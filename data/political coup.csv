In a statement, the Sudan Doctors Syndicate said that 3,531 people have also been injured in the violence since April 15.  The NGO said that 28 civilians had been killed in clashes between the two military rivals in Nyala city, the provincial capital of South Darfur province, in recent days.  Last week, the syndicate had put the death toll from the violence at 850 and 3,394 others injured.  A 7-day cease-fire is set to come into force between the army and the RSF on Monday following talks between the two conflicting parties in Saudi Arabia.  A disagreement had been fomenting in recent months between the army and the RSF over the paramilitary group’s integration into the armed forces, a key condition of Sudan's transition agreement with political groups.  Sudan has been without a functioning government since October 2021, when the military dismissed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's transitional government and declared a state of emergency in a move decried by political forces as a ""coup.""  Sudan's transitional period, which started in August 2019 after the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir, had been scheduled to end with elections in early 2024.

The 15-year sentence was handed down to Gülşen Özer, the former co-mayor of Bismil in the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakır, by the Diyarbakır 11th High Criminal Court at the last hearing of her trial on Monday.  Özer, who was among the dozens of democratically elected Kurdish mayors removed from office by the Interior Ministry on accusations of terrorism following their election in 2019, stood trial due to her attendance at 39 news conferences, events and other activities organized by her party, the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), and events organized by the Tevgera Jinên Azad (Free Women’s Movement) in 2018. She was the HDP’s co-chair of the Diyarbakır provincial branch at the time.  Özer’s lawyer Serhat Karaşin told the court during Monday’s hearing that his client cannot be accused of membership in a terrorist organization just because she attended some events organized by her party. He said Özer attended those events as an HDP official and was engaged in political but not terrorist activity.  The court, however, decided to give the politician a lengthy prison sentence. Özer will not be jailed during the appeals process.  Dozens of HDP officials in Turkey are accused of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and much of the international community.  A government crackdown on Kurdish parties and politicians in Turkey reached new heights following a coup attempt in the country in July 2016.  Dozens of democratically elected Kurdish mayors were removed from office, while a large number of Kurdish politicians, including the former co-chairs of the HDP, were jailed following the coup attempt.  The party currently faces a closure case on charges of “attempting to destroy the indivisibility between the state and the people.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIva3VyZGlzaC1tYXlvci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tMTUteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLW9uLXRlcnJvcmlzbS1jaGFyZ2VzL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIva3VyZGlzaC1tYXlvci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tMTUteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLW9uLXRlcnJvcmlzbS1jaGFyZ2VzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-22","16:30:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T15:26:14","Thailand’s proposed ‘government of hope’ would be committed to upholding and protecting the status of Thailand’s revered monarchy. The comprehensive new programme leaves parties also free to pursue their own legislative agendas both in parliament and in government which do not conflict with the programme as laid out. It is too early to say whether this will appease opposition among a large core group of upper house members or senators who are still reported to be against the proposed coalition. The Move Forward Party led by Pita Limjaroenrat also, on Monday, faced a new and broader complaint calling for its dissolution lodged with the Election Commission by activist lawyer Theerayuth Suwankaesorn which has further increased uncertainty over the fate of the proposed new government over a week after the May 14th General Election.  The Deputy Leader of the Move Forward Party, tipped to be Thailand’s next Minister of Finance, Ms Sirikanya Tansakul, on Monday spoke about growing confidence that the party would be able to form its proposed government with Pheu Thai with more support coming from within parliament and positive noises from the Thai Senate. The proposed coalition, on Monday afternoon, published a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the eight parties which did not refer to the controversial Section 112 provision on lèse-majesté and promised a new constitutional reform programme would be launched within 100 days with a referendum to be put to the people which could lead to a new constituent assembly. The new programme commits itself to uphold and protect, as inviolable, the status of the Thai Monarchy despite the groundbreaking and far-reaching programme of reform being proposed by what the Move Forward Party describes as a ‘government of hope’ for Thailand.  On Monday at 4.30 pm, nine years to the minute, since General Prayut Chan ocha staged his 2014 coup by taking all political leaders, invited to a high-level conference into custody and suspending the government, the Move Forward Party as the leader of an eight-party coalition with 313 setas reported agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding as to the formation of the next government amid more positive signs from the upper house or Thai Senate that enough senators may be prepared to give their blessing to the will of the people as expressed in the May 14th General Election.  There is increased concern and speculation about whether a political impasse or instability can be avoided on one hand and also the economic policies to be pursued by the predominantly Move Forward Pheu Thai government which may come to power.  Prime Minister Prayut Chan ocha on Monday assured markets the caretaker government will perform diligently and that the kingdom’s economy is sound  Earlier on Monday, Ms Trisulee Traisanakul, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister Prayut Chan ocha assured jittery markets created by the current uncertainty over the political situation, that it was temporary and the fundamentals of the Thai economy were sound.  Ms Trisulee said that the caretaker government would manage affairs well until a new government takes the reins including speeding up the disbursement of existing budgets.  She said the PM was confident that with a recovering foreign tourism sector and Thailand becoming a key location for firms moving production in response to geopolitical tensions, the future of the economy was promising.  One key question is who will be appointed as Minister of Finance in the new government and the answer to that appears to be the Deputy Leader of the Move Forward Party, 42 year old Ms Sirikanya Tansakul, who is being tipped for the role.  Tipped as the next Minister of Finance, Sirikanya Tansakul, spoke confidently on Monday about her growing confidence a new government will be formed  Ms Sirikanya is a graduate of Thammasat University’s Faculty of Economics and the University of Toulouse in France.  She was a member of parliament in the 25th House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023 and Chaired its Economic Development Commission.  Appearing on Monday on a Thai TV programme, she was upbeat about the prospects of 43-year-old Mr Pita Limjaroenrat becoming Thailand’s 30th Prime Minister in August and the youngest to occupy the seat in generations.  She pointed to the offer by the Thai Teacher for the People party to support the government without preconditions in parliament bringing the tally to 314 and said that appointments were being made to speak with senators to allay their concerns.  No mention of Article 112 in new government programme or memorandum unveiled on Monday with over 20 policy proposals for sweeping reform  On Monday afternoon, details of the new Memorandum of Understanding emerged and the first key point was that there was no mention of the controversial Article 112 Criminal Code provision in it.  This comes with strong indications from key coalition partners such as the Pheu Thai Party and Khunying Sudarat Keyuraphan’s Thai Sang Thai Party that they were opposed to either abolishing or amending the law which concerns lèse-majesté and the monarchy.  The programme outlined in the document is divided into over twenty policy proposals and a second schedule of resolutions concerning a modus vivendi for the new government, chief among them being that no party will act against anything in the official programme while each party will be free to pursue its own agenda in parliament on this basis.  The key proposal within the policy platform is that within 100 days, Thailand will have a referendum where the people will have their say on whether a new constitution should be drafted for their approval to replace the 2017 Constitution.  If passed, there will be an elected constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution which would then have to be ratified by a second referendum.  Programme offers full support for the Monarchy  The new programme, at the same time, clearly commits itself to upholding the inviolable status of Thailand’s revered monarchy.  It is reported that this provision was encouraged by the seven other parties to the coalition in order so that senators or others can relinquish any doubts about the Move Forward Party which has, itself, always insisted that its support for the country’s highest institution was second to none and indeed that its policies protected the monarchy.  The new programme also includes a plan to relist cannabis as a scheduled narcotic but, at the same time, introduce a law on its consumption and use by the public in a controlled and responsible way.  This policy sends a strong signal that the new coalition is not prepared to reconcile itself or to do business with the Bhumjaithai Party which is wedded to its cannabis policy which proved so controversial during the election.  Economic policy and agenda is a combination of Move Forward and Pheu Thai plans with both structural reforms and pro-growth initiatives to raise incomes  The programme calls for an economic platform which had been expected to be a combination of Pheu Thai and Move Forward party policies which will see the start of the creation of a new welfare state in Thailand to care for people from infancy until old age.  The economic programme will also allow for an increase in the earnings of workers on a gradual basis and more generous welfare payments to address inequality.  In the business sphere, the policy plan calls for the removal of red tape and bureaucratic processes which are a source of resistance to business development and a source of corruption within the system while removing all monopolies in Thailand, particularly concerning the production of alcoholic beverages.  At the same time, to balance this out with the view of the predominantly Muslim Prachachart Party, it was emphasised that the government would not be involved in promoting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages but in facilitating open and free competition in all business sectors of the wider economy.  Reconciliation programme with laws to prevent future coup d’états by imposing duties on unelected officer holders. Same-sex marriage law to be passed  The programme calls for a new reconciliation process in society to heal the country’s political divisions which will focus on ensuring that all political voices are heard through the parliamentary process.  At the same time, it calls for laws to specifically prevent any future coup d’états including placing an obligation on key office holders to resist such actions should they take place.  A Marriage Equality Act will be introduced allowing for marriage to be contracted between all sexes and in respect of all personal relationships while Thailand’s new law will protect those with more traditional religious views.  The plan calls for a 30% to 40% reduction in the size of the Royal Thai Army while phasing out national service or military conscription in favour of a volunteer defence force.  Reforms will take place throughout Thailand’s extended public service where the emphasis will be on zero-based budgeting and transparency to root out waste and corruption.  Plan to suspend martial law in Southern Provinces  The new government plans to suspend martial law in the Southern provinces while setting up a task force to review security with a focus on respect for human rights. There will be more involvement of local groups in security arrangements and law enforcement with priority given to a peace-building process for the region.  The programme will also provide a budget to solve long-running land disputes and will distribute large amounts of land to farmers throughout the country with title documents to boost agriculture and create a more sustainable living.  In agriculture, the government will introduce new marketing methods, technology to improve production and programmes to give homesteads energy security and reduce the cost of living for those on the land.  Thailand will have a new fisheries policy aiming to eliminate administrative obstacles and create sustainable careers in the industry.  The plan also calls for stronger protection of workers’ rights and an emphasis on generating sustainable incomes for lower-earning households.  Structural reform in the education system and new curriculum to raise standards of education to international levels as well as access for all citizens  Finally, the new government will address the need for structural reform of the education system by improving the curriculum to meet international specifications and by widening access to education among all sections of society in a ‘learn to earn’ programme where all Thai people can continually seek to improve their skills so as to create added value for the economy.  Concerning the working guidelines or modus vivendi of the new government, a key principle will be that it will seek to uphold the civil and political rights of all people.  High standards in public office and integrity  The new government, its ministers and officials will act with integrity at all times and any corrupt behaviour or inference will see such individuals removed from office.  The coalition partners will work sincerely and honestly with each other and in the work of government and adhere to this principle even over any loyalty to an individual political party or sectional interest.  After this, each party, MP or minister may pursue other legislative agendas or policy proposals which do not conflict with the programme.  It is still too early to tell if this formula will work with reports that between 20 and 75 senators may be open to supporting the coalition government provided that there is a guarantee that the Article 112 provision on lèse-majesté is neither removed nor amended by the government or its agents.  Uncertainty still hovers over the fate of the coalition  Despite all this, uncertainty over the political fate of the new coalition is rising due to Thailand’s 2017 Constitution and the power of the country’s Election Commission which has become a magnet for complaints relating to both politicians and political parties.  With Prime Ministerial hopeful Mr Pita Limjaroenrat already facing a complaint regarding a shareholding in a defunct media firm linked with his deceased father’s estate going back to 2008, which has been taken up by the Election Commission, on Monday, he and his party were facing another complaint which was filed by lawyer and constitutional activist Mr Theerayuth Suwankaesorn who argued that the Move Forward Party’s proposal to amend Article 112 is, in itself, sufficient and strong grounds to have the party dissolved by the Constitutional Court.  ‘The party’s plan could erode, damage, or undermine the key national Institution,’ declared Mr Theerayuth to reporters as he filed his petition in Bangkok.

"political coup","2023-05-07","16:00:00","{""Tunis"", ""Tunis"", ""Tunisia""}","2023-05-23T02:31:08","Four Daughters Review  It is a very French expression – coup de cœur. At Cannes, one sees all kinds of films: boring, long, average, amazing, masterpieces…But the literal translation of a coup de cœur is a film that captures your heart. It may not necessarily win prizes, but it touches the audience, emotionally, psychologically, in ways that other technically better films do not. Simply put, it is a film that every critic and every audience member loves, even it is not the rationally best film. In 2016 (the last Cannes edition I attended before this one), that film was Toni Erdmann. This year, it appears to be a draw between Le Regne Animal (The Animal Kingdom, which I have not seen) and Les Filles d’OIfa (Four Daughters).  Olfa Hamrouni is a real-life middle-aged Tunisian cleaning lady, unhappily married, happily-then-unhappily remarried who has, or at least had, four teenage daughters. The reason janitor Olfa Hamrouni is at Cannes this year is that she caught the attention of filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania when she appeared on Tunisian news and TV, imploring the authorities there to repatriate her two elder daughters Ghofrane and Rahma, both imprisoned in Libya after a US airstrike on an Islamic State (Daesh) compound. Ghofrane and Rahma joined Islamic State circa 2015 on what appears to have been a teenage whim directed at their overbearing but hapless mother Olfa.  The documentary-drama follows the transformation of Ghofrane and Rahma from goth-wearing, anarchist freaks to niqab-wearing fanatics – partly due to the socio-political aftereffects of the Tunisian revolution of 2011 (the fall of long-serving Tunisian president Ben Ali freeing the space for the rise of Islamic State organisations), partly due to teenage rebellion against their authoritarian mother Olfa.  The film is an amalgam of documentary footage and rehearsals for a fictional fiction film – there is no fiction film, however professional actresses assume the roles of the two imprisoned sisters and prominent Tunisian actress Hind Sabri is recruited as Olfa’s stand-in during the re-enactment of the more harrowing scenes. Director Ben Hania settled on this mixtures of genres after an unsuccessful attempt at pure documentary which was to revolve around the absence of the two older sisters. The participation of the professional actresses is intended as a therapeutic mirror directed at the torn-apart family, the director intentionally provoking heart-wrenching confrontations between the girls and their mother, who the audience learns is very far from being an unambiguously grieving, dedicated mother. Olfa has a somewhat violent, abusive temperament which she readily acknowledges and justifies as a survival skill in patriarchal Tunisia. It is a familiar trope of many a controlling parent: “It is all for the sake of the children’s good”.  Image: Cannes  Islamic state is Olfa’s comeuppance and it is a formidable rival – Four Daughters does a superb job of shining a light on the underlying reasons which likely drove a large contingent of IS recruits. Tyrannical parents, family abuse and teenage confusion are all addressed in this de facto art therapy exercise. Olfa is frequently confronted by the actress impersonating her and the director herself when she expresses particularly retrograde views, with the clear goal of prompting a reckoning and triggering the realisation of why exactly the girls rebelled.  Throughout the film runs an overtly feminist voice (there is only one male actor for all the male roles) and the matriarchal power of Olfa is challenged by the two younger girls Eya and Tayssir, who in their own words, narrowly escaped joining IS. They seem confident in their newfound freedom and openly dethrone Olfa and confront her certainties. This family therapy is at times laughter-provoking, at others brutally distressing. These are real people grasping for a catharsis in front of the filmmaker’s benevolent gaze and with all her contradictions and insecurities, Olfa manages to capture viewers’ hearts. The director herself states that the two younger, freedom-loving, tank-top clad daughters who openly address past traumas and lovingly challenge their mother’s authority are the only hope for the family’s and Tunisia’s future.  No doubt the Tunisian mother-daughter trio are the most touching characters in this year’s competition (yes, they have the advantage of being real) and Four Daughters might just walk away with the coup de coeur award.

Roberts wrote the following article this week following the public release of the Durham Report.

"political coup","2017-12-02","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:43:43","DUBAI: With Earth on the precipice as the devastating impacts of climate change loom ominously, it has become an urgent imperative to respond to this rapidly transforming world. As the international community prepares for the 28th Conference of the Parties, or COP28, hosted by the UAE, it is crucial to underscore the significance of this global gathering in addressing the complex interplay between climate resilience and conflict-affected regions.  A recent policy report released jointly by the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, and the Norwegian Red Cross, sheds light on the alarming exacerbation of humanitarian needs in the region. This report, titled “Making Adaptation Work: Addressing the compounding impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and conflict in the Near and Middle East,” sheds light on the dire situation faced by communities in the region.  The ICRC report emphasizes that climate change is not solely an environmental issue but a significant threat to human security, further exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The report highlights the intricate connections between marginalized communities, armed conflicts, and humanitarian crises, emphasizing the urgent need to address these interconnected challenges.  To delve into the intricate interdependencies between climate resilience, conflict-affected regions, and the imperative need for climate financing, a panel of experts convened in Dubai recently to explore this multidimensional crisis. The participants of the forum included Clare Dalton, the ICRC’s head of delegation in the UAE, Trond H.G. Rudi, charge d’affaires of the Norwegian Embassy in the UAE, and Helena de Jong, senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team.  Climate financing for conflict-affected regions  In conflict-affected countries, the challenge lies not only in combating climate change but also in navigating complex socio-political dynamics. Dalton emphasized that climate financing must be effectively channeled to countries grappling with conflict. The outcome she hopes to see from COP28 in the UAE is that “climate financing is better directed to countries experiencing conflict in ways that they can practically apply and use.” However, the current state of affairs presents obstacles, such as unreliable banking systems and numerous other factors that impede effective climate financing.  The report sheds light on the formidable barriers faced in accessing multilateral climate finance for state-led adaptation projects in conflict-affected countries. These challenges materialize as a result of stringent governance prerequisites and a certain aversion toward investing in volatile contexts.  As of January 2022, a mere 19 single-country projects in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have successfully secured funding approval, with the disbursed amount accounting for less than 0.5 percent of the global allocation of climate project funds. This stark disparity underscores the pressing need to address the limited access and utilization of climate financing in conflict-affected regions.  To overcome these obstacles, Dalton advocates for the collaboration of all sectors of society, emphasizing the necessity for concerted efforts in order to develop tangible, implementable solutions.  While the ICRC acknowledges that it operates at the periphery of climate negotiations, it recognizes the necessity of addressing climate change due to its impact on the regions it serves. Achieving this requires tangible strategies and concrete actions that go beyond mere agreement on the importance of adaptation.  “It’s not the fact that we all agree this needs to happen, but it’s the how. What are some very concrete ways that this could happen tomorrow because it’s needed then after the COP. And I think that happens in two ways because it’s not just in the form of negotiations, but it’s also in providing the space for actors to come together and look at some of these issues. So I think my second expectation is that we find a way to do that. You know, the remaining question is who can help us achieve that outcome. So yeah, money in places like Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, and any of these places that need that support,” Dalton said.  Dalton also touched on how small-scale initiatives play an important role in building community resilience amidst the challenges associated with the de-prioritization of climate action in conflict-affected settings, citing solutions such as education on sustainable agricultural practices, and the distribution of climate-resilient seed varieties to strengthen food security and build community resilience.  Armed conflicts exert a dual impact on the environment, both directly and indirectly, with profound consequences for human well-being. Such conflicts erode environmental governance structures and disrupt societal order, thus perpetuating the conditions conducive to environmental degradation. Consequently, the direct environmental harm caused by conflict and the subsequent degradation of ecological systems undermine the availability of natural resources, rendering communities more susceptible to the repercussions of climate change.  The report presents compelling instances that highlight how deliberate acts of environmental degradation can heighten the immediate jeopardy faced by significant population groups. A notable example is the seizure of Iraq’s Mosul Dam in 2014, which precipitated a looming risk of dam collapse. The accompanying threat to intentionally destroy the dam and flood downstream Baghdad underscores the urgent requirement for increased vigilance and accountability in safeguarding critical infrastructure systems and protecting vulnerable communities.  Dalton highlighted the imperative of engaging with the inhabitants of conflict-affected regions, acknowledging their lived experiences and incorporating their perspectives into climate resilience initiatives, stating: “We need to listen to those people about what changes they’ve seen, about what solutions they perceive might be.”  This approach recognizes the significance of local knowledge and ensures that adaptation strategies are contextually relevant and responsive to the specific challenges faced by these communities. By fostering connections between local, national, regional and global levels, a comprehensive and integrated framework can be established, incorporating diverse solutions and approaches to address the multifaceted issues arising from climate change and conflict.  “Communities need to understand how they can be part of the solution as well and what they can do in their own way not to make the situation any worse. And that’s exactly the same for humanitarians. We have that ‘do no harm’ principle. How can we respond to people’s needs but without making it any worse for them in terms of the assistance we give?” she said.  Revisiting climate-finance priorities  The report draws attention to the discrepancies between climate finance flows, vulnerability to climate change, and countries torn by conflict. De Jong, the senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team, highlighted a distressing statistic: out of the 46 countries listed as least developed, 22 are affected by conflict and fragility.  Paradoxically, these conflict-ridden nations receive the least amount of climate finance, exacerbating their vulnerability to both conflict and climate change. This predicament perpetuates a vicious cycle, hindering governments’ capacity to tackle these intertwined challenges effectively. To break this cycle, De Jong advocates for a paradigm shift in climate financing, with a renewed focus on prioritizing conflict-affected nations. She highlights the importance of engaging climate finance providers, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, and peacebuilding actors in finding solutions.  “This is something that we would like to see changed. It’s not easy. This is a fairly complicated problem. But the advantage of focusing on this as a COP28 presidency is that we can talk to all these climate finance providers, so we can talk to the multilateral development banks, and we can talk to humanitarian actors and peacebuilding actors in this space to really bring all of them together to look at the solutions. Because the solutions are there. We know that there are plenty of actors that are able to work in these settings,” De Jong said.  Global pact for climate adaptation  To address this imbalance, De Jong proposes a global pact that includes actionable solutions such as streamlined application procedures, adjusted eligibility criteria for conflict-affected actors, and increased flexibility in project locations could drive progress in climate adaptation efforts.  “It won’t be all different at COP28, but we do really want to see a very big step forward at COP28. And this could, for example — and that would be my dream outcome — be in the form of some sort of global pact that all of these actors would sign up to that doesn’t include just principles that we all agree on, but that also would include at least a couple of solutions to these issues,” De Jong said.  “Our proposal is mainly the global pact that I mentioned. So this would focus more, I guess, on changes in the policy spectrum. But it could, for example, also include like a regional capacity-strengthening facility that would help governments apply and develop strong adaptation projects that would then basically build a pipeline of adaptation projects which would help them in the long run, so it wouldn’t necessarily include a fund,” De Jong said.  With the presidency of COP28, the UAE aims to create a platform that brings together various actors to collectively explore solutions. De Jong stresses the need to leverage existing momentum for change, emphasizing that COP28 is a stepping stone toward addressing these complex issues comprehensively.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDgwNzbSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA4MDc2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The meeting will be the first significant international event in Kashmir since New Delhi stripped the Muslim-majority region of semi-autonomy in 2019. Indian authorities are hoping the meeting will show that the controversial changes have brought “peace and prosperity” to the region.  The government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has announced protests and rallies throughout the region on Monday against the G-20 summit in Srinagar city and human rights abuses in the Indian-administered section.  “Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari will address the joint session of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly and Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council in Muzaffarabad on Monday,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported.  “He will reiterate Pakistan’s unwavering support to the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for right to self-determination.”  Ties between bitter rivals India and Pakistan stand frozen since August 5, 2019, when New Delhi revoked the semi-autonomous status of the part of Kashmir it controls, dividing it into two federally administered territories.  The Muslim-majority Himalayan region has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India since their independence from British rule in 1947. Both neighbors rule parts of the Himalayan territory, but claim it in full and have fought two of their four wars over the disputed region.  Pakistan calls the revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy part of New Delhi’s alleged attempts to change the demography of the region and has demanded the world fraternity take notice of it.  But New Delhi has countered the objections, saying it is free to hold meetings on its own territory.  Since the 2019 changes, Srinagar, known for rolling Himalayan foothills and exquisitely decorated houseboats, has become a major domestic tourist destination. Hotels have been mostly booked out for months. Kashmir has also drawn millions of visitors, who enjoy a strange peace kept by ubiquitous security checkpoints, armored vehicles and patrolling soldiers.  For the G20 meeting, the city has spruced up its commercial center and roads leading to the convention center on Dal Lake, while police have increased security even further, placing a massive security cordon around the site.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzg3MS9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mazari was arrested for the fourth time on Monday, hours after a Pakistani court ordered her release. The Khan aide, first arrested on May 12, was subsequently nabbed by police on May 16 and May 18 despite court orders calling her arrest illegal.  The 72-year-old is among several members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party who were arrested after angry mobs attacked military installations, set fire to government buildings, and smashed buses to protest Khan’s detention on corruption charges on May 9, with the party saying more than 7,000 of its supporters have been arrested during the crackdown.  Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, Mazari denounced the violence that erupted in the aftermath of Khan's arrest and everyone should condemn it, particularly around the building that are symbolic to the state.  ""I have called this press conference for two things. Firstly, I condemn the violence that erupted on 9th and 10th May. I have also submitted an undertaking with regard to it in the Islamabad High Court. Violence at state symbols like the GHQ (army's General Headquarters), Supreme Court or parliament should be condemned by everyone and I do,"" she said.  ""The second thing that I am to say is that through the 12-day process of arrest, release, abduction and then release, due to my health and the difficulties my daughter, Iman, had to go through...I have decided that I am quitting active politics and I also want to say this from today onwards, I will not be a part of the PTI or any political party.""  The 72-year-old veteran, who was flanked by her daughter at the presser, said she would be focusing more on her health, children and her mother.  ""My children and my mother are my priority and because of that my health is my priority too,"" she said. ""There is nothing more important except for that.""  Mazari's departure came as a shock to PTI supporters, though she is not the first one to quit the party in recent days. More than a dozen current and former PTI lawmakers, including Aamir Kiani, Sanjay Gangwani and Mahmood Baqi Maulvi, have quit the party since the crackdown began.  In his reaction, Khan described the desertions as ""forced divorces.""  ""We had all heard about forced marriages in Pakistan but for PTI a new phenomenon has emerged, forced divorces,"" he wrote on Twitter.  ""Also wondering where have all the human rights organizations in the country disappeared.""  We had all heard about forced marriages in Pakistan but for PTI a new phenomenon has emerged , forced divorces.

Qureshi, another top aide and former foreign minister in Khan's cabinet, was rearrested on Tuesday after getting bail, the ex-premier said.  Khan, who has been calling for snap elections since his ouster from office last year, has accused the government of initiating the crackdown against his supporters to “crush” the PTI ahead of the upcoming general elections, a charge the government denies.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwODA2MS9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Three members of a farmers’ group have been arrested and accused of plotting to oust him in a 'peasant revolution.' (Photo:AFP)  Three senior members of a farmers’ group in Cambodia have been arrested for holding training workshops amid allegations that they were plotting a ""peasant revolution"" which has been likened to the one instigated by Pol Pot.  The arrests of three members of the Coalition of Cambodian Farmers Community (CCFC) were made as the authorities turned their attention from the successful staging of the Southeast Asia (SEA) Games to the July 23 election, which has invited criticism from the West and human rights units for the treatment of opposition parties.  Theng Savoeun, CCFC president, and Nhel Pheap and Than Hach, its advocacy officers, face up to two years behind bars if convicted of incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest under Articles 494 and 495 of the Criminal Code.  More universal than Catholicism?  Mary among Asian religions  Interior ministry spokesperson, Khieu Sopheak, told the independent CamboJA News outlet that Savoeun had confessed to his activities while likening the plot to a Pol Pot-styled “peasant revolution” with evidence supporting the allegations found on his computer.  It included “a manuscript teaching the people to make the peasant revolution,” Sopheak said. “What did the peasant revolution try to do?”  “It was necessary to overthrow the capitalists, the oppressed classes — whoever you are — and millions of people died because of the peasant revolution…”  ""More than 100 CNRP supporters have been handed prison sentences""  Pol Pot and his hardline communists, the Khmer Rouge, devastated Cambodia when they ruled between 1975 and early 1979, resulting in the deaths of about 2 million people, amid a 30-year civil war, which resulted in the long-ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) coming to power.  The CPP is the only party capable of winning the upcoming elections, a task made easier by the National Election Committee (NEC) since it banned the opposition Candlelight Party (CLP) from contesting the polls for failing to provide original documents regarding its formation.  Charges of plotting to oust Prime Minister Hun Sen have been made against independent media groups, the CLP and its predecessor — the outlawed Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP).  More than 100 CNRP supporters have been handed prison sentences, often in absentia. Its leader Kem Sokha is serving a 27-year sentence for treason while other members, like the Khmer Bible editor Theary Seng, are also serving lengthy jail terms.  On May 19, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights sent a letter to the G7 meeting in Japan to express their “grave concerns about the state of human rights and democracy” in Southeast Asia and in Cambodia.  “The situation related to human rights and democracy has drastically deteriorated in Cambodia in recent years, notably since Hun Sen used the country’s courts to dissolve the opposition CNRP in 2017, shortly after it had run close to his CPP in successive nationwide elections,” leading human rights lawmakers from Southeast Asia told the G7 gathering in Hiroshima.  The opposition in Cambodia is riddled by defections, while the NEC has disqualified the Khmer United Great Nation Party, a minor political outfit, from its first election, also for failing to provide the correct paperwork.  According to the pro-government Khmer Times, about 120 CLP and former CNRP members have defected to the ruling CPP. One CLP youth group member was cited as saying the government’s successful handling of the Games was partly behind her decision to join the CPP.  ""A disappointing development which weakens the choice available to the Cambodian people""  However, an apology from CLP politician Chea Poch was not as well received by Hun Sen.  He sent a letter to the prime minister admitting that he had said “the struggle to overthrow” Hun Sen during a meeting with party activists. This was picked up by the semi-official Fresh News, alleging he was also plotting to overthrow the government.  Chea Poch insisted he meant a peaceful non-violent change through the ballot box and that he rejected the report claiming “my goal is to overthrow Hun Sen.""  But the Khmer Times quoted a letter from Hun Sen, saying the apology was unacceptable and that Chea Poch had also referred to a “military coup d’état, using the color revolution” with the goal of overthrowing his government “to the point of assassination.”  Meanwhile, Britain added its voice to the banning of the CLP from contesting the election, saying in a statement that “this is a disappointing development which weakens the choice available to the Cambodian people.”  British ambassador, Dominic Whiting, added that he hoped the CLP appeal “will conclude with a decision in keeping with the spirit of multi-party democracy.”  Australia, France, Germany and the European Union have also criticized the NEC’s disqualification of the CLP, while the United States has yet to issue a formal statement.  The Cambodian authorities dismissed the criticism, saying the NEC’s decision-making process was designed to “provide a free, fair, just, and transparent voting process” and that this will not “affect the liberal, pluralistic and democratic nature of the country.”  Lend your helping hand!

"political coup","2021-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T11:40:30","Will Sudan crisis trigger a fresh wave of migrants and refugees out of Africa?  JUBA, South Sudan: Thousands of civilians in towns and villages across Sudan have been forced to flee in recent weeks to escape the worsening conflict in the country, which has entered its second bloody month, leading to fears of a new global refugee crisis.  Initial clashes between former allies the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces have escalated into heavy combat, displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded, and disruptions to basic utilities and shortages of medical supplies have forced medical staff to turn away even the critically ill.  Meanwhile, shortages of food, fuel, electricity and clean water, coupled with economic collapse and the breakdown of law and order, have forced entire communities to pack up and leave in search of security and relief.  Passengers fleeing war-torn Sudan cross into Egypt through the Argeen Land Port on May 12, 2023. (AFP)  In the first four weeks of the crisis, around 200,000 people fled Sudan while another 700,000 were displaced inside the country. As many as 860,000 refugees and returnees are expected by the UN refugee agency UNHCR to flee by October, raising fears among European policymakers of a new influx of migrants who risk the perilous journey north to their shores.  Europe was forced to confront the issue of mass migration in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa, the Middle East and Asia began arriving from across the Mediterranean.  More recently, the continent has absorbed millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, which has placed additional strain on a continent already grappling with high energy prices as a result of gas shortages.  However, few experts predict Europe will see anything close to the same number of migrants as a result of the crisis in Sudan. Instead, most expect the majority to be displaced internally or settle in neighboring African states.  “Some of the refugees will try to go to Europe, but I don’t see that there will be mass migration going to Europe right now,” Namira Negm, director of the African Migration Observatory in Morocco, told Arab News.  “It will increase but it will not be mass migration. Migration to neighboring countries needs to be addressed first.”  IN NUMBERS 116,995 First-time asylum seekers from Sudan in EU+ area during 2015 peak.  860,000+ Refugees and returnees expected to flee Sudan by Oct. (UNHCR).  $445m Funding required to support the displaced until Oct. 2023 (UNHCR).  Nevertheless, many in Europe remain fearful that any fresh influx will place additional strains on the resources of host nations, and trigger a surge in anti-immigrant sentiments and support for right-wing populist movements.  In response to previous waves of migration several European nations adopted draconian immigration policies, making it more difficult for new arrivals to obtain asylum and the right to remain. Those who still try to reach Europe face dangerous journeys, including sea voyages in often flimsy and overloaded vessels.  “Reaching Europe would require navigating treacherous and expensive migration routes, often involving perilous sea crossings and facing the risk of exploitation and abuse by human traffickers,” Franck Duvell, a senior researcher at Universitat Osnabruck in Germany, told Arab News.  “Numbers might go up a little, but I don’t see these networks and routes now. Traveling to western Libya has become dangerous and is getting more and more difficult, and therefore (an) increasing number of people actually continue their journey to Tunisia.  “I don’t see Sudanese traveling all the way to Tunisia. It’s simply too far, it’s too expensive, it’s too dangerous … Even if numbers are increasing, the total numbers will still be relatively small.”  Migrant numbers were already on the rise prior to the start of the conflict last month. More than 36,000 people arrived from Sudan in Europe’s Mediterranean region between January and March, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest UNHCR figures.  Sudan has been caught in a cycle of violent coups and countercoups for years. The latest, in October 2021, resulted in a transitional, civilian-led government being overthrown by a military junta led by the two factions now fighting each other.  Since the start of a shaky political transition in 2019, after long-time autocratic ruler Omar Al-Bashir was ousted, Sudan has been plagued by political and economic instability, prompting many citizens to seek sanctuary outside the country.  According to the EU’s European Asylum Support Office, Sudanese nationals represented the fifth-largest group of applicants for international protection in the EU in 2020, with more than 34,000 new applications. This was a significant increase on the previous year, when there were about 18,000 new applications.  An economic crisis, including high inflation, devaluation of the national currency and shortages of basic goods, had already caused poverty and unemployment to increase in Sudan prior to the latest conflict, which began on April 15.  And it is not only the Sudanese people themselves who face displacement. Before the fighting began, Sudan hosted more than a million refugees, 300,000 of them in the capital Khartoum, who had fled South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of them are now returning home or looking for refuge elsewhere in the region or further afield.  Refugees from Sudan who crossed into Ethiopia rest in Metema, on May 5, 2023. (AFP)  If the crisis in Sudan becomes long drawn out, akin to the Syrian civil war, the possibility of large number of Sudanese refugees seeking safety in Europe cannot be ruled out.  “A protracted conflict could create unwanted uncertainties,” Thirsa de Vries, a Sudan expert at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told Arab News.  “This is why it is also important that the international community (engages with) the different actors that might be involved, or works with neighboring countries to close corridors for weapons smuggling.”  The possibility of a large number of Sudanese refugees attempting to reach Europe also highlights the importance of cooperation between nations in managing migration flows.  Abdullahi Hassan, a researcher at human rights organization Amnesty International who specializes in Sudan, stressed the importance of ensuring the security and stability of host and origin countries.  “With adequate planning and resources, it is possible to provide safe and orderly routes for those seeking refuge,” he told Arab News.  He said the response to the crisis in Sudan should not solely focus on migration and added: “It must instead prioritize the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid.  “The EU and its member states should use their influence, both in the region and in Sudan, to ensure that they are directly engaging with the parties to the conflict to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, encourage immediate and unrestricted access for humanitarian actors, and pressure the Sudanese authorities to allow safe exit passages for people trying to flee the conflict.”  As the fighting continues to rage, the warring Sudanese factions have held talks in Saudi Arabia to discuss a ceasefire but made it clear they would not negotiate an end to the conflict.  Despite the challenges posed by the violence, humanitarian organizations are working to provide aid to those affected by the Sudan crisis. But attacks on aid workers and the looting of relief supplies have made it increasingly difficult for agencies to deliver help to needy communities, which could in turn affect the response of donor countries.  A view shows black smoke and fire at Omdurman market in Omdurman, Sudan, May 17, 2023. (Screengrab/Reuters)  Some organizations “have evacuated international staff, particularly those that were in the most affected areas,” UNHCR spokesperson Faith Kasina, told Arab News, who highlighted the risks and limitations of aid provision during armed conflicts.  The UN’s Children’s Fund, UNICEF, reported on May 5 that at least 190 children have been killed and 1,700 injured since the fighting began in Sudan. While a tentative ceasefire allowed foreign nations to evacuate their citizens from the country in the past few weeks, Sudanese nationals continue to endure great hardships.  Several media outlets, including the BBC, the Washington Post and Al-Jazeera, have interviewed Sudanese citizens who said their passports were locked inside foreign embassies, leaving them trapped in their own country.  Hassan, the Amnesty International researcher, said foreign nations must provide safe evacuation procedures, and that the warring factions must “stop attacking humanitarian aid workers.”  But he added that instances of attacks on workers and the looting of aid supplies “should not be an excuse to withdraw funding.”  “The response to the crisis in Sudan is completely different from the response, for example, Ukraine received when the conflict started in that country,” said Hassan.  “European countries should, nevertheless, provide safe and regular pathways to Europe for those seeking international protection … It is the responsibility of the EU and member states to ensure that such pathways are made available.”  However, public sentiment in Europe appears to be overwhelmingly hostile to refugees. Both Italy and the UK have faced recent criticism for their strict immigration policies, which aid agencies warn could drive more refugees into the arms of smuggling gangs.  In mid-April, Italy passed legislation to curb undocumented migration, including tougher sentences for those convicted of human trafficking and terminating residency permits for migrants who face humanitarian risks.  This drew criticism from search-and-rescue organizations, who warned it would lead to more deaths at sea in the Mediterranean as migrants seek illegal routes to Europe.  The British government has been accused of racial discrimination in its refugee policy. Immigration experts point out that although hundreds of thousands of visas were provided for Ukrainian refugees, there is no plan, or safe route, to help those fleeing violence in Sudan.  Ultimately, the best way to avoid migrant crises is by helping ensure that all countries in Africa are able to offer their citizens a decent quality of life.  “The root cause is lack of development; people lose hope in their country and end up migrating to other countries,” African Migration Observatory Director Negm said regarding the importance of stability in Africa.  “If they have a good life in their own home countries, they will not think of going somewhere else.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc5OTbSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3OTk2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-07-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T23:12:38","A cobalt mine in central Africa. Image by Fairphone/Flickr.  Last year, Ottawa announced its first-ever Critical Minerals Strategy, a program aimed at securing and expanding the access of Canadian companies to certain minerals deemed essential for the economy’s functioning. These 31 minerals, “the building blocks for the green and digital economy,” include: cobalt for jet engines, batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells; gallium for semiconductors, circuits, and LED lights; lithium for electric vehicle (EV) batteries; nickel for EV batteries, aerospace, and electronics; rare earth elements for wind turbines, EV motors, and defense technologies; and zinc for metal alloys and EVs.  Ottawa’s mineral exploration budget is one of the highest in the world. Canada also attracts around one-fifth of the world’s mineral exploration. While gold and copper dominate exploration budgets in Canada, the amount of capital poured into extracting battery metals like lithium, cobalt, and graphite is steadily growing. These critical minerals “attracted roughly double the proportion of the global budget in 2022 versus the 10-year average.”  There are currently 409 active lithium projects in Canada, most of which are not yet producing. Only one-quarter of these projects are in the “advanced” stage, where a significant amount of exploration and drilling has been done.  According to some estimates, the global market for batteries will increase 20 percent annually. The World Economic Forum asserts that “[t]he production of minerals such as graphite, lithium, and cobalt could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.”  New operations centred around battery metals and Canada’s “sustainable transition” are popping up throughout the country, such as Nouveau Monde Graphite in Québec. Mining officials and government representatives are urging Canada to lead the way in global lithium production. Ottawa is incentivizing mineral exploration across the country, including in the Northwest Territories. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has announced a critical minerals strategy of his own, while pushing for mining development in the north, specifically the Ring of Fire region, where Indigenous resistance is strong.  Meanwhile, Canada and the US are targeting China’s mining industry as part of their new Cold War, which has also seen intensified US warmongering and increasingly belligerent Canadian policies in the Pacific.  In the words of Paul Triolo and Kevin Allison, “Canada—with its abundance of natural resources, including critical minerals essential for making EV batteries, wind turbines, and solar systems work—is now applying a geopolitical lens to the sector in ways that will create risk and opportunity for Canadian firms and investors.”  Around the time that Ottawa pushed several Chinese state-owned companies out of Canada’s mining sector, the US military announced it will fund mining for critical minerals on Canadian territory. As Alexander Panetta writes, this “illustrates how Canadian mining is becoming the nexus of a colossal geopolitical struggle.” And, it should be added, there are no illusions as to where Ottawa’s loyalties lie.  Despite its hostile policies toward Beijing, Canada continues to import huge amounts of computers, electronics, machine parts, and more from China, much of which need critical minerals to be produced. As such, Canada and other Western countries have a high import dependency on China. The announcement of Canada’s critical minerals plan occurred in this context: one in which Canadian elites are aiming to reduce mineral dependency on China, while the US continues to raise tensions in the Pacific with provocative military drills, arms sales, and base expansion in Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, and elsewhere.  Anastasia Ufimtseva, a program manager with the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, has said that there is an interest in government and business to move away from Chinese products, but it is a difficult task given the extent to which the West embraced post-Mao China as the proverbial factory of the world. “Despite a lot of countries saying… we want to establish alternative supply chain structure,” she explains, “it’s costly and difficult to switch if your business was established, you have your suppliers. It will take such a long time to find alternatives to build that infrastructure.”  While Russia, China, Iran, and other non-Western nations expand their cooperation in the areas of energy, electronics, military, and more, so are Canada and the US deepening their collaboration, pushing for more critical mineral exploration on their own territory, Latin America, and Africa. As CEO of American Lithium Simon Clarke said in a recent interview with the Canadian Mining Journal:  [G]overnments in Canada and the US have ultimately recognized that we must develop this domestic critical industry with countries that would be part of a Western supply chain… The governments have done a lot recently, especially with the recent incentives announced by the Canadian government and the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, which is a positive step towards helping to incentivize not only domestic production, but that Act also has the potential to apply to countries like Peru and other countries to help make sure that we can secure the supply. The amount of lithium and other critical minerals we need to make this transition is huge.    American Lithium has significant investments in Peru, including the Falchani lithium project, which is the sixth largest hard-rock lithium deposit in the world. This led Clarke to defend the right-wing forces that overthrew elected President Pedro Castillo in December 2022, in what the Canadian Mining Journal interviewer accurately describes as a coup d’état.  In Clarke’s words: “I know that the [Boluarte] government… is looking to bring forward early elections later this year… Peru is a big mining jurisdiction. Mining is protected in the constitution. There may be some calls from the left to nationalize mining, but that cannot be done under the constitution.”  According to polling company IEP, 69 percent of Peruvians agree that the country needs a new constitution. However, the unelected Dina Boluarte government responded to a national uprising in favour of new elections and a constitutional assembly with massive military force, killing almost 70 civilians and injuring close to 2,000.  Clarke also neglects to mention that, before his removal, one of Castillo’s main goals was to convene a constitutional assembly to rewrite the Peruvian constitution, which was implemented under the far-right dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori.  The formation of a “Western supply chain” cannot be achieved with minerals solely from Canada and the US. That would be controversial enough given the often deleterious social and ecological effects of mining operations in Canada (particularly for Indigenous communities). No, the building of this “Western supply chain,” and the concomitant “decoupling” from China, relies on Canadian and US mineral extraction in countries like Peru, where profit-driven mining companies are allowed to operate with little to no consideration for the local and environmental consequences of their projects.  This is something that is totally lost in conversations about decoupling from China: it will mean more US and Canadian extractive investment in the Global South, specifically Latin America and Africa, which will bring more dispossession, more surveillance and state repression, more degradation of local ecologies, and more anger toward the Canadian and US governments.  For example, access to critical minerals influenced Ottawa’s shameful response to the massacres and political repression in Peru. Despite Boluarte having an approval rating of 15 percent, and with the Congress that removed Castillo having a 91 percent disapproval rate, both have “the full support of the US, Canada, and foreign mining corporations.”  At the same time, Ecuador’s embattled President Guillermo Lasso, whose approval rating sits between 12 and 14 percent, has retained Ottawa’s support because of his concessions to mining capital. Despite the nationwide uprising against his mismanagement of the country, which has set Ecuador on track for its most violent year on record, and his prioritization of foreign mining capital over the needs of his own citizens, Trudeau is behind Lasso. This is because, even though Indigenous-led resistance movements have called for more restrictions on foreign mining and greater environmental protections, Lasso has spurned their demands.

The Canada-Ecuador free trade agreement (FTA) is another factor in Ottawa’s support for the discredited Lasso government. If implemented, the FTA will greatly expand the power of Canadian companies in Ecuador by allowing them to sue Quito in a private tribunal for interfering with their ability to earn profits. Companies often sue national governments when the governments introduce higher tax and royalty rates, or introduce new protections for the environment and human rights.  The US and Canadian governments are also working hard in Guatemala to ensure that the Fenix nickel mine transfers to a Canadian company. The mine is currently owned by a Switzerland-based investment group called Solway, although it has been sanctioned by the US for alleged “Russian influence peddling.”  Previously owned by Canadian companies Inco (from 1960 to 2004), Skye Resources (2004 to 2008), and Hudbay Minerals (2008 to 2011), the Fenix mine has been a constant site of struggle for environmental and Indigenous rights. During the period of Canadian ownership, the Guatemalan state responded to Indigenous resistance at the mine with extreme violence including murder, rape, and the burning of homes, without any condemnation from Canada’s government.  Now that the mine’s current owner has been sanctioned, and Canada and the US are concerned with building a supply chain that can sideline Chinese industrial inputs, Ottawa and Washington are once again interested in Fenix. This led to a Newsweek report that the US government is intervening in Guatemala to ensure that the Canadian company Central America Nickel (CAN) acquires the nickel mine from Solway at a “substantial discount.”  At the same time, Ottawa and Washington are contending with an upsurge of “resource nationalism” in Mexico under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO). The Trudeau and Biden governments are currently trying to hinder AMLO’s attempts to increase Mexican state sovereignty over oil and gas, electricity, and mining.  Canadian mining investments in Mexico are valued at $9 billion, ranking seventh overall in Canadian mining assets abroad. Mexico is also a top ten global producer of several minerals that the Canadian government has identified as critical for its “green and digital economy,” including zinc and graphite.  AMLO’s left-wing policies, however, have had an unwanted impact on the ability of Canadian and US companies to extract the profit and resources they want from Mexico. In addition to strengthening the state’s role in Mexico’s energy market (leading to confrontation with Ottawa and Washington under the CUSMA), AMLO has nationalized his country’s lithium and announced plans to form a lithium association with other countries in the region that produce the resource, namely Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.  Furthermore, AMLO’s government has proposed an overhaul of the mining industry that reduces the role of private foreign investment and expands state protection of the environment. The Mexican government’s goals are threefold: “to restore state control over Mexico’s mineral and water resources; to regulate the granting, maintenance, supervision and termination of mining concessions; and to protect human rights, the environment and human health.”  In the context of the ongoing energy dispute between Mexico on the one hand and the US and Canada on the other, AMLO’s mining reforms are likely to provoke an aggressive response from the rest of North America. As journalist Nick Corbishley writes:  Both Washington and Ottawa have already threatened to take Mexico to dispute resolution settlement over the AMLO government’s energy reforms and proposed ban on imports of [genetically modified] corn. Now, the AMLO government wants to radically change the rules of the game for Mexico’s hugely lucrative mining sector, which is a major source of industrial metals and other minerals for global manufacturers. In other words, one can expect fierce resistance to the proposed reforms as they make their winding way through the legislative branches.    Canada’s Trade Minister Mary Ng has “expressed concern” about Mexico’s mining reforms on multiple occasions. In a recent statement, Ng specifically noted that AMLO’s mining reforms would “have impacts on [North America’s] supply chain resiliency.”  Reforms like these are obviously one reason why AMLO is facing so much negative press coverage in the rest of North America. If he continues interfering with the ability of Canadian and US companies to invest in Mexico on their own terms—a key component of the incipient “western supply chain”—we will likely see more demonization of AMLO and perhaps direct electoral interference against his MORENA party in next year’s presidential election.  With Chile announcing that it too will nationalize its lithium industry, and the potential for resource nationalism in left-leaning governments like Gustavo Petro’s Colombia and Lula’s Brazil, Canada and the US will face many challenges as they aim to impose the terms of their “Western supply chain” on the region.  In Africa, too, Canada has sought to increase resource investments to recover from its drift away from China and Russia. Of course, Canada is primarily interested in the ability of Canadian companies to profit from investments.  At the Mining Indaba, an annual conference hosted by South Africa, Canadian officials work to put mining companies in contact with friendly African governments, such as Zambia’s, which offer low taxes and royalties and few labour and environmental protections. At the 2022 Indaba, several speakers from large Canadian companies spoke about Russia, the war in Ukraine, and how their interest in African minerals grew following the invasion—an indication of how Canadian companies are pushing for even more investment in the continent as geopolitical blocs form between East and West.  In the post-Cold War period, Canadian governments negotiated Foreign Investment Protection Acts (FIPAs) in African countries, which give corporations the right to sue governments for interfering with their investments. The Harper government negotiated FIPAs with 15 African countries, some of which were signed or announced at mining conventions. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau announced negotiations for a FIPA with Ethiopia in 2020, and later signed an FIPA with Nigeria.  In the case of South Africa, Canadian companies and diplomats interfered during the transition out of apartheid to ensure that mineral resources were not placed under state control.  In 2009, Congolese president Joseph Kabila withdrew the Canadian company First Quantum’s rights to a copper mine in Congo’s east. Harper immediately began lobbying against the Congolese government with the IMF, the World Bank, and other international investors, and even threatened to prevent the country from restructuring debt accrued under the Mobutu dictatorship until Kabila backed off.  In a more recent case, the Trudeau government intervened in Tanzania to prevent a ban on gold concentrate exports that would have eaten into the profits of Canadian company Barrick Gold.  It is clear that, throughout Africa, Ottawa has responded to countries that seek to gain more national control over their mining industries with political meddling.  Of course, the spectre of resource nationalism is always hovering, and even in friendly countries the transnational industry remains concerned about public demands for a greater domestic role in their nation’s mining.  It is important to remember these facts when officials in Ottawa and Washington speak on the importance of “decoupling” from the Chinese economy. When it comes to critical minerals, Canada and the US are dead set on replacing China’s supply with reserves elsewhere, namely Latin America and Africa. Given the exploitative way that US and Canadian mining functions in the Global South, “decoupling” means more exploitation of these regions, more undermining of state sovereignty, and more conflict with those who oppose selling out their mining industries to foreign capital.

"political coup","2022-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T09:01:47","The construction of a hydropower dam by a company with alleged ties to the United Wa State Army (UWSA) is moving forward in contested territory along northern Shan State’s Namtu (Myitnge) River while remaining “shrouded in secrecy,” according to a local activist network.  A report released last week by the Shan State Frontline Investment Monitor (SSFIM) described the company in question, National Current Energy Hydropower (NCEH), as UWSA-owned.  A spokesperson for the activist network attributed the information to an internal source close to the firm and cited links between the Mandalay-based NCEH’s leadership and other ventures with known ties to the ethnic Wa armed group.  A UWSA information officer acknowledged that he had seen the SSFIM report but, at the time of reporting, had not responded to Myanmar Now’s questions regarding the allegations.  SSFIM said that NCEH—which Myanmar Now was also unable to reach for comment—signed an agreement with the junta’s electricity ministry in late April 2022 to build a 210-megawatt dam in Hsipaw Township. The project is estimated to cost a total of US$436m.  The SSFIM spokesperson said on May 19 that since then, activity has increased around the dam site and his group had been waiting for the situation to be “safe enough for an update to be released.” He estimated that the dam was 10 percent finished at the time of reporting.  “Currently, they are building housing for the workers, transporting materials, digging, and clearing the land for a road to the site,” he said.  Map indicating the location of the planned electric railway from Muse to Mandalay, in relation to the Namtu dams (Shan State Frontline Investment Monitor)  SSFIM criticised an “ongoing lack of transparency and disregard of local concerns” surrounding the project, pointing out that the dam’s capacity had more than doubled since it was originally proposed nearly 10 years ago as a 100-megawatt initiative. The group emphasised that it still had not been disclosed as being among the military council’s electricity generation projects under construction.  NCEH, it said, has been involved in the dam since 2014, when the company signed a memorandum of understanding with the then military-government for “build, operate and transfer” rights to the initiative. Community-based groups accused NCEH in 2017 of illegally clearing forests and constructing roads in the area before an environmental impact assessment could be carried out.  Over the next two years, a local Shan parliamentarian raised concern in the national legislature about NCEH’s practices, and asked that the Namtu hydropower project be stopped. It moved forward despite these efforts, SSFIM said.  The dam site is located some 12 miles upstream from Hsipaw Township’s administrative centre, whose 20,000 residents are believed to be put at risk by the project.  “Parts of [Hsipaw] town are already prone to flooding from river overflow after heavy rainfall, meaning that even without dam breakage, sudden large releases of water could cause significant damage,” SSFIM said.  The threat to the town was not mentioned in a 2018 “scoping report” carried out by MyAsia Consulting—a firm hired by NCEH for the task. The report did describe the project’s safety as being “a serious concern to the people who live in the downstream area,” noting that a dam breach could result in a catastrophic disaster” and mentioned that the upstream village of Lilu and 140 hectares of farmland would be submerged in the dam’s reservoir.  A full environmental impact assessment of the project has not been made available to the public.  Pollution to the Namtu dam reservoir from the Bawdwin lead and silver mines is also a threat, and since the February 2021 coup, excavation at the mining site, some 25 miles upstream from the Namtu dam, has been “resuming at a fast pace,” according to SSFIM.  The dam is one of five hydropower projects proposed along the Namtu River; the Yeywa, with a capacity to produce more than 700 megawatts of electricity—was completed in 2010. Two more dams remain in the planning stages: the Middle Yeywa and the Deedoke.  The Namtu project in Hsipaw is one of two currently under construction—the other being the 280-megawatt Upper Yeywa in neighbouring Kyaukme Township, set to be completed this year and threatening to flood an area of 100 villages and home to 40,000 people.  SSFIM noted that NCEH is also simultaneously constructing a nearly 50-mile 230kV electricity transmission line connecting the Upper Yeywa and Namtu dams.  The transmission line’s location, which crosses the route of a planned electric railway connecting the Shan State-China border town of Muse to Mandalay, has caused SSFIM to speculate that electricity generated by the Namtu dam will power the Chinese transport project, “rather than serve local people’s electricity needs.”  SSFIM also pointed to the recent arrival of more than 100 Chinese workers at the Namtu dam site who do not speak Burmese as “supporting the widely held assumption that this is a China-backed project.”  The network condemned the UWSA, which has a close military and political relationship with China, for “directly profiting” from the Namtu dam’s construction.  SSFIM also noted that the project is located in an area where several other ethnic armed organisations are active, raising “serious questions” about these groups’ priorities, particularly given the strong opposition by area communities and the “interests of the illegitimate [military] regime.”  Map indicating the armed groups active around the Namtu River dam sites in northern Shan State (Shan State Frontline Investment Monitor)  Among them are the Shan State Progress Party and Ta’ang National Liberation Army, known to be close to the UWSA. Myanmar Now was unable to reach either group for comment.  The fact that construction has been able to continue in this “highly contested landscape” suggests that “security guarantees have been obtained from the various armed actors,” the network added.  “It would be impossible for the project to proceed without the permission of the armed groups in the region,” the SSFIM spokesperson told Myanmar Now. “We think that because the project is backed by China and the electricity will supply the China-Myanmar railway project, it has been allowed to go ahead.”  SSFIM referenced an April 25 statement by more than a dozen Shan civil society organisations urging ethnic armed groups to stand with locals in solidarity and “use any means” necessary to stop the Namtu River dams, which they deemed a threat to establishing a future federal democracy.  The activist network called for a moratorium on dam construction nationwide until a federal Constitution is adopted that would allow “local communities to protect their own natural resources.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL215YW5tYXItbm93Lm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzL3dhLWFybXktbGlua2VkLWNvbXBhbnktY29sbGFib3JhdGluZy13aXRoLWp1bnRhLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWh5ZHJvcG93ZXItZGFtLWluLW5vcnRoZXJuLXNoYW4tc3RhdGUtYWN0aXZpc3RzLXNheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

REUTERS/Mohammad Shoiab  Militants detonated explosives inside two empty girls' schools in northwestern Pakistan overnight, destroying nine classrooms but causing no casualties, officials said Monday.  Girls' education has long been contentious for some regional militants, including the Pakistan Taliban, notorious for shooting then-schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai as she campaigned for schooling in 2012.  The twin attacks on the girls' schools took place on Sunday night in the Hassu Khel and Gul Mosaki areas of North Waziristan, both around 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the border with Afghanistan.  ""Militants planted improvised explosive devices in the two government middle schools for girls, which exploded late in the night,"" said senior local administration official Rehan Gul Khattak.  He said six classrooms in Hassu Khel and a further three in Gul Mosaki were destroyed.  ""It was surely done by militants but we don't know yet which group was involved,"" Khattak told AFP.  District police officer Salim Riaz confirmed the incident and said ""a full- scale investigation"" had been launched.  North Waziristan has historically been a hive of militancy, and was the target of a long-running Pakistani military offensive and US drone strikes during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan.  Since the Taliban surged back to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has witnessed a dramatic uptick in militancy, with most attacks focussed in border regions.  The Pakistan Taliban -- known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- remain among the most active groups in the area.  It was formed in 2007 by Pakistani militants who splintered off from the Afghan Taliban to focus their fight on Islamabad for supporting America's invasion.  TTP fighters once held sway over swathes of northwest Pakistan but were turfed out by the army after 2014, the same year Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkL3NvdXRoLWFzaWEvbWlsaXRhbnRzLWJsb3ctZW1wdHktcGFraXN0YW4tZ2lybHMtc2Nob29scy02MzYxNjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2021-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T19:18:45","Will Sudan crisis trigger a fresh wave of migrants and refugees out of Africa?  JUBA, South Sudan: Thousands of civilians in towns and villages across Sudan have been forced to flee in recent weeks to escape the worsening conflict in the country, which has entered its second bloody month, leading to fears of a new global refugee crisis.  Initial clashes between former allies the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces have escalated into heavy combat, displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded, and disruptions to basic utilities and shortages of medical supplies have forced medical staff to turn away even the critically ill.  Meanwhile, shortages of food, fuel, electricity and clean water, coupled with economic collapse and the breakdown of law and order, have forced entire communities to pack up and leave in search of security and relief.  Passengers fleeing war-torn Sudan cross into Egypt through the Argeen Land Port on May 12, 2023. (AFP)  In the first four weeks of the crisis, around 200,000 people fled Sudan while another 700,000 were displaced inside the country. As many as 860,000 refugees and returnees are expected by the UN refugee agency UNHCR to flee by October, raising fears among European policymakers of a new influx of migrants who risk the perilous journey north to their shores.  Europe was forced to confront the issue of mass migration in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa, the Middle East and Asia began arriving from across the Mediterranean.  More recently, the continent has absorbed millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, which has placed additional strain on a continent already grappling with high energy prices as a result of gas shortages.  However, few experts predict Europe will see anything close to the same number of migrants as a result of the crisis in Sudan. Instead, most expect the majority to be displaced internally or settle in neighboring African states.  “Some of the refugees will try to go to Europe, but I don’t see that there will be mass migration going to Europe right now,” Namira Negm, director of the African Migration Observatory in Morocco, told Arab News.  “It will increase but it will not be mass migration. Migration to neighboring countries needs to be addressed first.”  IN NUMBERS 116,995 First-time asylum seekers from Sudan in EU+ area during 2015 peak.  860,000+ Refugees and returnees expected to flee Sudan by Oct. (UNHCR).  $445m Funding required to support the displaced until Oct. 2023 (UNHCR).  Nevertheless, many in Europe remain fearful that any fresh influx will place additional strains on the resources of host nations, and trigger a surge in anti-immigrant sentiments and support for right-wing populist movements.  In response to previous waves of migration several European nations adopted draconian immigration policies, making it more difficult for new arrivals to obtain asylum and the right to remain. Those who still try to reach Europe face dangerous journeys, including sea voyages in often flimsy and overloaded vessels.  “Reaching Europe would require navigating treacherous and expensive migration routes, often involving perilous sea crossings and facing the risk of exploitation and abuse by human traffickers,” Franck Duvell, a senior researcher at Universitat Osnabruck in Germany, told Arab News.  “Numbers might go up a little, but I don’t see these networks and routes now. Traveling to western Libya has become dangerous and is getting more and more difficult, and therefore (an) increasing number of people actually continue their journey to Tunisia.  “I don’t see Sudanese traveling all the way to Tunisia. It’s simply too far, it’s too expensive, it’s too dangerous … Even if numbers are increasing, the total numbers will still be relatively small.”  Migrant numbers were already on the rise prior to the start of the conflict last month. More than 36,000 people arrived from Sudan in Europe’s Mediterranean region between January and March, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest UNHCR figures.  Sudan has been caught in a cycle of violent coups and countercoups for years. The latest, in October 2021, resulted in a transitional, civilian-led government being overthrown by a military junta led by the two factions now fighting each other.  Since the start of a shaky political transition in 2019, after long-time autocratic ruler Omar Al-Bashir was ousted, Sudan has been plagued by political and economic instability, prompting many citizens to seek sanctuary outside the country.  According to the EU’s European Asylum Support Office, Sudanese nationals represented the fifth-largest group of applicants for international protection in the EU in 2020, with more than 34,000 new applications. This was a significant increase on the previous year, when there were about 18,000 new applications.  An economic crisis, including high inflation, devaluation of the national currency and shortages of basic goods, had already caused poverty and unemployment to increase in Sudan prior to the latest conflict, which began on April 15.  And it is not only the Sudanese people themselves who face displacement. Before the fighting began, Sudan hosted more than a million refugees, 300,000 of them in the capital Khartoum, who had fled South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of them are now returning home or looking for refuge elsewhere in the region or further afield.  Refugees from Sudan who crossed into Ethiopia rest in Metema, on May 5, 2023. (AFP)  If the crisis in Sudan becomes long drawn out, akin to the Syrian civil war, the possibility of large number of Sudanese refugees seeking safety in Europe cannot be ruled out.  “A protracted conflict could create unwanted uncertainties,” Thirsa de Vries, a Sudan expert at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told Arab News.  “This is why it is also important that the international community (engages with) the different actors that might be involved, or works with neighboring countries to close corridors for weapons smuggling.”  The possibility of a large number of Sudanese refugees attempting to reach Europe also highlights the importance of cooperation between nations in managing migration flows.  Abdullahi Hassan, a researcher at human rights organization Amnesty International who specializes in Sudan, stressed the importance of ensuring the security and stability of host and origin countries.  “With adequate planning and resources, it is possible to provide safe and orderly routes for those seeking refuge,” he told Arab News.  He said the response to the crisis in Sudan should not solely focus on migration and added: “It must instead prioritize the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid.  “The EU and its member states should use their influence, both in the region and in Sudan, to ensure that they are directly engaging with the parties to the conflict to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, encourage immediate and unrestricted access for humanitarian actors, and pressure the Sudanese authorities to allow safe exit passages for people trying to flee the conflict.”  As the fighting continues to rage, the warring Sudanese factions have held talks in Saudi Arabia to discuss a ceasefire but made it clear they would not negotiate an end to the conflict.  Despite the challenges posed by the violence, humanitarian organizations are working to provide aid to those affected by the Sudan crisis. But attacks on aid workers and the looting of relief supplies have made it increasingly difficult for agencies to deliver help to needy communities, which could in turn affect the response of donor countries.  A view shows black smoke and fire at Omdurman market in Omdurman, Sudan, May 17, 2023. (Screengrab/Reuters)  Some organizations “have evacuated international staff, particularly those that were in the most affected areas,” UNHCR spokesperson Faith Kasina, told Arab News, who highlighted the risks and limitations of aid provision during armed conflicts.  The UN’s Children’s Fund, UNICEF, reported on May 5 that at least 190 children have been killed and 1,700 injured since the fighting began in Sudan. While a tentative ceasefire allowed foreign nations to evacuate their citizens from the country in the past few weeks, Sudanese nationals continue to endure great hardships.  Several media outlets, including the BBC, the Washington Post and Al-Jazeera, have interviewed Sudanese citizens who said their passports were locked inside foreign embassies, leaving them trapped in their own country.  Hassan, the Amnesty International researcher, said foreign nations must provide safe evacuation procedures, and that the warring factions must “stop attacking humanitarian aid workers.”  But he added that instances of attacks on workers and the looting of aid supplies “should not be an excuse to withdraw funding.”  “The response to the crisis in Sudan is completely different from the response, for example, Ukraine received when the conflict started in that country,” said Hassan.  “European countries should, nevertheless, provide safe and regular pathways to Europe for those seeking international protection … It is the responsibility of the EU and member states to ensure that such pathways are made available.”  However, public sentiment in Europe appears to be overwhelmingly hostile to refugees. Both Italy and the UK have faced recent criticism for their strict immigration policies, which aid agencies warn could drive more refugees into the arms of smuggling gangs.  In mid-April, Italy passed legislation to curb undocumented migration, including tougher sentences for those convicted of human trafficking and terminating residency permits for migrants who face humanitarian risks.  This drew criticism from search-and-rescue organizations, who warned it would lead to more deaths at sea in the Mediterranean as migrants seek illegal routes to Europe.  The British government has been accused of racial discrimination in its refugee policy. Immigration experts point out that although hundreds of thousands of visas were provided for Ukrainian refugees, there is no plan, or safe route, to help those fleeing violence in Sudan.  Ultimately, the best way to avoid migrant crises is by helping ensure that all countries in Africa are able to offer their citizens a decent quality of life.  “The root cause is lack of development; people lose hope in their country and end up migrating to other countries,” African Migration Observatory Director Negm said regarding the importance of stability in Africa.  “If they have a good life in their own home countries, they will not think of going somewhere else.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc4NTYvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3ODU2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Deere economist on interest rates. Kanlaya Barr, Director of Corporate Economics for John Deere, said: ""Interest-rate expense is only about 6% to 7% of total ag production expenses, but a little over half of that is tied to mortgages, which are mostly fixed at lower rate. The portion tied to operating loans tends to be more variable and is about 3% and that number is even smaller for row-crop producers, their interest rate expend is less than 1% of their overall operating expenses. The impact of higher interest rates is much smaller than the tailwinds from lower input costs and fuel costs. With that said, rising interest rates have also had an impact on real estate. While the housing market has been significantly affected by the elevated interest rates, the farmland market has been relatively immune, and farmland values continue to hold up through Q2 of this year."" Deere's Dave Gilmore, SVP, Ag and Turf Sales and Marketing, added: ""To add some context, comments that came from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City earlier this spring is that when you put interest rates in perspective relative to history, roughly $0.12 of every dollar of a Midwest U.S. farm earnings is going to interest cost today versus the long-term average of $0.15. As a result, customers are managing this expense very well."" He also noted that ""As the Fed reported, the marginal increase in interest costs on operating loans is the financial equivalent of an additional 2.5 bushels of yield for corn. That's why a major component of our smart industrial strategy is focused on helping our customers better manage volatile periods by delivering products, and solutions that minimize costs and increase yields. Our goal is to deliver products, and solutions that offset and improve the variable cost structure of our farmers.""  Kanlaya Barr, Director of Corporate Economics for John Deere, said: ""Interest-rate expense is only about 6% to 7% of total ag production expenses, but a little over half of that is tied to mortgages, which are mostly fixed at lower rate.

The world stage. ""As the U.S. and China coexist, compete, and confront each other to determine who will set the geopolitical rules, they will either court or thwart an emerging group of countries to gain an edge.

It is the largest fine to be imposed on a big tech company in the bloc. Ireland's Data Protection Commission, one of the EU's privacy watchdogs, said that Facebook did not properly protect the data of European users against American surveillance programs.  The Federal Reserve's rate-raising campaign has hit small businesses the hardest. Smaller companies rely predominantly on lending from banks, and commercial and industrial lending by banks to businesses has fallen every month this year. Nearly half of all U.S. banks said they are raising their standards for lending money to small companies, with 56% of lenders reporting falling demand. Meanwhile the average rate for a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration, which historically costs less than a bank loan, has reached double-digits, driving many small firms to borrow less.  Immigrants' share of the U.S. labor force grows to a new high. Foreign-born workers' share of the U.S. labor force rose last year to the highest level in 27 years of records, as labor demand surged and the pandemic faded. People born outside the U.S. made up 18.1% of the overall labor force, up from 17.4% the prior year and the highest level in data back to 1996, the Labor Department said. The number of immigrants in the labor force — those working or actively looking for jobs —r ose by 1.8 million to 29.8 million in 2022. More foreign-born people joined the labor force than native-born Americans last year, the Wall Street Journal notes.  Sluggish U.S. population growth and accelerating baby-boomer retirements during the pandemic created labor shortages in many industries, increasing job opportunities for foreign-born workers. The Labor Department's report doesn't break down foreign-born workers by country of origin or legal status. The figures include legally admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary residents and immigrants lacking permanent legal status.  Auto dealers finally have cars to sell again. New-car buyers are finding a bigger selection of models to choose from this spring selling season, in large part because of easing supply-chain woes and more stable factory output. The replenished inventory also is shaping up to be an important test for car companies: If supplies get bloated, it could put an end to the lofty prices and big profits the industry has enjoyed since the pandemic's early days, the WSJ concludes.  Market perspectives:  • Outside markets: The U.S. dollar index was weaker, with the euro, yen and British pound all firmer against the greenback. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was higher, trading around 3.69%, with a mixed tone in global government bond yields. Crude oil has swung to gains, with U.S. crude around $71.80 per barrel and Brent around $75.85 per barrel. Gold and silver were weaker in electronic trading, with gold around $1,974 per troy ounce and silver around $23.90 per troy ounce.  • At around $3.50 a gallon, average national gas prices are $1 less than they were a year ago. A similar drop has happened only three times recently—during the 2009 recession, the 2015 OPEC supply glut, and after the onset of Covid-19 in 2020, according to GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan.  Gas prices have fluctuated between about $3.15 and $3.65 a gallon this year. That's well below $5 a gallon or more last year, but people have not increased their driving much, wrote Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, in an email to Barron's.  Gasoline demand fell 4.2%, to 8.9 million barrels a day in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration. OPIS estimates that prices could be down $1.25 to $1.50 a gallon by June from last year.  The positions of oil traders such as hedge funds are near the most bearish levels they have seen since 2011, Bloomberg reported. So far this year, WTI crude futures are down 11%, while Brent crude, the international benchmark, is down 12%.  • Oilprice.com asks whether it's time to take green methanol seriously as governments and industries try to reduce carbon emissions. It notes:  — Methanol has a wide range of uses including creating plastics, paints, and construction materials as well as being used as a fuel for transport.  — Methanol production traditionally uses natural gas, but as the world races to reduce emissions there is a growing opportunity for green methanol.  — Arguably the biggest growth opportunity for green methanol is as a new fuel for the shipping industry, an industry that is already looking to aggressively decarbonize.  • Hydro reservoirs around Europe are recovering, but that's thanks to water conversation efforts rather than higher inflows, according to BloombergNEF. Reservoirs in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and France are filling up at an average 357 gigawatt-hours per week, 10% higher than the nadir of 2022 but still the second-lowest filling rate since 2017. Unless water inflows pick up, electricity generation from hydro will remain muted in the region, leading to more gas being burned in the power sector — and higher prices.  • China's disappointing economic recovery is putting the metals bears in charge. Merchants, bankers, brokers and fund managers attending the London Metal Exchange's annual Asian event reported lackluster activity, and they don't expect that to change soon, Bloomberg reports.  • The price of extra virgin olive oil has surged to an all-time high, with a 46% increase from last year, resulting in a price of $6,269.63 per metric ton as of April. This cost translates to about $6 per liter for consumers, although additional shipping, marketing, and sales costs will significantly raise the final price. Filippo Berio, a leading olive oil brand, reports that the latest olive season was the most challenging in 30 years due to record-low crop yields. This price spike is largely due to severe drought in Spain, the producer of about 40% of the world's olive oil. The country experienced its hottest and driest summer on record last year, leading to a significant drop in production. Spain's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food forecasts that the crop will yield just 680,000 tons of olive oil in the current growing season, a significant decrease from the five-year average annual yield of 1.37 million tons. Both Spain and Italy, another major producer, had lighter harvests than expected. Spain has requested emergency funds from the European Union to support its farmers. Researchers warn that due to climate change, it may become more difficult to grow olives in key production areas, which could lead to more volatility in prices and higher costs for consumers. A significant shift in farming practices may be needed to counter this problem.  • Rice is in trouble as the Earth heats up, forcing the world to find new ways to grow one of the most important crops, the New York Times reports.  • More Polish wheat headed to United States.

RUSSIA/UKRAINE  — President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would support training Ukrainian pilots to use American-made F-16 fighter jets, a significant step after resisting the idea of providing the planes to Ukraine.  — To aid Ukraine, allies are looking to a security model like Israel's. An Israeli-style security agreement for Ukraine would give priority to arms transfers and advanced technology, Polish President Andrzej Duda said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. This security agreement would be linked to a process of moving toward future membership in NATO for Ukraine but stop short of actually making NATO a party to any conflict with Russia, according to Western officials familiar with the talks. With NATO membership for Kyiv possibly years away, a set of binding security arrangements would be a way of helping the Ukrainian military immediately as it gears up for an expected counteroffensive against Russia's invasion.  — G7 calls for full implementation of Black Sea grain deal. The Group of Seven (G7) called on all participants of the Black Sea Grain deal ""to continue and fully implement its smooth operation at its maximum potential and for as long as necessary."" G7's statement on global food security also stressed ""the importance of allowing grains to continue to reach those most in need.""  — Russia targets 55 MMT of grain exports annually. Russia plans to harvest on average around 130 MMT of grain a year and export up to 55 MMT, Russian First Deputy Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut said. She noted Russia had managed to increase its grain exports despite some countries rejecting its supplies because of the war in Ukraine. Russia is currently shipping around 80% of its grain to the Middle East and North Africa, with Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Algeria comprising the top five buyers, according to Eduard Zernin, the head of Russia's grain exporters union.  — Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, was cut off from its power supply and is relying on diesel generators. The United Nations called the safety situation ""extremely vulnerable.""  Meanwhile, Russia launched several strikes on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Ukraine's air force claimed to have shot down 20 drones and four missiles. Russia has intensified its aerial attacks in recent weeks in anticipation of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.  — The war in Ukraine has forced farmers to risk planting crops in fields potentially littered with explosives left by Russian forces, the Associated Press reports. As a result of the Russian invasion and ongoing occupation, Ukrainian farmers face a difficult decision of risking their lives to plant and harvest crops during the critical spring planting season. This danger is compounded by soaring production and transportation costs caused by Russia's blockade of many Black Sea ports. Some European countries have also imposed import restrictions on Ukrainian grain to prevent a surplus.  Impacts: Industry insiders, Ukrainian government officials, and international organizations predict at least a 20% to 30% reduction in grain output, lower quality crops, and potentially thousands of bankruptcies next year. This could pose a significant threat to global food security as Ukraine is often referred to as the ""breadbasket of the world,"" providing essential supplies of wheat, barley, and sunflower oil to regions like Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that 90% of agricultural businesses in Ukraine have lost revenue and 12% have land contaminated with mines. These conditions may lead to a further reduction in land planted with grain, with significant consequences for local farmers and the global food supply.  POLICY UPDATE  — Latest on debt-limit talks:  President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will meet this afternoon in a one-on-one meeting to discuss the impending U.S. government debt default, with disagreements over spending caps for the future, social-welfare program work requirements, permit reform, and IRS funding. The two haven't met one-on-one to discuss spending and the debt ceiling since Feb. 1. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who some previously thought might have to step in to negotiate a compromise, has thrown his full support behind the Speaker to negotiate a deal.    Negotiators met for more than two hours Sunday evening in McCarthy's office. Biden also called McCarthy from Air Force One on his way back from the G7 summit in Japan, a call that McCarthy called ""productive.""    Biden said before departing for Japan that he'd cut spending and that the Republicans must now shift their demands.    On Sunday, the sides were still at loggerheads. McCarthy told reporters ""We're still apart,"" while Biden said what the GOP has offered is ""unacceptable.""    Central to the talks are setting a top-line spending level for the next year and deciding how long to lift the debt ceiling until having to raise it again. Republicans want to hold spending to 2022 levels, while the White House wants to keep 2024 spending at the level of the current 2023 budget year. The latest draft has spending caps for six years while the White House wants a two-year deal.    House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) last Monday said the GOP's request for beefed-up work requirements for public assistance programs was a ""nonstarter."" But later in the week, Biden signaled willingness to compromise on work requirements, though rejected any kind of significant change. Republicans want work requirements on the Medicaid health care program, though the Biden administration has countered that millions of people could lose coverage. The GOP additionally introduced new cuts to food aid by restricting states' ability to waive work requirements in places with high joblessness. That idea, when floated under President Donald Trump, was estimated to cause 700,000 people to lose their food benefits.    GOP lawmakers are also seeking cuts in IRS money and asking the White House to accept parts of their proposed immigration overhaul. The White House has countered by keeping defense and nondefense spending flat next year, which would save $90 billion in the 2024 budget year and $1 trillion over 10 years.    Biden is facing pressure to invoke the 14th Amendment to prevent a government shutdown in case of a default. However, there are doubts about the feasibility of this approach given the short timeline to the around June 1 deadline and questions over whether it could survive a legal challenge.    Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reaffirmed the June 1 ""x-date"" despite other estimates pushing the X-date further into June. She said even with a fresh influx of tax revenue in mid-June, odds of continuing to make payments through June 15 are ""quite low."" Asked last week if he doubted the administration's latest default deadline, Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters: ""No. Whatever Janet Yellen says is the date. I'm not going to argue about that."" Yellen and Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo are on a daily call with the Treasury office that tracks developments in global trading, known as the markets room. Yellen has been getting a daily briefing on the X-date forecast for the last few months.    Goldman Sachs estimates that by June 8 or 9 the U.S. Treasury will see its cash levels drop below the $30 billion it's said is the bare minimum it needs to meet its debt obligations. ""While we expect a deal to occur ahead of the deadline, we also expect a few more twists along the way, and suspect that markets are likely to price in additional risk before the debt limit is finally raised,"" Goldman economists said in the note.    Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told ABC's This Week that Democrats should move on to other options, including a so-called discharge petition, a way to bypass Republicans by going to a vote. Democrats are working on a discharge petition for a clean debt-limit increase, which needs 218 signatures. As of now, they have 210 and are hoping to have all 213 House Democrats sign by the end of the day. It's murky whether the remaining signatures will be secured.    Public opinion surveys have not shown that Democratic attacks on Republicans for holding the economy ""hostage"" with their debt limit demands are swaying the electorate in their favor. A May 17-18 Harvard/Harris poll found that 57% of voters think Democrats should alter their position to prevent a default, up from 55% in April, while 43% said Republicans should change.    Signs of investor jitters are growing. According to a Bank of America report published on Friday, investors pulled $7.7 billion out of stocks last week, buying less-risky Treasury notes instead.    — Debt-ceiling standoff could start a recession, but default would be worse. Prolonged debt-ceiling squabbling could push the U.S. economy into recession, while a government default on its obligations might touch off a severe financial crisis. A Wall Street Journal article looks at three potential scenarios — ranging from a last-minute deal to lengthy impasse—and the potential fallout for the economy.  CHINA UPDATE  — After Xi. The Wall Street Journal's China correspondent, Chun Han Wong, author of the forthcoming book, Party of One: The Rise of Xi Jinping and China's Superpower Future, discusses the political situation in China. As the nation's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong nears his 70th birthday, Xi Jinping's succession plans remain unclear. This uncertainty keeps the Chinese Communist Party's elite members vigilant and aids Xi in retaining his power. However, the article notes, this lack of a clear succession plan could backfire if it continues indefinitely, potentially alienating his supporters and aggravating his adversaries to such an extent that it might destabilize his leadership or even lead to a coup d'état.  — President Biden said he expects U.S. relations with China to improve soon as a spat over an alleged spy balloon earlier this year shows signs of blowing over. Speaking to reporters on Sunday at the end of the G7 summit in Japan, he said ""I think you're gonna see that begin to thaw very shortly."" But the two superpowers also still disagree on a lot.  Details: The U.S. reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to maintain open lines of communication with the country, but the spy craft incident earlier this year derailed the effort, President Biden said. Biden claimed that China's balloon had temporarily stalled chances for open dialogue between Washington and Beijing. The president did say he maintains hopes to reopen those talks soon. Biden said: ""We should have an open line [of communications]. With the Bali conference that's what President Xi and I agreed that we were going to do and meet on. And then this silly balloon that was carrying two free cars worth of spy equipment was flying over the United States, and it got shut down and changed in terms of talking to one another.""  — China bars purchases of Micron chips, announcing that that Micron products failed to pass a cybersecurity review. Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company's goods, saying it found ""relatively serious"" risks in Micron products sold in the country. The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two countries. The U.S. semiconductor maker said it cooperated with the probe and stands by its products' safety. Washington has blacklisted Chinese tech firms.  Mainland China and Hong Kong generated 25% of Micron's $30.8 billion in 2022 revenue. China is investing in its own chip industry to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. The agency's statement said it ""promotes high-level opening up"" to the outside world. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra attended the weekend's Group of Seven summit in Japan, the Financial Times reported. Micron said it was evaluating the agency's conclusion and assessing its next steps. Shares of Micron were down over 6% in premarket trading.  Other impacts: With the ban, Chinese companies can easily switch out its products for those made by competitors such as Samsung and SK Hynix, according to analysts and Western business executives who have consulted with Chinese authorities.  China also is accelerating efforts to develop satellite-powered internet networks to compete with Elon Musk's Starlink, which has maintained connections in war-torn Ukraine. New launch sites are being built in China, and state-owned and private satellite companies are expanding, the Wall Street Journal reported.  — G7 leaders said they will seek ""constructive and stable"" ties with Beijing, even as they push ahead with steps to reduce dependence on China for critical supply chains. They also said they will implement an anti-economic-coercion mechanism, drawing a Chinese rebuke.  TRADE POLICY  — The Mexican government is requesting Texas to discontinue its state-run cargo truck inspections at the border due to long delays and significant trade losses. Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) initiated these inspections on May 2 at the Veterans International Bridge in Brownsville and Free Trade International Bridge in Los Indios, causing delays from 8 to 27 hours. This has had a significant impact on perishable products and has been costly to American consumers.  Perspective: In 2022, the U.S. imported $18.7 billion of produce, including fresh, frozen, and processed fruits, vegetables, and nuts from Mexico, according to USDA.  Background: Texas DPS's checkpoints are supplementary to the commercial truck inspections performed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The DPS inspections have significantly slowed down CBP's processing. The Texas DPS stated the inspections' goal was to ensure road safety by checking that trucks are functioning properly. After initially inspecting all trailers from Mexico, DPS reduced the number of inspections from May 8.  Possible USMCA complaint. Despite the reduction, the Mexican government has threatened to lodge a complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement if inspections are not halted immediately. The Mexican economy ministry argues these actions stem from an ""anti-Mexican vision,"" despite Mexico being Texas's main trading partner with an average annual trade value of $231 billion.  — There should be no major trade policy implications from BSE confirmed in a cow in South Carolina that was traced back to a herd in Tennessee. The U.S. has a negligible risk status for BSE and an atypical case will not alter that status and no major trade disruptions are expected. This is the seventh case of BSE found in the U.S. and the first since 2012. As for China, Phase 1 of the U.S./China agreement says: ""Provided the United States maintains its OIE negligible risk classification for that disease, China shall not impose new import restrictions or requirements related to that disease on imports of U.S. beef.""  ENERGY & CLIMATE CHANGE  — Biden administration pulls back on renewable natural gas credits. The Biden administration has dropped, for now, a plan that would have awarded automakers such as Tesla credits for using renewable natural gas to power electric vehicles.  — RFS update. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is starting its review of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final rule on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) levels for 2023 and beyond. The review process includes a series of meetings with various stakeholders, starting with the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) on May 23, followed by NATSO (representing truck stop operators) on May 31, Clean Fuels Alliance of America and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers on June 1, and the United Steel Workers on June 6.  The EPA's final plan does not include provisions for renewable fuel credits (eRINs) to be awarded to electric vehicle manufacturers using renewable natural gas. Reports suggest that the Biden administration removed these provisions to prevent potential legal challenges that could jeopardize the overall RFS levels.  The EPA has until June 14 to finalize the RFS plan. As the OMB review process continues, additional meetings are expected to be scheduled. The focus remains on any changes in the final RFS levels compared to the proposed plan, particularly in terms of biodiesel and renewable diesel.  — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the allocation of $187 million to promote electric vehicles (EVs). This includes $87 million distributed across 45 projects, spanning 18 states, aimed at accelerating the electrification of domestic transportation, advancing more sustainable EV technologies, and raising consumer awareness about the benefits and potential cost savings of EV ownership.  DOE also introduced a new funding opportunity worth $99.5 million. This initiative is intended to support projects that improve EV charging infrastructure in underserved communities, develop EV batteries that use abundant materials, and further educate consumers about EVs and charging.  Applications for this new funding opportunity are currently open. Interested parties must submit concept papers by June 26, with full applications due by Aug. 11. This initiative is part of the DOE's efforts through its Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) to support the growth of the EV sector.  — Ford Motor Co. signed onto three deals for a supply of lithium amid a ramp-up of electric vehicle production, with an aim of producing 2 million units by the end of 2026. The agreements include a long-term deal with Canada's Nemaska Lithium Inc. for 13,000 tons of lithium hydroxide a year, a deal with EnergySource Minerals for supply from a California site anticipated to start up in 2025 and a five-year agreement with Albemarle Corp. for more than 100,000 metric tons of supply. Reuters.  — Exxon joins hunt for lithium in bet on EV boom. The Texas oil giant recently purchased drilling rights to some 120,000 gross acres of Arkansas land from which it aims to produce the mineral, a key ingredient in batteries for electric cars, cellphones and laptops, according to people familiar with the matter cited by the Wall Street Journal.  POLITICS & ELECTIONS  — Biden gets low ratings on economy, guns, immigration in AP-NORC poll. Just 33% of American adults say they approve of President Joe Biden's handling of the economy and only 24% say national economic conditions are in good shape. That's according to a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Public approval of Biden's handling of the economy remains low in a time of high inflation, a difficult housing market and concerns about a potential U.S. government debt default. American opinion is also gloomy about Biden's efforts on gun policy and immigration, with only 31% saying they approve of the president's performance on those hot button issues. Overall, 40% say they approve of the way Biden is doing his job.  — Election results in Greece trigger a big rally in stocks and bonds. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece is on the cusp of a new four-year term after his party did far better than opinion polls had predicted. In the run-up to the election, hedge funds had been shorting Greek bonds, betting on more political instability. Of note: Greece is close to seeing its sovereign debt return to investment grade, a dramatic turnaround from its disastrous 2010 default. New York Times.

"political coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","{""ProspectHeights"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T17:38:24","PROSPECT HEIGHTS — When asked to assess religious freedom worldwide compared to a decade ago, Edward Clancy, the director of outreach for Aid to the Church in Need, doesn’t hesitate with his answer.  “It’s worse. It’s worse,” Clancy said.  The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) — the U.S. government’s religious freedom watchdog — released its own assessment of religious freedom worldwide earlier this month, recommending the State Department designate 17 countries “Countries of Particular Concern (CPCs)” for their religious freedom abuses. The designation, created by the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) of 1998, leads the government to attempt noneconomic policy options to end the country’s religious freedom violations and impose economic penalties thereafter if the noneconomic attempts fail.  Twelve of those countries that the State Department has designated CPCs: Burma, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. USCIRF wants five others added: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, Syria, and Vietnam.  Clancy highlighted the fact that in Africa alone, “there are so many hotspots” of Christian persecution in particular, including Nigeria, Mozambique, Mali, across the Lake Chad region, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. He also highlighted countries across the Americas, particularly Cuba and Nicaragua.  And then there’s China, which Clancy said could be “a series of articles all by itself.”  Here is The Tablet’s look at the religious persecution that exists in eight countries, representing every region of the world. No two countries are the same, but at the heart of each is a government intent on its beliefs alone being represented in the country.  Nigeria (Region: Africa)  Last year, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo on Pentecost Sunday, killing at least 40 people. The attack is a microcosm of what Christians in Nigeria have experienced for  more than a decade, with consistent persecution at the hands of terror groups and other ethnic groups, and a consistently ineffective government response.  A recent report from the International Society of Civil Liberties and Rule of Law found that at least 52,250 Christians in Nigeria have been killed for their faith since 2014 — 30,250 of those since 2015. Over that same span, the report found about 18,000 Christian churches and 2,200 Christian schools were set on fire.  In the first 100 days of 2023, there were 1,041 “defenseless Christians” killed in Nigeria, according to the report. It also found that there are about 5 million displaced Christians who have been forced into Internally Displaced Persons camps within Nigeria.  USCIRF recently recommended the State Department designate Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” given the “rampant violence and atrocities” across the country that continue to impact religious freedom.  Clancy recently told The Tablet that Nigeria is “the principal country” when it comes to Christian persecution worldwide, saying, “The U.S. government has to start using diplomatic pressure to help change these things.”  Sudan (Region: Africa)  As Sudan descends into a potential civil war, Clancy fears the conflict could lead to further persecution of the nation’s Christians.  Christians are less than 5% of Sudan’s population, but for years have been persecuted.  According to Aid to the Church in Need’s 2020-2022 report on Christian persecution, there was optimism for Christians when Sudan’s former President, Omar al-Bashir, was killed in 2019. Al-Bashir ran the country under a strict interpretation of Shariah (Islamic law), which led to Christian persecution throughout his almost 30-year tenure.  That optimism initially proved true. After al-Bashir was killed, the death penalty was no longer applied to incidents of people converting faiths, public flogging was ended, and the public consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims was permitted.  However, the persecution persisted, especially after another military coup in October 2021 saw individuals connected to al-Bashir’s ruling party reclaim power.  In May 2022, a couple was charged with adultery and faced 100 lashes after a Shariah court annulled their marriage on the grounds of the husband’s conversion to Christianity. A month prior, a pastor was sentenced to a month in prison at the hands of a Muslim judge under a law against disturbing the peace after being attacked during a worship service.  Afghanistan (Middle East)  Religious freedom in Afghanistan has continued to worsen, and religious persecution has increased since the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021. Although the Islamic fundamentalist group pledged change and inclusivity when it came to power, the opposite has been true, as it has implemented rigorous enforcement of Shariah.  The Taliban has also been unable or unwilling to provide religious minorities safety and security against radical Islamist violence, usually by groups affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS), according to USCIRF.  In April 2022, the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) bombed multiple religious sites, two of which saw more than 30 deaths. Other places of worship and schools have been bombed and attacked, as well. Violence has been particularly committed against Hazara communities — a predominantly Shiite Muslim group in Afghanistan.  That same month, the Taliban tortured and killed a Hazara midwife — amputating her legs, stabbing her, and shooting her 12 times. Another attack against a Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Kabul in August 2022 left eight people dead.  The federal religious freedom watchdog recently recommended the State Department designate Afghanistan a “Country of Particular Concern” and called for sanctions on the Taliban.  China (Asia)  Last May, Cardinal Joseph Zen, the retired Catholic archbishop of Hong Kong, was arrested on suspicion of “collusion with foreign forces,” stemming from his involvement in a now-defunct humanitarian relief fund that provided aid to people who participated in pro-democracy protests in 2019. He was convicted in November — a decision he appealed a month later.  Another prominent Catholic, media and business tycoon, Jimmy Lai, was sentenced to 20 months in prison in October for charges related to his role in unauthorized demonstrations during 2019 pro-democracy protests. He is awaiting trial on separate national security law charges, in which he could be sentenced to life in prison.  The cases of Lai and Zen are examples of how the Chinese government has continued to implement its “sinicization of religion.” In essence, the Chinese Communist Party demands that any religious person or group support its rule and ideology.  And even though China officially recognizes Buddhism, Catholicism, Islam, Protestantism, and Taoism, groups and people with perceived foreign connections — including Uyghurs and other Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, underground Catholics, and house church Protestants — are especially vulnerable to persecution by the Chinese government.  Persecution against the Uyghurs has been especially reported on, with the Chinese government using prisons and concentration camps in a forced assimilation campaign. Uyghurs have also been subjected to forced labor, political indoctrination, mass surveillance, a homestay program that embeds officials in Uyghur households, and forced interfaith marriages, according to USCIRF.  China has been designated a “Country of Particular Concern” by the State Department for its religious freedom violations every year since 1999.  India (Asia)  Last August, more than 150 Sikhs disrupted an evangelical Christian event and beat the organizers. Last May, a mob dragged a  Protestant pastor out of a prayer hall where he was leading worship, and he — not the assailants — was later arrested. A month prior, 55 Christians were detained for “illegal conversions.” Around the same time, Christian pastor Yalam Sankar was dragged out of his house and stabbed to death by five men.  These instances were all highlighted in Aid to the Church in Need’s 2020-2022 report on Christian persecution to illustrate how religious freedom in India continues to deteriorate. The report cites data that there were 505 incidences of violence and hate in 2021, up from 279 in 2020. There were 302 in the first seven months of 2022.  Christians are about 5% of the population in India, but persecution against them is on the rise.  USCIRF recently reported that throughout 2022 the Indian government at the national, state, and local levels promoted and enforced a number of religious discriminatory policies and laws that impact not just Christians, but Muslims, Sikhs, Dalits, and Adivasis, as well.  Vietnam (Asia)  Last May, 15 Christians in Vietnam were arrested at the funeral of a local pastor and charged with resisting officers on duty and violating the safety regulations of crowded areas. They faced up to four years in prison for the alleged transgression. In January 2022, a Bible study session in a private home was broken up by police, and all of the Christian materials were confiscated. And in December 2021, police entered the home of a Christian pastor, demanded he stop the service, and took him to the local police station for questioning.  The form of religious persecution in Vietnam may not rise to the level of that in other countries like China, Afghanistan, and Nigeria, but religious freedom watchdog organizations report that religious freedom conditions are worsening in the Asian nation as the government continues to clamp down on different religious groups.  In particular, unregistered religious groups bear the brunt of the persecution.  USCIRF recently reported that Montagnard and Hmong Protestants, Cao Dai followers, and Hoa Hao Buddhists are among the most targeted. Harassment of Catholic communities is also on the rise.  Cuba (Caribbean)  Cuba is another country where the government took steps to restrict religious freedom.  According to USCIRF, over the past year, Cuba has worked to tightly control religious activity through increased surveillance, harassment of religious leaders and laypeople, forced exile, fines, and ill-treatment of religious prisoners of conscience.  The Cuban government has taken these steps largely through strict regulations set out by its Office of Religious Affairs and state security forces. Through these regulations, pastors, in particular, have been subjected to detention, interrogation, threats of prison, sentencing on  false charges, and confiscation of property.  For example, in February 2022, authorities detained Christian Rev. Yordanys Díaz Arteaga after an extensive search of his home and the confiscation of technology belonging to his church. He was threatened with criminal charges and effectively put under house arrest.  There were other reports of authorities detaining citizens who traveled or planned to travel to the United States in 2022, including Catholic Dagoberto Valdés and his son and Mildrey Betancourt Rodríguez, a member of the Alliance of Non-Registered Churches.  The State Department designated Cuba a “Country of Particular Concern” because of its religious freedom violations.  Nicaragua (Central America)  Last year was the first time the State Department designated Nicaragua a “Country of Particular Concern,” which USCIRF wants it to do again this year, as well as impose sanctions on the government, press for the release of religious prisoners, and exercise increased scrutiny of financial assistance.  Persecution of Catholics has increased significantly in Nicaragua since 2018 when President Daniel Ortega accused church leaders of attempting to overthrow the government when they acted as mediators after deadly protests broke out that left more than 300 people dead.  On Feb. 10, Bishop Rolando Álvarez of Matagalpa was sentenced to 26 years in prison, stripped of his citizenship, and given a large fine on charges of treason, undermining national integrity, and spreading false news.  Ortega also banned outdoor Holy Week celebrations and processions, and two women religious and a priest were recently expelled from the country.  USCIRF notes that in 2022 “the Nicaraguan government heightened its crackdown against members of the clergy,” including for the first time imprisoning clergy. The regime engaged in widespread hate speech against clergy and expelled priests or prevented them from returning.  Further, in 2022 the Nicaraguan government shut down over 3,000 nongovernmental organizations, revoked the legal status of a Catholic university, stripped funding from another learning institution, and approved a law that strengthens its control over educational outlets.  Clancy recently told The Tablet that Nicaragua is another country where Catholics are persecuted for the good they try to do.  “It’s terrible,” he said. “It’s another situation where the Church, by doing its mission of helping people and advocating for the poor and for the disenfranchised, someone on the front lines of that like Bishop Álvarez is now in prison.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhldGFibGV0Lm9yZy9yZWxpZ2lvdXMtcGVyc2VjdXRpb24tY29udGludWVzLXRvLXJpc2Utd29ybGR3aWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

These rallies called out the government of Japan for being among the world’s leading fossil fuel investors and their lacklustre stance towards phasing-out fossil fuels; promotion of fossil gas and false solutions like hydrogen and ammonia technology.Japan is the largest public fossil fuel financier, with an annual average of USD 10.6 billion towards fossil fuel projects from 2019 to 2021 according to a report . At the same time there are tensions between Japan and other G7 members over their differences on carbon emissions and phase out of fossil fuel technologies.In the recent communique from the G7 from the energy and climate ministers meeting last April affirmed their commitment to aligning with the Paris Agreement set in 2015. The ministers agreed to drastically increase solar capacity and offshore wind. However, they did not set a timeline for a gas phase-out and welcomed investments in gas subject to conditions. Technologies such as hydrogen and ammonia were also accepted as technologies that can help with the decarbonization process.  Renewables-based electricity is now the cheapest power option in most regions. According to research , renewables are already the default option for capacity additions in the power sector in almost all countries and dominate current investments. Renewables are also the most readily-available and cost-effective way to provide 90 per cent of all decarbonisation by 2050 -- that is, if currently installed renewable power capacity will be tripled by 2030.“Japan and the rest of the G7 display a blatant disregard for the pressing needs of both people and the planet, instead of meetingaa their climate finance obligations and fulfilling their commitment to end by 2022 their public financing of fossil fuels,” said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD) and Convenor of the Asian Energy Network (AEN).Saktiman Ghosh, General Secretary of the National Hawker Federation felt, “As the host for this year’s G20 Summit, India has a deep responsibility of steering this powerful body of countries towards a cleaner future. Japan should not be allowed to interfere and use the G7 to derail the world by promoting false solutions! We also reject the notion that the new Indo-Pacific strategy will be used to export fossil gas, non-renewable hydrogen and ammonia in the region. This new kind of energy colonialism does not have a place in the equitable future for Asia.””No to LNG and strongly rejecting any Finance in Fossil fuel project in Asia.

The hope and aspirations of millions in the global south are now anchored with them.

"political coup","2024-07-25","18:00:00","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T14:25:15","DeSantis plans to announce 2024 bid Wednesday on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk, sources tell AP  WASHINGTON: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as Donald Trump’s leading rival for the Republican nomination, plans to launch his 2024 presidential campaign on Wednesday in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.  DeSantis, an outspoken cultural conservative, will outline his plans in an evening audio event streamed on Twitter Spaces, according to the two people. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.  The 44-year-old two-term governor joins a crowded Republican contest to decide whether the party will move on from Trump in 2024. DeSantis has embraced Trump’s combative style and many of his policies, but casts himself as a younger and more electable version of the former president.  In choosing Twitter, DeSantis is taking a page out of the playbook that helped turn businessman-TV celebrity Trump into a political star.  The timing of DeSantis’ long-expected announcement has been shrouded, with various iterations of plans being leaked over the past few days. Some close to him suspected that he was providing conflicting information about the timing and location to root out leakers. Others believe he changed his initial preparations after news reports came out about them.  Musk, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit event in London on Tuesday, seemed to confirm the Wednesday event, saying DeSantis would be making “quite an announcement” on Twitter the next day. “The first time something like this is happening on social media,” he said, with live questions and answers. The announcement is scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT.  He added that he is not endorsing any particular candidate at this time.  Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday made a video appearance in a New York courtroom, where the judge tentatively scheduled a criminal trial for the former president for next March 25, in the heart of the primary season. Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his family company, the Trump Organization.  While it is common for campaigns to publicize their announcements in videos shared on social media, it is far more unusual — and perhaps unprecedented — to hold a campaign announcement in a live social media forum.  “Big if true...” DeSantis’ wife, Casey, posted Tuesday on Twitter, linking to a Fox News story on the announcement and adding a smiley face.  Earlier Tuesday, the Florida governor gave no hints of his 2024 plans during a short Cabinet meeting in Tallahassee where he discussed state business with agency heads. The media was barred from covering a subsequent bill signing ceremony.  DeSantis has emerged as a national star in Republican politics as an unapologetic leader on controversial issues.  The governor sent dozens of immigrants from Texas — by way of Florida — to a small island off the Massachusetts coast to draw attention to the influx of Latin American immigrants trying to cross the Southern border. He signed and then expanded a Parental Rights in Education bill — known by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — which bans instruction or classroom discussion of LGBTQ issues in Florida public schools for all grades.  More recently, he signed a law banning abortions at six weeks, which is before most women realize they’re pregnant. And he removed an elected prosecutor who vowed not to charge people under Florida’s new abortion restrictions or doctors who provide gender-affirming care.  Trump’s allies lashed out Tuesday at DeSantis’s plan.  “This is one of the most out-of-touch campaign launches in modern history. The only thing less relatable than a niche campaign launch on Twitter, is DeSantis’ after party at the uber elite Four Seasons resort in Miami,” said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s super PAC.  Trump himself frequently dismisses his rival as Ron “DeSanctimonious.”  In choosing to announce with Musk, DeSantis is linking his presidential announcement to one of the world’s richest men, who has emerged as a conservative cult hero of sorts.  Since buying Twitter last October, Musk has reinstated the accounts of prominent Republicans including Trump and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who had been removed. Popular conservative broadcasters have flocked to Twitter, with ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the podcast hosts of The Daily Wire announcing they will start streaming on the platform.  Musk himself has promoted far-right conspiracy theories on Twitter, including misleading claims questioning a Texas mall shooter’s background and a debunked rumor that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband had a relationship with an assailant who attacked him.  Earlier this month, Musk’s tweets likening billionaire philanthropist George Soros to a Jewish supervillain were met with criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which said they would embolden antisemitic extremists. Musk responded on Twitter clarifying his criticism of Soros and saying he would “be more thoughtful in the future.”  Twitter was once Trump’s most important megaphone — one he used to dominate his rivals in the 2016 primary and to command the news cycle for years. Trump was barred from the platform after Jan. 6, 2021. Though his access was reinstated shortly after Musk took over, he has yet to tweet.  About 1 in 5 US adults say they use Twitter, the Pew Research Center found last year.  Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say they have Twitter accounts, according to a Fox News poll from December. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say Musk buying Twitter was a good thing and to have a favorable view of him.

"political coup","2013-07-26","14:00:00","{""SanPedroSula"", ""Cortes"", ""Honduras""}","2023-05-22T19:00:00","Inside a little wooden house among the pine and oak forests of western Honduras’ coffee-growing mountains, a woman opened a tiny package of pills, delivered to a nearby town. She didn’t know it, but the medication had more than likely entered the country hidden in an activist’s suitcase, from Mexico.  The woman, 27, was confident in her decision to have an abortion, but in the moment, she panicked. She knew she was breaking national law banning all abortions and could be prosecuted. Even more, she feared medical complications, or her religious family finding out.  Days earlier, an anonymous guide had asked her for an ultrasound; she sent it via encrypted message. Now, in her one-room house, empty and quiet except for the pings of her cellphone with messages from the guide and her closest friend, she studied the instructions on how to take the pills – first the mifepristone, later the misoprostol.  She was ready. She swallowed the first pill.  READ MORE: The U.S. abortion rights movement is battered. What can it learn from Latin America's?  In remote mountain villages, urban neighborhoods, along the Caribbean coast – despite the national ban against abortions under all circumstances and amid suffocating social and religious opposition, women are terminating pregnancies across Honduras with the help of clandestine networks seeking to make the procedure as safe as possible.  Activists in the networks use code words, aliases, encrypted messages, burner phones. Most don’t know one another, or any specifics beyond their role in the chain that ultimately provides information and the abortion pills endorsed by the World Health Organization and used safely and legally in dozens of other countries around the globe.  Honduras has one of the world’s strictest abortion bans, with a constitutional prohibition on terminating pregnancy in all cases, even rape. Neighboring El Salvador and Nicaragua have similar total bans. Until March, Honduras was the only country in the region that also banned emergency contraception, the so-called morning-after pill.  Some Latin American countries — Argentina, Colombia, Mexico — are widening access to abortion while manyU.S.states are restricting it. Honduras doesn’t enforce its ban as strictly as its neighbors, but the possible punishment of up to six years in prison is a constant threat. Advocacy groups say they believe no Honduran women are currently imprisoned on abortion-related charges, but national data are incomplete.  The Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, estimates that more than 50,000 abortions occur in Honduras annually. It’s unclear how many are medication abortions — in the U.S., they account for over half of all procedures and complications are rare.  Advocates say forcing abortions to take place in secret inherently creates more risk, though that’s mitigated when women are provided proper instructions. That’s why guides of the networks in Honduras say they’re dedicated to helping as many people as possible.  The Associated Press traveled throughout Honduras, interviewed more than a dozen women who have given or received help through activist networks, and documented places where abortions take place amid the ban and societal shame: from rickety bathrooms in crowded houses and sites surrounded by violence and poverty, to comfortable homes and even the occasional hotel.  All the women who had abortions or helped those who did spoke on condition of anonymity over fears they’d be reported or prosecuted. They also worry they’ll be stigmatized or shamed, sometimes by those closest to them, because of social pressures and the enormous influence of the Catholic and Protestant churches. Many of these women are vocal activists on other issues – the environment, land rights, social matters – but they feel most afraid of speaking out on abortion. The women also insisted that details of the locations they shared be withheld.  “If something breaks, it blows up the network,” said an activist who has been accompanying women getting abortions for 12 years.  To reconstruct how the secretive networks operate, AP drove highways and dirt roads in crowded neighborhoods and indigenous villages, from export-focused assembly-plant regions to banana plantations.  Activists learn tricks of the trade little by little. “Now there is less naiveté and more technology, virtual phone numbers, disappearing messages,” said the activist with 12 years of experience.  Allied organizations inside and outside Honduras help them; activists won’t name them, to avoid legal issues.  Some women seeking abortions call a hotline publicized on the internet as “La Línea.” They’re asked questions to try to confirm the request is real and not an attempt to track down activists. Later, calls are triangulated; sometimes phone chips are switched to avoid identifying numbers.  Other women learn about the networks via hushed word of mouth. Either way, women seeking abortion help are ultimately put in touch with the person who will be her guide, introduced via pseudonym.  The guide asks basic health questions, including how far along the pregnancy is, and requests that an ultrasound be sent through a secure application. Then the challenge is obtaining the pills – never referred to as medication abortions, or with their pharmaceutical names, but as ordinary objects, code names that change from group to group.  Misoprostol is sold in Honduras under prescription; it’s used for gastrointestinal issues and in hospitals for miscarriages. It can be bought on the black market, but activists warn of misinformation about use. Mifepristone isn’t sold at all in Honduras. The networks often sneak both drugs in from Mexico.  Sometimes activists buy them; sometimes they’re donated from aid groups. Guides ask for contributions from women who can afford it, about $50 to $60.  Activists take advantage of every trip across the border, hiding the pills in suitcases. Then, packages pass carefully from hand to hand, delivered by taxi or via “drops” with a detailed time, place and description of the contact.  Once a woman has the pills in hand, the guide suggests finding a private place, away from prying eyes. When she’s ready to take the medication, the woman is advised to have her cellphone near to ask any questions about bleeding or pain and to let the guide monitor the process through a safe app.  Some women have the support of partners or can afford to escape to a hotel. Others find a private spot in houses with large families or ask for a friend’s sofa.  For those with nowhere to go, some groups offer a safehouse in the capital, Tegucigalpa, a city spread over the hills. The grand historic basilica Our Lady of Suyapa stands on one of them. On the steps leading up to church sits a small statue called the Virgin of Life, inaugurated on Christmas Eve 2013 “in memory of unborn babies,” according to its plaque.  _____  In a country of 10 million people, sometimes there are surprises.  A young lawyer discovered that her own mother was part of a network when she sought help to get an abortion. She first asked her mother’s friend. Her sister eventually encouraged her to approach her mother directly. When she did, her mother assured her there was a solution.  Her mom already was in possession of the pills, as part of her role in the network. Lying on a bed at her sister’s apartment in the capital, the woman felt her mother massage her feet to ease pain from the drugs.  Normally, the networks try to avoid having a guide help a relative or friend. But the experience of having an abortion often motivates those involved to help others. The young lawyer later offered her living room to a friend; her own husband didn’t know what was happening on the sofa next door.  Other women are conflicted, and their positions on abortion change.  In a small community of unpaved streets in northern Honduras, a woman who ended her pregnancy years ago recently refused to help her daughter get an abortion. She said the girl hadn’t been careful with contraception and must deal with the consequences.  “Once the baby is born, she can always give it away if she cannot afford to take care of the child,” the mother told AP. “But you can lose your life in an abortion.”  She feared for her own life during her abortion, nearly four months into the pregnancy. She said a married man impregnated her and she wanted to take the pills earlier, but it took longer than expected to get them. Now, she said, she supports abortion only in cases of rape or danger to the health of the mother or fetus.  For teens in this largely religious country, pregnancy and reproductive rights pose a particular issue. Honduras has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Latin America, more than double the world average, according to the U.N. Population Fund.  That’s why some activists have specialized in accompanying girls for abortions. The minors, some just 12, are usually with their mothers or grandmothers — who often need more comfort than the girls, the experienced guide said: “The older people, we get more scared.”  Guides say they stay glued to their phones for more comprehensive tracking with girls. Minors also undergo more follow-up — including reproductive health tips.  The hardest part, the guide said, “is when I have to give contraceptive counseling, because it’s like telling them that it can happen again.”  On a March day, two lines of women waited in the gynecological emergency corridor of the country’s main public health center, Hospital Escuela. Some were teenagers with fear on their faces.  Dr. Zyanya Cruz consulted with a patient. It was 2 p.m. on a Monday, and eight women whose pregnancies ended had already been seen, two of them minors.  “We don’t inquire about what happened, whether it was induced or not,” the gynecologist said. “We only evaluate and do an ultrasound.”  Problems emerge when pills are found in the vagina, or there are incomplete abortions of women in advanced gestation. That’s clear evidence of an abortion, and doctors are obligated by law to report it to authorities.  ___  Honduras’ total abortion ban dates to 1985. Previously, abortion was permitted in three instances: rape, risk to the mother or nonviability of the fetus.  After the 2009 coup d’état that removed then-President Manuel Zelaya, husband of current President Xiomara Castro, the emergency contraceptive pill was banned. It marked the start of several administrations linked to ultraconservative churches.  In 2021, an amendment to add the abortion ban directly to the constitution was adopted. The measure also increased the number of lawmakers needed to change that part of the constitution. It cannot be “repealed or modified” by other legal provisions, according to the text.  The constitutional protection is unique in Latin America, according to the International Center for Reproductive Rights. It was appealed twice to the Supreme Court and upheld.  Castro is Honduras’ first female president. She’s more liberal than predecessors and has integrated well-known feminists into her government. After 14 months in power, on March 8, she ended the ban on the emergency contraceptive pill — just as thousands of women were demanding more rights in demonstrations nationwide.  She pledged to legalize abortion again in the three instances previously allowed. But her administration doesn’t have a majority in the legislature, and persistent issues with gang violence and organized crime have diverted much of her attention.  The Honduras Gynecologists Association says the current legislation is inconsistent with science and leaves doctors vulnerable to accusations of violating the constitution every time they save a woman’s life.  At Hospital Escuela, Cruz said she recognizes that some health professionals report women to avoid legal problems, but others do so because of religious convictions. Some quietly perform abortions at secretive clinics for those who can pay several hundred dollars.  The Public Prosecutor’s Office did not answer AP’s request for abortion data. But according to the activist group Somos Muchas, six women were convicted for abortions from 2012 to 2018, the most recent period for which it has figures, and none is in prison. The Center for Reproductive Rights says there may be more but cites the lack of data.  There are criminal consequences outside prison. Some women may be banned from leaving the country or may be unable to obtain the criminal record clearance needed for most employment.  In 2015, raids of clinics resulted in the arrest of several health professionals. More recently, some activists say they received intimidating and threatening messages, sent anonymously to their phones and generally coinciding with political instability. They also say some women have fled the country over harassment and legal complaints.  Other women temporarily disappear from their communities and families while seeking a safe place to have an abortion. Or they land in a private clinic if there’s an infection.  A social worker who lives in a violent neighborhood of San Pedro Sula, the country’s economic capital, told AP she learned the hard way that the networks aren’t infallible.  When a friend fainted and was bleeding heavily after taking the pills, she was gripped with worry — the guide who was supposed to be on the other end of the phone wasn’t answering. The social worker found information on the internet and was able to control the situation and help her friend. The episode motivated her to join natural medicine and Indigenous groups to learn about using plants for abortions.  It’s a practice used quietly in some remote communities – taking herbs, often in the form of teas, to try to end early pregnancies. But it uses plants that can be toxic in the wrong doses, and some organizations consider it an unsafe method. It’s not widely accepted in medical and activist communities.  “Here nobody can know,” a woman who provides the teas told AP. “It’s very dangerous.”  The woman, in her 50s, learned from experienced midwives when unwanted pregnancies among young women increased in her mountain community.  “We’re not going to leave them that way, especially the girls who are not ready,” the woman said. For her, it’s her duty to help, especially young girls and teenagers. She simply doesn’t understand villagers who say an abortion “is worse than killing an adult.”  ____  For the 27-year-old who took the pills in her home in the mountains, Honduras’ clandestine networks helped her successfully terminate her pregnancy. Per the activists’ protocol, the guide advised her to have a post-abortion ultrasound.  Like most women, she went to a private clinic far from home. She felt much more relaxed than she did in her first ultrasound, and she was glad to get a healthy report.  Knowing her body was safe, she focused on saving money. She’d been unable to pay for the pills at the time, and she wanted to make up for that. She knew it was the only way for the guides to keep working.  But the secrecy of the networks prevailed.  The woman had no way to send a payment or find the person who’d helped her. Her guide never answered the phone again.  ___  Journalist Iolany Pérez in El Progreso, Honduras, contributed to this report.

"political coup","2021-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T07:55:23","Will Sudan crisis trigger a fresh wave of migrants and refugees out of Africa?  JUBA, South Sudan: Thousands of civilians in towns and villages across Sudan have been forced to flee in recent weeks to escape the worsening conflict in the country, which has entered its second bloody month, leading to fears of a new global refugee crisis.  Initial clashes between former allies the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces have escalated into heavy combat, displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded, and disruptions to basic utilities and shortages of medical supplies have forced medical staff to turn away even the critically ill.  Meanwhile, shortages of food, fuel, electricity and clean water, coupled with economic collapse and the breakdown of law and order, have forced entire communities to pack up and leave in search of security and relief.  Passengers fleeing war-torn Sudan cross into Egypt through the Argeen Land Port on May 12, 2023. (AFP)  In the first four weeks of the crisis, around 200,000 people fled Sudan while another 700,000 were displaced inside the country. As many as 860,000 refugees and returnees are expected by the UN refugee agency UNHCR to flee by October, raising fears among European policymakers of a new influx of migrants who risk the perilous journey north to their shores.  Europe was forced to confront the issue of mass migration in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa, the Middle East and Asia began arriving from across the Mediterranean.  More recently, the continent has absorbed millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, which has placed additional strain on a continent already grappling with high energy prices as a result of gas shortages.  However, few experts predict Europe will see anything close to the same number of migrants as a result of the crisis in Sudan. Instead, most expect the majority to be displaced internally or settle in neighboring African states.  “Some of the refugees will try to go to Europe, but I don’t see that there will be mass migration going to Europe right now,” Namira Negm, director of the African Migration Observatory in Morocco, told Arab News.  “It will increase but it will not be mass migration. Migration to neighboring countries needs to be addressed first.”  IN NUMBERS 116,995 First-time asylum seekers from Sudan in EU+ area during 2015 peak.  860,000+ Refugees and returnees expected to flee Sudan by Oct. (UNHCR).  $445m Funding required to support the displaced until Oct. 2023 (UNHCR).  Nevertheless, many in Europe remain fearful that any fresh influx will place additional strains on the resources of host nations, and trigger a surge in anti-immigrant sentiments and support for right-wing populist movements.  In response to previous waves of migration several European nations adopted draconian immigration policies, making it more difficult for new arrivals to obtain asylum and the right to remain. Those who still try to reach Europe face dangerous journeys, including sea voyages in often flimsy and overloaded vessels.  “Reaching Europe would require navigating treacherous and expensive migration routes, often involving perilous sea crossings and facing the risk of exploitation and abuse by human traffickers,” Franck Duvell, a senior researcher at Universitat Osnabruck in Germany, told Arab News.  “Numbers might go up a little, but I don’t see these networks and routes now. Traveling to western Libya has become dangerous and is getting more and more difficult, and therefore (an) increasing number of people actually continue their journey to Tunisia.  “I don’t see Sudanese traveling all the way to Tunisia. It’s simply too far, it’s too expensive, it’s too dangerous … Even if numbers are increasing, the total numbers will still be relatively small.”  Migrant numbers were already on the rise prior to the start of the conflict last month. More than 36,000 people arrived from Sudan in Europe’s Mediterranean region between January and March, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest UNHCR figures.  Sudan has been caught in a cycle of violent coups and countercoups for years. The latest, in October 2021, resulted in a transitional, civilian-led government being overthrown by a military junta led by the two factions now fighting each other.  Since the start of a shaky political transition in 2019, after long-time autocratic ruler Omar Al-Bashir was ousted, Sudan has been plagued by political and economic instability, prompting many citizens to seek sanctuary outside the country.  According to the EU’s European Asylum Support Office, Sudanese nationals represented the fifth-largest group of applicants for international protection in the EU in 2020, with more than 34,000 new applications. This was a significant increase on the previous year, when there were about 18,000 new applications.  An economic crisis, including high inflation, devaluation of the national currency and shortages of basic goods, had already caused poverty and unemployment to increase in Sudan prior to the latest conflict, which began on April 15.  And it is not only the Sudanese people themselves who face displacement. Before the fighting began, Sudan hosted more than a million refugees, 300,000 of them in the capital Khartoum, who had fled South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of them are now returning home or looking for refuge elsewhere in the region or further afield.  Refugees from Sudan who crossed into Ethiopia rest in Metema, on May 5, 2023. (AFP)  If the crisis in Sudan becomes long drawn out, akin to the Syrian civil war, the possibility of large number of Sudanese refugees seeking safety in Europe cannot be ruled out.  “A protracted conflict could create unwanted uncertainties,” Thirsa de Vries, a Sudan expert at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told Arab News.  “This is why it is also important that the international community (engages with) the different actors that might be involved, or works with neighboring countries to close corridors for weapons smuggling.”  The possibility of a large number of Sudanese refugees attempting to reach Europe also highlights the importance of cooperation between nations in managing migration flows.  Abdullahi Hassan, a researcher at human rights organization Amnesty International who specializes in Sudan, stressed the importance of ensuring the security and stability of host and origin countries.  “With adequate planning and resources, it is possible to provide safe and orderly routes for those seeking refuge,” he told Arab News.  He said the response to the crisis in Sudan should not solely focus on migration and added: “It must instead prioritize the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid.  “The EU and its member states should use their influence, both in the region and in Sudan, to ensure that they are directly engaging with the parties to the conflict to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, encourage immediate and unrestricted access for humanitarian actors, and pressure the Sudanese authorities to allow safe exit passages for people trying to flee the conflict.”  As the fighting continues to rage, the warring Sudanese factions have held talks in Saudi Arabia to discuss a ceasefire but made it clear they would not negotiate an end to the conflict.  Despite the challenges posed by the violence, humanitarian organizations are working to provide aid to those affected by the Sudan crisis. But attacks on aid workers and the looting of relief supplies have made it increasingly difficult for agencies to deliver help to needy communities, which could in turn affect the response of donor countries.  A view shows black smoke and fire at Omdurman market in Omdurman, Sudan, May 17, 2023. (Screengrab/Reuters)  Some organizations “have evacuated international staff, particularly those that were in the most affected areas,” UNHCR spokesperson Faith Kasina, told Arab News, who highlighted the risks and limitations of aid provision during armed conflicts.  The UN’s Children’s Fund, UNICEF, reported on May 5 that at least 190 children have been killed and 1,700 injured since the fighting began in Sudan. While a tentative ceasefire allowed foreign nations to evacuate their citizens from the country in the past few weeks, Sudanese nationals continue to endure great hardships.  Several media outlets, including the BBC, the Washington Post and Al-Jazeera, have interviewed Sudanese citizens who said their passports were locked inside foreign embassies, leaving them trapped in their own country.  Hassan, the Amnesty International researcher, said foreign nations must provide safe evacuation procedures, and that the warring factions must “stop attacking humanitarian aid workers.”  But he added that instances of attacks on workers and the looting of aid supplies “should not be an excuse to withdraw funding.”  “The response to the crisis in Sudan is completely different from the response, for example, Ukraine received when the conflict started in that country,” said Hassan.  “European countries should, nevertheless, provide safe and regular pathways to Europe for those seeking international protection … It is the responsibility of the EU and member states to ensure that such pathways are made available.”  However, public sentiment in Europe appears to be overwhelmingly hostile to refugees. Both Italy and the UK have faced recent criticism for their strict immigration policies, which aid agencies warn could drive more refugees into the arms of smuggling gangs.  In mid-April, Italy passed legislation to curb undocumented migration, including tougher sentences for those convicted of human trafficking and terminating residency permits for migrants who face humanitarian risks.  This drew criticism from search-and-rescue organizations, who warned it would lead to more deaths at sea in the Mediterranean as migrants seek illegal routes to Europe.  The British government has been accused of racial discrimination in its refugee policy. Immigration experts point out that although hundreds of thousands of visas were provided for Ukrainian refugees, there is no plan, or safe route, to help those fleeing violence in Sudan.  Ultimately, the best way to avoid migrant crises is by helping ensure that all countries in Africa are able to offer their citizens a decent quality of life.  “The root cause is lack of development; people lose hope in their country and end up migrating to other countries,” African Migration Observatory Director Negm said regarding the importance of stability in Africa.  “If they have a good life in their own home countries, they will not think of going somewhere else.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc4OTYvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3ODk2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2023-05-17","18:00:00","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:49:00","DeSantis plans to announce 2024 bid Wednesday on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk, sources tell AP  WASHINGTON: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as Donald Trump’s leading rival for the Republican nomination, plans to launch his 2024 presidential campaign on Wednesday in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.  DeSantis, an outspoken cultural conservative, will outline his plans in an evening audio event streamed on Twitter Spaces, according to the two people. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.  The 44-year-old two-term governor joins a crowded Republican contest to decide whether the party will move on from Trump in 2024. DeSantis has embraced Trump’s combative style and many of his policies, but casts himself as a younger and more electable version of the former president.  In choosing Twitter, DeSantis is taking a page out of the playbook that helped turn businessman-TV celebrity Trump into a political star.  The timing of DeSantis’ long-expected announcement has been shrouded, with various iterations of plans being leaked over the past few days. Some close to him suspected that he was providing conflicting information about the timing and location to root out leakers. Others believe he changed his initial preparations after news reports came out about them.  Musk, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit event in London on Tuesday, seemed to confirm the Wednesday event, saying DeSantis would be making “quite an announcement” on Twitter the next day. “The first time something like this is happening on social media,” he said, with live questions and answers. The announcement is scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT.  He added that he is not endorsing any particular candidate at this time.  Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday made a video appearance in a New York courtroom, where the judge tentatively scheduled a criminal trial for the former president for next March 25, in the heart of the primary season. Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his family company, the Trump Organization.  While it is common for campaigns to publicize their announcements in videos shared on social media, it is far more unusual — and perhaps unprecedented — to hold a campaign announcement in a live social media forum.  “Big if true...” DeSantis’ wife, Casey, posted Tuesday on Twitter, linking to a Fox News story on the announcement and adding a smiley face.  Earlier Tuesday, the Florida governor gave no hints of his 2024 plans during a short Cabinet meeting in Tallahassee where he discussed state business with agency heads. The media was barred from covering a subsequent bill signing ceremony.  DeSantis has emerged as a national star in Republican politics as an unapologetic leader on controversial issues.  The governor sent dozens of immigrants from Texas — by way of Florida — to a small island off the Massachusetts coast to draw attention to the influx of Latin American immigrants trying to cross the Southern border. He signed and then expanded a Parental Rights in Education bill — known by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — which bans instruction or classroom discussion of LGBTQ issues in Florida public schools for all grades.  More recently, he signed a law banning abortions at six weeks, which is before most women realize they’re pregnant. And he removed an elected prosecutor who vowed not to charge people under Florida’s new abortion restrictions or doctors who provide gender-affirming care.  Trump’s allies lashed out Tuesday at DeSantis’s plan.  “This is one of the most out-of-touch campaign launches in modern history. The only thing less relatable than a niche campaign launch on Twitter, is DeSantis’ after party at the uber elite Four Seasons resort in Miami,” said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s super PAC.  Trump himself frequently dismisses his rival as Ron “DeSanctimonious.”  In choosing to announce with Musk, DeSantis is linking his presidential announcement to one of the world’s richest men, who has emerged as a conservative cult hero of sorts.  Since buying Twitter last October, Musk has reinstated the accounts of prominent Republicans including Trump and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who had been removed. Popular conservative broadcasters have flocked to Twitter, with ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the podcast hosts of The Daily Wire announcing they will start streaming on the platform.  Musk himself has promoted far-right conspiracy theories on Twitter, including misleading claims questioning a Texas mall shooter’s background and a debunked rumor that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband had a relationship with an assailant who attacked him.  Earlier this month, Musk’s tweets likening billionaire philanthropist George Soros to a Jewish supervillain were met with criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which said they would embolden antisemitic extremists. Musk responded on Twitter clarifying his criticism of Soros and saying he would “be more thoughtful in the future.”  Twitter was once Trump’s most important megaphone — one he used to dominate his rivals in the 2016 primary and to command the news cycle for years. Trump was barred from the platform after Jan. 6, 2021. Though his access was reinstated shortly after Musk took over, he has yet to tweet.  About 1 in 5 US adults say they use Twitter, the Pew Research Center found last year.  Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say they have Twitter accounts, according to a Fox News poll from December. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say Musk buying Twitter was a good thing and to have a favorable view of him.

"political coup","2009-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Lagos"", ""Lagos"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-22T15:12:00","His bonhomie was unusually absent that night in 2009. He spoke little, his luminous eyes mostly staring at us intensely with an expression difficult to fathom. The “Governor of Example” (BRF) and this writer ended up being the last to leave the putative den of the “Lion of Bourdillon” in Lagos at past midnight.  Not until we were outside at the car park of our host’s Ikoyi home (sufficiently beyond his earshot), did the then Governor Babatunde Fashola (the one who had been Jagaban’s Chief of Staff for five years) share his observation: “Louis, I can tell Asiwaju is very, very depressed tonight”.  Drawing on an intimacy earned from working very closely with Asiwaju, BRF’s diagnosis could hardly be faulted. Lately, the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) had suffered a series of reversals in courtrooms in Osun, Ekiti, and Edo in pursuit of mandates “stolen” in the 2007 governorship polls in what had become multiple convoluted legal tussles.  Having immersed himself as the chief inspiration and sole financier of the legal kerfuffle unfolding simultaneously on multiple fronts, Asiwaju was thus the one who often bore the burden more. So absorbed, so invested was he in those difficult moments that one could, in fact, be pardoned to imagine that even in his sleep, Jagaban probably still found himself mixing it up with the adversaries he earlier contended with all his waking moment. In the same vein heavyweight boxing champion Joe “Smoking Joe” Frazier once admitted he sometimes found himself in dreams engaged in ferocious fistic combat with eternal rival Mohammed Ali, only to wake in the middle of the night covered in hot sweat.  Advertisement  Such was the exacting climate under which “stolen mandates” were recovered in Ondo, Edo, Ekiti, and Osun after epic battles championed by Tinubu, the man young Nigerians (the millennials and Gen Z) do not seem to know or have been misled to hate and deny credits as arguably the biggest champion of multi-party democracy in the Fourth Republic.  The instinctive warrior is never shy to insert himself in a battle for others, but often with eyes on the greater prize not easily perceived by the shortsighted.  The one who curbed Obasanjo’s imperial aspirations and excesses, particularly in Yorubaland, and who, from 2003, began to stitch, one thread after another fragile thread, what would blossom into the historic coalition that sensationally unhorsed a ruling party at the centre in 2015.  Advertisement  To be sure, the man from Lagos is no saint. True saints would only be found in heaven. However, there is something extraordinary about Jagaban. His agglomeration of laser focus, daring, Trojan stamina, improvisation, organisational acumen, and mental acuity is surely never seen in any other politician in all of Nigeria’s recent history. It speaks to a forbearing virtue or what the Yoruba call “aforiti” central to “iwa” (good character) which partly defines the Omoluabi ethos often invoked to describe the Yoruba identity and epistemology.  An integral part of “iwa” is, of course, loyalty to friends or values subscribed by the community. Jagaban is a study of loyalty. He expects no less from those for whom he is prepared to take a bullet. (Ask President Buhari or Baba Akande.) In exile, he taxed himself to fund Radio Kudirat set up in the UK to battle the military dictatorship in Nigeria. As well as provide for fellow exiles pushing for June 12 while its symbol, MKO, was languishing in Abacha’s gulag in Abuja.  “Revolutionary” Tony Nyiam (of the April 1990 coup fame) once told this writer how regular stipends from Tinubu helped alleviate the adversities of exile for him and a number of other June 12 activists. Of course, he gave from the proceeds realised from either property he sold discreetly back at home or returns from his chain of gas stations in the US being managed by his wife, Senator Remi.  Ever so inventive, he mooted the idea of using the name of the Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, as collateral in Thailand for shipments of rice on credit to be sold clandestinely in West Africa to fund the NADECO struggle.  Advertisement  Greater is even the loyalty shown by assisting the dependants when their breadwinner was no more or in a position to repay. In death, no one has stood by MKO’s family more than Tinubu. As Lagos governor, he instituted a special monthly welfare package for some members of his family, a scheme still sustained by the state government to date.  When told about the precarious financial position of Concord Press (owned by MKO) in 1999, he made a generous offer to buy the company’s idle giant power generator on behalf of the Lagos State Water Board. The money offered would have been sufficient to offset the long arrears of salaries owed Concord workers and re-finance its operations. But just before the deal could be consummated came a caveat emptor in a national newspaper placed by one of MKO’s children. It did not take long before Concord Press, the asset most dear to Bashorun, finally went under.  The virtue of “aforiti”, it bears restating, is not a province for those given to instant gratification. Nor for those who switch political loyalties for electoral convenience or casually break oaths for any accommodation, however transient. Rather, it is a mantra for the committed marathoner, for the patient sower who plants in faith, hoping for a boom with the same zeal they are prepared for bust. The pot truly seeking the honey in pepper must endure the ravages of fire.  Such resourcefulness was very much evident in the way and manner Osun was recovered in 2010. In 2007, the electoral bandits stole too much for the owner not to notice. But it would require an exceptionally ingenious application of forensic testing of the ballots by Englishman Adrian Forty to establish what everyone had suspected: ballot stuffing on a mindless scale. All thanks to Tinubu.  Advertisement  The same wizardry came in handy in unearthing the illicit exchange of text messages between the presiding judge and the defense counsels to confirm the offer and receipt of dirty cash, thus extending the frontiers of Nigeria’s jurisprudence in general and criminal investigation in particular.  Finally sensing his fall from power, the story is told that the embattled infantry general, who had exercised a stolen mandate for almost three years, now pleaded, “Bola, fimi sile o! Awon lawyers ti gba gbogbo owo mi tan!” (Bola, leave me alone! Lawyers have emptied my pockets!) shortly afterwards when he and Jagaban met at an Owambe.  Advertisement  Elsewhere in Ondo, forensic examination of ballots revealed even more comical details. Among those listed to have voted PDP’s Olusegun Agagu was one-time “baddest man on the planet”, Mike Tyson, widely known to be domiciled in far away US. So pervasive, so audacious were the forgeries that famous poet/journalist Sam Omatseye, otherwise registered and permanently based hundreds of miles away in Lagos, was also implicated to be among those who voted Agagu in Akure!  Indeed, a few days away, Tinubu will be crowned the 16th leader of the most populous black nation on earth. How fitting that he is ascending the golden throne his mentor, MKO, was denied. Suddenly, his trademark cap with distinctive embroidered broken shackle, perhaps the worst contraband to be caught with in Abuja between 2015 and 2022, has turned into the hottest fashion item craved by new fortune-seekers.  Advertisement  But a quarter century ago, his dream was no more than a chance to return to the senate after Abacha died in 1998. A meeting in Lagos altered that trajectory. On arriving at Murtala Mohammed Airport in Lagos after five harrowing years of exile in the U.S/UK, his first stop in his green Mercedes was Concord Press premises (less than a mile away) to reunite with his old “co-conspirators” in the June 12 struggle, Messrs. Dele Alake, Segun Babatope and Tunji Bello (editor of National Concord, editorial board chairman and editor of Sunday Concord respectively).  After bouts of long, fraternal bear-hugs with old comrades amid bitter-sweet reminiscences on the darkness that had pervaded Nigeria in the preceding five years, the returnee hinted a plan to return to the senate where he was chairman of the Appropriations Committee until Abacha’s coup of November 17, 1993.  Advertisement  “Why not contest the Lagos governorship instead?” Bello interjected. Alake and Babatope shared that view, perceiving a vacancy in Lagos’ emerging politics after Abacha.  “Well, to be honest, that has not crossed my mind,” he replied and before leaving Concord that day, promised to reach out to his base and consult widely.  The vacuum the Concord editors were seeing was in the abdication by the “Prince of Hope” (Ademola Adeniji-Adele). Upon his release from military detention in 1996, the erstwhile chairman of Lagos Island council had received a tumultuous welcome in Lagos, thus becoming the new darling of the progressive community, having played a pivotal role in June 12 protests in 1994. And when Abacha announced a transition programme, many began to see him as the next governor.  But in a moment of grave indiscretion, Adeniji-Adele would allow himself to be lured into moving the motion for Abacha’s adoption as GDM’s “consensus presidential candidate” at the party’s national convention in Maiduguri in April 1998, at the expense of the revered and consequential Dikko Yusuf. Just like other teleguided parties memorably characterised as “the five fingers of a leprous hand” by Bola Ige.  Confronted by Segun Adeniyi and this writer in an interview we conducted for Sunday Concord shortly afterward, Adeniji-Adele told us in confidence that he had been directly threatened by a notorious army Major close to Abacha, listing that as a pre-condition for him to contest the coming elections. In his own calculation, he did not consider that a significant price to pay “if only to reclaim Lagos and use it to defend Abiola’s interest”.  But the jealous Lagos progressives never forgave that betrayal. It took Abacha’s death two months later for Adeniji-Adele’s political stock to crash from the zenith of fame into the valley of infamy. The revanchist spirit that generally gripped the land thereafter meant that anyone associated with Abacha instantly turned a leper. The heartbroken progressives in Lagos were now looking for a new bride.  That was the moment Tinubu arrived. So, he could not be said to have forced his way into the Lagos governorship in 1998. Rather, unique circumstances of the moment anointed him for the historic journey ahead. His first acid test soon came over alleged discrepancies in the form submitted to INEC.  A lesser mortal would probably have buckled in the heat of the vicious smear campaign that ensued. But sometimes, the truth is not so straightforward. In the rush to submit the nomination form for Lagos governorship in 1998, Tokunbo Afikunyomi, a fellow NADECO returnee, did the filling. In some regards, he mixed up some information.  Unfortunately, once the form got submitted, all the depositions therein became binding. To claim otherwise elsewhere is perjury. Out of malice, political opponents twist this to mean he told lies about his past. It is one of the burdens Jagaban has had to bear ever since.  As an editor of a national newspaper with more than a casual knowledge of what transpired at the time, I can attest to another exaggeration in Tinubu’s much-trumpeted drug story. Ahead of the 2003 polls, someone with deep connections in the national security establishment was interested in AD’s governorship ticket in Lagos. Apparently privy to the original court papers, he twisted the story to present Tinubu as the villain and was looking for any newspaper to publish the story dangling a blank cheque, with a view to tainting him ahead of the AD primaries.  Once he found a platform and the contrived story was uploaded, conspiratorial Obasanjo jubilated thinking he finally got Tinubu in the bag. Malicious mischief was barely concealed in a confidential memo immediately dispatched to the United States by the Inspector General of Police Tafa Balogun, earnestly seeking clarity on the rather “disturbing story about Tinubu’s drug trafficking in the U.S. in the past”.  Responding swiftly in no unmistakable language in a public statement, the State Department declared Tinubu was not involved in any drug trafficking nor convicted for any drug crime.  In all the wild goose chase, the real substance of the story was not more than the fact that someone abused Tinubu’s trust. Being naturally a magnet for people, his Chicago residence was open to all folks from Nigeria in the 80s. It turned out that one of those who had been allowed access got entangled in a drug mess, warranting US investigators to list him as a person of interest and his bank accounts frozen in the interim. But after months of forensic investigation, they found nothing against him, except the “offense” that due tax was not paid on some cash found as a fixed deposit, for which a surcharge was imposed.  This essentially is the actual meat of what would be misappropriated to feed the apocryphal tale about “Tinubu’s massive drug involvement in the U.S.”, now grown into a cottage industry in the past two decades, spawning a vast army of media experts and procured pundits surfacing in every election season, elaborately theorising a petty lie.  When it was time to share the spoils of APC’s victory in 2015, it is common knowledge that Tinubu was virtually left empty-handed, without being able to nominate anyone of consequence in Buhari’s first cabinet. Party leaders he earlier helped install also forsook him. The new one he was allowed to nominate on the eve of the 2019 polls was again defenestrated soon after victory was secured. Such serial heartbreaks would certainly leave a lesser mortal broken.  But again, Tinubu’s “aforiti” shone forth.  Perhaps the unkindest cut of all is the betrayal of close disciples who had climbed on his back to power and glory. Like the biblical Apostle Peter who forsook his master three consecutive cock-crows before dawn, thrice many had denied Tinubu too. First, immediately they got appointed in Abuja in 2015. Next was 2019 after APC got re-elected. And later on the road to APC presidential primaries of June 2022 when they reckoned Jagaban was not the anointed of the “Villa cabal”.  Still, the man kept the faith.  Upon being declared winner of the February 25 polls by INEC, wherever he went or whomsoever of consequence he met, Jagaban formed the habit of flaunting his certificate of return as “my own World Cup”. But on account of his tortuous and thorny odyssey to Aso Rock in the past twenty-five years, that may as well pass for a testament in tenacity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhYmxlLm5nL3RpbnVidS10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtYWZvcml0adIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ron DeSantis, long seen as Donald Trump’s leading rival for the Republican nomination, plans to launch his 2024 presidential campaign on Wednesday in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.  DeSantis, an outspoken cultural conservative, will outline his plans in an evening audio event streamed on Twitter Spaces, according to the two people. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.  The 44-year-old two-term governor joins a crowded Republican contest to decide whether the party will move on from Trump in 2024. DeSantis has embraced Trump’s combative style and many of his policies, but casts himself as a younger and more electable version of the former president.  In choosing Twitter, DeSantis is taking a page out of the playbook that helped turn businessman-TV celebrity Trump into a political star.  The timing of DeSantis’ long-expected announcement has been shrouded, with various iterations of plans being leaked over the past few days. Some close to him suspected that he was providing conflicting information about the timing and location to root out leakers. Others believe he changed his initial preparations after news reports came out about them.  Musk, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit event in London on Tuesday, seemed to confirm the Wednesday event, saying DeSantis would be making “quite an announcement” on Twitter the next day. “The first time something like this is happening on social media,” he said, with live questions and answers. The announcement is scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT.  He added that he is not endorsing any particular candidate at this time.  Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday made a video appearance in a New York courtroom, where the judge tentatively scheduled a criminal trial for the former president for next March 25, in the heart of the primary season. Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his family company, the Trump Organization.  While it is common for campaigns to publicize their announcements in videos shared on social media, it is far more unusual — and perhaps unprecedented — to hold a campaign announcement in a live social media forum.  “Big if true...” DeSantis’ wife, Casey, posted Tuesday on Twitter, linking to a Fox News story on the announcement and adding a smiley face.  Earlier Tuesday, the Florida governor gave no hints of his 2024 plans during a short Cabinet meeting in Tallahassee where he discussed state business with agency heads. The media was barred from covering a subsequent bill signing ceremony.  DeSantis has emerged as a national star in Republican politics as an unapologetic leader on controversial issues.  The governor sent dozens of immigrants from Texas — by way of Florida — to a small island off the Massachusetts coast to draw attention to the influx of Latin American immigrants trying to cross the Southern border. He signed and then expanded a Parental Rights in Education bill — known by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — which bans instruction or classroom discussion of LGBTQ issues in Florida public schools for all grades.  More recently, he signed a law banning abortions at six weeks, which is before most women realize they’re pregnant. And he removed an elected prosecutor who vowed not to charge people under Florida’s new abortion restrictions or doctors who provide gender-affirming care.  Trump’s allies lashed out Tuesday at DeSantis’s plan.  “This is one of the most out-of-touch campaign launches in modern history. The only thing less relatable than a niche campaign launch on Twitter, is DeSantis’ after party at the uber elite Four Seasons resort in Miami,” said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s super PAC.  Trump himself frequently dismisses his rival as Ron “DeSanctimonious.”  In choosing to announce with Musk, DeSantis is linking his presidential announcement to one of the world’s richest men, who has emerged as a conservative cult hero of sorts.  Since buying Twitter last October, Musk has reinstated the accounts of prominent Republicans including Trump and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who had been removed. Popular conservative broadcasters have flocked to Twitter, with ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the podcast hosts of The Daily Wire announcing they will start streaming on the platform.  Musk himself has promoted far-right conspiracy theories on Twitter, including misleading claims questioning a Texas mall shooter’s background and a debunked rumor that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband had a relationship with an assailant who attacked him.  Earlier this month, Musk’s tweets likening billionaire philanthropist George Soros to a Jewish supervillain were met with criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which said they would embolden antisemitic extremists.

The Environmental Quality Management Co Ltd (EQM) consultancy firm is owned by Dr Ohnmar May Tin Hlaing, wife of the junta’s energy minister Myo Myint Oo. The family business profits from fossil fuel and mining companies operating in Myanmar, JFM said, in a “clear conflict of interest”.  JFM campaigns for justice and accountability in Myanmar and exposes junta-linked businesses.  EQM was registered in 2012 under the military’s proxy-civilian Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) government. Ohnmar May Tin Hlaing owns it with her father U Tin Hlaing, who was a high-ranking civil servant.  The EQM website lists 87 projects, many for oil and gas companies that were mostly completed before the 2021 coup, and its clients include TotalEnergies of France, India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Videsh, Italian major Eni, Posco International of South Korea, PTTEP of Thailand, the Malaysian firm Petronas, Shell and Petroleum Brunei.  EQM delivered air and noise monitoring services for a polluting cement factory in Karen State controlled by the military-owned conglomerate, the Myanmar Economic Corporation, in 2018.  In 2016 the company prepared an environmental examination and management plan for Bo Aung Kyaw Port controlled by the military-run Myanma Economic Holdings Limited. EQM monitored air quality at the controversial, Chinese-owned Letpadaung copper mine in 2012.  Myo Myint Oo was appointed managing director of Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) in 2014 by the USDP regime. He held the role until becoming the junta’s energy minister in August 2022.  The US, EU and Canada have sanctioned Myo Myint Oo but Ohnmar May Tin Hlaing and her father, an EQM director, face no sanctions.  The EU stated that Myo Myint Oo, “is in charge of enabling the investment and cooperation with foreign partners in the oil and gas sectors, which creates revenue for the State Administration Council [junta], thereby contributing to securing the financial needs of the military regime and to importing aviation fuel for the military which enables the military airstrikes against civilians”.  Their daughter Ma Lin Hay Thi Oo is studying in Australia.  She benefits from her parents’ business interests and should be investigated by the Australian authorities, said JFM.  In September 2017, TotalEnergies provided a five-month internship to Lin Hay Thi Oo.  JFM said Myo Myint Oo’s roles at MOGE and as energy minister and his wife’s business are a clear conflict of interest, raising serious corruption concerns.  Of EQM’s clients, ONGC Videsh, Posco and PTTEP remain in Myanmar, investing in projects that bankroll the junta’s military operations against civilians, JFM added.  TotalEnergies’ relationship with Myo Myint Oo’s family was particularly problematic, it said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXJtYS9yaWdodHMtZ3JvdXAtZGVtYW5kcy1zYW5jdGlvbi1mb3ItbXlhbm1hci1lbmVyZ3ktbWluc3RlcnMtZmFtaWx5Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnJhd2FkZHkuY29tL25ld3MvYnVybWEvcmlnaHRzLWdyb3VwLWRlbWFuZHMtc2FuY3Rpb24tZm9yLW15YW5tYXItZW5lcmd5LW1pbnN0ZXJzLWZhbWlseS5odG1sL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2021-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T23:16:58","Will Sudan crisis trigger a fresh wave of migrants and refugees out of Africa?  JUBA, South Sudan: Thousands of civilians in towns and villages across Sudan have been forced to flee in recent weeks to escape the worsening conflict in the country, which has entered its second bloody month, leading to fears of a new global refugee crisis.  Initial clashes between former allies the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces have escalated into heavy combat, displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the numbers of wounded, and disruptions to basic utilities and shortages of medical supplies have forced medical staff to turn away even the critically ill.  Meanwhile, shortages of food, fuel, electricity and clean water, coupled with economic collapse and the breakdown of law and order, have forced entire communities to pack up and leave in search of security and relief.  Passengers fleeing war-torn Sudan cross into Egypt through the Argeen Land Port on May 12, 2023. (AFP)  In the first four weeks of the crisis, around 200,000 people fled Sudan while another 700,000 were displaced inside the country. As many as 860,000 refugees and returnees are expected by the UN refugee agency UNHCR to flee by October, raising fears among European policymakers of a new influx of migrants who risk the perilous journey north to their shores.  Europe was forced to confront the issue of mass migration in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa, the Middle East and Asia began arriving from across the Mediterranean.  More recently, the continent has absorbed millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, which has placed additional strain on a continent already grappling with high energy prices as a result of gas shortages.  However, few experts predict Europe will see anything close to the same number of migrants as a result of the crisis in Sudan. Instead, most expect the majority to be displaced internally or settle in neighboring African states.  “Some of the refugees will try to go to Europe, but I don’t see that there will be mass migration going to Europe right now,” Namira Negm, director of the African Migration Observatory in Morocco, told Arab News.  “It will increase but it will not be mass migration. Migration to neighboring countries needs to be addressed first.”  IN NUMBERS 116,995 First-time asylum seekers from Sudan in EU+ area during 2015 peak.  860,000+ Refugees and returnees expected to flee Sudan by Oct. (UNHCR).  $445m Funding required to support the displaced until Oct. 2023 (UNHCR).  Nevertheless, many in Europe remain fearful that any fresh influx will place additional strains on the resources of host nations, and trigger a surge in anti-immigrant sentiments and support for right-wing populist movements.  In response to previous waves of migration several European nations adopted draconian immigration policies, making it more difficult for new arrivals to obtain asylum and the right to remain. Those who still try to reach Europe face dangerous journeys, including sea voyages in often flimsy and overloaded vessels.  “Reaching Europe would require navigating treacherous and expensive migration routes, often involving perilous sea crossings and facing the risk of exploitation and abuse by human traffickers,” Franck Duvell, a senior researcher at Universitat Osnabruck in Germany, told Arab News.  “Numbers might go up a little, but I don’t see these networks and routes now. Traveling to western Libya has become dangerous and is getting more and more difficult, and therefore (an) increasing number of people actually continue their journey to Tunisia.  “I don’t see Sudanese traveling all the way to Tunisia. It’s simply too far, it’s too expensive, it’s too dangerous … Even if numbers are increasing, the total numbers will still be relatively small.”  Migrant numbers were already on the rise prior to the start of the conflict last month. More than 36,000 people arrived from Sudan in Europe’s Mediterranean region between January and March, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to the latest UNHCR figures.  Sudan has been caught in a cycle of violent coups and countercoups for years. The latest, in October 2021, resulted in a transitional, civilian-led government being overthrown by a military junta led by the two factions now fighting each other.  Since the start of a shaky political transition in 2019, after long-time autocratic ruler Omar Al-Bashir was ousted, Sudan has been plagued by political and economic instability, prompting many citizens to seek sanctuary outside the country.  According to the EU’s European Asylum Support Office, Sudanese nationals represented the fifth-largest group of applicants for international protection in the EU in 2020, with more than 34,000 new applications. This was a significant increase on the previous year, when there were about 18,000 new applications.  An economic crisis, including high inflation, devaluation of the national currency and shortages of basic goods, had already caused poverty and unemployment to increase in Sudan prior to the latest conflict, which began on April 15.  And it is not only the Sudanese people themselves who face displacement. Before the fighting began, Sudan hosted more than a million refugees, 300,000 of them in the capital Khartoum, who had fled South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of them are now returning home or looking for refuge elsewhere in the region or further afield.  Refugees from Sudan who crossed into Ethiopia rest in Metema, on May 5, 2023. (AFP)  If the crisis in Sudan becomes long drawn out, akin to the Syrian civil war, the possibility of large number of Sudanese refugees seeking safety in Europe cannot be ruled out.  “A protracted conflict could create unwanted uncertainties,” Thirsa de Vries, a Sudan expert at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told Arab News.  “This is why it is also important that the international community (engages with) the different actors that might be involved, or works with neighboring countries to close corridors for weapons smuggling.”  The possibility of a large number of Sudanese refugees attempting to reach Europe also highlights the importance of cooperation between nations in managing migration flows.  Abdullahi Hassan, a researcher at human rights organization Amnesty International who specializes in Sudan, stressed the importance of ensuring the security and stability of host and origin countries.  “With adequate planning and resources, it is possible to provide safe and orderly routes for those seeking refuge,” he told Arab News.  He said the response to the crisis in Sudan should not solely focus on migration and added: “It must instead prioritize the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid.  “The EU and its member states should use their influence, both in the region and in Sudan, to ensure that they are directly engaging with the parties to the conflict to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, encourage immediate and unrestricted access for humanitarian actors, and pressure the Sudanese authorities to allow safe exit passages for people trying to flee the conflict.”  As the fighting continues to rage, the warring Sudanese factions have held talks in Saudi Arabia to discuss a ceasefire but made it clear they would not negotiate an end to the conflict.  Despite the challenges posed by the violence, humanitarian organizations are working to provide aid to those affected by the Sudan crisis. But attacks on aid workers and the looting of relief supplies have made it increasingly difficult for agencies to deliver help to needy communities, which could in turn affect the response of donor countries.  A view shows black smoke and fire at Omdurman market in Omdurman, Sudan, May 17, 2023. (Screengrab/Reuters)  Some organizations “have evacuated international staff, particularly those that were in the most affected areas,” UNHCR spokesperson Faith Kasina, told Arab News, who highlighted the risks and limitations of aid provision during armed conflicts.  The UN’s Children’s Fund, UNICEF, reported on May 5 that at least 190 children have been killed and 1,700 injured since the fighting began in Sudan. While a tentative ceasefire allowed foreign nations to evacuate their citizens from the country in the past few weeks, Sudanese nationals continue to endure great hardships.  Several media outlets, including the BBC, the Washington Post and Al-Jazeera, have interviewed Sudanese citizens who said their passports were locked inside foreign embassies, leaving them trapped in their own country.  Hassan, the Amnesty International researcher, said foreign nations must provide safe evacuation procedures, and that the warring factions must “stop attacking humanitarian aid workers.”  But he added that instances of attacks on workers and the looting of aid supplies “should not be an excuse to withdraw funding.”  “The response to the crisis in Sudan is completely different from the response, for example, Ukraine received when the conflict started in that country,” said Hassan.  “European countries should, nevertheless, provide safe and regular pathways to Europe for those seeking international protection … It is the responsibility of the EU and member states to ensure that such pathways are made available.”  However, public sentiment in Europe appears to be overwhelmingly hostile to refugees. Both Italy and the UK have faced recent criticism for their strict immigration policies, which aid agencies warn could drive more refugees into the arms of smuggling gangs.  In mid-April, Italy passed legislation to curb undocumented migration, including tougher sentences for those convicted of human trafficking and terminating residency permits for migrants who face humanitarian risks.  This drew criticism from search-and-rescue organizations, who warned it would lead to more deaths at sea in the Mediterranean as migrants seek illegal routes to Europe.  The British government has been accused of racial discrimination in its refugee policy. Immigration experts point out that although hundreds of thousands of visas were provided for Ukrainian refugees, there is no plan, or safe route, to help those fleeing violence in Sudan.  Ultimately, the best way to avoid migrant crises is by helping ensure that all countries in Africa are able to offer their citizens a decent quality of life.  “The root cause is lack of development; people lose hope in their country and end up migrating to other countries,” African Migration Observatory Director Negm said regarding the importance of stability in Africa.  “If they have a good life in their own home countries, they will not think of going somewhere else.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDg0MzbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Srinagar"", ""JammuAndKashmir"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T07:54:00","On May 21, 1990, three young men came to meet Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq at his home in Srinagar. It was nothing out of the ordinary: the Mirwaiz, Kashmir’s head priest and one of its most influential political leaders, received visitors as a matter of everyday routine. Except, this morning’s young visitors were assassins. They fatally shot the Mirwaiz and got away.  The assassination shocked Kashmir and, although support for the separatist struggle was at its peak, it could have led to a public backlash against the armed separatists, who were suspected to be the assailants. That did not happen. Instead, public anger was directed at the government. The reason: as thousands of agitated people carried the Mirwaiz’s body in a procession from the hospital to his home, they were fired at by the Central Reserve Police Force near Hawal in Old City, killing at least 60 and wounding scores. The government, led by Governor Jagmohan, claimed that the CRPF had come under fire from within the procession and retaliated.  The government justification for firing further muddied the waters. In his book My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir, Jagmohan would assign the blame to his police chief N S Saxena, arguing that if he had gone himself or sent a strong police contingent with the procession, the killings of the mourners would have been averted. “His conduct, to say the least, was highly irresponsible, particularly in the context of my instructions,” Jagmohan claimed. “An officer of his seniority was expected to provide leadership and show initiative on such occasions”.  The Mirwaiz’s was Kashmir’s first major political assassination. The murder and its aftermath eventually led to Jagmohan’s ouster as Governor.  The assassination was investigated by the CBI, which said that it was planned by Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan and executed by their operatives Ayub Dar, Javid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat. Bangroo and Shigan were killed in gunfights with the security forces not long after. Dar was caught and sentenced to life in prison. Last week, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat were arrested, after 33 years on the run.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvdGhlLW1pcndhaXpzLWtpbGxpbmctYW5kLXdoeS1pdC13YXMtYS13YXRlcnNoZWQtbW9tZW50LWZvci1qay04NjIwMzE1L9IBfWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvdGhlLW1pcndhaXpzLWtpbGxpbmctYW5kLXdoeS1pdC13YXMtYS13YXRlcnNoZWQtbW9tZW50LWZvci1qay04NjIwMzE1L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Biden told reporters upon his return to the White House from Japan that the call ""went well"".  And McCarthy struck a more positive tone on the issue on Sunday, despite no sign of a final agreement being hammered out.  [Kevin McCarthy, House Speaker]  “What I am looking at is where our differences are and how we could solve those. I felt that part was productive. But look, there is no agreement, we are still apart. The agreement would be let's get our teams back together so everybody clearly understands what we are talking about, what they are talking about.”  Talks had stalled as both sides fell back to calling the other side’s position extremist.  Biden, who was in Hiroshima for the Group of Seven summit, said before the call that Republicans’ demands were “unacceptable”.  Democrats have been pushing to hold spending steady at this year's levels, while Republicans want to return to 2022 levels. Last month the Republican-led House passed legislation that would cut government spending by eight percent.  Democrats have said it would mean average cuts of 22% to education and law enforcement, a figure top Republicans haven’t disputed.  In any case, they are on a tight schedule to strike a deal before June – with risk of default already putting markets on edge.  [Kevin McCarthy, House Speaker]  “I have spoken to Schumer, Leader Schumer, I was giving him seven days and he told me he probably doesn't need that much time. We need to post a bill to whatever it is that we agree to, it takes some time to write it. We have to have it in three days, 72 hours, before we can vote on it, and then it would go to the Senate.”  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said June 1 was a ""hard deadline"" for raising the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, lest the country risk triggering a default, sparking chaos in financial markets and spiking interest rates.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYmlkZW4tbWNjYXJ0aHktaGFkLXByb2R1Y3RpdmUtY2FsbC0wNzI5MzI4MDYuaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9iaWRlbi1tY2NhcnRoeS1oYWQtcHJvZHVjdGl2ZS1jYWxsLTA3MjkzMjgwNi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The truce, to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid for civilians, took effect Monday night only to be quickly marred by more gunshots and blasts.  By around noon on Tuesday, witnesses reported a relative calm had taken hold, both in greater Khartoum and in the Darfur region’s cities of Nyala and El Geneina, which have been among the other main battlegrounds.  “We have not heard shelling in our neighborhood since last night,” said a witness in southern Khartoum, who told AFP the last airstrike was five minutes before the truce formally started at 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) on Monday.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a video message that the truce is “backed by a remote monitoring mechanism” supported by the US.  “If the cease-fire is violated, we’ll know,” he said. “And we will hold violators accountable through our sanctions and other tools at our disposal.”  More than five weeks of war have pitted the army, led by Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces of his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.  The battles since April 15 have killed an estimated 1,000 people, sparked mass evacuations of foreigners and forced more than a million people to flee their homes internally and across borders, fueling concerns for regional stability.  Those who remain have run low on water, food and basic supplies, and more than half the population, 25 million people, are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the UN.  Khartoum residents had longed for a pause in combat to allow in life-saving humanitarian aid and to enable more people to flee the city. The United Nations said nearly 650,000 had already done so during the war.  A series of previous cease-fires were announced but quickly violated, and a foreign aid group on Monday voiced frustration about the crisis which has piled new misery on the already poverty-stricken northeast African nation.  “We’ve had over a month of broken promises and empty words while humanitarian colleagues were killed, together with children and others and hospitals destroyed,” Karl Schembri of the Norwegian Refugee Council wrote on Twitter.  Volker Perthes, the United Nations envoy to Sudan, told the UN Security Council on Monday that “fighting and troop movements have continued even today, despite a commitment by both sides not to pursue military advantage before the cease-fire takes effect.”  While no previous truce has held, the United States and Saudi Arabia said this agreement was different because the seven-page document was “signed by the parties” and would be supported by the monitoring mechanism.  Neither side has directly blamed the other for breaking this truce — as they did within minutes after previous cease-fires collapsed.  But the health ministry released a statement on Tuesday accusing the RSF of violating hospitals.  The ministry, loyal to Burhan, said RSF troops “stationed themselves” inside two hospitals in greater Khartoum Tuesday, “assaulting medical staff and ejecting patients.”  The RSF called the accusations “lies.”  Major fighting has devastated the western Darfur region near Chad, where the UN has reported hundreds of civilians killed in the West Darfur capital El Geneina.  Perthes in his Security Council address warned that “the conflict risks to expand and prolong... with implications for the region.”  “In parts of the country, fighting between the two armies or the two armed formations has sharpened into communal tensions, or triggered conflict between communities,” he said, after reports of civilians being armed in Darfur.  Sudan has a long history of military coups and the army in 2019 overthrew the veteran Islamist autocrat Omar Al-Bashir after mass protests against his rule.  Sudanese were promised a gradual transition toward civilian rule, but Burhan and Daglo staged another coup in October 2021 before simmering tensions between the two men flared into the current war.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwODU0Ni9taWRkbGUtZWFzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-17","18:00:00","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T23:39:50","DeSantis plans to announce 2024 bid Wednesday on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk, sources tell AP  WASHINGTON: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, long seen as Donald Trump’s leading rival for the Republican nomination, plans to launch his 2024 presidential campaign on Wednesday in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.  DeSantis, an outspoken cultural conservative, will outline his plans in an evening audio event streamed on Twitter Spaces, according to the two people. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.  The 44-year-old two-term governor joins a crowded Republican contest to decide whether the party will move on from Trump in 2024. DeSantis has embraced Trump’s combative style and many of his policies, but casts himself as a younger and more electable version of the former president.  In choosing Twitter, DeSantis is taking a page out of the playbook that helped turn businessman-TV celebrity Trump into a political star.  The timing of DeSantis’ long-expected announcement has been shrouded, with various iterations of plans being leaked over the past few days. Some close to him suspected that he was providing conflicting information about the timing and location to root out leakers. Others believe he changed his initial preparations after news reports came out about them.  Musk, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit event in London on Tuesday, seemed to confirm the Wednesday event, saying DeSantis would be making “quite an announcement” on Twitter the next day. “The first time something like this is happening on social media,” he said, with live questions and answers. The announcement is scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT.  He added that he is not endorsing any particular candidate at this time.  Meanwhile, Trump on Tuesday made a video appearance in a New York courtroom, where the judge tentatively scheduled a criminal trial for the former president for next March 25, in the heart of the primary season. Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his family company, the Trump Organization.  While it is common for campaigns to publicize their announcements in videos shared on social media, it is far more unusual — and perhaps unprecedented — to hold a campaign announcement in a live social media forum.  “Big if true...” DeSantis’ wife, Casey, posted Tuesday on Twitter, linking to a Fox News story on the announcement and adding a smiley face.  Earlier Tuesday, the Florida governor gave no hints of his 2024 plans during a short Cabinet meeting in Tallahassee where he discussed state business with agency heads. The media was barred from covering a subsequent bill signing ceremony.  DeSantis has emerged as a national star in Republican politics as an unapologetic leader on controversial issues.  The governor sent dozens of immigrants from Texas — by way of Florida — to a small island off the Massachusetts coast to draw attention to the influx of Latin American immigrants trying to cross the Southern border. He signed and then expanded a Parental Rights in Education bill — known by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — which bans instruction or classroom discussion of LGBTQ issues in Florida public schools for all grades.  More recently, he signed a law banning abortions at six weeks, which is before most women realize they’re pregnant. And he removed an elected prosecutor who vowed not to charge people under Florida’s new abortion restrictions or doctors who provide gender-affirming care.  Trump’s allies lashed out Tuesday at DeSantis’s plan.  “This is one of the most out-of-touch campaign launches in modern history. The only thing less relatable than a niche campaign launch on Twitter, is DeSantis’ after party at the uber elite Four Seasons resort in Miami,” said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s super PAC.  Trump himself frequently dismisses his rival as Ron “DeSanctimonious.”  In choosing to announce with Musk, DeSantis is linking his presidential announcement to one of the world’s richest men, who has emerged as a conservative cult hero of sorts.  Since buying Twitter last October, Musk has reinstated the accounts of prominent Republicans including Trump and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who had been removed. Popular conservative broadcasters have flocked to Twitter, with ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the podcast hosts of The Daily Wire announcing they will start streaming on the platform.  Musk himself has promoted far-right conspiracy theories on Twitter, including misleading claims questioning a Texas mall shooter’s background and a debunked rumor that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband had a relationship with an assailant who attacked him.  Earlier this month, Musk’s tweets likening billionaire philanthropist George Soros to a Jewish supervillain were met with criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which said they would embolden antisemitic extremists. Musk responded on Twitter clarifying his criticism of Soros and saying he would “be more thoughtful in the future.”  Twitter was once Trump’s most important megaphone — one he used to dominate his rivals in the 2016 primary and to command the news cycle for years. Trump was barred from the platform after Jan. 6, 2021. Though his access was reinstated shortly after Musk took over, he has yet to tweet.  About 1 in 5 US adults say they use Twitter, the Pew Research Center found last year.  Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say they have Twitter accounts, according to a Fox News poll from December. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say Musk buying Twitter was a good thing and to have a favorable view of him.

"political coup","2020-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Kabul"", ""Kabul"", ""Afghanistan""}","2023-05-22T00:26:58","In 1961, the German big pharma firm Degussa AG, launched a new drug, fenethylline, on the market under the brand name Captagon. This was an amphetamine fusion, developed (so it was claimed) to help patients with depression.  Captagon gives an instant high, making the patient forget about pain, personal problems and poverty. For anyone who just wanted an incredible high, Captagon was a favourite amongst connoisseurs of chemical aids to instant nirvama. It soon became clear that the drug was highly addictive. Other better designed drugs offering real medical help for depression eventually replaced Captagon, though it was not withdrawn by Degussa until 1986, when the WHO placed it on the list of psychotropic substances and it became illegal in most countries. Since then, however, the production and trade in this illicit drug has continued, especially in the Middle East.  Now Captagon has become the weapon of choice of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. His regime has been distributing it all over the Middle East and Western Asia, to the joy of millions who want momentarily to escape the oppressions, poverty, and cruelties of Arab potentates. The latter turned a blind eye to the damaging effects of Captagon, because their nightmare is that their people will start demanding democracy and human rights. Now, though, the health impact has become impossible to ignore.  Some 80 per cent of the world’s supply of Captagon is produced in Syria under the control of Bashar’s family or close regime associates, including the military. The US and Britain have issued international arrest warrants for Bashar’s cronies, but such gesture diplomacy has had and will have no impact.  Just as the global south will not follow the US and Europe against Putin, so the Arab world will not take lessons from London or Washington after the regime change disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Efforts by the US to get majority Muslim countries to comply with the wishes of Washington are ignored, just as those of Moscow were in the 1980s. Since 2011 the wishes of London and Paris to have obedient regimes in Tripoli and Damascus have turned into disaster. Instead, Nato and EU capitals lick the boots of anti-Jewish, anti-women, anti-democracy regimes, as long as they sell oil.  Now Bashar al-Assad has cynically used the global north’s indulgence of brain-altering drugs for pleasure to sell Captagon to the peoples of his neighbouring regimes. He does this both to earn a great deal of money for Syrian generals and politicians, thereby ensuring their loyalty, and to show his fellow Arab leaders that shunning him, at the bidding of Washington, London and Paris, just won’t work.  Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic relations with Damascus in 2012. A decade later, as the Saudi rulers see the impact of Captagon on the young populations in the region, they are opening the door to Bashar al Assad’s return to the Arab League. The Saudis are now giving Syria considerable financial aid to be spent on combating Captagon addiction.  At the beginning of May Jordan launched an air raid on south Syria, aimed at eliminating one of Bashar’s associates, who was flooding Jordan with Captagon. Hezbollah in Lebanon organises the transit route for Syrian-produced Captagon to much of the Arab world and Turkey.  Three years ago President Macron grandiosely promised to rebuild Lebanon, but France no more than the US or Israel has the means to displace Hezbollah. Iran and Russia are Bashar al Assad’s main non-Arab supporters, along with Turkey. Under Erdogan or any other conceivable Turkish ruler, Ankara will keep the Syrian dictator in power in exchange for support in eliminating as far as possible any Kurdish threat to the unity of the Turkish state.  So Bashar al-Assad has scored a major diplomatic coup by being accepted back into the Arab league. He is being offered large sums of oil money in exchange for turning off the Captagon tap.  Cynical? Yes to the highest degree. But the US and Europe are not going to send invading armies to replace the Baathist clique that rules in Damascus. Moscow tried regime change in Kabul after 1980. It failed. Bush and Blair tried regime change in Iraq in 2003. It turned into a disaster.  David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkoy backed regime change in Libya and Syria in 2011. Where are they now? David Cameron handed his party over Boris Johnson, Suella Braverman and Jacob Rees Mogg when he gave in to Nigel Farage and Rupert Murdoch by holding the Brexit plebiscite in 2016.  Sarkozy is facing unending trials over corruption and was last week sentenced to wearing a tag and being under de facto house arrest. He is appealing the court hearing and, given the cynicism of French judges about political corruption, he will probably escape any real sanction.  Meanwhile, though, Vladimir Putin, assorted Arab despots and Islamist dictators in Iran are still in power. Bashar al-Assad’s narco-state has survived revolution and civil war to be readmitted as a full member of the Arab political community.  So far this century, Euro-Atlantic diplomacy in the Muslim world has been a total failure. We can enjoy the Netflix series, “Diplomat”. The real diplomats, or rather the political chiefs who give them their orders, have badly let down the democracies of the north and the oppressed peoples of the south.

Hun Sen on May 21 posted to his Facebook page an apology from Poch and a letter from him rejecting a report by local media outlet Fresh News that he intended to oust the prime minister.  Poch can be heard in a 22-second voice message telling CP members that he has been in a “struggle” to “depose” Hun Sen since he was 19 years old.  “Since I entered politics at 19, many colleagues and leaders have died. With this pain, how seriously they have mistreated us, we know our goal. To be frank, my goal is to oust Hun Sen.”  However, in the letter to Hun Sen, Poch apologised and said his “struggle” referred only to democratic elections held every five years.  He said that during his 27 years of political activities with opposition parties, he had intended to promote and improve democracy, freedom and human rights in Cambodia.  He said he had also adhered to the principle of non-violence, and to the spirit of the Paris Peace Agreements of October 23, 1991, the Cambodian Constitution and the Kingdom’s laws.  “I deny the report by Fresh News of May 13, 2023, and the doctored 22-second audio clip saying my goal was to oust Hun Sen.  “I would like to make it emphatically clear that I have never had such an idea, or even just one thought as to what I have been accused of.  “What I have said so far was to strengthen the stance of opposition party activists in competing in free, fair and credible elections, and winning out over the ruling Cambodian People’s Party [CPP] led by Prime Minister Hun Sen,” the letter says.  In the other letter to Hun Sen, dated May 15, Poch says: “My speeches were rude and have affected the prime minister. I ask the prime minister to forgive me.”  In the letter, Poch says he had requested for Candlelight Party delegates to express themselves with politeness, and that he wished to apologise to Hun Sen in person.  However, the premier said he had rejected Poch’s apology and instructed his lawyers to begin proceedings, with them to wait until May 30 to hear any further explanations from Poch regarding the matter.  He said that Poch, instead of accepting the truth, was trying to protect his reputation by hitting out at the veracity of the Fresh News report.  “I have asked my lawyers to prepare legal proceedings against Chea Poch regarding two cases: one is a letter refuting a media report and the other what Poch has said,” Hun Sen said.  The prime minister said that while the word “depose” could refer to an election as Poch had argued, it could also mean a coup or colour revolution as had been carried out in some countries.  The end goal of “depose” was to topple a leader through any means possible, he contended.  “Poch could have used another word besides ‘depose’. However, Poch and his party have such poor manners and have developed an endless culture of revenge from top to bottom.  “I don’t accept the apology. What Poch should do for himself and his family members, he knows himself,” Hun Sen said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcGhub21wZW5ocG9zdC5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwvcG0tcmVqZWN0cy1hcG9sb2d5LWNhbmRsZWxpZ2h0LXBhcnR5cy1wb2No0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

His flock includes Finns and Swedes, but also a few Sámi, nomadic reindeer herders, the Indigenous people of the Scandinavian tundra.  With “The End of Drum-Time,” Hanna Pylväinen provides a fictionalized account of a mid-19th century religious movement as she weaves a tale of clashing cultures and religious colonialism. The award-winning author unwinds an exquisite story that combines historical fiction, romance, and social commentary.  The story begins when Lars Levi is unexpectedly interrupted by Biettar Rasti, a shaman and a leader among the Sámi people. As Biettar stands quietly in the aisle of the church, everyone stunned by his presence, an earthquake rattles the small building. No one is quite sure what is happening, whether they are experiencing yet another example of nature’s harsh treatment or perhaps a dramatic religious awakening. As the congregation stares silently, all Lars Levi can think is, “What a coup, if Biettar should be saved, here and now!”  Yes, it does appear the Sámi elder has experienced a religious conversion. But it is one that brings consequences that Lars Levi had not anticipated. Cultural influence, after all, seldom flows in only one direction.  In the weeks that follow, Lars Levi welcomes Biettar into the fold where he becomes a disciple of sorts, spending his time learning this new religion, leaving the care of his ever-dwindling herd of reindeer to his son, Ivvár. But while the minister gains a new parishioner, one whom he views as a prize, his daughter, Willa, becomes infatuated with Ivvár. As the young Sámi struggles to maintain the herd on his own, a task never intended for one person, the two grow closer. With the spring migration approaching, a custom that has been practiced by the tribe for generations, Willa prepares to join them, defying her father’s control.  Readers will recognize familiar literary themes of conflicting cultural standards and familial power struggles. But Pylväinen uses these themes as a foundation upon which she embroiders an exquisite variation that illumines a lesser-known culture as well as an earlier religious movement. Much of the outline of the book – the minister and his efforts to convert the Sámi and eradicate their way of life – is factual. But with her lush prose and balanced perspectives, Pylväinen tells the story with a fairness that does not cast one culture as “advanced” and the other as “primitive.” Rather, she provides a richness of detail and captivating storytelling that makes the era accessible to contemporary readers.  Take for example the alcohol that has ravaged much of the community. It was introduced by settlers who had traveled to the northern regions searching for new customers for their product. As they ventured farther north, they also introduced what they considered to be the basic necessities of life – roads, the church, a general store – all of which they try to impose upon the untamed tundra.  The settlers also introduce the concept of buying on credit to entrap the Sámi. When obligations mount, which the Sámi have no hope of repaying, the settlers impose political and legal consequences upon a nomadic people who never had a need for such systems. Their lives were determined by natural conditions, perhaps summarized in a Sámi proverb with which Pylväinen opens the novel: “Let the reindeer decide.”  Yet while the Sámi are viewed by the settlers, and by the minister especially, as primitive, the author reveals how their way of life is perfectly suited to the extreme circumstances of their environment. Their independence and self-sufficiency have emerged as adaptations to the natural conditions, illustrating how their simplicity is an elegant and effective response that brings them into harmony with the world around them.

This contemporary account of a dark chapter in Scandinavian history benefits from the author’s imaginative storytelling and her brilliance as a writer. Pylväinen infuses each situation with details that make it come alive and make each character’s situation relatable to the reader. These might be as simple as Ivvár’s conscientious collecting of straw that he will use to line his boots. However meager, the straw will serve as insulation that helps protect him from the arctic cold.  Such wisdom, we learn, is part of the Sámi way of life, an example of how indigenous cultures have adapted and thrived in some of the most hostile regions on earth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzbW9uaXRvci5jb20vQm9va3MvQm9vay1SZXZpZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUyMi9UaGUtRW5kLW9mLURydW0tVGltZS13ZWF2ZXMtYS1wb2lnbmFudC10YWxlLW9mLWNsYXNoaW5nLWN1bHR1cmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Born and raised in Tehran to Iranian parents who upon finishing their post-graduate studies became American citizens, Tara Kangarlou wrote the book in the hope that it will ""serve as a small reminder that beyond our skin color, religion, and passport, we all share similar dreams, fears, and aspirations — and are all bound to one another through our joint humanity"".    The book is not about politics, she says, ""nor is it meant to paint a rosy picture of a country whose people are suffering on a daily basis from repressive forces at home. Rather, it is an invitation for readers, particularly in the US and elsewhere in the West, to take a glimpse into the hearts and minds of the Iranian people, and to view the intricacies of their lives in a unique environment unfamiliar to many living outside the country"".    And while admitting that ""twenty or so portraits cannot ever capture the entirety of a nation of 80 million"", she hopes that ""the complexities of each story in this book can help bring readers closer to the textures, nuances, and chasms of life in the Islamic Republic of Iran"".    Interspersing the stories told by people with her own comments, Kangarlou takes the readers on interesting personal journeys, but also informs them of the history of her country of birth. As a true journalist, she provides historical and political background that should greatly help those unfamiliar with the realities of Iran.    The millennia-old history of that country, its richness, feats, and foibles are easily explained by this writer of great talent who colors the stories in her book with warm, glowing hues or harsh, glaring, jarring tinges.    Geographical boundaries, long chipped at by later powers, mores, and political games at play in Iran are presented alongside people's accounts, making for a fast-paced, interesting, and educative reading into the history of a very old civilization that has been witnessing turmoil and dramatic changes brought about by the powers of the day without a thought for their impact on people's lives.    The readers come to know about Iran's long history in the course of the story of a nonagenarian whose ""resilience in the face of tragedy perfectly captures the ethos of Iran over the past century: two kings, a world war, a coup, a revolution that completely pulled the nation apart, followed by an eight-year war"".    They get introduced to cultural aspects — cuisine, customs, literature, history, geography, religion — to the most disparate characters — from a star actor of modest demeanor to a ""cool"", reform-oriented, ""avid fan of theater, movie buff, and music enthusiast"" Shiite Muslim cleric, to a rabbi whose very presence in Tehran where he teaches religious texts and classes belies the prevailing narrative serving certain interests — or get a glimpse at the intricacies of Iranian politics, the ayatollahs' advent to power through the Islamic Revolution, and the insidious foreign interference in the country's affairs that, like in many other nations, has only bred resentment.    The interviews reflect the image of bright, mostly educated, Iranians who had the power to break free from the shackles of dogmatic religious upbringing and see the world for the complex universe it is. They could incur the wrath of religious conservatives, but the exhilarating feeling of freedom they discover seems to be enough to give them courage to express themselves.    But they are also stories of humanity, of lifestyles, of affluence and poverty, of ignorance and erudition, that all find a way in the book and through which Kangarlou weaves a rich tapestry of the people of Iran.    With clinical, impartial eye, she paints a complex image of society. Having interviewed the widest array of individuals, she creates a fascinating tableau of the inhabitants of a country that is often maligned by the sometimes ignorant West.    Whether a woman married off at 12 to a man 18 years older, or ""one of the few Muslim female race car champions in the world"", an engineer turned restaurateur, a former drug addict turned photographer, a saffron farmer who brings to the fore the water crisis in the country and reminds of the crippling sanctions it has been under, a blind PhD in political science who made it against all odds and who is also ""a passionate advocate for the environment, women, and the disabled people of her community"", an Olympic gold medalist archer who ""sitting in her wheelchair … made history as the flag-bearer of her country during the game’s opening ceremonies"", or a transgender, whether Zoroastrians, Muslims, Christians or Jews, her characters pour their heart out, have no pretenses, but lots of hope and love for their ancestral land.    In the tradition of Scheherazade, Kangarlou presents story after enthralling story, this time, though, told by real people about their real lives.    The young writer's interesting interventions enrich the whole, are enlightening lessons in the history, politics, faiths, and social customs of Iran, making for page-turning reading.

"political coup","2016-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Ankara"", ""Ankara"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-23T00:14:00","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's decision to allow allies to train Ukrainian forces on how to operate F-16 fighter jets — and eventually to provide the aircraft themselves — seemed like an abrupt change in position but was in fact one that came after months of internal debate and quiet talks with allies.  Biden announced during last week's Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, Japan, that the U.S. would join the F-16 coalition. His green light came after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spent months pressing the West to provide his forces with American-made jets as he tries to repel Russia's now 15-month-old grinding invasion.  Long shadowing the administration's calculation were worries that such a move could escalate tensions with Russia. U.S. officials also argued that learning to fly and logistically support the advanced F-16 would be difficult and time consuming.  But over the past three months, administration officials shifted toward the view that it was time to provide Ukraine's pilots with the training and aircraft needed for the country's long-term security needs, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  Still, the change in Biden's position seemed rather sudden.  Political Cartoons View All 997 Images  In February, Biden was insistent in an interview with ABC’s David Muir that Ukraine “doesn’t need F-16s now” and that “I am ruling it out for now.” And in March, a top Pentagon policy official, Colin Kahl, told U.S. lawmakers that even if the president approved F-16s for Ukraine, it could take as long as two years to get Ukrainian pilots trained and equipped.  But as the administration was publicly playing down the prospect of F-16s for Ukraine in the near term, an internal debate was heating up.  Quiet White House discussions stepped up in February, around the time that Biden visited Ukraine and Poland, according to the U.S. officials.  Following the trip, discussions that included senior White House National Security Council, Pentagon and State Department officials began on the pros and cons and the details of how such a transfer might work, officials said. Administration officials also got deeper into consultations with allies.  In April, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin heard from defense leaders from allied countries during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group who were looking for U.S. permission to train the Ukrainians on F-16s, according to a Defense Department official who was not authorized to comment publicly. Austin raised the matter during the NSC policy discussions and there was agreement that it was time to start training.  Austin also raised the issue with Biden before the G7 summit with a recommendation “to proceed with approving allies"" to train the Ukrainians and transfer the aircraft, the department official said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also was a strong advocate for pushing forward with the plan during the U.S. policy talks and conveying to Biden increasing European urgency on the issue, officials said.  U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to London on May 8 for talks with British, French and German allies on Ukraine, and F-16s were high on the agenda. They got into the nitty gritty on how to go about provide training and which countries might be willing to transfer jets to Ukraine. It was agreed that the focus would be on training first, according to one of the officials.  Sullivan, before leaving London, spoke by phone with his counterparts from the Netherlands and Poland, both countries that have F-16s and “would be essential to any efforts to provide Ukraine jets for any future use.” Denmark also could potentially provide the jets, the official added.  Biden and Sullivan discussed how the upcoming G7 summit in Hiroshima could provide a good opportunity for him to make the case to key allies on the administration’s shifting stance on fighter jets.  They also discussed Biden backing allies providing jets to Ukraine — a line he had previously appeared not to want to cross out of concern that it could draw the West into what could be seen as direct confrontation with Moscow.  Biden, in private talks with fellow G7 leaders on Friday, confirmed that the U.S. would get behind a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 and that as things went on, they would work together on who would provide them and how many would be sent.  State, Pentagon and NSC officials are now developing the training plan and “when, where and how to deliver F-16s” to Ukraine as part of the long-term security effort, the official said.  U.S. officials say it will take several months to iron out details, but the U.S. Air Force has quietly determined that the actual training could realistically be done in about four months. The Air Force based the far shorter estimate on a visit by two Ukrainian pilots to a U.S. air base in March, where they got to learn about the F-16 and fly simulators. The training, officials say, would take place in Europe.  White House officials have bristled at the notion that Biden's decision amounted to a sea change.  The administration had been focused on providing Ukraine with weapons — including air defense systems, armored vehicles, bridging equipment and artillery — that were needed for a coming counteroffensive. There also were concerns that sending F-16s would eat up a significant portion of the money allocated for Ukraine.  What changed, the official added, is that other allies got to a point where they were willing to provide their own jets as part of a U.S.-based coalition.  The Biden administration is still examining whether it will directly provide its own F-16s to Ukraine. Regardless, it needed buy-in from other allies because the U.S. wouldn't be able to provide the full fleet of jets Zelenskyy says is needed.  Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the F-16 will give Ukraine a key capability for the long term but it won't be a “game changer.”  Kendall told a gathering of reporters on Monday there has been an awareness that “we needed to go there at some point, but we didn’t have a sense of urgency about this. I think we’re at a reasonable place to make that decision now.”  Another potential wrinkle in the F-16 conversation involves Turkey.  Turkey wants to buy 40 new F-16s from the U.S., but some in Congress oppose the sale until Turkey approves NATO membership for Sweden, which applied to join the alliance in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has objected to Sweden's perceived support of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, the leftist extremist group DHKP-C and followers of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara claims was behind a failed military coup attempt in 2016.  Erdogan is facing opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu in a runoff election on Sunday. If Erdogan wins, as expected, White House officials are increasingly hopeful that the Turkish leader will withdraw his opposition to Sweden's membership, according to the U.S. official.  If Erdogan drops opposition to Sweden joining NATO, it could lead to Turkey getting its long desired F-16s and may eventually add to the number of older F-16s in circulation, which could benefit Ukraine.  —  Associated Press White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed reporting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTA1LTIyL2JpZGVucy1zaGlmdC1vbi1mLTE2cy1mb3ItdWtyYWluZS1jYW1lLWFmdGVyLW1vbnRocy1vZi1pbnRlcm5hbC1kZWJhdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Melbourne"", ""Victoria"", ""Australia""}","2023-05-22T15:00:35","Why Wimbledon’s reversal of their ban on Russian players is good for players, fans and the tennis sports industry  Can Wimbledon 2023 regain its status as the number one grand slam on the tennis tour? It certainly has the potential to achieve this status with the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club’s (AELTC) reversing its ban on Russian and Belarusian tennis players.  This action allows these players to now compete as “neutrals” at Wimbledon and ends a year-long stance against their participation. It is a smart strategic and financial move that will be good for tennis in the UK - the players, fans and the tennis sports industry.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  The ban on Russian/Belarusian players was first announced April 20 2022 by Ian Hewitt, chairman of the All England Club responsible for managing the Wimbledon Championships. This decision was supported by the UK Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) which put in place similar bans for tournaments that lead up to Wimbledon. This was done so that there was a “consistent approach” across UK tennis.  Jonathan Skinner  The international Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) immediately criticised the ban as unfair discrimination against players and stripped Wimbledon of its ability to rank players in the grand slam, effectively reducing it to an exhibition event that some players stayed away from. It subsequently introduced UK$200,000 (£164,018) fines for each LTA event ATP players were banned from, and was joined by similar sanctions from the Women’s Tennis Association. The threat of LTA expulsion from the international tennis tour also hung over this cloud of multi-million dollar fines should the ban continue into 2023.  Not detrimental  Wimbledon’s ban was initially implemented because of fears of a propaganda coup for Putin should a Russian or Belarusian player such as Daniil Medvedev win and be photographed being awarded a trophy by British royalty or beating British former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in the process. In one unilateral action, Wimbledon became a highly politicised sporting event, treating players according to their ethno-national background rather than their playing abilities.  Although a Russian/Belarusian victory might still come to pass in July, the anticipated awkward clashes and interactions on and off court between Russian/Belarusian and Ukrainian or Ukrainian-supporting players have been contained without being detrimental to the tennis ecosystem.  In April, Russian player Anastasia Potapova was formally warned for wearing a Spartak Moscow football shirt on court during the BNP Paribas Open (Indian Wells) in California. She has not worn it since.  Animosity was visible between Potapova and Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk in the next tournament she faced - the Miami Open. There, Kostyuk refused to shake hands with a player from the country her homeland is at war with. The WTA responded by reaffirming its support for Ukraine.  And in January at this year’s first slam in Melbourne, Novak Djokovic was embarrassed by his father’s behaviour and had to ban him from attending his matches after Srdjan Djokovic was seen posing for photos with fans, standing beside one waving a Russian flag with Putin’s face in the middle and with the pro-invasion “Z” symbol emblazoned on the fan’s T-shirt.  There was no political fallout from this personal ban imposed, and Djokovic went on to win the Australian Open.  Story continues  Courting the tennis ecosystem  There is pressure on tournaments at every level to modernise and grow. The AELTC itself has controversial expansion plans and neither the AELTC nor the UK governing tennis body can risk further fines, loss of sponsorship, or loss of status by keeping the player ban in place.  Predictably, the AELTC has been cautious in its route back in line with the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the WTA and the ATP. Wimbledon seeks to avoid the “disruptions of the ban as well as the tensions between players arising from the Russian-Ukrainian war.  This all compounded to result in the LTA making a loss in the last financial year. Reversing the player ban brings players and rankings back to Wimbledon. It also conveniently halved last year’s WTA fine and has given the LTA the initiative to negotiate with the ATP with respect to their 2022 season fine.  While the money from the fines was allocated to Ukrainian relief funds, this is money that the LTA needs to recoup for UK tennis to survive.  Lifting the ban at Wimbledon will add to the players’ challenge by bringing additional top-draw quality to the Wimbledon Championships. It will also add a containable edge to the matches. The fans will be looking to see how a recent friendly wave seen at the Madrid Open between Russian Daria Kasatkina and Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko grows into a more visible peace.  Last year Andy Murray was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award after donating nearly his entire season’s winnings (£510,000) to Unicef’s programme assisting children affected by the invasion of Ukraine.  Jonathan Skinner , CC BY  This year, Murray must work hard in the tournaments leading up to Wimbledon to retain his seeded status and avoid playing against the likes of Medvedev early in his campaign. Whether it is in the early rounds or later in the finals, a Murray/Medvedev match will favour the Russian for a win, but the clash is containable and will be to the advantage of the championship, the fans and UK tennis.

He received the maximum sentence for treason and rebellion under Section 122 of the Penal Code.  Friday’s decision by the court in Monywa Prison in northern Sagaing region takes his total sentence to 52 years.  The 28-year-old has already been found guilty of crimes including robbery; rioting; carrying a weapon; incitement to mutiny; and unlawful assembly.

I went into shrimp feed distribution before my recruitment by the government in 1989.  My first three years were spent in the Department of Tourism which saw one major crisis after another — the 1989 coup attempt, the PH-US bases talks, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the Baguio earthquake, the First Gulf War, the abrogation of the US bases treaty, the abrupt turnover of Camp John Hay, the closure of Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base — where I found myself playing key roles as crisis manager, negotiator, spokesman, enforcer and steward.

"political coup","2024-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:00:00","Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  A self-proclaimed “seven-fingered dirt farmer” could stand between Republicans and the Senate majority in 2024. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection next year, has bedeviled Republicans since 2006, winning reelection twice in a deep-red state whose other senator, Steve Daines, is now in charge of gaining back the majority for Republicans as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  “He’s pretty wily,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who once led the NRSC, of Tester. “He’s been able to hold on a long time.”  Republicans hope to change that this time, with Daines and his longtime top aide Jason Thielman, the NRSC’s executive director who is also from Montana, working to recruit a top-flight challenger to Tester and using their expertise to plot his defeat from their perches at the organization. They argue the state has changed rapidly since the last time Tester won, and their bet is that Montanans will no longer let their affection for the likable senator with a penchant for salty language override their increasing alienation from the Democratic Party.  Advertisement  “The biggest disadvantage that Jon Tester has is that there isn’t a senator in America whose voting record is more out of step with the preferences of his state,” Thielman said in an interview. “He is proud to be out of step with Montana and frankly arrogant about his ability to do so and think he can get away with it.”  This time, Tester doesn’t have the “grace” to pull off a victory in the red state, Thielman added.  Tester’s campaign manager, Shelbi Dantic, said Republicans are “scared” of facing Tester and that he defends “our Montana way of life every day.”  But Tester’s allies essentially agree that the race will be a test of whether the senator’s authenticity and connection with his home state’s voters can override most Montanans’ inclination to vote Republican. President Donald Trump carried the state by 16 percentage points in 2020 — less than he won it by in 2016. But in 2022, Democratic state lawmakers lost races in the party’s former stronghold of Great Falls and Cascade County — Tester’s backyard — and the GOP gained a supermajority in the Montana state legislature.  Advertisement  The state’s population also has grown rapidly since 2020, and Thielman predicts many of the new residents, who he believes were fleeing more restrictive covid-19 policies, will vote Republican. And Daines was able to defeat popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock to win reelection in 2020, a warning sign that likability might not be enough to save a Democrat statewide anymore.  “It’s really a question about political brand versus personal brand. And that’ll be the story of this election,” said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, President Barack Obama’s former campaign manager, who has advised Tester in the past.  Tester has used his charm and his deep roots in the state in the past to attract voters who typically reject Democrats.  “A lot of Montana still likes the guy,” said Montana state Sen. Jason Small, a Republican. “At the end of the day I think a lot of people in Montana look at it like this: You got one candidate that’s from Montana and odds are another one that isn’t, and that is a deciding factor for a lot of people.”  Advertisement  That ups the pressure on Daines and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to recruit a winning opponent.  Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale (R-Mont.), who lost to Tester in 2018 after the senator’s campaign dubbed him “Maryland Matt,” has not ruled out running again, and he would probably enjoy the backing of the conservative and anti-tax Club for Growth PAC in a primary. Tester, who lost three fingers in a meat grinder accident, also raised questions about whether Rosendale was actually a rancher, as he claimed, after it emerged he did not own any cattle. (He said he leased his land.)  Daines and McConnell, meanwhile, have encouraged wealthy businessman and decorated veteran Tim Sheehy to run, and Daines sounded optimistic about the prospect that Sheehy would get in at a recent presentation to GOP senators about the 2024 map.  Advertisement  Daines listed Tester and two other Democrats in states that voted for Trump in 2020 — Sens. Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Joe Manchin III in West Virginia — as the NRSC’s top targets at the presentation.  “He obviously has special insights into how Montanans think, how they behave, the political history of the state and the way it’s been trending,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said of Daines. “Clearly the emphasis and focus right now is on recruiting top-tier candidates in those three red states with blue senators.”  National Republicans have recruited candidates to take on Brown and Manchin, but Tester, for now, remains unopposed. Sheehy getting in would be a coup for Daines. As a newcomer to politics, the businessman lacks political baggage and has the ability to self-fund — a key perk given Democratic Senate candidates’ fundraising advantage over Republicans in recent cycles.  Daines’s personal interest in the race arguably makes Tester’s reelection even harder, and the new NRSC chair has shown that he’s willing to try out controversial tactics to win. Last month, Montana Republican state lawmakers moved to restrict the ability of third parties to make the ballot in the 2024 Senate race — widely interpreted as a way to prevent a Libertarian candidate from siphoning off support from the Republican candidate. The initial bill, which was pushed by a lobbyist closely associated with Daines, was narrowly targeted to Tester’s race and would have sunset immediately afterward, drawing charges of partisan interference.  Some Republican lawmakers, facing an uproar from Libertarian constituents, helped kill the bill and said they resented the interference from Washington. Both Republicans and Democrats have benefited from having third-party candidates on the state’s ballot in the past, and it’s unclear that a Libertarian would have boosted Tester anyway.  Advertisement  “The optics just are so bad,” Small, who opposed the effort, said. “I don’t think everybody up here is nuts, and I couldn’t have been the only one that’s thinking that.”  Daines and Tester both had muted responses to the bill’s dying when asked by The Washington Post.  “I respect our legislature and I think they had a good debate,” said Daines. “But I’ll always respect the outcomes of the people who serve in the state legislature.”  Tester didn’t celebrate the fact that the maneuver failed.  “I think that’s fine, but I really wish [the legislature] would have worked on things like child-care and inflation and the price of housing and all that stuff, but they dealt with politics and social issues all session,” he said.  But Messina, the Democratic strategist, said the move “really pissed people off.”  Advertisement  “It shows Daines’s desperation that he tried to rig the rules,” Messina said.  The move drew some blowback from other Republicans, including former governor Marc Racicot, who supported Daines when he ran for the House and Senate but has broken with his party over his opposition to Trump.  “So here they come in with this plan invented in some faraway land called Washington, D.C., with the intent of figuring out ‘How can we beat this guy?’ For what? So we can have a majority? For what?” Racicot said. “That’s a disappointment to me that this is all about only winning.”  “I understand it’s a competitive enterprise,” he added. “But victory at any cost to me is a misplaced set of priorities.”  Democrats bought ads to boost the Libertarian candidate in Tester’s 2012 race, a spokesman for the NRSC pointed out, and Daines has said he supported the effort because he believed the winner of the Senate race should gain a majority of the vote.  Advertisement  Even with the primary rules unchanged, Tester faces a formidable path to reelection, although he’s a prolific fundraiser and skilled on the stump. He raked in $5 million in his first quarter of fundraising, his campaign announced, most of it after he officially jumped into the race in late February. Rosendale, who has not announced he’s running, raised less than $100,000 over the same period.  In 2018, Trump appeared multiple times in the state to campaign against Tester, but the senator pulled off a reelection victory anyway. He touted his independence from the Democratic Party by pointing out in an ad that he helped pass more than a dozen bills that Trump signed into law. But he also led the charge against Trump Veterans Affairs nominee Ronny Jackson, who was forced to withdraw after the senator raised questions about allegations he created a hostile work environment and liberally handed out prescription drugs.  This time, it could be harder for Tester to make the same case of independence, given Democratic President Biden is in the White House. He’s made some moves to distance himself from the White House in recent weeks, including staying coy about whether he will vote for Biden’s labor secretary nominee, Julie Su, whose record as the head of California’s labor agency has drawn Republicans’ opposition. But his voting record remains in line with Democrats.  Advertisement  “What makes it difficult is people have now put on their jerseys and reject the Democratic agenda and Tester has never hidden … that he votes in lockstep with Biden,” Thielman said.  Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Republicans will probably end up tangled up in their own primary fight, which could boost Tester, who can focus on the general election.  “Jon always runs very strong in Montana and he’s only gotten stronger as he’s gotten to know more people through the state,” Peters said.

"political coup","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:03:20","There’s something heartbreaking about the 11th-hour campaign makeover of Turkish opposition presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu – as if a kindly owl has been told he must act like a vicious wolf.  Prior to the first round of voting on May 14, the leader of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) regularly shared folksy videos from his home office surrounded by books. Sitting professorially at an overloaded desk, he stressed democratic values, unity, even love, echoing the 2019 CHP campaign that led to major mayoral victories.  The heart-shaped hand gesture he flashed at his supporters became the defining symbol of his presidential push, and he seemed sincere as he offered personal revelations and talked of pluralism and openness, as in the Alevi video seen by more than 100 million people.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu gives a press conference in Ankara on May 18. AFP  But in the past week, as Mr Kilicdaroglu has begun to vie for the 5 per cent of voters who backed ultranationalist Sinan Ogan in the first round, gone are the books, the desk, and the warmth. With a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of Turkey and the CHP, keeping watch over his shoulder, he stands straight, punctuates each point with his hands, and speaks with an urgency bordering on anger.  He said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the governing AKP welcomed 10 million Syrian refugees – which is about three times the real figure and the same total repeated by Mr Ogan and his nativist, far-right partner Umit Ozdag.  Quote The likelier outcome of Sunday’s vote is a victory for the incumbent  He said that a vote for Mr Erdogan – who last week vowed to send a million Syrians back home – would open the door to 10 million more refugees. “This unruly flood of people flowing into our veins [would] threaten our survival,” Mr Kilicdaroglu warned. “Our women won’t be able to walk the streets.”  He linked Mr Erdogan to the outlawed religious group accused of plotting the 2016 failed coup and described AKP partner Huda Par, a Kurdish-Islamist party, as criminals. He even offered a commemoration for Sinan Ates, the recently assassinated former leader of the ultranationalist Grey Wolves, which is linked to the AKP’s far-right partner MHP.  Suddenly disguised in wolf’s clothing, Mr Kilicdaroglu’s shift has a whiff of desperation. Perhaps he hopes his populist pivot will draw much-needed support – a prominent Twitter astrologist recently explained how the stars are in Mr Kilicdaroglu’s favour.  But the likelier outcome of Sunday’s vote is a victory for the incumbent, particularly after Mr Ogan said yesterday that he is backing Mr Erdogan in the run-off. If that is indeed the result, these may well be Mr Kilicdaroglu’s last days on the national stage. If so, his legacy would be of a bland, hard-working party steward who mounted a sustained challenge to Turkey’s longest-reigning leader, but could never get over the hump.  Hope, for Turkey’s opposition, looks set to die with a whimper, possibly marking the end of an era. It went largely unremarked at the time, but May 14, the date of the first round, was also the date of Turkey’s first multi-party elections, back in 1950. Now the run-off is set for May 28 – the date that marks the start, 10 years ago, of the Gezi Park protests.  Turkish newspaper reports on the presidential election results in Istanbul, on May 15. Bloomberg  I lived in Istanbul at the time and regularly braved the tear gas to visit the vibrant, ad-hoc encampment hundreds of demonstrators had set up in the city’s central square. From there, a wave of dissent and disenchantment with the AKP spread like wildfire, spurring about 3 million Turks across the country to take to the streets.  Turkish authorities soon cleared Gezi Park and quelled the protests, but in the months and years that followed Gezi inspired new political parties, urban movements, and activist outfits, and came to shape the opposition’s political strategy.  Turkey is set to hold local elections next year, but those are focused on cities and have little impact on the national government. We might soon look back and say that the Gezi era lasted a decade, bookended by that initial protest wave and this run-off, the apparent capstone to Mr Erdogan’s singular political journey. I've already heard from some CHP-voting friends in Turkey who are now thinking of leaving the country.  This would not mark a new trend: news outlets have been reporting on a Turkish brain drain for years, prompted by economic hardship, few opportunities, and curbs on free speech. But the trickle seems to be building into a steady stream.  The number of Turkish citizens looking to cross into the US over the Mexican border, for instance, has increased more than two-thirds since January. Given the lingering economic crisis, says Imdat Oner, an analyst at the US-based Jack D Gordon Institute for Public Policy, “the number of Turkish people immigrating to the West isn't going to slow down”.  It's hard to know how this might affect Turkey, but it seems clear that the next major challenge mounted by Turkey’s progressive-minded opposition will be led by a new generation of leaders, such as Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul CHP chief Canan Kaftancioglu, and Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas.  Mr Imamoglu, who is currently against appealing a two-year jail sentence and political ban for insulting Turkey’s top election board, may have given us an early glimpse of the future last week. Appearing on a TV news panel, he recounted how a group of 4th graders had recently asked him whether he's a terrorist, then used their query to argue that the government had created a fearful people.  More from David Lepeska Erdogan stuns Turkey, and the world, with another triumph  It seemed just the sort of astute political manoeuvring Mr Kilicdaroglu has lacked. In response to Mr Imamoglu’s appearance, political analyst Selim Sazak said he felt that sooner or later the Istanbul mayor would be positioned to “determine the fate of this country"".  The AKP may have this same concern. Last week, Istanbul party spokesman Murat Turkyilmaz said he had an expanded file on Mr Imamoglu, who ""would be dealt with"" after the election. The AKP's leader, meanwhile, is readying major plans for a possible new term, including a huge celebration of the republic’s centennial in October and an overhaul of the Turkish constitution.  Asked during a CNN interview aired on Friday if his vision for Turkey’s constitution included a change that would allow him to remain president for another decade, Mr Erdogan responded, with a grin, that this process would end auspiciously.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jb21tZW50LzIwMjMvMDUvMjMva2lsaWNkYXJvZ2x1cy1kZWZlYXQtbWF5LW1hcmstdGhlLWVuZC1vZi1hbi1lcmEtaW4tdHVya2lzaC1wb2xpdGljcy_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlbmF0aW9uYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnQvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9raWxpY2Rhcm9nbHVzLWRlZmVhdC1tYXktbWFyay10aGUtZW5kLW9mLWFuLWVyYS1pbi10dXJraXNoLXBvbGl0aWNzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-01","10:00:00","{""TaipeiCity"", ""TaipeiCity"", ""Taiwan""}","2023-05-22T08:00:00","Written by Max Dixon.  Image credit: 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC（Taiwan）/ Facebook.  Liz Truss, MP for South West Norfolk and British Prime Minister for 44 days, visited Taiwan last week, between May 16th and May 20th, meeting with senior officials, including William Lai, the frontrunner to replace current President Tsai Ing-wen, and giving a keynote speech to the Prospect Foundation that called for a more stringent British approach to China. Ostensibly the visit of a former Prime Minister has been heralded as a coup for Taipei in emboldening the position of Taiwan in the global imagination amidst growing Chinese assertiveness; indeed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has welcomed Truss’ visit.  However, Liz Truss is not Nancy Pelosi. Indeed, it is important to contextualise the role of Liz Truss in British politics, as an examination of Britain’s shortest-serving Prime Minister invites serious questions about the rationale and advisability of her visit. Following the resignation of Boris Johnson in July 2022, Truss defeated her future successor Rishi Sunak in a Conservative Party leadership contest before overseeing a disastrous ‘mini budget’ of tax cuts that sparked an economic crisis and led to her resignation. The scale and speed of the collapse of Truss’s government led to ridicule, including British Tabloid the Daily Star infamously live-streaming the gradual spoiling of a supermarket lettuce in a race to outlast Liz Truss, a race the lettuce won.  A long-standing advocate for Taiwan  However, after reflection, Truss sought to resurrect her reputation as a prominent foreign policy campaigner within British politics, which developed during her roles as Secretary of State for International Trade and Foreign Secretary during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, Truss’s position on Taiwan is not ephemeral; Truss implored NATO to extend its protection to Taiwan following Russia’s invasion, was vocal in her support for Taiwan during the fallout of Pelosi’s visit and championed links between British industry and Taiwan’s renewable energy sector as International Trade secretary. Moreover, Truss has long advocated for greater clarity in the UK’s ambiguous position on China, adding credence to her championing of Taiwan and Taiwanese democracy in her speech. As such, it would be incorrect to label Truss’s visit to Taiwan as a consequence of fleeting interest in an eminent foreign policy issue. An obvious comparison to Boris Johnson’s continual advocacy for Ukraine and friendship with Volodymyr Zelenskyy is apt; [MMU1] there is substance to Truss’s support for Taiwan, even if the reputational rehabilitation invites questions of authenticity.  Conservative Party Tumult  Enter Alicia Kearns MP, a rising foreign policy voice in the Conservative Party and elected Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Following the announcement of Truss’s visit, Kearns denounced the move as ‘the worst kind of example of Instagram diplomacy’ in reference to Truss’s penchant for imitating former Conservative Prime Minister Margret Thatcher on foreign policy trips. It is perhaps not a coincidence that Thatcher was the last major British politician to visit Taiwan. Kearns argued that Truss’s trip would escalate Cross-Strait tensions and was, in its motivations, entirely performative and, crucially, equated to a ‘petty political attack’ on Rishi Sunak. This final rebuke is evocative of the Conservative Party melodrama that has defined British politics in recent years and offers clear grounds for questioning the motivations of Truss’s trip to Taiwan. Finally, a spokesperson for Truss issued a stinging rebuke to Kearns, likely emerging perhaps from Kearns’s role in the ‘Pork Pie Plot’, named after a delicacy from Kearns’s Rutland constituency, to oust Truss’s close political ally Boris Johnson in early 2022. Truss rejected the accusation that her trip amounted to little more than a bid to remain relevant, arguing that her invitation from the Taiwanese Government trumped the reservations of an MP from Rutland.  However, Truss’s visit has drawn attention to the increasing insufficiency of Rishi Sunak’s government’s ambiguity on China, and specifically Taiwan, inviting a range of discussions in the mainstream British media, ranging from support of Taiwan being tantamount to Sinophobia to the recognition that the UK needs to have a ‘serious conversation’ about Cross-Strait relations. It is equivalent to a revival of the foreign policy debates, often won by Truss, that defined the Conservative leadership race of 2022. It is a Conservative party squabbling writ large on the international stage, yet it has evidently further animated Taiwan in British perceptions.  An unadvisable visit?  Liz Truss’s visit has further bolstered understanding of the precarity of Taiwan’s position vis-à-vis China within British politics and amongst the British public. In part due to Truss’s swift equivalence to Ukraine, discussion of Taiwan has risen considerably in Parliament, whilst Britons are becoming increasingly wary of China in light of incursions into Hong Kong, the emergence of COVID-19 and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.  The visit of a former Prime Minister, breaking convention in British politics where it is expected a former leader won’t challenge existing British foreign policy, will instigate further debates on the United Kingdom’s approach to the ‘Taiwan Issue’. This raising profile is a clear success for Taiwan’s assiduous nation-building campaigns. Yet, the extent to which China will recognise Liz Truss’s authority to defer any form of pressure on Beijing’s Cross-Strait approach remains to be seen, with effective CCP spokesperson Vincent Gao offering only a perfunctory rebuke, whilst the Global Times centred its critique on the ‘washed-up political figure’ of Truss, arguing that it will have no impact on the Cross-Strait situation.  In contrast to the strident criticism levied at Nancy Pelosi, such rebukes appear to be considerably muted. Whilst China has continued its persistent aerial ‘sorties’, incursions in Taiwan’s airspace, there was no marked increase accompanying Truss’s visit to Taiwan, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Defence, which regularly documents incursions on its Twitter page. Judging by Beijing’s taunting reproach towards Truss, it is unlikely that any further PLAAF show of force comparable to that which accompanied Pelosi’s visit will follow the former Prime Minister’s trip.  Indeed, if the accusations of Alicia Kearns are correct, the most significant outcome of the visit will be to heap pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to take a harder line on China and to provide ‘hard power’ to Taiwan. This message is likely to resonate with China-sceptic Conservative MPs, even if Truss herself remains an object of derision, and would shift the Overton window of the UK’s China approach closer to the position held by key UK allies, the United States and Australia. Intriguingly Kearns, in a visit of her own to Taipei in 2022, discussed strengthening the UK’s defence cooperation with Taiwan, whilst Kearns has herself critiqued the ambiguity of Sunak’s approach to a ‘Taiwan Issue’. To this end, it appears that there is an affinity between both MPs’ positions on Taiwan, a key issue that British foreign policy in its current form cannot address. It is only due to the political machinations in the battle for the direction of the Conservative Party that the spat has emerged.  However, Truss and Kearns differ in how Taiwan is recognised, and an examination of this difference is crucial to understanding the emerging salience of Taiwan in British foreign policy. The former Prime Minister’s position appears to be fuelled by the geopolitical significance of Taiwan, where the ‘most dangerous place on Earth’ and its defence offers an evocative platform upon which to build a politically potent ‘strong line on China’. Conversely, Kearns’s analysis emphasises the twenty-three million people of Taiwan, who endure the consequences of such visits, arguing that they ‘overwhelmingly wish not to rock the boat, but to be left to live in a functionally autonomous, liberal democracy’. Such an approach, cognisant of the complexity inherent, for example, in the role of Taiwanese independence within Taiwan’s governing DPP party, provides a considerably more nuanced approach and, for Kearns, offers a potent attack on the perceived one-dimensional nature of Truss and her wing of the Conservative Party. However, either approach boosts Taiwan’s image in the United Kingdom.  Taiwan still wins  Truss’s visit can be considered a success for Taiwan; in light of her insignificance, it amounted to a low risk visit where the material ramifications deferred by China appear to have been relatively restrained. Yet, the visit of a former Prime Minister has drawn attention in the UK, however fleeting, to Cross-Strait relations and has already seen Taiwan grow in the British consciousness, carried by the perpetual drama of Conservative quarrels. Although this is undoubtedly beneficial for Taipei, it has instigated foreign policy debates in the British media and has elicited reactions within Sunak’s government and the Foreign Office, where officials were said to be ‘aghast’ by Truss’s visit. Moreover, given Liz Truss’s record on Taiwan, an optimist may view the visit as a further confirmation of her support for democracy as Foreign Secretary. However, even if Alicia Kearns is right, and Truss is indeed seeking to revive her career by using Taiwan as an intriguing Instagram backdrop, such is the nature of her tarnished reputation, she poses minimal risk to Cross-Strait relations, a talking point as opposed to a turning point. Either way, Taiwan wins, as by virtue of the very debate Truss inspires, more policymakers and voters in the United Kingdom have read and will continue to read about Taiwan over the coming days. With every column inch and podcast, growing demands that the UK further clarifies its position on Taiwan will emerge.

The right thing to do is for the people who love Liberia to continue to raise awareness to motivate people to work together through the Rule of Law to transform the prevailing UNFAIR electoral system to the enduring FAIR electoral system.  There continues to be a lot of talk in Liberia about the Running Mate. This plenty talk is about the Running Mate to the Main Runner for the Presidency of Liberia. The Presidential Candidates have been placed under immense societal pressure to select Running Mates. This pressure continues because some Presidential Candidates have not selected their respective Running Mates as yet.  The reality is that some Running Mates have been selected because they are considered to be vote getters. In effect, these vote getters are Second Mates rather than Running Mates. They are Second Mates because they do not have the records to occupy the Office of the Presidency. Their selection also means that the Main Runners/Presidential Candidates also do not have the records to occupy the Office of the Presidency.  It is only on the basis of record, what has been done well, that any Candidate can stand up to occupy any elected office, especially the Presidency and Vice Presidency. The Candidates do not have records of helping to solve the main societal problem in Liberia. This problem is longstanding and widespread poverty that has become the pretext for violence, which, at times, takes the forms of coup d'etat and civil war, experienced by Liberians. On the basis of this horrific experience, Liberians declare that they prefer Peace to War.  There should not be any surprise to anyone who realizes that societal problems continue because the Candidates elected do not have the relevant records for their respective offices. In leading by example, my Running Mate was Dr. Saye Guannu.  While presenting Dr. Guannu to the Media, some questions were posed to me by the Media members and they were surprised when I referred them to Dr. Guannu for the answers. My referral was due to the fact that if a person were not to have the record to be a Running Mate, he or she could not serve as a Running Mate and should not serve as Main Runner.  I had no expectation of getting elected because of the UNFAIR /UNCONSTITUTIONAL electoral system that continues today. I was a Main Runner because of the need to raise awareness to motivate the people to work together through the Rule of Law to change the UNFAIR system into the FAIR system.  When the results from the election came out, my Running Mate received 26 votes from his Home Town, where there were over 2000 registered members of his Political Party! Here we are going into the General and Presidential Election in October 2023 when not a single national religious leader, political leader, civil society leader, government leader and foreign partner leader is concerned about the high likelihood of post election violence because the upcoming election will not be FAIR!!!  The right thing to do is for the people who love Liberia to continue to raise awareness to motivate people to work together through the Rule of Law to transform the prevailing UNFAIR electoral system to the enduring FAIR electoral system.  It is only through this transformation that persons with good records can get elected to bring the system of Justice, the indispensable ingredient for Peace and Progress in Liberia and in any other Country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubGliZXJpYW5vYnNlcnZlci5jb20vcnVubmluZy1tYXRlLW5vdC1zZWNvbmQtbWF0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-23T02:05:09","An unprecedented crackdown against Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has prompted concerns that it could be outlawed. DW looks at whether a possible ban would be more likely to hurt or help the former PM.  Any attempt to dissolve the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party would likely plunge Pakistan into a deeper political crisis — not to mention boost the former prime minister's popularity, analysts have warned.  Police have arrested more than 7,500 PTI members and supporters since Khan's arrest on May 9 triggered deadly riots and attacks on Pakistani military installations.  The PTI complained that hundreds of its workers and leaders, including former Human Rights Minister Shirin Mazari, had been rearrested even after they were granted bail by courts.  Khan has incensed the military  Pakistani authorities warned that those suspected of being involved in the violent protests would face trials in the country's controversial military courts — a platform typically reserved for enemies of the state.  The decision to try civilians under army laws has been slammed by rights groups.  Over a dozen PTI parliamentarians, former ministers and office bearers have deserted Khan since the attacks on military installations. He asserted that they had been pressured into parting ways with him.  He has been highly critical of the country's military since his ouster from power last year.  And earlier this month, he even accused the military of abducting him — a claim that infuriated the army, which slammed it as being completely baseless.  Putting the PTI under pressure  Anyone who challenges Pakistan's army faces the wrath of the nation's most powerful institution, Karachi-based analyst Tauseef Ahmed Khan pointed out. He told DW that the former prime minister might be prosecuted and banned from running for re-election.  ""Such pressure will affect the party, forcing leaders to part ways with Khan. So, in a way, it will be dismantled,"" he said.  Rights groups have urged all political stakeholders to sit together and resolve the crisis Image: Fayaz Aziz/REUTERS  Asma Shirazi, an Islamabad-based commentator, agreed that Khan's party might not be able to survive the pressure  Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US and a scholar at Hudson Institute in Washington, echoed Shirazi's sentiments: ""Khan's party will subsequently emerge as a much smaller party than it currently seems,"" he said.  Would a ban dent Khan's popularity?  But for now the former prime minister remains Pakistan's most popular leader. Noor Fatima, an Islamabad-based academic, believes that a ban on his party would do more harm to his rivals than to Khan himself.  She told DW that it would not be a ""wise decision,"" adding that political plurality strengthened democracy. ""If the government ends this plurality by banning PTI, it will damage the democratic credentials of the ruling parties, affecting their vote banks, not that of Khan's,"" she said.    Exclusive: Imran Khan speaks to DW from his besieged home To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video  Sadia, an activist from Okara in the province of Punjab said that if the PTI was outlawed, this could serve as a precedent: ""We don't like the PTI's way of politics but would strongly oppose banning any political party. Such a ban would spell disaster for the democratic future of the country,"" she said.  Tauseef Ahmed Khan posited that a ban would further consolidate the position of the army. ""It will create an impression that democratic parties are not capable of dealing with political crises,"" he suggested, saying that "" politicians should avoid banning the PTI"" and resolve issues ""through dialogue.""  History repeating itself?  If Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is banned, it will not be the first party to be outlawed after drawing the ire of the Pakistan army.  In the 1960s, the religious Jamaat-e-Islami party was outlawed. During the 1970s, the left-wing National Awami Party was also declared illegal.  A number of sectarian and religious organizations were outlawed under General Pervez Musharraf, who ruled the country for nearly nine years after seizing power in a military coup in 1999.  The Karachi-based Muttahida Qaumi Movement has also faced an unofficial ban in the past, as did the Pakistan People's Party during the military dictatorship of General Zia-ul Haq from 1977 to 1988.

"political coup","2003-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:59:37","Editor’s note: This essay is available in our print issue, Godfathers: An Introduction. Buy the issue here.  As far back as 1977 when Ali Mazrui published his book, Africa’s International Relations, the prominent political writer and scholar described Nigeria as a country ‘on its way to becoming the first major black power in modern international politics’. At the time, Nigeria was famous for its non-alignment principle during the Cold War. After independence, the Tafawa Balewa administration repeatedly affirmed Nigeria’s vision for steering regional and continental growth, making Africa the focus of its foreign policy. To back this up, Nigeria’s first National Development Plan (1962-1968) was launched as part of an overall strategy to foster the country’s capacity to become, ‘the industrial heart of an African Common Market’.  What Balewa’s administration could not achieve due to its short-lived tenure (he was assassinated in 1966), the Yakubu Gowon administration (1966-75), after the Civil War, would partly bring to fruition. The plan to forge an African Common Market, starting with an integrated sub-region to make Nigeria an industrial powerhouse spurred Gowon’s diplomatic alliances and politics in West Africa towards the realization of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1975.  Since 1975, however, Nigeria has neither become the major Black power it was expected to be nor the industrial powerhouse it sought to become. Not only has economic growth been five times slower since the turn of the current millennium, but investors’ confidence has also reduced and consequently Foreign Direct Investments. Nigeria saw a 69 per cent drop in its FDI from $2.3 billion in 2014 to $699 million in 2021. Not least, export value is on the decline. According to a recent Stears article, the volume of Nigeria’s export in 2021 ($47.3 billion) was 68 per cent lower than the number in 2012 ($146.4 billion). Nigeria only exports raw materials, not finished goods, and enduring challenges of insecurity, corruption, theft and vandalism have crippled its production capacity and consequently limited its earning potential.  By these accounts, it makes sense that the focus of the next president should be seeking long-term solutions to these domestic issues. Yet one ignored but equally important discussion point is the impact that Nigeria’s challenges have on the West African sub-region and the benefits regional stability and integration would have on Nigeria’s domestic and international interests. Nigerian politics matter at home and abroad, particularly for West Africa. Likewise, West Africa’s stability or otherwise matters and has real implications for Nigeria. Unlike the Muhammadu Buhari administration, Nigeria’s next administration cannot afford to neglect foreign policy in favour of an overemphasis on domestic issues.  A stable Nigeria is crucial to the progress of West Africa and vice versa. Therefore, leaders cannot continue to treat regional issues with disinterest or little interest at best. Alongside fostering peace and development at home, the incoming president should also develop a bold and assertive foreign policy for West Africa. Top on the agenda should be rallying West African leaders to forge a common defence policy to address insecurity and terrorism; more active participation in peacekeeping through ECOWAS and African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council where Nigeria is the longest-serving member, and more effort to coordinate regional integration through cultural education.  The traditional argument is that Nigeria needs to resolve its internal issues before it can address external concerns. However, foreign affairs are not unconnected to Nigeria’s domestic realities. Therefore, the challenge before the next president is to develop unique strategies to address both domestic and foreign issues concurrently.  NIGERIA AND THE BIG STATE CONUNDRUM  The question about the role of big states in Africa has been on for several years. Countries like Nigeria, with economic and political clout, are expected to step up to influence reforms across the continent. Nigeria in previous years has lived up to such expectations. In past years, Nigeria has constantly leveraged political and economic influence to advance its national interest but also foster regional cooperation and advocate for African development. Several regional and continental initiatives have been launched in Nigeria or driven by the Nigerian governments of the past.  Nigeria was crucial to the formation of ECOWAS in 1975, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963 which later became the AU in 2002, and the African Development Bank in 1964. During the military rule, Nigeria worked to ensure stability in West Africa deploying troops and funds through the ECOWAS Monitoring Group to end civil wars in Liberia under Ibrahim Babangida’s regime in 1990 and Sierra Leone under Sani Abacha’s regime in 1998. Nigeria was also well-positioned as a defender of democracy and peace and stability within the continent in the years since the return to democracy, particularly under Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration. An example was when the then-president of São Tomé and Príncipe, Fradique de Menezes, was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2003. Menezes was visiting President Obasanjo in Nigeria to discuss oil development when the coup happened. Nigeria with other African and international partners worked to restore São Tomé’s president a week later, with Obasanjo escorting him back to his country in the presidential jet.  Through the years, Obasanjo was the president who really advanced a conscientious foreign policy. The end of his tenure in 2007 is now synonymous with the end of the golden era of Nigeria’s foreign policy. Nigeria’s past international engagements have not been without criticisms though. There was opposition from members of the public to the peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Sierra Leone mainly on the grounds of corruption and lack of freedom at home. Obasanjo was often criticized for placing foreign considerations above domestic issues.  During his first few years in office, President Muhammadu Buhari showed enthusiasm on working with regional leaders. He pushed for a multilateral approach to addressing insecurity through the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), which was launched in 2014 with three other Lake Chad countries, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. His enthusiasm and prioritization of regional cooperation then showed in his visits to Chad, Cameroon, Benin and Niger as soon as he assumed office from June to August 2015. He also disbursed funds in 2015, $21 million out of $100 million pledged to the MNJTF. His efforts then boosted the morale of the leaders and troops of the other countries that made up the MNJTF.  But since then, the MNJTF has been plagued by poor funding, the military offensives have not been properly coordinated, and historical and ongoing mistrust due to border disputes, and inadequate support among member countries have led to reduced collaboration and intelligence sharing. As a result, the MNJTF, which started with some victory over Boko Haram, has been unable to conquer the jihadist group. Rather, Boko Haram has split into multiple factions.  In December 2019, Chad recalled more than 1,000 of its troops from Nigeria without adequate communication with other MNJTF members. Then Chadian president, Idriss Déby, complained that his troops did most of the fighting with insufficient support from Nigeria or its neighbours. The perception was that the Nigerian side showed little effort and its weakness to handle the crisis continued to cause resentment about the spillage of the Boko Haram crisis to the Lake Chad region.  In recent years, Nigeria has been silent on the international front. There has not been a major effort to address cross-border insecurity and terrorism crises from Buhari’s government, beyond vows and calls for cooperation at regional events. There was an instance when President Buhari donated N1.4 billion worth of vehicles to Niger Republic, which could be considered a misplaced priority. While this shows in some sense a renewed, if late, commitment to cultivating regional relationships again, the move arguably was not adequately calculated and not properly communicated. Nigeria was also hesitant and was one of the last to join the African Continental Free Trade Area, even though there has been sustained advocacy for an African common market since Balewa’s administration.  For one thing, the challenges that Nigeria faces today, years since Obasanjo’s internationalist orientation, have changed. Insecurity has worsened, poverty has deepened as have other socio-economic woes. At the same time, West Africa is facing diverse new and existing challenges exacerbated by climate change, poor leadership and the historical malformation of the sub-region. That Buhari’s focus has been on domestic issues is, therefore, understandable.  The incoming leader, however, faces unique challenges at a crucial period in Nigerian and world history. As Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, said in 2022, Nigeria must properly define the foreign policy terms in which it engages an ever-changing and dynamic world. When faced with two inevitable choices, following President Buhari’s path by focusing overly on domestic affairs or creating a new mode of engaging with local and international issues, the incoming president should be encouraged to forge a new path. He should fashion unique approaches in a way that ensures a balanced focus on domestic and foreign affairs across all critical areas including security, trade, and peacebuilding.  THE LONG PATH TO A SUCCESSFUL SECURITY PACT  The insecurity crisis in West Africa and the Sahel needs decisive actions as it has dragged on for too long. This is the time for coordinated action amongst West African states against organized crime, insurgency and terrorism. Nigeria should lead coordinated efforts in partnership with suitable external parties.  The nature of the insecurity crisis is complex, dynamic and ever-evolving. As such, a one-size-fits-all approach cannot work. Moreover, any counterinsurgency move that doesn’t consider the lives or human rights of community members would be counterintuitive. At the same time, trying to solve insecurity without resolving corruption would be ineffective. Corruption, state dysfunction and lack of trust in governments motivate insurgents to want to create alternative governments. On the other hand, corruption among public officials and security forces through defence procurement has over the years hampered serious interventions, leading to a lack of resources and proper remunerations for soldiers on battlefronts. Military forces of respective countries in the sub-region are over-stretched because of having to deal with multiple threats and security crises. Thus, the next president needs to focus on the process of designing solutions to this multi-layered and dynamic security crisis alongside regional leaders and multilateral stakeholders.  In December 2022, leaders from ECOWAS countries said they were working towards creating a regional peacekeeping force to combat jihadism. However, no specific details as to when and how this regional force would be established and its processes have been provided. The defence ministers have agreed to meet in the second half of 2023 to discuss this. The challenge is that leaders work too slowly in creating solutions to crises that don’t wait for them. The next administration should make urgent efforts to coordinate regional action on this. They should also draw lessons from the structural, funding and procurement challenges that hampered the effectiveness of the much smaller MNJTF.  Even though West Africa has the most open visa policy among the regional economic communities in Africa, the porosity of its borders has led to the infiltration of armed groups and the illegal sale of arms. Partly in response to this, between 2019 and 2021 Nigeria closed its borders, preventing the movement of goods from neighbouring countries. This policy which contradicts the Freedom of Movement Protocols of ECOWAS aimed to prevent the import of agricultural products and illegal arms trading, in a bid to promote domestic production and curb insecurity.  While its intention was no doubt noble, the border closure wasn’t deemed successful. Nigerian manufacturers lost out on cross-border trading and insecurity worsened during the period. It also led to an increase in food inflation. This led to high food prices which gave smugglers incentives to keep importing. The border closure was criticized by neighbouring countries, including Ghana whose traders complained the closure had negative impact on their businesses. Nigerian’s exports to West Africa which was valued at N2.2 trillion in 2019 before the border closure and subsequent pandemic has not returned to such peak levels.  As this shows, the border closure was not very effective in curbing insecurity and was not helpful for the economy. This re-emphasizes the need for addressing insecurity and corruption on a regional scale through innovative means.  FOSTERING PEACE AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION THROUGH CULTURAL EDUCATION  The West African sub-region has been engulfed in political instability with bouts of military coups. Mali has recently witnessed two coups while Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Guinea Bissau have recently witnessed one failed or successful coup attempt. In December 2022, The Gambia also foiled a coup attempt with eight soldiers charged with treason.  There were fears that Nigeria could also plunge into a similar situation in 2022 but the military reassured there were no such plans. Now that the elections episode which has dominated the national politics for almost a year is relatively behind, the incoming president must begin to devise ways to spearhead solutions for the troubles across the West African sub-region. For one, the region’s volatility and instability call for regional support, one Nigeria has experience leading. The ECOWAS region can be so much more, but it is lacking effective leadership.  Recent reports from the Institute for Insecurity Studies on the AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) have also resounded the call for big states with political and economic influence to take on more leadership roles to drive agendas that promote a stable, peaceful and prosperous continent. The role of big states in driving such progress was evident when the OAU was transformed into the AU. The PSC was established, in part, to provide an enhanced avenue for nations to take on leadership roles on the continent. Part of the responsibilities of its members are to participate in peacebuilding and conflict resolution efforts within their region and Africa. Nigeria is the longest-serving member of the PSC and has served for 18 years since it was established. That Nigeria is the only member that has been part of this important council for that long again emphasizes Nigeria’s strategic importance. It is high time Nigeria lived up to the actions expected of it in facilitating defence policies and promoting peace and stability in the West African region and Africa by extension.  As the government intervenes abroad, it needs to pay attention to the cases of violence at home. There is a need for dialogue with agitators from the Indigenous People of Biafra in the South East to addressing banditry and terrorism from groups such as Boko Haram in the North. Unaddressed crises at home can drive instability in the sub-region and, as such, the next president will need to show that he is a president for all and not just the section of the country that voted for him. There should be initiatives, in his first few months in office, to carry along the already aggrieved south-eastern part of the country. His cabinet should also reflect that conscious decision to carry everybody along. The president should pay visits to the South East and hear directly from the community members their agitations and seek community-led efforts to address the issues tabled. The sit-at-home directive prevalent in parts of the South East is already hurting the region. Long-lasting peace efforts are therefore needed to quell tensions and end the crisis of unknown gunmen.  Should domestic violence remain unaddressed, this could impact neighbouring countries. Unrest and violence could lead to an influx of people into neighbouring countries that are unprepared to deal with such issues. Nigeria’s inability to tackle existing insecurity issues has already affected neighbouring countries. The Boko Haram crisis has extended to Chad, Niger, and Cameroon while neighbouring Benin is also experiencing the crisis of kidnapping for ransom which is believed to be a spillover from Nigeria.  These crises—particularly those around religious extremism and ethnic conflict—cannot only be addressed through guns and bullets. More collaboration and integration could foster innovative solutions. Not much emphasis is placed on it, but cultural diplomacy could unlock massive potential for collaboration within the subregion and within the country.  Messaging would be important for the next administration. There is a National Orientation Agency which is not active. There should be appropriate campaigns from the ground up, through all forms of mass media, consistently and over the long term, preaching a message of peace, religious tolerance, principles of love and the values of the country’s ethnic diversities. This is more domestic but in terms of regional scale, more cultural exchange programs can be launched between respective countries to foster collaboration, dialogue, research, innovation and problem-solving among youths of respective countries while developing them to be ambassadors for these values. These are long-term strategies that can better position Nigeria and the West African region to harness the true strength of the diversity and enormous potential in the subregion rather than be hampered by intolerance and lack of cooperation.  Regional efforts without appropriate domestic considerations and initiatives could inevitably lead to wasted efforts. Without peace and stable economic growth at home, Nigeria’s international efforts would not be deemed credible. The important thing, therefore, is not to overemphasize one to the detriment of the other. Nigeria needs technocratic and visionary leadership that not only manages the domestic economy but is poised to reposition the country’s standing in the comity of nations. Nigeria needs to focus on creating a stable and friendly regional atmosphere and improving its industrial and productive capacity. This is easier said than done, but it is nonetheless what the incoming president ought to start thinking about when compiling profiles of members of his cabinet and heads of strategic foreign missions⎈  The views, thoughts, and opinions published in The Republic belong solely to the author and are not necessarily the views of The Republic or its editors.

"political coup","2019-03-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T07:35:54","Istanbul, Turkey – Istanbul’s skyline has been rapidly transforming over the years as towering new skyscrapers pop up and expansive bridges connect the metropolis that spans two continents.  Since 2019, Grand Camlica Mosque – which stretches over 57,500sq metres (620,000sq feet) and has six minarets and a towering central dome – has been the most visible structure on the Anatolian side of Turkey’s cultural capital.  Perched on the hill after which it is named, the now-largest mosque in Turkey opened its doors to the public on March 7, 2019, as a place of worship as well as a symbol of state pride and Turkish national identity.  Since the establishment of the modern republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, Turkish nationalism has been largely defined by secular symbols that lean away from religion and the country’s Ottoman past.  As president of the early republic, Ataturk outlawed the fez and turban – two forms of Ottoman male headgear – and later the headscarf was banned in state institutions. He also transformed the Turkish language from Arabic to Latin script, moved the capital city from the Ottoman epicentre of Constantinople – later known as Istanbul – to a newly established Ankara, and replaced religious courts with a European-inspired legal system.  Although the “headscarf ban” was notably overturned by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which came to power 20 years ago, religious symbols have remained distinct from the secular Turkish state.  Yet, Camlica Mosque reflects how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to challenge the secular narrative of Turkish nationalism by attempting to connect state pride to an Ottoman past and an Islamic heritage.  “The main objective of the 1923 Turkish revolution was to create a new nation and national identity by fighting the old one,” said Turkish sociologist Ferhat Kentel. “To do this, the Kemalists cut ties with Ottoman times.”  “The same goes with AK Party. It used religious and Ottoman symbolism, such as Camlica Mosque, but especially Hagia Sophia Mosque, to cut ties with the Kemalist regime,” he added.  Strong symbolism  Hayriye Gul, one of the two female architects behind the design of the complex, told Al Jazeera that the structure aimed to contribute to the silhouette of Istanbul in a modern and practical way while reflecting traditional Turco-Islamic architecture.  “It’s a modern version of the traditional mosque which included a madrassa [school] and hammam [public bath]. To suit today’s needs, it has a conference hall, parking lot and library,” said Gul.  For Gul and her co-architect Bahar Mizrak, the building also evokes a sense of national pride.  “As Turkish citizens and architects, we’re proud to be part of building such a monumental mosque during the republican era,” said Mizrak.  Designed as a successor to Ottoman-era mosques, the complex is inspired by the work of the empire’s chief architect Mimar Sinan who built Istanbul’s famous Suleymaniye Mosque, among 300 other structures.  Camlica Mosque includes a prayer hall that can hold about 60,000 people, a museum, a gallery, art workshops, a library and a conference hall, and has many symbolic features that link Turkish and Ottoman history to national identity.  Seen from anywhere in the city centre, the mosque’s main dome stands 72 metres (236 feet) tall to represent the 72 ethnic groups in Turkey and spans 34 metres (111 feet) to represent the city of Istanbul’s number plate.  Four minarets are 107.1 metres (351 feet) high, signifying the Manzikert Victory of 1071 which saw Seljuk Turks, led by King Alp Arslan, crush an imperial Byzantine army said to be twice their size.  Inside the dome, 16 names attributed to God in Islam are artistically drawn to signify the 16 Great Turkic Empires before the establishment of the modern republic. The number 16 also features in Turkey’s presidential seal, with its large 16-pointed sun surrounded by 16 five-pointed stars to symbolise the Turkish Republic and the 16 great empires.  Linking to more religious symbols, the complex has five smaller domes that represent the five pillars of Islam, and eight monumental doors to represent the eight gates to heaven, according to Muslim belief.  Nationalist projects, messaging  While some observers have linked the decision to build Camlica Mosque to the government’s 2020 reconversion of Hagia Sophia and the 2017 construction of a mosque in Taksim – a square associated with secularism and republicanism, others say the former is part of the government’s political manoeuvring.  “There was a need to build a mosque in Taksim because there wasn’t any, and the reconversion of Hagia Sophia was a historic promise of the conservatives, not of Erdogan. But Camlica Mosque was never needed, Osman Sert, PanoramaTR research director, told Al Jazeera.  “Camlica Mosque was a political decision and part of a series of nationalist projects launched by Erdogan and the AK Party to build national pride at a time when they have little to offer in terms of economic development,” he added.  Over the past five years, Turkey’s economic crisis has seen the Turkish lira drop to historic lows and people’s concerns over the cost of living grow. Meanwhile, Turkey has undertaken a range of political and economic measures to boost its national pride and independence.  Among those projects are TOGG, the first ever Turkish-made electric car launched in 2022, the TCG Anadolu, an amphibious assault ship and Turkey’s first landing platform dock in 2023; and Camlica Tower, a huge telecommunications tower inaugurated in 2021 as Istanbul’s tallest.  Erdogan has also invoked nationalist messaging during his electoral campaign ahead of the May 14 vote by incorporating the country’s centenary celebration into slogans, and promising that the next 100 years will be the “Century of Turkey”.  According to Sert, Erdogan’s nationalist rhetoric has particularly spiked since the 2016 coup attempt which could have seen his government overthrown.  “The coup attempt was a breaking point in the country’s history that created public concern about the republic’s security and continuity. It triggered nationalist feelings wrapped around worries that the country’s fate was under threat,” Sert told Al Jazeera.  He added that the emergence of the leader of the ultranationalist, right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Devlet Bahceli, as Erdogan’s main political supporter at the time also indicated this.  “To make this momentum more sustainable, Erdogan needed the consent of the people, so religion and nationalism came together,” he said.  National pride  But according to Kentel, “Erdogan’s ideology is not religious, but nationalist with some religious undertones.”  Erdogan and the AK Party have been successful in “integrating traditional and conservative sectors of society into nationalist identity. With this renewed form of nationalism, sectors which did not previously associate with the nation-state, now relate strongly with it,” he said.  Kentel and Sert said while this form of nationalism has attracted conservative sectors of society, it has polarised and alienated many others.  Still, Camlica Mosque has become an important stop for tourists and locals visiting Ottoman palaces and mosques, with many seeing it as a success for Erdogan and his party.  “Camlica Mosque is a source of national and political pride. It represents Islam’s presence in the modern world and symbolises AK Party’s political power,” said Mustafa, a 39-year-old accountant visiting the mosque.  “While values of the republic were secular and mostly rejected by the country’s conservative sectors, the AK Party has managed to keep these concepts while appealing to a larger segment of society,” he added.  Another mosque-goer, 37-year-old Suheyb, agreed: “The AK Party brought the state closer to the people. Camlica Mosque is seen as a symbol of this transformation.”  Like the mosque-goers, former AK Party parliamentarian, Iffet Pollat, told Al Jazeera that Camlica Mosque was a “salutation to the Turkish Republic, to Ottoman heritage and our Muslim ancestors, all in one. It is a masterpiece of the Turkish Republic under Erdogan”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjIvdHVya2V5cy1jYW1saWNhLW1vc3F1ZS1vdHRvbWFuLWhlcml0YWdlLW9yLW1vZGVybi1uYXRpb25hbGlzbdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzIyL3R1cmtleXMtY2FtbGljYS1tb3NxdWUtb3R0b21hbi1oZXJpdGFnZS1vci1tb2Rlcm4tbmF0aW9uYWxpc20?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1948-01-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T20:29:05","Even as the civil war rages on, many pro-democracy groups in Myanmar have begun building their own governance and security institutions. As these new structures emerge, it’s important that they do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  Many institutions in Myanmar were originally designed as top-down structures without any space for civil society input. The Myanmar Police Force (MPF), in particular, originally existed as an arm of the British empire. When Myanmar achieved independence, the MPF then operated as a mechanism of state control rather than a public service to protect civilians. Consequently, the MPF grew into a hub of systemic violence and brutality that has continued to this day.  If the resistance is going to turn their democratic vision into a reality, the process of building new institutions must be more inclusive and sustainable — and that requires collaboration with civil society. This is particularly pertinent for security institutions, which both define and monopolize the legitimate use of force.  The First Step: Building Trust  For these new security institutions to establish legitimacy, they must first create trust between themselves and the communities they serve. They can do so by structuring these institutions around civil society’s needs. But how can that work in practice?  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has exported many democratic policing models across the world for decades, advocates for mechanisms such as open forums between police and civil society, community policing initiatives, and representative composition. Developing relations between community and policing through simple acts such as face-to-face engagement can increase local perceptions of legitimacy. While the MPF has historically been hesitant to participate in local community dialogues, emergent policing groups affiliated with the pro-democracy movement and Ethnic Revolutionary Organizations — such as the Karen National Police Force (KNPF) — have demonstrated greater interest in community engagement.  During interviews with USIP, women police officers in the KNPF shared their thoughts on the role of policing in their community. One police officer remarked that “only with the people’s support, the police are able to establish their foundation. It is required to build trust from the community. The police have a responsibility to show their good character to be accepted by the community.”  Another officer shared that policing laws have operated similarly across Myanmar. However, “the distinguishing [thing] is that … we have our own requirements and some adjustments based on the community needs.” Creating security institutions structured around community-specific needs can give birth to more sustainable justice and security practices.  Addressing community needs requires rethinking how to make access to security more inclusive. Rather than envisioning security as a service limited to the select few, or as a means of state control, more sustainable security institutions should honor all community needs by prioritizing building mechanisms to address the insecurity of the historically marginalized — including ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, women and gender minorities. Expanding access to security across the whole community supports trust-building and strengthens legitimacy.  Operationalizing Inclusivity  A practical starting point for emergent security institutions could be building on existing gender-inclusive practices. Women in Myanmar have faced significant gender-based violence throughout the country’s history — both directly at the hands of Myanmar’s police and indirectly as a result of conflict-affected insecurity, such as the threat of sexual violence in displacement camps or physical violence from civilians without accountability. This has left most women without trusted security resources.  Building security institutions that serve an entire community, however, is not as simple as “adding women and stir” to reshape power dynamics. Although women’s civil society groups are active in more liberated areas, such as Karen and Karenni States, gender-inclusion should not be outsourced to civil society. Civil society needs to inform the structure of the security institutions.  In Karenni State, the emergent Karenni State Police try to serve a wide community. Due to limited resources, the Karenni State Police often must prioritize conflict-related security concerns and lack the capacity for addressing gender-based violence specifically. Civil society leaders assessed that the Karenni State Police have a “limited awareness” of gender issues, however the Karenni State Police have expressed interest in expanding its capacity to serve a more inclusive population, including by addressing gender-based violence in Karenni State.  In Karen State, the Karen Women’s Organization (KWO) is more integrated into the justice system. The KWO has spearheaded efforts to address gender-based violence with the KNPF through the provision of legal support, shelter and assistance to victims of gender-based violence.  However, this still means that these institutions are dependent on the KWO for advocating for protections for women. This is not practical for all liberated areas in Myanmar, and security institutions need to be designed to serve inclusive populations without overreliance on women’s groups to guide them.  The case of Brazil can offer some lessons, as feminist movements in the 1980s played a large role in the creation of all-women police stations and generating attitudinal shifts toward greater advocacy for victims of gender-based violence. Further, women’s police stations in Brazilian metropolitan areas were strongly correlated with decreases in the female homicide rate. Rural areas did not experience this change, but this is thought to be due to cultural norms regarding gender-based violence in those areas.  The case of Brazil demonstrates that if there is political will that values women in civil society, opportunities for justice can shift. Creating security institutions that factor in culture and the lived experiences of civil society — particularly women — as a fundamental part of their operations can truly enhance security and justice for communities.  Reconsider Power as a Community-Owned Good  As momentum builds among emerging security institutions in Myanmar, it’s important to take a step back and recognize that these institutions represent new centers of power among communities. Questions of power dynamics will emerge, such as: Who wields the legitimate use of force? Who has the authority to represent communities? Who grants access to resources? The allocation of power within communities will set new precedents. It is imperative that communities truly have ownership over this power by shaping new security institutions.  Emerging police institutions should develop community-informed systems to protect the community and prevent criminal activity in a holistic way. These systems should go beyond outsourcing labor to civil society. Community dialogues could address these embryonic questions of legitimacy, authority and use of force to inform the foundational principles of these institutions. Creating open spaces for communities to re-envision security in partnership with security providers could promote greater buy-in across all stakeholders. Other structural practices could include regular consultations and dialogues with community leaders at the policy level, designing police training curricula in partnership with community leaders, and trust-building initiatives with communities.  In another example, community-nominated civilian representatives have joined rotations of the community auxiliary police in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea. It should also be noted that a meta-analysis of community policing in the Global South found that community policing interventions did not affect community trust or perceptions of insecurity. Rather, these community policing interventions were limited by a lack of prioritization of community engagement at the leadership level, a rotation of champions of community engagement, and limited resources. Building new security institutions from the bottom-up allows a unique opportunity to overcome these limitations by instilling norms of prioritizing community in the strategy, training and practices of the institution itself.  While it is encouraging that the KNPF has initiated some community-oriented policing approaches, this should be strengthened and promoted across other security institutions in the resistance network. As one KNPF police officer shared, “Policing work [has] to be endorsed, recommended, appreciated by the people. That is really important. In order to be a police force, it has to be trusted by the community.”  Developing trust between police and civil society is key to sharing community knowledge and building the political will to create more secure and just spaces in Myanmar. For security to be an accessible good for all, then all must respect and center the power of the community.

"political coup","2023-07-22","15:00:00","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","2023-05-22T09:05:00","(Bloomberg) -- A Thai lawyer filed a complaint against the party that won last week’s general election over its vow to amend the country’s royal defamation law, the latest sign that the process of forming a new government could get protracted.  Eight days after Move Forward led pro-democracy groups in a historic victory in the May 14 election, lawyer Theerayuth Suwankaesorn submitted his complaint to the Election Commission. He urged the agency to seek a ruling from the Constitutional Court on whether Move Forward’s call to amend the lese majeste or the royal insult law, which punishes criticisms against the king and other members of the royal family, undermines the monarchy.  “The party’s plan could erode, damage, or undermine the key national institution,” Theerayuth — who previously filed a complaint against the leaders of the party that was a predecessor to Move Forward — told reporters on Monday. A ruling against the party could result in its dissolution, he said.  The complaint, which has not been formally accepted by the Election Commission, comes hours before Move Forward’s leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, and the heads of seven other parties are scheduled to sign an agreement to push ahead with efforts to form a government following the May 14 vote.  Move Forward’s pledge to push for amendments to the lese majeste law, also known as Article 112, has emerged as a key dividing line between different political parties as it tries to cobble together a governing majority with a coalition of eight parties that won 313 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives.  READ: Thai Coalition Talks Spook Markets Amid Split Over Law on Royals  While pro-democracy parties won the election, they face built-in obstacles as the constitution — approved following a military coup in 2014 — allows the unelected 250-member Senate to vote alongside the lower house to pick a new leader. That means Pita’s coalition still falls short of the 376 votes he needs in parliament to become prime minister without counting on Senate support.  Pita’s bid to take the top job has faced opposition from many members of the Senate, stacked with allies of the pro-military establishment of caretaker Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha and other conservative parties. The Bhumjaithai Party, which finished third with 70 seats, already ruled out support for Pita as prime minister, saying it won’t back a candidate from a party planning to amend Article 112. The conservative Democrat Party has not begun a discussion on its stance on Pita’s bid to become prime minister but it disagrees with amending the law against royal insults, party spokesman Ramate Rattanachaweng said Monday.  READ: Pressure Mounts on Thai Senators to Support Pita’s Premier Bid  Under Thai law, the Election Commission has 60 days after the vote to release official election results and certify 95% of the lower house seats. The first session of the new parliament must then take place within 15 days. That pushes the timeline to late July.  Move Forward’s secretary-general, Chaithawat Tulathon, said over the weekend that he was confident the party could win over some senators, adding that an agreement to be signed by the parties in a briefing scheduled at 4:30 p.m. local time on Monday will sway members of the Senate to vote for Pita.  The push to directly change laws affecting the monarchy breaks a longstanding taboo in Thailand, where in years past even the suggestion of disloyalty to the palace has been grounds for the military to stage a coup, leading to successive bouts of deadly street protests that have held back Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy.  While there are different views within Pita’s coalition, Move Forward’s plan to amend the law isn’t a deal breaker, deputy party leader Sirikanya Tansakul told local media over the weekend. Support for the party’s plan to amend Article 112 won’t be a criteria for joining its coalition, and Move Forward will keep its word to propose the amendment for discussion in parliament, she said.  Earlier this month, another lawyer lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that Pita had violated election rules by holding shares in a defunct media company. Pita has said he’s not worried about the allegation, which could see him disqualified as a member of parliament, as the shares are part of an estate that he manages and he doesn’t directly own them.  ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS90aGFpbGFuZC1zLW1vdmUtZm9yd2FyZC1mYWNlcy1uZXctbGVnYWwtdGhyZWF0LXRvLWNvYWxpdGlvbi1iaWQtMS4xOTIzMjQ30gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm5uYmxvb21iZXJnLmNhL3RoYWlsYW5kLXMtbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJkLWZhY2VzLW5ldy1sZWdhbC10aHJlYXQtdG8tY29hbGl0aW9uLWJpZC0xLjE5MjMyNDcuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2022-04-01","Not Discerned","{""PortMoresby"", ""NationalCapitalDistrict"", ""PapuaNewGuinea""}","2023-05-22T08:02:00","(Bloomberg) -- The US and Papua New Guinea signed two new security agreements on Monday aimed at bolstering ties in a move seen as an effort to counter to China’s growing influence in the Pacific.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Prime Minister James Marape in Port Moresby to deepen engagement with a Pacific island nation strategically located near trade routes to allies Australia and Japan.  The Defense Cooperation Agreement reached on Monday “will facilitate bilateral and multilateral exercises and engagements,” the US said in a statement. “It also enables the United States to be more responsive in emergency situations, such as those involving humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.”  The move is the latest step in a period of strategic competition between the US and China in the Pacific after a decade in which Beijing has ramped up its economic and political presence in the region. In April 2022, China signed a security agreement with the Solomon Islands, its first in the Pacific and a diplomatic coup for Beijing.  Blinken made the visit to Papua New Guinea after President Joe Biden scrapped a planned stop there and in Australia in order to return directly to Washington following a visit to Japan for the Group of Seven summit. He would have been the first US president to visit the island, but changed plans to continue talks with Republicans over raising the US debt ceiling.  Read More: What’s the ‘Quad’ and Should China Fear It?: QuickTake  The US said a second deal announced Monday will also allow Papua New Guinea to take part in the US Coast Guard’s Shiprider program, a security cooperation program which aims, in part, to help nations protect their sovereignty and natural resources, including fisheries.  That will be seen as an indirect effort to push back on China: Several nations in Southeast Asia have bristled at the armada of Chinese fishing vessels which often swarm around contested reefs, outcrops and islands, saying they are violating national sovereignty.  In addition, the defense pact will also help improve the capacity of the PNG Defense Force and increase stability and security in the region, according to a previous State Department statement. Blinken is slated to meet with Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Biden’s behalf while in Papua New Guinea, and had planned to discuss a range of issues including the climate crisis and advancing economic growth.

New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins earlier said he isn’t concerned that a renewed partnership between the US and Papua New Guinea represents a militarization of the Indo-Pacific region, adding that the pact builds on existing relationships with the US and isn’t just about security.  --With assistance from Tim Smith and Sudhi Ranjan Sen.

"political coup","2016-08-15","Not Discerned","{""Imphal"", ""Manipur"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T19:22:53","While India has remained focused on events and activities related to the G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), internal security challenges are resurfacing. Recent events point to the revival of these challenges.  Firstly, the developments in Punjab, including the rise and arrest of Amritpal Singh, indicate that the pro-Khalistan elements are attempting to stage a comeback. Khalistani activities have increased in Canada, Australia, and Britain as well.  Secondly, the Naxals attacked security forces in Chhattisgarh. Naxal attacks just before the onset of the monsoon are a known tactic, as retaliatory anti-naxal operations become difficult in the rainy season.  Also Read: Response to G20 in Srinagar a diplomatic setback for India  Thirdly, the recent terror attack in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir was a reminder that despite the ceasefire with Pakistan, terrorism will continue to pose a serious security threat. Finally, the eruption of violence in Manipur and the deployment of central security forces pointed towards the volatility and complexity of the Northeast. The instability in Myanmar since the military coup and the refugee flows have already been a challenge to the security of the Northeast.  Four key pointers indicate that there indeed is a revival of internal security threats:  India has faced serious internal security problems since independence. Compared to the current situation, the magnitude of these challenges was greater in the 1980s and early 1990s when the active support of China and Pakistan for the various armed outfits intensified the challenge for India.  In the last three decades, with the steady accumulation of economic and military power by India, the seriousness of these challenges has come down progressively. However, as the strategic environment around India worsens and security challenges on the western as well as northern peripheries intensify, internal security problems too seem to be making a comeback.  One of the important motivations behind these attacks and their specific timing is to prick the government’s narrative of a strong India and underscore the severity of challenges, especially in the year when the global spotlight is on the country. India plans to hold a G20 meeting in Kashmir, and the attack in Rajouri was a reminder that the problem of Kashmir remains alive. For India, the Rajouri attack can be deployed to once again highlight the problem of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.  Internal security challenges are primarily political in nature, and therefore, a military response is limited in its effect. This is particularly true in the context of the instability in Manipur. The show of force was useful to stop the violence and bring back stability and normalcy. However, ethnic and religious fault lines are a constant feature of politics in the Northeast. Therefore, moving forward, the political leadership will have to show deftness and tact to bridge the gap between communities and heal the wounds. Instability in a strategically located border state like Manipur aggravates the already-existing, complex security challenges in the Northeast. The assertive military posture of China along the Arunachal Pradesh border, looming elections and political instability in Bangladesh, and the intensifying conflict in Myanmar exacerbate India’s security challenges in the Northeast.  Finally, as Pakistan stumbles into even greater instability and violence, the temptation to create trouble in Kashmir cannot be ignored. For a divided political class and discredited military establishment, Kashmir will perhaps be a unifying factor as well. For India, normalcy in Kashmir is of utmost importance as it seeks to hold a G20 meeting in Srinagar, which sends a message to China and Pakistan that the world has moved on from the issue of Kashmir. However, precisely for this reason, for Pakistan and its terror proxies, the idea of launching terror attacks will be an attractive proposition. Even for China, keeping up the military pressure on India in eastern Ladakh serves to highlight the magnitude of India’s security challenges in Kashmir.  Hence, for India, internal security challenges are here to stay. Addressing the socio-economic and political roots of grievances in the context of Punjab, Naxalism, and the Northeast is a long-term solution.  In Kashmir, as internal and external challenges get intertwined, managing the security situation seems to be a practical option. Moving forward, while India seeks to improve its position externally, the necessity of keeping a close vigil on the internal security front cannot be underestimated.

"political coup","2019-07-23","15:00:00","{""Manila"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-22T21:09:00","They say in politics, there are neither permanent friends nor permanent enemies. But the truth is a tad more complicated: even political interests can change over time depending on the broader constellation of forces as well as the sheer power of human reflection.  Amateurs tend to view politics as largely static, thus confidently forecasting future trends based on ultimately transient variables. As for conspiracy theory, it’s often the refuge of the intellectually indolent. Actual politics is, in modern societies, far more indeterminate and, especially in besieged democracies like ours, highly contested. In short, plot twists often trump seemingly unbreakable patterns.  ADVERTISEMENT  And this, dear reader, brings us to the latest realignments in Philippine politics, which took place not long after former senator Leila de Lima was yet again acquitted on another baseless charge, and not long before the incumbent announces his new Cabinet picks following the end of the one-year appointment ban on losing candidates in last year’s elections.  Make no mistake: the incumbent is in a privileged position to assemble a truly inclusive Cabinet from across the ideological spectrum. Who knows, there might even be a “grand coalition” in the making, if not a whiff of a Lincolnite “team of rivals.”  To truly understand the shifting sands in Philippine politics, one must look no further than the House of Representatives, the unmistakable vortex of traditional politics. In just the latest plot twist in the House, former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was “demoted” from a “senior” deputy speaker position—itself, lower than the speakership post, which she occupied under the former administration and aspired for under a newly elected one last year.  After initially adopting a policy of strategic silence, the former president mused about the possible reason behind her “demotion,” namely the (baseless) suspicion that she was “plotting a ‘coup’ against” the current House supremo. Arroyo was quick to clarify, however, that “my actions may have been misconstrued” and that she harbored no intention to replicate her controversial ascent to speakership in the not-so-distant past. Remember the dramatic set of events, on the eve of Rodrigo Duterte’s third State of the Nation Address, behind the downfall of former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez in 2018?  It didn’t take long before her most powerful ally, Vice President Sara Duterte, announced her resignation from the ruling party, citing her dissatisfaction with “political toxicity” and “execrable political powerplay.” The significance of this move can’t be overstated. Lest we forget, the Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) was instrumental to the fateful formation of the “UniTeam” between the House of Marcos and House of Duterte in the 2022 elections. As I wrote in a forecast piece for the Monocle magazine in London in late-2021, once the two powerful families join forces, the fate of the presidential elections is effectively sealed.  Just as interesting, however, is President Marcos’ characterization of the latest developments. A pacifist by temperament, and eager to keep powerful allies, the incumbent simply characterized Arroyo’s demotion as nothing more than a “run-of-the-mill … reorganization” in the House. As for the vice president, he defended her recent decision by stating how Sara Duterte “cannot allow herself to be distracted” because of her load of responsibilities. Mr. Marcos’ subtle response is important because it signifies his uniquely nonconfrontational approach to politics, which, by all indications, is serving him well.  Sen. Nancy Binay recently wondered if the country needs a leader who can leverage “fear factor” and the politics of rage. But we saw how that brand of governance ended up creating more mess than gains for the country, which heavily suffered under the former populist in Malacañang. A year into office, Mr. Marcos has, by sedulously avoiding direct clashes with any major camp, overseen a “silent revolution,” which has restored relations with democratic allies, rebooted a brutal drug war, and recreated a semblance of press freedom and political sanity after six years of demagogic euphoria.  In a bizarre twist of events, the son of the former strongman is in a historic position to create a new legacy altogether by, inter alia, appointing a whole set of progressive-liberal bureaucrats to a new and revamped Cabinet without fully alienating his more traditional allies, who have been constantly kept at bay. As the German statesman Otto von Bismarck once remarked, actual politics is about “the capacity of always choosing at each instant, in constantly changing situations, the least harmful, the most useful.”  —————-  [email protected]  Your subscription could not be saved.

"political coup","2016-07-27","Not Discerned","{""Chisinau"", ""Chisinau"", ""Moldova""}","2023-05-22T16:29:09","Moldova’s quest to join the EU reflects its aspiration for territorial integrity and economic development. Credit: Loveshop via Shutterstock.  This week, Moldovan President Maia Sandu organized a huge pro-EU rally. An estimated 75,000 people turned out to support Moldova’s push to join the European Union (EU).  Moldova is making EU citizenship a top priority for the country’s government. It has long expressed its desire to strengthen its ties with Western Europe and break free from its historic dependency on Russia. However, the ongoing Ukraine conflict has significantly complicated Moldova’s aspirations.  Ties to Russia  Moldova is a small landlocked country that has played an integral role in contemporary Eastern European history. The former Soviet Union state’s proximity to Russia, coupled with shared linguistic and cultural ties, has made Russia a key trading partner and a major source of remittances from Moldovan citizens working abroad. Yet, the two country’s relationship remains volatile. That is nowhere more evident than in its ongoing dispute in Transnistria.  Wedged between Moldova and western Ukraine, Transnistria is a strip of land that is officially a part of Moldova but has existed as a de facto unrecognized breakaway republic for the last 30 years. Although Russia does not recognize Transnistria as an independent state, it maintains strong political, military, and economic ties with the separatist region.  Alongside the ongoing dispute regarding Transnistria, Moldova’s pro-EU president Maia Sandu has also accused the Russian government of interfering in Moldovan politics and plotting an attempted coup.  Conflicting aspirations  Moldova’s quest to join the EU reflects its aspiration for territorial integrity and economic development. In 2014, Moldova signed an agreement with the EU that aimed to deepen the pair’s political and economic cooperation. The agreement included provisions for free trade, visa liberalization, and support for democratic reforms. Moldova’s government has also implemented other political and economic reforms, such as anti-corruption measures and judicial reforms. However, progress toward EU membership has been slow due to internal political divisions, corruption, and ongoing challenges in implementing reforms effectively.  The Ukrainian conflict reignited Moldova’s pursuit to join the EU after it significantly affected the country’s economy and energy security. In 2022, Gazprom, the Russian energy supplier, partly cut off the country’s gas supplies. Trade between Moldova and Russia, which had already been strained, also faced further disruption as Russia imposed trade restrictions on the country, while a drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittances, as Moldovan workers employed in Ukraine faced job losses, further weakened the country’s economy.  Problems for Moldova  Despite its efforts and desire to join the EU, geopolitical factors will most likely hinder Moldova’s aspirations. For a long time, territorial enlargement was considered the EU’s most successful policy instrument. However, a lack of political alignment within the EU institutions and ongoing economic instability across the continent have festered hesitations around expansion.  European leaders have also become conscientious of further damaging EU-Russia relations. Although Europe outwardly supports Ukraine, it must avoid further aggravating tensions with Russia outside of the conflict. The induction of Moldova and Ukraine into the union could be interpreted by the Russian government as an offensive manoeuvre against Russia, that would most likely result in the outbreak of conflict across Europe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcmRpY3QuY28udWsvbW9sZG92YS1ldS1jaXRpemVuc2hpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On May 12, 1998, Indonesian security forces gunned down four students at Jakarta’s Trisakti University who were protesting the corruption and nepotism of the government of Suharto, who had ruled since seizing power in a coup in 1965.  The incident unleashed a chain of events that saw the dictator of 32 years forced to resign and an organic democracy take root in the world’s fourth-largest country.  Indonesian citizens had much to protest about as Suharto’s rule had become increasingly capricious and despotic.  Civil society was repressed, the media shackled and politics stilted in a rigid corporatist system that coopted an enfeebled opposition. The military governed down to the village level in a system known as dwifungsi (dual function).  Crony capitalists who plundered the country’s natural resources dominated the economy and concentrated wealth in Jakarta. The Asian economic crisis led to the collapse of currency and a 13% contraction of the economy in 1998.  It was lost on no one that the U.S. $36 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund was nearly the amount Suharto’s family allegedly amassed during the dictator’s time in office.  The May 1998 riots in Jakarta’s Chinatown were clearly the work of some military units who were looking for a justification to make a direct intervention in politics. Fortunately, the military chief at the time, Wiranto, resisted and deferred to the civilian leadership.  Suharto handed over power to then-Vice President B.J. Habibie on May 21, 1998. Habibie was unable to halt the economic slide and did not even contest the first election held in 1999.  Consolidating Democracy  The transition to democracy was not easy – between May 1998 and October 2004, Indonesia had five presidents. Frustration was high, especially as the country was the slowest to emerge from the Asian economic crisis.  Even though the first five years were chaotic, several cornerstones to the nation’s democratic foundations were laid.

[Agus Lolong/AFP]  First, the military returned to the barracks. The dwifungsi policy was abolished and officers who were civil administrators were given the choice of resigning their commissions or giving up administrative powers to civilians.  Following East Timor’s independence in 1999 and the 2005 peace accord with the Acehnese rebels, there have been fewer internal security justifications for the military to be acutely involved in internal security.  The armed forces became more focused on professionalizing and modernizing. In 1999, the police, which until then had been an arm of the military, became independent and under civilian control.  Second, Indonesia had always been an overly centralized state, politically, economically and culturally. But since there had been long-running separatist rebellions in East Timor, Aceh, Papua and elsewhere, there always was a fear that decentralization would quickly morph to secessionism.  So when the parliament authorized the “big bang” decentralization, it bypassed provinces and gave considerable powers to smaller regencies to enact public policy.  Third, presidential, legislative and local elections over the sprawling 17,000-island archipelago began to be held effectively and routinely. Despite fears of political violence, elections have been surprisingly peaceful.  There have been five largely free and fair elections since 1999 that have shown no systematic disenfranchisement. Voter participation has been high, averaging 80% since 1999.  There are dozens of political parties, but many remain vanity vehicles for individuals. Election laws have been adjusted to ensure that small and fringe parties that do not meet requirements are ineligible even as there are no prohibitive barriers to entry for candidates and new parties.  Early elections were overly complex under a hybrid political system until 2004, when the president was elected through a parliamentary vote. Since then, the president has been directly elected.  Most importantly, elections have seen the regular and peaceful turnover of presidential power.  Fourth, parliament passed a new media law in 1999 that ended censorship. Today, Indonesia has a robust media, though arguably overly controlled by a handful of conglomerates. Social media usage is high and Indonesia has one of the least restricted internet networks in Southeast Asia.  Democracy has been good for the economy. When Suharto fell, Indonesia’s GDP was $95.45 billion. That rose to $1.32 trillion in 2022.  While the economy is still overly dependent on the extraction of natural resources, there has been growth in the manufacturing and service sectors. Oil rents as a portion of GDP fell to 0.8% in 2021, from 9.9% in 1998. Oil rents are the difference between the value of crude oil production at regional prices and total costs of production, according to the World Bank.  No country has democratized as quickly as Indonesia, but that doesn’t mean the reforms are not fragile and irreversible.  Five issues of concern  First, since 2014, the military has been trying to claw back some of the civilian authority it relinquished in 1999. In what became known as Bela Negara, in 2014, the TNI identified separatism, narcotics, communism and LGBTQ rights as the greatest threats to the country. The 2018 Counterterrorism Law enshrined an internal security role for the military.  Second, there has been legislation undermining free speech, freedom of association, religion and identity. Every major piece of public policy since 1999 has had a sharia component. A few laws have threatened Pancasila (“unity in diversity”), a core principle of the founding ideology of the state.  The mother of a student shot during riots that led up to the resignation of President Suharto takes part in a protest in Jakarta 10 years later, urging the government to probe human rights violations during that time, May 12, 2008. [Bay Ismoyo/AFP]  The blasphemy law, for example, has criminalized “deviant sects,” including Shia and Ahmadi. And the government has been all too quick to turn a blind eye to religious vigilante groups who target these minorities.  For instance, the Blasphemy Law and ensuing street protests took down Jakarta’s democratically elected Chinese-Christian governor, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, in 2017.  The new Criminal Code penalizes premarital sex and cohabitation outside of marriage, and also undermines free speech by criminalizing criticism of the president and Pancasila.  Third, the “big bang” decentralization impacted the secular nature of the state by devolving public policy authority to local governments. Today, there are 389 sharia codes and bylaws across the country that have had a disproportionate impact on women and religious minorities.  Fourth, while insurgencies were resolved in East Timor and Aceh, the war in the resource-rich province of Papua continues. The government has periodically shut down the internet, banned foreign media and criminalized peaceful protest and support for secessionism. Security forces continue to commit human rights abuses and credible reports have emerged that the civilian intelligence service has violated the law and is waging a dirty war.  Finally, despite the recent high profile arrest of a cabinet minister, Johnny G. Plate, corruption in Indonesia is endemic and undermines already weak political institutions. In addition, Indonesia’s economy continues to be dominated by state-owned enterprises.  In 2002, the government established an independent Counter Corruption Commission (KPK) with full investigative authority, modeled on Italy’s anti-mafia courts. It was extremely successful and quickly became the most trusted political institution in the country.  But since 2014, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has caved in to political pressure and stripped the KPK of some autonomy and powers. In 2019, parliament passed a law stripping it of some investigative powers, prompting mass protests.  Indonesia’s ranking in the annual Transparency International corruption perception index remains poor, and has been declining since 2019, leading to a negative impact on economic growth and political institutions.

[Ismira Lutfia Tisnadibrata/BenarNews]  Indonesia will hold its first round of voting in the next presidential election in February 2024. People will be able to exercise their right to vote, parties will campaign, articulate platforms and policies – and the media will cover it all. But behind the performative aspects of democracy, there has been substantial backsliding.  Democracy has come so far, but it is not irreversible.

Since mid-April, the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been exchanging heavy fire, accusing each other of starting assaults.  According to an Anadolu reporter on the ground, heavy clashes were heard on Sunday night in several areas across Khartoum, including central Khartoum, the northern Bahri area, and Omdurman western Khartoum.  On Sunday, Saudi Arabia and the United States announced that a new 7-day cease-fire has been agreed upon by the Sudanese rival groups starting as of Monday evening.  Saudi Arabia said that talks in Jeddah city will continue with the aim to reach a permanent cease-fire and a conflict resolution through dialogue.  Medical sources estimate that nearly 1,000 people have been killed during the war that erupted on April 15 between the Sudanese army and RSF.  A disagreement had been fomenting in recent months between the army and the RSF over the paramilitary group’s integration into the armed forces, a key condition of Sudan's transition agreement with political groups.  Sudan has been without a functioning government since October 2021, when the military dismissed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's transitional government and declared a state of emergency in a move decried by political forces as a ""coup.""  Sudan's transitional period, which started in August 2019 after the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir, had been scheduled to end with elections in early 2024.  ---  Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L3JlZ2lvbi8yMTAxMjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-09","22:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T05:56:33","The Myanmar junta has arrested nearly 130 National League for Democracy (NLD) members of parliament (MPs), killed 16 NLD members and revoked the citizenship of a further four members.  The figures were in a report issued by the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) on 20 May.  Amongst the NLD members arrested by the Myanmar junta are State Counsellor Daw Aung San Kyi and President U Win Myint.  Of the arrested NLD MPs, 41 were from the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (union-level parliament) and 87 were from regional or state parliaments. Of those, currently 29 union-level and 59 regional or state MPs are still in prison.  An NLD MP from Bago Regional Parliament died in prison because he was refused medical treatment. Another NLD MP from the Mon Sate parliament was arrested and killed in custody and his body was then left by the side of a road.  Five union-level NLD MPs and nine regional or state-level NLD MPs, who fled their homes because they feared being arrested, died whilst they were on the run due to not being able to receive medical treatment.  As well as arresting, imprisoning and killing NLD members, the junta has also revoked the citizenships of four union-level NLD MPs who are also members of the CRPH, they are: U Ye Mon (alias U Tin Thit), U Lwin Ko Latt, and Daw Zin Mar Aung who are now the ministers of NUG, and Daw Phyu Phyu Thin, the member of CRPH.  The junta has also detained NLD MP’s family members as hostages to force them to give themselves up. The junta has also sealed and seized or destroyed NLD members’ houses.  Once imprisoned NLD members lose their fundamental human rights, such as having legal representation or visitors. Often their cases do not even follow due legal process. NLD members released from prison recount stories of brutal torture and no access to medical treatment for their injuries.  Currently, Aung San Suu Kyi, the 77-year-old State Counsellor, is being held in solitary confinement in a prison in Naypyitaw. She is currently serving a 33-year prison sentence for various politically motivated charges, including corruption, illegally possessing walkie-talkies and flouting COVID-19 restrictions.  The international community has protested Aung San Suu Kyi’s imprisonment and called for her release, saying that legal procedures were not followed in her prosecutions.  The president, the NLD’s U Win Myint, was arrested after the coup and moved to Taungoo Prison in Bago Region in January of 2023. He is serving a 12-year prison sentence, including for five charges of corruption relating to the rental and the purchase of a helicopter for a disaster relief program whilst he was in government.  Political prisoners in Myanmar are regularly subjected to hard labour, beatings and cruel treatment. They are shackled whilst in prison and have no access to clean water.  Last year, the families of political prisoners called for international organisations such as the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to inspect prison conditions, but they were unable to carry out any inspections as the junta did not grant them access to prisons.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbWl6emltYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9qdW50YS1pbXByaXNvbnMtbmxkLW1lbWJlcnMtcGFybGlhbWVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-22","16:30:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T07:19:39","The Thai stock market opened Monday morning with a price drop from 1,500 points, despite the MOU signing ceremony to form a government to be held today at the Conrad Hotel in Bangkok.  This government formation led by Move Forwrad leader Pita Limjaroenrat, who is also considered a candidate for prime minister. The signing ceremony on May 22 at 4.30 p.m. took place at the same time that Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha announced the coup 9 years ago.  Although the market rallied back 14 points higher in the afternoon from purchasing back major stocks (BiG Cap) led by CPALL, AOT, and GULF as the market relieved concerns over the government’s setup following the MOU signing news conference, there is no change to Section 112 in the MOU’s terms.  Uncertainties in the stock market remain high.  In the five days following the election on May 14, foreign investors sold Thai shares worth a total of 12 billion Baht. Furthermore, sales since the start of the year total 80 billion Baht. According to analysts, international investors are still concerned about the formation of the government.  Niwet Hemwachirawarakorn, a value investment expert at the Thai Value Investor Association, said elections have been held in Thailand and a new government with different policies than in the past is in the offing. However, it seems that investors have not reacted well to this.  Niwet said that the Thai index has actually not gone up in the last 10 years. In his opinion, it could be called the “lost decade.”  The situation is similar to that in Japan 20 years ago. At that time, Japanese society began to age rapidly, creativity began to wane and the creativity of “youth” replaced the old commodity and service industries. Japanese society and people who are more “conservative” could not keep up with this pace.  It was only in the last 10 years that Japanese stocks did exceptionally well, especially after the then-still-young Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who stimulated the long-hibernating economy.  For Thailand, however, Niwet added that the future will show in the next 2-3 months after the government is formed or in the next 1-2 years whether the policy will respond well to the country’s economic growth or not.  Niwet said those who will be in charge of the country should look at the stock market index as a sign that what they will do will affect the country positively or negatively in the long run.  He added that the stock market is not a niche sector as this market is the centre of people who do the economic activities that can predict the country’s economy. When the stock market goes up, it means that policies are going in the right direction and vice versa.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZm9yZWlnbi1pbnZlc3RvcnMtZHVtcC10aGFpLXN0b2Nrcy1hbWlkLXBvbGl0aWNhbC1wb2xhcml0eS1zaGlmdHMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2hhb3NvZGVuZ2xpc2guY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9mb3JlaWduLWludmVzdG9ycy1kdW1wLXRoYWktc3RvY2tzLWFtaWQtcG9saXRpY2FsLXBvbGFyaXR5LXNoaWZ0cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2018-09-24","Not Discerned","{""Berlin"", ""Berlin"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-22T00:20:00","BERLIN (AP) — The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency warned Monday of a rise in anti-government extremism fueled by authoritarian states such as Russia that seek to divide society and topple the government.  German security agencies have disrupted several plots in recent years by small groups linked to the Reich Citizens movement accused of planning attacks on critical infrastructure, government officials and even the national parliament. While it is unclear how far advanced such plans were, authorities have expressed alarm that the alleged plotters had acquired weapons and included people who aren’t usually on the radar of security agencies, such as judges and police officers.  Thomas Haldenwang, who heads the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, said the mixing of previously separate groups — from far-right extremists to QAnon conspiracy theorists — and their willingness to use violence was particularly worrying.  “What links all of these groups is that they despise our state and our democracy, reject it and want to abolish it,” he told The Associated Press in an interview in Berlin.  Haldenwang said anti-government extremists consciously use wedge issues to stoke fear and gain new followers. These include migration — where far-right actors have perpetuated the myth of a “great replacement” — but also government measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic and combat climate change.  “All of these issues can be used to spread a particular narrative and give the impression that the state isn’t in control of certain situations and therefore it needs to be toppled,” he said.  Recent government plans to encourage Germans to replace old oil and gas heaters with efficient and climate-friendly heat pumps have faced hostility from opposition parties but also extremist groups seeking to tap into homeowners’ fears that they’ll be saddled with high costs, despite warnings from experts that the alternative is more expensive in the long run.  “The more complex an issue is, the more intensively one has to deal with a topic, the more there is a tendency to seek simple answers and run after people who offer an easy solution for problems,” said Haldenwang. “Often those are people from the extremist circles.”  The BfV chief said such trends are actively fueled by countries like Russia, which has an interest in destabilizing democracy in Europe’s biggest economy.  “When they recognize that there are sentiments in the country that can lead to division, then those sentiments are supported,” he said. “And we see a large number of measures being taken (to that effect).”  Haldenwang cited disinformation being spread by Russian state media and internet platforms, but said key influencers are also targeted by Russia’s agents in Berlin to carry propaganda into German society.  “Naturally there are attempts to get close to certain politicians on the right or left fringes,” he told The AP. “Less so to support those political parties than to use their role to split society.”  Aside from the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has come under scrutiny from the BfV, among the most prominent figures attacking the government are Left party lawmaker Sahra Wagenknecht and Haldenwang’s own predecessor, Hans-Georg Maassen, who was fired five years ago after downplaying anti-migrant violence.  “Of course it’s nice for Russian actors if they can win such people over for their purposes and possibly use their influence in certain audiences,” said Haldenwang.  “If those people have a large number of followers in certain media then the aim of dividing society is achieved in that way,” he added.  “The fact that my predecessor allows himself to become a mouthpiece for this is something that irritates me beyond all measure,” said Haldenwang.  Germany and other European countries have expelled a considerable number of suspected Russian spies since the outbreak of war in Ukraine last year. China is also increasingly being seen as a threat in the theater of “hybrid warfare,” though Beijing’s efforts to undermine German democracy are considered more subtle than Moscow’s.  Coup plots such as those disrupted last year likely won’t be the last, Haldenwang warned: “We know of protagonists who are again talking about a ‘Day X’ when certain things are meant to happen.  “We are monitoring such efforts very intensively, very carefully, and I’m certain that we will be able to intervene in time together with other security agencies,” he said. “But I can’t completely rule out that groups will forms under the radar of the security agencies.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNldGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MveW91ci1taWxpdGFyeS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL2dlcm1hbi1zcHktY2hpZWYtd2FybnMtcnVzc2lhLXN0b2tpbmctYW50aS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW1vb2Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2016-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:13:00","Read this in The Manila Times digital edition.  I'VE said it before, and I will say it again. The political opposition that we used to know, which we colored yellow, pink and red, will no longer be the place from where the challenger will emerge. I would add another layer of crystal ball scenario-making to that prediction. Since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is term-limited, the battle to succeed him will be an open political warfare not between his coalition and the now diminished political opposition. It will be a rumble from within his supermajorities in Congress.  And the battle for succession has now begun. Some say it's too early. That would be so for many of us who think of politics as a rational game of principled men and women. But when unbridled ambition takes over politicians, which is often, then there is nothing that could be too early. Five years before the next presidential elections may no longer be as remote, and two years before the midterms can just feel as if it is already here.  We are not privy to the transcripts of power grabs and backstabbing that may be happening in the corridors of power. What we only witness are the revelations coming from overt acts and coded statements, including one cryptic post of former senator Panfilo Lacson about a coup that is too early. I am of the belief that Lacson was not referring to the military.  What we saw is the unceremonious demotion of former president, former speaker and now former senior deputy speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from what many believed is a ceremonial position to now become just one of the many deputy speakers, which is actually also another array of ceremonial positions which I dare say are just one too many for a House of Representatives that is smaller than the parliament of India, or of Indonesia or even of Thailand. A demotion deserves an explanation from the one who ordered it, and we have not been given that privilege by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez.  But what is more instructive is the political noise in the aftermath, with Arroyo stating that she had no intention of ousting Romualdez — this while party after party which are members of the supermajority came out expressing their loyalty to Romualdez. In politics, the events may not necessarily give you a direct answer. You will have to excavate it from the deflections, denials and affirmations of support. Romualdez must have an important reason to relieve Arroyo of her largely symbolic role. At the top of the list would probably be because she did something naughty and not nice. Arroyo admitted it herself. She said that her intentions were probably misinterpreted.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  And then Vice President Sara Duterte made a move that only aggravated the speculation. Her resignation from Lakas-CMD, a party to which she, Arroyo and Romualdez all belong, is like that two red lines that indicate a positive test result, except that this one is not about a virus, but about a rift that the vice president didn't want to be a part of, which she referred to as political toxicity. Duterte is a known ally of Arroyo. However, while one can interpret her move as a sign of protest at what her party did to Arroyo, it can also very well be, as she said, her way of extricating herself from being embroiled in a political melee.  One needs to be reminded that Duterte and Arroyo have a history of figuring prominently in the ouster of one speaker named Pantaleon Alvarez. Tongues are wagging that it may not be farfetched that either that is what has happened, or to be fair to Duterte, that kind of talk may be the reason why she resigned from the party and detach from the toxicity to avoid being accused of doing the ouster dance once again.  There is another woman politician who was labeled by media then as a member of a formidable trio. Sen. Maria Josefa Imelda ""Imee"" Marcos is also close to both Duterte and Arroyo. She is fighting another war of her own on social media. She is caught up in this vitriolic clan cyberwar between Marcos loyalists, renegade Marcos loyalists and diehard supporters of former president Rodrigo Duterte. There are allegations made by Marcos loyalists who blame Senator Marcos for the actions of some of her loyal supporters and friends on social media involved in a take-down of the first lady, and for sowing divisive intrigue, including the allegations that the former spokesman for former vice president Maria Leonor Robredo is now somewhat already connected in Malacañang.  And then you end up with perfect material for our own version of ""Game of Thrones,"" a political drama that whips the political fanbase who devote much of their precious time sowing and devouring intrigues from their favorite vloggers. The plot is just too delicious to conjure. The three women are probably suspected of making their moves now. And there is pushback. Meanwhile, the remnants of the vanquished opposition watch on the sidelines, cheering what they think as an implosion, a fracturing of the unity of the Marcos base hoping that it would benefit them.  Even if it is true, which I am not saying it is, it would not benefit them.  After all, the fight is within the family, or rather, within the coalition. All the parties involved in the controversy, including Gloria Arroyo, Sara Duterte and even Imee Marcos on one side, and for the lack of a better word, the Romualdez loyalists, and even the party of the die-hard Duterte loyalists, the PDP-Laban, remain loyal to and supportive of President Marcos.  My fearless forecast, for now, is that the 2025 midterm elections and the next presidential election cycle will be an internal brawl to succeed President Marcos. All of them will remain supportive of him, even as they would tear and smear each other.  But things can still change. The political opposition may just find itself being in bed with disgruntled Marcos or Duterte supporters. And we won't be a bit surprised if that happens.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9pdC13aWxsLWJlLWEtZmFtaWx5LWJyYXdsLzE4OTI2NjDSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5pbGF0aW1lcy5uZXQvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvaXQtd2lsbC1iZS1hLWZhbWlseS1icmF3bC8xODkyNjYwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As of May 19th, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) has compiled lists revealing that 114 individuals presently incarcerated in prisons and sentenced to death in relation to their involvement in the Spring Revolution, and the anti-Junta movement.  There are also an additional 42 individuals who have been sentenced to death in absentia. The total count of people condemned to death by the Military Council stands at 156, as reported by AAPP.  According to AAPP, on May 18th, the special court at Insein Prison pronounced delivered verdicts against 5 young men, resulting in a combination of death sentences and life imprisonments. Among them, one individual faced a second death sentence, while the remaining four were handed a combination of death sentences and life imprisonment.  These young individuals were arrested under allegations of shooting at a train with security police personnel on board that circled Yangon in August 2021. Their arrest took place in September of the same year, and after a duration of over a year, the Military Council handed down the verdict.  U Than Soe Naing, a political analyst told the Than Lwin Times "" the significant number of death sentences is a clear indication of the deliberate repression by the Military Council against individuals associated with the Spring Revolution, displaying brutality serves as a menacing tactic to suppress dissent and instill fear among the population.

As a preemptive measure, they are employing severe punishments to eradicate any affiliation with opposition forces”.  From an analysis of AAPP's list the Than Lwin Times found that a total of 186 individuals have received life imprisonment sentences. Additionally it was determined that a minimum of 9 people have faced the imposition of both death sentences and life imprisonments.  Furthermore, 7 individuals who had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment have now received sentences ranging from 3 to 10 years in prison. It is alarming to note that there are 5 individuals who have been subjected to the harsh sentence of death three times each.  Even though they have already faced the death penalty once, there are still 4 political prisoners who have been sentenced to additional prison terms ranging from 3 years to over 200 years.  A Union Supreme Court lawyer expressed the view that a thorough evaluation of the entire legal process is necessary to determine the fairness of a death sentence before it can be considered for examination and approval.  ""From a legal perspective, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of each case to determine whether the punishments align with fairness and adhere to the prescribed laws. Approaching judgments solely from a political standpoint undermines their fairness and consistency with the law. Therefore all applications, submissions, and judgments should  undergo meticulous scrutiny on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the identification of a fair and consistent perspective”, he pointed out.  Last year, on July 23rd and 24th, the Military Council carried out the execution of democracy activists Ko Jimmy (Ko Kayw Min Yu), Ko Phyo Zayar Thaw, Ko Aung Thura Zaw, and Ko Hla Myo Aung, all of whom had previously received death sentences.  The executions conducted by the Military Council elicited strong protests and condemnation from both the domestic population and foreign nations. As a consequence, additional international sanctions were imposed on the Military Council in response to their actions.  Despite facing significant pressure and condemnation, the Military Council persistently defies these circumstances and continues to impose death sentences and additional penalties upon individuals affiliated with the resistance forces engaged in anti-Junta activities.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuaW9ubGluZS5uZXQvZW4vbmV3cy90cmlwbGUtZGVhdGgtc2VudGVuY2UtaGFuZGVkLW91dC1zb21lLXBvbGl0aWNhbC1wcmlzb25lcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Konya"", ""Konya"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-22T07:08:00","President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who reduced the number of campaign rallies ahead of the runoff vote set for May 28, is in form on social media. Erdoğan, active on Twitter after securing the majority of votes in the first round on May 14, lashed out at the opposition again on Monday.  Expressing his hope for a “record” rate of votes in the runoff, the president asked the public to answer some questions about the opposition’s record in his tweet. “Can you trust those who pledge free housing for earthquake victims before the elections, only to attempt to evict the victims from the places they were hosted?” was his first question. Erdoğan’s main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, nominated by the six-party opposition bloc, pledged free houses for survivors of the Feb. 6 earthquakes that hit Türkiye’s south. Yet, the municipality of Tekirdağ, run by Kılıçdaroğlu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP), removed earthquake victims from the hotel they were hosted in the aftermath of the election where Kılıçdaroğlu trailed behind Erdoğan. The incident sparked an outcry, especially amid a flurry of social media posts by Kılıçdaroğlu supporters who derided people in the earthquake zone where Erdoğan garnered high support in the first round of the election.  “Do you believe that this person who did nothing good for this country in his bureaucratic and political career would benefit this nation?” Erdoğan said in his second question about Kılıçdaroğlu, the former director of Türkiye’s social security agency. The president often criticizes Kılıçdaroğlu for his bureaucratic tenure and accuses him of mismanagement of the agency. After ending his bureaucratic career, Kılıçdaroğlu took to politics, where he was elected as head of CHP after his predecessor, the late Deniz Baykal, stepped down amid a sex tape scandal. Yet, the CHP failed to defeat Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in multiple elections after Kılıçdaroğlu took office, save for winning some municipality seats in unprecedented success in the 2019 elections.  Erdoğan also said the public could not trust “someone cooperating with members of the Gülenist Terrorist Group (FETÖ) during the Dec. 17-25 coup attempt,” referring to the 2013 coup attempts disguised as an anti-graft probe that targeted Erdoğan and his ministers. Several judiciary members and police chiefs were indicted in the investigation based on fake evidence, and all are accused of having links to FETÖ.  “Can you expect those who pledged to release the people inciting the Oct. 6-7 riots from prison to fight against the separatist group?” Erdoğan also asked. The opposition bloc promises the release of Selahattin Demirtaş, jailed co-chair of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP). Demirtaş is accused of inciting the riots in 2014 that killed dozens. Riots were the work of sympathizers of the terrorist group PKK, which the HDP maintains close ties with. The PKK is often referred to as being “separatist” for its agenda to establish a so-called Kurdish autonomous area in Türkiye’s southeast. Its campaign of violence since the 1980s killed thousands of people across the country.  “Can you trust the political morals of those who view everything, from blackmail to threats, as legitimate to get rid of their rivals?” Erdoğan asked in his tweet. Muharrem Ince, one of four presidential candidates in the May 14 elections, dropped out of the race a few days before the vote, citing a smear campaign that accused him of serving the interest of Erdoğan by “dividing the vote of the opposition.” Ince, a former CHP member, had decried doctored videos and images spread through social media that “defamed” him.  Irresistible force  Erdoğan has beaten back his rivals at one of his most vulnerable moments and regained his old aura of invincibility ahead of a historic runoff election. The ultimate political survivor, Erdoğan, 69, has overcome jail and a bloody 2016 coup attempt to emerge as Türkiye's most important leader since Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the revered founder of the post-Ottoman republic.  An unprecedented opposition coalition represented his latest challenge in last Sunday's general election. But while coming closer to defeat than ever, Erdoğan beat the odds yet again, looking increasingly likely to extend his two-decade rule for one last time until 2028. Erdoğan is revered for unshackling religious restrictions in the officially secular but mostly Muslim state, overseeing ambitious infrastructure projects and turning Türkiye into a geopolitical force.  Known to his inner circle as ""beyefendi"" (sir) and to admirers as ""reis"" (the chief), Erdoğan prides himself on being able to woo doubters through tireless campaigning. This passion has helped him and his party win more than a dozen local and national elections. Erdoğan risked his political domination in a 2017 referendum over abolishing the office of prime minister and handing greater powers to the president. He eked out a narrow win in the referendum that ushered Türkiye into an era of executive presidency.  Born in a working-class harbor district of Istanbul, Erdogan made his name in nascent conservative movements, becoming the city's mayor in 1994. His term in office was cut short when he was convicted and jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred when he recited a fiery poem that compared mosques to army barracks and called minarets ""our bayonets."" Among supporters, this only seemed to magnify his appeal.  Erdoğan spearheaded AK Party's 2002 landslide election victory and became premier less than six months later. His signature early achievements included a series of reforms that gladdened the European Union, including abolishing the death penalty and beginning a reconciliation process to resolve the ""Kurdish question.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2VsZWN0aW9ucy9lcmRvZ2FuLWhpdHMtb3V0LWF0LW9wcG9zaXRpb24taG9wZXMtcmVjb3JkLXZvdGUtaW4tdHVya2lzaC1ydW5vZmbSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXNhYmFoLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9lbGVjdGlvbnMvZXJkb2dhbi1oaXRzLW91dC1hdC1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWhvcGVzLXJlY29yZC12b3RlLWluLXR1cmtpc2gtcnVub2ZmL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-04-15","10:02:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:00:00","The continuing military hostilities in Sudan that began on 15 April between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces could have dire consequences for both the country, its people and the region, briefers told the Security Council today, as the members of the 15-nation organ voiced support for the recent seven-day truce, which aims to safeguard civilians and provide humanitarian access.  “Let us be clear: the responsibility for the fighting rests with those who are waging it daily,” said Volker Perthes, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS). While the international community urged parties to de-escalate and intensified its engagement with military leaders, on 15 April — when progress was thought to have been made — the parties instead chose war.  He painted a bleak picture of thousands who made gruelling journeys in search of safety and the suffering of those who stayed in their homes with depleted supplies and no access to humanitarian assistance. Homes, shops, places of worship and water and electricity installations have been destroyed; health facilities have been used as military positions; and appalling sexual violence against women and girls has been reported. Against this backdrop, he underscored that borders must remain open to those seeking safety and border crossing procedures must be expedited.  Bankole Adeoye, African Union Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, said that, despite the Union’s mediation efforts, the acute fragmentation among the Sudanese political and military actors and the multiplicity of external interference undermined the transition, which then led to the stalemate resulting in the coup of 25 October 2021. Outlining the Union’s comprehensive de-escalation plan for a sustainable resolution of the crisis, he said: “We must arrest Sudan’s slide into complete collapse, which would have unbearable consequences for the region, the African continent and, in fact, the world.”  On a positive note, Workneh Gebeyehu, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), cited the signing of the 20 May ceasefire and humanitarian agreement between the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces as progress that “makes us cautiously optimistic that a permanent cessation of hostilities is within reach”. The agreement will remain in effect for seven days — subject to extension if the parties agree — and aims to facilitate, inter alia, the delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance; restoration of essential services; and the withdrawal of forces from hospitals.  In the ensuing debate, Council members called on the parties to cease hostilities and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation. To this end, they underlined the importance of the Trilateral Mechanism — consisting of the African Union, IGAD and the United Nations — in ensuring a viable political process and building long-lasting peace.  The representative of Mozambique, also speaking for Gabon and Ghana, called on the parties to silence the guns immediately and return to the path of negotiation. Warning that the deteriorating security situation has created a conducive environment for exacerbating intercommunal clashes in Darfur, Blue Nile, South and West Kordofan States, he also expressed concern about the spill-over in neighbouring countries.  Along similar lines, the representative of Brazil, calling Sudan’s rapid descent into deadly conflict a “terrible setback”, emphasized that military means will not solve the root causes of the ongoing conflict. Welcoming the recent ceasefire and humanitarian arrangements, he stressed that negotiation is the first step to halting the current military clashes, providing adequate protection for millions of civilians and avoiding additional damage to essential civilian infrastructure.  The representative of the United Arab Emirates highlighted that more than 200,000 refugees have now crossed over into neighbouring countries, which is accelerating the humanitarian crisis for the region at a time when neighbouring countries themselves are under great strain. She also reported that, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 190 children were killed during the first 11 days of the fighting alone, with another 1,700 injured.  The representative of the United States said all must do their part to bring about peace and security as there is no time to waste, urging Sudan’s security forces to “end this senseless conflict once and for all.” Further, all parties must allow for immediate and unhindered humanitarian access for all those in need and those who have been displaced by the fighting, she said, highlighting the needs of the 1.1 million refugees who were in Sudan prior to the fighting.  However, the representative of the Russian Federation described the conflict as the result of the mismanagement of Sudan’s political settlement, with a large degree of responsibility belonging to Western countries who thought they had the right to interfere in its internal affairs. Instead of allowing the political process to be genuinely intra-Sudanese in nature, those nations imposed hasty solutions that were not accepted by population, she asserted, adding that UNITAMS unfortunately forced the civilian transition.  Rounding up the discussion, the representative of Sudan reported that the Sudanese armed forces have contained the conflict to a narrow area to prevent the enemy from achieving strategic advancements. Nonetheless, as insurgent militias seek to receive additional resources, the Sudanese armed forces must continue monitoring entry points, he said, providing examples of the systemic crimes committed by such militias “to demolish economic order and erase institutional and society memory”. Appealing to the international community for humanitarian assistance, he said that his Government has dedicated certain ports and airports to receive such aid, which will be distributed by the United Nations and national organizations.  The meeting began at 10:02 a.m. and ended at 12:18 p.m.  Briefings  VOLKER PERTHES, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), reported that the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces has shown no signs of slowing down despite repeated ceasefire declarations. Further, neither side has yet shown the ability to claim a military victory. More than 860 people have been killed, including 190 children with another 3,500 injured; more than 840,000 have sought shelter in rural areas and other States; and nearly 8,000 of the displaced are pregnant women; and approximately 250,000 have crossed Sudanese borders. These figures, however, do not capture the harrowing stories of thousands who made gruelling journeys in search of safety, nor do they illustrate the suffering of many others who stayed in their homes with depleted supplies and no access to humanitarian assistance. Borders must remain open to those seeking safety and border crossing procedures must be expedited, he stressed, pledging the continued support of the United Nations to alleviate the burden on neighbouring States.  He went on to detail the parties’ continued fighting which has been without regard for the laws and norms of war. Homes, shops, places of worship and water and electricity installations have been destroyed; health facilities have been used as military positions; and appalling sexual violence against women and girls has been reported. Children continue to be vulnerable to sexual violence, abduction and recruitment as child soldiers; United Nations premises and residences — including UNITAMS’ compound — have been looted; and criminality has been compounded by the release of thousands of prisoners and the increasing spread of small arms. There have also been reports of death threats against political activists and leaders, arrests of volunteers and the intimidation of journalists.  As well, tribal militias joined the fight and civilians took up arms to defend themselves, he continued, adding that recent renewed violence led to at least another 250 deaths and tens of thousands displaced to Chad. Tribal mobilization has also been reported in South Kordofan and the Blue Nile region. Taking to task the blame being placed on the political process and the international community for not seeing the warning signs and for giving an outsized role to men with guns, he said: “Let us be clear: the responsibility for the fighting rests with those who are waging it daily.” What has been happening since 15 April is precisely what the United Nations and its partners tried to prevent. The international community urged parties to de-escalate, intensified its engagement with military leaders and coordinated such efforts with Sudanese civilian leaders who also tried to mediate. Yet, on 15 April, when progress was thought to have been made, the parties instead chose war.  Despite the relocation of its staff to Port Sudan and outside Sudan, the United Nations has not abandoned the Sudanese people, he asserted. It remains firmly committed to achieving, among other things, a stable ceasefire and preparing a fresh political process for when the time is ripe. While UNITAMS has supported the efforts of the Organization’s country team and humanitarian partners to restore the flow of humanitarian supplies, additional funding is urgently needed. The revised Humanitarian Response Plan, launched on 17 May, is requesting $2.6 billion to reach 18 million people in need, up from 15 million before the fighting began. Moreover, parties must honour the 11 May Declaration of Commitments and the recent agreement on 20 May on a short-term ceasefire and humanitarian arrangements which will allow access for humanitarian relief; protect humanitarian workers and assets; and facilitate safe passage for civilians.  Noting that he will continue to engage with leadership of both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, he also commended the leaders of the armed movements Juba Peace Agreement signatories for their efforts in restoring peace and for their neutrality in the conflict. He urged both parties to end the fighting and return to dialogue in the interest of Sudan and its people, he emphasized. As talks advance, a diverse array of civil and political stakeholders must play their role. For its part, the world must coordinate regional and international efforts to forge a common approach which enhances collective leverage and effectiveness. Ultimately, only a credible civilian-led transition can chart a lasting peace and any coordinated plan must involve Sudan’s neighbours and the region, he underscored.  BANKOLE ADEOYE, African Union Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, said that the Union has been mobilized from the very first days of the overthrow of former President Omer Al-Bashir to resolve the post-revolution challenges and to put in place a mediation that would lead to an inclusive broad-based transition. Unfortunately, the acute fragmentation among the Sudanese political and military actors and the multiplicity of external interference undermined the transition, which then led to the stalemate resulting in the coup of 25 October 2021. Thereafter, the African Union suspended Sudan, while continuing to work with partners for a rapid restoration of constitutional order and a consensual transition, including through the establishment of the Trilateral Mechanism.  However, the outbreak of military hostilities on 15 April between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces dashed hopes that the Framework Agreement would lead to the resumption of the political transition process and usher in the prospects of a new Sudan, he continued. Since then, the African Union has been working relentlessly to ensure an end to the conflict and the resumption of an inclusive political process. On 16 April, the Peace and Security Council condemned the fighting, called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and requested the Chairperson of the Commission to use his good offices to ensure that the guns are silenced. Shortly after, key actors in the international community were brought together to intensify efforts for an immediate ceasefire and the resumption of the political process.  He outlined the African Union’s comprehensive de-escalation plan, which identifies pillars for a sustainable resolution of the Sudanese crisis, including coordinated international action to avoid a proliferation and duplication of mediation initiatives and urgent humanitarian action, among others. The destruction of public and private institutions is systematic and the sick and wounded are dying without any care, he reported, adding: “There is no one to bury them.” Gross human rights violations are rampant and arrests, looting and sexual assaults are on the rise, he said, stressing the need to put an end to the fighting and to provide humanitarian relief.  The resumption of the political transition is premised on inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation that brings together all sectors of Sudanese society, he said. The African Union is working to support such an inclusive political process, which would allow for the full representation of Sudanese civil society and political parties. It is also critical to ensure that States bordering Sudan, which are receiving growing numbers of traumatized Sudanese refugees, are assisted at this difficult time. To this end, the Union will be deploying special envoys to all of the neighbouring capitals. “We must arrest Sudan’s slide into complete collapse, which would have unbearable consequences for the region, the African continent and, in fact, the world,” he asserted.  WORKNEH GEBEYEHU, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), welcomed the signing of a ceasefire and humanitarian agreement between the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces on 20 May as progress that “makes us cautiously optimistic that a permanent cessation of hostilities is within reach”. The agreement will remain in effect for seven days — subject to extension if the parties agree — and aims to facilitate, inter alia, the delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance; restoration of essential services; and the withdrawal of forces from hospitals. While previous ceasefire agreements were repeatedly violated, he noted that, unlike previous agreements, the 20 May accord was signed by the parties and will be monitored by a ceasefire-monitoring mechanism supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia.  “The longer the fighting takes, the higher the toll will be”, he stressed, pointing out that shortages of food and medical services will exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Neighbouring countries, while either emerging from conflict or facing their own serious economic or humanitarian crises, have also been impacted, hosting thousands of refugees. For example, the price of goods in South Sudan has spiked as the national currency has weakened since the conflict broke out in Sudan. Against that backdrop, IGAD has been actively working with partner organizations and States to secure a ceasefire. Reporting that its high-level delegation has been engaging the warring parties on a daily basis — in addition to consulting and coordinating with regional and international actors — he called on the international community to support and complement these efforts in a coordinated manner.  He further reported that, despite limited capacities and resources, IGAD and its member States are doing “whatever is possible within our reach” to support the people of Sudan. Ethiopia and South Sudan, for example, are receiving thousands of refugees, with the former facilitating visas for those arriving at the border and the latter giving visas free of charge. Countries such as Ethiopia and Djibouti have also played a key role in evacuating the staff of diplomatic missions and international organizations based in Sudan. He therefore called on the international community to support these frontline countries. While commending Saudi Arabia and the United States for their “relentless effort” in facilitating talks, he encouraged them to involve and engage the Trilateral Mechanism — consisting of the African Union, IGAD and the United Nations — as the entity entrusted by regional, continental and international actors to facilitate the political process in Sudan.  Statements  JAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ), urging the parties to immediately stop fighting, also called for the protection of civilians and the granting of safe and immediate humanitarian access. Coordinated action by international and regional partners is crucial to help end this conflict, he stressed, welcoming all diplomatic efforts in this regard. However, these commitments will be worthless if they are not put into action or if they are used to secure a military advantage. Therefore, all parties must fully abide in letter and spirit. There must be strong coordination between the efforts of regional and multilateral bodies and the voices of Sudanese civilians must be heard loud and clear and included at every stage. Turning to the appalling human rights and humanitarian situation, he pointed out that visceral violence is igniting at a scale that has not been experienced in decades. Humanitarian need — having already been at record levels prior to the conflict — has risen sharply. There must be an immediate end to the continued attacks on civilian infrastructure, including homes, health-care facilities, schools and places of worship. Looting humanitarian assets is simply unacceptable and perpetrators must be held accountable, he stressed.  PEDRO COMISSÁRIO AFONSO ( Mozambique ), also speaking for Gabon and Ghana, said that the deterioration of the situation in Sudan has undermined all the progress achieved, particularly in the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement. He called on the parties to silence the guns immediately and return to the path of negotiation, underlining the importance of the Trilateral Mechanism in ensuring a viable political process and building long-lasting peace. Further, he encouraged the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to fully embrace the African Union’s de-escalation plan, stressing the need for coordination between all such initiatives. The deteriorating security situation has also created a conducive environment for exacerbating intercommunal clashes in Darfur, Blue Nile, South and West Kordofan States. In addition, it poses serious security threats to the seven neighbouring States, with reports of human rights violations, including attacks on the civilian population, particularly women, children, and vulnerable people, diplomatic personnel, United Nations and humanitarian workers.  He also decried the targeting of diplomatic premises, including widespread looting of United Nations premises, particularly in Khartoum and Darfur, stressing: “Perpetrators of such acts should be made to face justice in due course.” Expressing concern about the spill-over in neighbouring countries, he underscored that there is a need for a stronger collaboration between UNITAMS and other United Nations missions and entities operating in the region. Turning to the humanitarian situation in Sudan, he said that 700,000 people have been internally displaced, most of them coming from Khartoum, West Darfur and South Darfur, and 150,000 have left Sudan, including the refugee returnees back to their countries of origin, which are not safe. Against this backdrop, he reiterated the appeal for sustained support for the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan and commended efforts aimed at achieving a humanitarian truce and the establishment of humanitarian corridors.  JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO ( Brazil ), calling Sudan’s rapid descent into deadly conflict a “terrible setback”, underscored that another such setback would be insisting that the current conflict be solved through military means. The United Nations, the African Union, IGAD and the League of Arab States — and virtually all of Sudan’s partners — have called for ceasefires and truces precisely because military means will not solve the root causes of the ongoing conflict. Welcoming the recent ceasefire and humanitarian arrangements, he called on the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces to exercise maximum restraint and uphold the truce. Negotiation is the first step to halting the current military clashes, providing adequate protection for millions of civilians and avoiding additional damage to essential civilian infrastructure. There will be no Sudanese ownership of the political process without peaceful coexistence between leading military and paramilitary forces, he added, calling on Sudanese stakeholders to engage with ongoing initiatives in good faith.  DAI BING ( China ), noting his country was a “good friend and partner”, said he sincerely hoped the two parties will prioritize peace and the population’s well-being, stop hostilities and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation. The pressing task is to ensure the implementation of commitments to ensure civilian and civilian infrastructure protection while providing security guarantees to facilitate humanitarian assistance and evacuation. For its part, the United Nations and its international partners must support and cooperate with regional organizations to provide the necessary time and space for regional mediation. Sudan’s developments demonstrate that a solution can only be found within, he pointed out, cautioning that external interference or unilateral sanctions will only intensify tensions and aggravate political and social crises. As such, relevant parties must seriously reflect on the current situation and refrain from expanding such sanctions. He also expressed his support for the Organization to communicate and coordinate with Khartoum and its neighbours to ease humanitarian pressures. Turning to UNITAM’s mandate, which will expire in early June, he urged the penholders to respect Sudan’s views and stay in close contact as this will be conducive for long-term cooperation.  HERNÁN PÉREZ LOOSE ( Ecuador ) highlighted that 37 days have passed since the start of armed violence in Sudan, which deteriorated the already precarious humanitarian situation of the civilian population. Thus, UNITAMS must play a critical role in seeking peace and security, which affects not only Sudan but also the whole region. The Mission’s work must be bolstered, as it remains central in strengthening gender inclusion in the political process. Turning to the humanitarian situation in Sudan, he voiced concern about the situation of mass displacement of the population, with alarming figures nearing 1 million people, while another 250,000 have fled to neighbouring countries. It is essential that the agencies of the United Nations system have the necessary resources to overcome this humanitarian crisis, he stressed, noting that women and girls are always the most affected. In this context, UNITAMS is fundamental in carrying out peacebuilding activities, protecting civilians and strengthening the rule of law, with special attention to gender-based violence. It is also crucial to strengthen the work carried out by UNITAMS in removing explosive devices and mines, as established in the Juba Agreement.  ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ) reiterated his call on both parties to immediately stop fighting and return to a peaceful political process. “We cannot accept any use of force that undermines the Sudanese-led and Sudanese-owned process towards a transition to civilian rule,” he said, commending regional and international initiatives to that end. As Tokyo is seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in both Sudan and its neighbouring countries, his Government has decided to implement assistance to Chad, Egypt and South Sudan through international organizations in response to the influx of refugees. Also of importance is maintaining UNITAMS under such difficult circumstances. For its part, the Council must speak in a united voice and support the Mission as it seeks to revive the political process while also maintaining the other three pillars of its mandate. Going forward, Japan will actively contribute to the discussions on adapting the Mission’s strategic objectives and operations to the rapidly changing circumstances while ensuring that the Council has the optimal insights into the political dynamics affecting its work, he said. In that vein, all parties in Sudan must ensure that UNITAMS can carry out its activities unhindered.  LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ), calling on parties to fulfil their obligations under the recent seven-day ceasefire, stressed: “Now, more than ever, it is critical that the Council signal its full support for the Mission.” All must do their part to bring about peace and security as there is no time to waste, she added. To this end, the United States is closely cooperating with its partners, including Saudi Arabia, IGAD, the African Union and the League of Arab States, to name but a few. As all parties must allow for immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for all those in need and those who have been displaced by the fighting, she highlighted her Government’s commitment to address humanitarian needs and underscored that the international community must not forget the needs of the 1.1 million refugees who were in Sudan prior to the fighting. All refugees and asylum-seekers must not only have access to protection but must also be able to eventually and voluntarily return to their countries of origin when conditions permit, she continued, urging Sudan’s security forces to “end this senseless conflict once and for all.”  LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH ( United Arab Emirates ) welcomed the short-term ceasefire and humanitarian arrangement signed over the weekend, stressing that its details must be fully implemented. Since the beginning of the fighting, the United Arab Emirates has sent nine planes to Sudan, evacuating almost 1,000 people. Her Government is supporting neighbouring countries which have taken in refugees, including dispatching 229 tons of aid to Chad to help the displaced Sudanese. However, much work still remains to be done, she emphasized, calling for the safe passage of aid workers, distribution of humanitarian supplies and unimpeded flow of goods to restore essential services. More than 200,000 refugees have now crossed over into neighbouring countries, which is accelerating the humanitarian crisis for the region at a time when neighbouring countries themselves are under great strain. Tragically, the lives of many children have been cut short by the fighting; according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 190 children were killed during the first 11 days of the fighting alone, with another 1,700 injured. Against this backdrop, she stressed the need for continuity of relief services and voiced support for the renewal of UNITAMS mandate.  DARREN CAMILLERI ( Malta ), welcoming recent mediation efforts — including the brokering of a seven-day ceasefire — stressed that this is the only path to sustainable peace and stability in Sudan. Women and girls remain at high risk of sexual and gender-based violence, and he urged that protection measures be strengthened for them as well as for the elderly, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. He also condemned attacks on civilian infrastructure, humanitarian and medical workers and United Nations premises, expressing concern that an estimated $14 million worth of food products and more than 1 million polio vaccines have been destroyed by looting. The conflict in Sudan is also impacting the wider region, and the high number of refugees and displaced persons could result in further destabilization in a fragile region. Against that backdrop, he welcomed all efforts that seek to support dialogue and mediation and stressed that such efforts must include women, youth and civil society. Urging both parties to act on calls for political settlement, he also called on the authorities to fully respect UNITAMS’ mandate.  ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA ( Russian Federation ) urged the Council to understand and analyse the steps which have led to the current confrontation. From her Government’s view, the conflict is the result of the mismanagement of Sudan’s political settlement, with a large degree of responsibility belonging to Western countries who thought they had the right to interfere in its internal affairs. Instead of allowing the political process to be genuinely intra-Sudanese in nature, those nations imposed hasty solutions that were not accepted by the population. UNITAMS, for its part, unfortunately forced the civilian transition, she said, recalling Moscow’s repeated concerns over the insufficient efforts to attract international financial assistance for Khartoum’s socioeconomic stabilization. Sudan must not only have the full right to make decisions about its future but also bear that responsibility, she stressed, underlining the legacy of colonialism as the root cause of its structural problems. She called on Sudanese parties to immediately end the fighting, while emphasizing that the Libyan experience must not be repeated. “Now is not the time to complicate the parameters of [United Nations] assistance, she said regarding UNITAMS.  NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ) said that the situation in Sudan has continued to deteriorate since 15 April, not only in Khartoum but also in Western Darfur. She condemned the indiscriminate violence, which violates the commitments made by both parties on 11 May in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, noting that this crisis threatens to destabilize the region. She also voiced concern over a massive increase in the number of displaced people, refugees and people facing food insecurity. The determination of the parties to continue the combat means that millions of civilians will continue to be affected, either by the fighting or by the disruption of humanitarian assistance. Commending the continued action of the United Nations on the ground and the solidarity of neighbouring countries in hosting refugees, she reported that the European Union’s support has amounted to more than €150 million this year and spotlighted efforts undertaken by regional players, as well as by the United States and Saudi Arabia. She welcomed the recent ceasefire that has just been established, noting that the parties must implement the commitments made in Jeddah by opening humanitarian corridors and ceasing hostilities.  ALBANA DAUTLLARI ( Albania ) welcomed the recent ceasefire agreement but underscored that “words must be followed by actions”. Continued conflict will only worsen divisions, fragment society and escalate the risk of prolonged intercommunal clashes. The current situation in Sudan is regrettable, as it compromises the significant progress that had been achieved before the conflict erupted. Spotlighting the risk of regional fragmentation and expressing concern over high rates of casualties and displacement, she urged both parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and infrastructure. Further, they must ensure safe movement for civilians, along with access to essential resources such as food, water and medical supplies. She also welcomed all diplomatic efforts by the international community, regional actors, the United Nations, the African Union, IGAD and the League of Arab States, along with reiterating her country’s support for UNITAMS’ work.  PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL ( Switzerland ), Council President for May, speaking in her national capacity, expressed her regret that current conditions did not allow for a civil society briefer to participate. Calling for the guns to be silenced, she said that fighting in densely populated areas, the targeting of critical infrastructure, widespread looting and theft have threatened civilian safety and livelihoods as the destruction of diplomatic and humanitarian premises have severely limited the ability to provide support to Sudan’s population. Moreover, the fighting also threatens to exacerbate existing conflicts, particularly in Darfur and Blue Nile, which could lead to a further escalation. Within this context, both parties must respect international humanitarian law; facilitate full, safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need; and enable the evacuation of the wounded. Many of those who have been able to flee the violence remain acutely vulnerable and need the Council’s full support, she said, underlining the vitality of the recent ceasefire’s full implementation for alleviating suffering. A durable ceasefire, however, must be complemented by a return to negotiations in which diplomatic efforts are closely coordinated and Sudanese civilian actors remain central, she emphasized.  Ms. EVSTIGNEEVA ( Russian Federation ), taking the floor a second time, responded to the representative of France, rejecting the narrative that the West is never guilty of anything but only brings democracy and peace. However, noting this never ends up in stability, she said it was this way “peace and democracy were brought into Libya and Somalia and many other regions of the world”. Regarding France’s peace and economic efforts in Africa, she commented that volumes and volumes have been written about that already.  AL-HARITH IDRISS AL-HARITH MOHAMED ( Sudan ), spotlighting the recent short-term truce, said that the purpose of the agreement — sponsored by Saudi Arabia and the United States — is to safeguard civilians, promote adherence to international humanitarian and human-rights law, provide humanitarian access and restore basic services. Appealing to the international community and United Nations agencies for humanitarian assistance, he said that the Government has dedicated certain ports and airports to receive such aid, which will be distributed by the United Nations and national organizations. Further, based on its constitutional responsibility to protect national security, the Government has committed to the norms of war through its response to repeated calls for a truce that has led to the current agreement. He also reported that the Sudanese armed forces have contained the conflict to a narrow area to prevent the enemy from achieving strategic advancements; prevented insurgent militias from receiving cross-border assistance; and used limited-impact weapons that are carefully targeted. However, as insurgent militias seek to receive additional resources, the Sudanese armed forces — despite agreements — must continue monitoring entry points. He went on to provide examples of the systemic crimes committed by such militias “to demolish economic order and erase institutional and society memory”, calling on the international community and the Council to condemn this “unprecedented” aggression.  He also detailed Government efforts to build peace in Darfur. On regional implications, he offered a detailed description and definition regarding the classification of “refugees” and “internally displaced persons”, stressing that there are no Sudanese refugees in Egypt, Eritrea or Chad and that Sudanese citizens are not granted special legal status so long as they remain in the country’s borders. However, both these groups of people and the large number of persons who crossed borders require assistance, he said, urging they receive prioritized humanitarian support. Turning to statements regarding the negative regional impacts of the conflict in Sudan, he underscored that “no one has verified that there is an impact affecting regional security”. He nevertheless welcomed the role of IGAD and the Trilateral Mechanism, noting that the Government will participate in a summit to be held in Djibouti on 12 June. On UNITAMS, he called on the Mission to prioritize, inter alia, peacebuilding, reconstruction, capacity-building, humanitarian efforts and social reconciliation. Additionally, he said that financial assistance pledged by donors and international actors for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes has not been provided, and that the Secretary-General’s report neglected to mention that the insurgent forces started the conflict in his country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vcHJlc3MudW4ub3JnL2VuLzIwMjMvc2MxNTI5MS5kb2MuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T06:08:43","0 Shares  Turkey recently held a pivotal presidential election that would have not only dictated the political and economic trajectory of the country, but also the fate of millions of refugees living in the country. The results, however, were not consequential and a run-off election will take place on May 28.  The two candidates fighting for power are the current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been in power for the past 20 years, and Kemal Kiliçdaroglu, the leader of the Republican People’s Party (CHP). Both political figures hold differing conceptions of what Turkey should look like, but the best starting point is to dive into what Erdogan’s time as president has looked like.  Erdogan has had nothing short of a tricky relationship with democracy. There is a general consensus that the past 20 years of his rule have coincided with a consistent decrease in levels of democratic governance.  While a number of external and societal trends have put pressure on Turkey’s democracy, much of the pressure is the result of Erdogan himself. Not only has he perpetuated the societal polarization between conservative and progressive camps, but he has also transformed the parliamentary system into a presidential one, resulting in the abandonment of checks and balances.  The transformation of Turkey’s government took place after a failed coup attempt in July 2016. After declaring a state of emergency, Erdogan used the special powers to chip away at the opposition by imprisoning thousands of political figures and journalists.  Eventually, in 2017, a successful ballot measure transformed the parliamentary system into a presidential system. This transformation entailed an accumulation of powers that concerned experts due to the lack of checks and balances.  This structural transformation coincided with an erosion of the rule of law, questionable elections and a weakening of opposition leaders. Freedom of expression has also declined, and most media companies have been transferred to business figures who are sympathetic to Erdogan’s regime.  As such, the upcoming runoff signals that Erdogan’s power might be gradually slipping away. The past decade has seen the Republican People’s Party, the strongest opposition party in Turkey, usually earns around 30% of the vote in presidential elections. The first round of elections a couple of weeks ago, however, saw the CHP gain 44.5% of the vote.  This is likely due to a number of factors. For one, the lire (Turkey’s currency) has seen its value consistently plummet since 2018. Despite a number of attempts to put it back on track, no policy has been successful in this respect. There is also a growing frustration in regard to Erdogan’s islamic nationalism and autocratic tendencies. That being said, Kemal Kiliçdaroglu represents something new and different to many voters despite his own shortcomings.  Kiliçdaroglu is best known as a soft-spoken yet extremely experienced politician. He was first elected to public office in 2002, and in 2010 he became the leader of the CHP and has lost several elections since then. His rhetoric generally focuses on uniting all aspects of society and has done work in the past in regard to anti-corruption.  There are similarities between the two candidates, however, and it is these similarities that might be the root of the success Kiliçdaroglu has experienced so far. The CHP frontrunner has recently announced his plan to deport all refugees in a country with around 3.5 million Syrian refugees. This announcement is part of an increasingly nationalist agenda Kiliçdaroglu has started to embrace.  Whether his stance on refugees is a temporary electoral tool or not, the agenda he is setting could have lasting negative impacts on human rights. Even though Kiliçdaroglu represents a pro-democracy option for Turkish voters, his xenophobia could hurt millions of people.  The upcoming run-offs represent a potential win for democracy in a world that is becoming increasingly less democratic. Yet the problem this run-off represents is rather unique. Is Turkish democracy worth the displacement of millions of already displaced people? The answer is one the citizens of Turkey must grapple with. If democracy does increase, then all we can hope is that the next leader makes the right decision.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZHVjbGFyaW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2lzLXR1cmtpc2gtZGVtb2NyYWN5LXdvcnRoLXRoZS1kaXNwbGFjZW1lbnQtb2YtbWlsbGlvbnMtb2YtcmVmdWdlZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While the nine councilors who proposed and supported the gerrymandered map stated it did not violate the Voter Right Act, it clearly appeared to me to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.  As US District Court Judge Patti Saris ruled the proposed map likely was unconstitutional and has been thrown out. A new map must be drawn by the Boston City Council that doesn’t use race as a reason to gerrymander districts. District 3 City Councilor Frank Baker stated correctly, “Gerrymandering is gerrymandering whether in pursuit of progressive or conservative goals. The court saw that an unfair map would deprive the residents of District 3 and the citizens of Boston of their time-honored role and stature.”  Everything is now back in the council’s court and time is of the essence as nomination papers are already out there for this fall’s city council elections.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)  The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency warned Monday of a rise in anti-government extremist groups seeking to divide society and topple the government, which receive support by authoritarian states such as Russia  BERLIN -- The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency warned Monday of a rise in anti-government extremism - fueled by authoritarian states such as Russia - that seeks to divide society and topple the government.  German security agencies have disrupted several plots in recent years by small groups linked to the Reich Citizens movement accused of planning attacks on critical infrastructure, government officials and even the national parliament. While it is unclear how far advanced such plans were, authorities have expressed alarm that the alleged plotters had acquired weapons and included people who aren't usually on the radar of security agencies, such as judges and police officers.  Thomas Haldenwang, who heads the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, said the mixing of previously separate groups — from far-right extremists to QAnon conspiracy theorists — and their willingness to use violence was particularly worrying.  “What links all of these groups is that they despise our state and our democracy, reject it and want to abolish it,” he told The Associated Press in an interview in Berlin.  Haldenwang said anti-government extremists consciously use wedge issues to stoke fear and gain new followers. These include migration — where far-right actors have perpetuated the myth of a “great replacement” — but also government measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic and combat climate change.  “All of these issues can be used to spread a particular narrative and give the impression that the state isn't in control of certain situations and therefore it needs to be toppled,” he said.  Recent government plans to encourage Germans to replace old oil and gas heaters with efficient and climate-friendly heat pumps have faced hostility from opposition parties but also extremist groups seeking to tap into homeowners' fears that they'll be saddled with high costs, despite warnings from experts that the alternative is more expensive in the long run.  “The more complex an issue is, the more intensively one has to deal with a topic, the more there is a tendency to seek simple answers and run after people who offer an easy solution for problems,” said Haldenwang. “Often those are people from the extremist circles.”  The BfV chief said such trends are actively fueled by countries like Russia, which has an interest in destabilizing democracy in Europe's biggest economy.  “When they recognize that there are sentiments in the country that can lead to division, then those sentiments are supported,” he said. “And we see a large number of measures being taken (to that effect).”  Haldenwang cited disinformation being spread by Russian state media and internet platforms, but said key influencers are also targeted by Russia's agents in Berlin to carry propaganda into German society.  “Naturally there are attempts to get close to certain politicians on the right or left fringes,” he told The AP. “Less so to support those political parties than to use their role to split society.”  Aside from the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has come under scrutiny from the BfV, among the most prominent figures attacking the government are Left party lawmaker Sahra Wagenknecht and Haldenwang's own predecessor, Hans-Georg Maassen, who was fired five years ago after downplaying anti-migrant violence.  “Of course it's nice for Russian actors if they can win such people over for their purposes and possibly use their influence in certain audiences,” said Haldenwang.  “If those people have a large number of followers in certain media then the aim of dividing society is achieved in that way,” he said, adding: “The fact that my predecessor allows himself to become a mouthpiece for this is something that irritates me beyond all measure.”  Haldenwang said there were “astonishing parallels” between the present and the 1920s and 1930s that should prompt concern.  “For too long there was too little opposition to the rise of extremism and authoritarianism,” he told a conference of security experts Monday. “Ninety years ago an elected extremist party gained power that first led Germany into a dictatorship and finally toward total ruin.”  While the current conditions are different than a century ago, Haldenwang said Russia's attack on Ukraine last year has been seized upon by “intellectual arsonists on the new right, demagogues and extremist ideologues, conspiracy theorists and influencers for foreign powers” who have helped stoke anxiety and polarization in some parts of society.  Germany and other European countries have expelled a considerable number of suspected Russian spies since the outbreak of war and sought to curb its state-backed media. China is also increasingly being seen as a threat in the theater of “hybrid warfare,” though Beijing's efforts to undermine democracy in Germany and elsewhere are considered more subtle but potentially more dangerous.  “Russia is the storm, China is climate change,” he said, echoing a similar warning from last year.  Haldenwang told The AP that coup plots such as those disrupted last year likely won't be the last as some “are again talking about a 'Day X' when certain things are meant to happen.”  ""We are monitoring such efforts very intensively, very carefully, and I'm certain that we will be able to intervene in time together with other security agencies,” he said. “But I can't completely rule out that groups will forms under the radar of the security agencies.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3Rvcnkvc3B5LWNoaWVmLXdhcm5zLWF1dGhvcml0YXJpYW4tc3RhdGVzLXN0b2tpbmctYW50aS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LTk5NTAyNjY20gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3Rvcnkvc3B5LWNoaWVmLXdhcm5zLWF1dGhvcml0YXJpYW4tc3RhdGVzLXN0b2tpbmctYW50aS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LTk5NTAyNjY2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2018-07-25","23:00:00","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-22T10:52:54","By Gibran Naiyyar Peshimam  ISLAMABAD (Reuters) – Pakistan’s military has struck back after an unprecedented challenge to its hegemony by the popular Imran Khan and his followers, but the nuclear-armed nation remains caught between its most powerful institution and the man who was once a firm ally.  Khan’s arrest on corruption charges earlier this month, which he says was at the behest of the generals, led to violent nationwide protests, attacks on military buildings and on the homes of senior officers, allegedly by the former prime minister’s supporters.  There has never been that kind of challenge to Pakistan’s military, which has held sway over the country since independence in 1947 with a mixture of fear and respect. It has been in power for three of those decades and has wielded extraordinary influence even with a civilian government in office.  “I’ve seen the fall of Dhaka and of course there was a lot of opposition later, but never of this severity,” said Naeem Khalid Lodhi, a general who was part of the army’s top decision making process as a corps commander, and later held key government posts.  The 1971 fall of Dhaka in what was then East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh after defeat by arch-enemy India has been the lowest point for Pakistan’s military since 1947.  Populist civilian leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took charge after that debacle, holding sway over the army for five years. The generals, however, staged a military coup in 1977, and stayed in power for 11 years. Military ruler Gen. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq ordered Bhutto hanged.  Khan was released by court order two days after his arrest, but his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party now faces the ire of the military.  Thousands of supporters have been arrested, including Khan’s top aides. The government has said those accused of being involved in attacks on its installations will be tried by military courts – a platform typically reserved for enemies of the state.  With Pakistan also grappling with a devastating economic crisis, a showdown between the military and its most popular political leader could push the nation of 220 million to the brink of chaos.  “(The military) is trying to assert raw power by invoking the draconian Army Act against civil society and thereby risks destroying Pakistan’s fragile constitutional system,” said Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center and author of “The Battle for Pakistan”.  A spokesperson for the military did not respond to several requests for comment.  KHAN’S GAMBIT  While civilian organisations have historically been unable to stand up to the military’s might in a country where no elected prime minister has completed a full term, Khan is unlikely to be a pushover.  The larger-than-life 70-year-old is an Oxford graduate, was part of London’s smart set in the late 1970s and later led cricket-mad Pakistan to victory in the 1992 World Cup. Famed for his aggressive, never-say-die attitude when he played the game, he seems to have brought that approach into politics.  After years in the wilderness, rival political parties said the military supported his ascent to become prime minister in 2018 while Khan himself blamed the same generals for his ouster last year. The military denies any role in his taking office or his ouster.  Since then Khan has shown an uncanny ability to mobilise crowds and some analysts say he has the support of many in the rank-and-file of the military.  “Khan has weaponised the resentment his followers feel about his removal into a frontal assault on army leaders,” said Aqil Shah, an academic and author of the book “The Army and Democracy in Pakistan”.  His popularity remains high – well ahead of his opponents, according to local polls – in the run-up to national elections which are due by November this year.  However, Khan is vulnerable on many fronts. If he is found guilty in any of the numerous cases against him, ranging from corruption to inciting terror, it would in all probability disqualify him from participating in the polls.  The army’s vast intelligence apparatus will also turn the screws on PTI’s leadership, many of whom have already jumped ship because of pressure and fear of retribution, Khan says.  THE WAY FORWARD  Analysts say talks are necessary between Khan, the army and the civilian government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to defuse the situation – but there have been no indications of any negotiated settlement.  Khan has dismissed the Sharif government as inconsequential.  Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told Reuters that Khan’s supporters attacked “sensitive military installations” and that the law would take its course.  Zulfiqar Bukhari, one of Khan’s few close aides yet to be arrested, says the PTI has reached out for talks with the military, but had got no response.  “Unfortunately, no one wants to listen,” he said.  Some analysts believe Khan will have to placate the generals in some way for him to survive.  Others said the gloves were off and the military would not back down.  “Ultimate power in Pakistan flows through the barrel of the gun,” said Shah, the academic. “The military is unlikely to give Khan the off-ramp any time soon.”  Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States and currently a scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said the military has lost standing significantly and it will not accept being attacked and taunted.  “The military’s power comes from its ability to deploy force, not popularity – Pakistan’s generals like being liked but they like being in control even more,” he said.

"political coup","2021-09-18","14:00:00","{""Rangoon"", ""Rangoon"", ""Myanmar""}","2023-05-22T13:46:12","A new report shows that U.S.-based timber traders continued to import thousands of metric tons of Myanmar timber, despite sanctions imposed following the February 2021 military coup and brutal crackdown on citizens.  More than 3,000 metric tons of teak, a material highly prized in the manufacture of luxury furniture and yachts, were imported into the U.S. since February 2021, the report says.  Claims that imported timber is coming from stockpiles harvested and set aside prior to the 2021 coup are dubious, the report says, and the accuracy of timber tracing technology to verify legality in this time of conflict in Myanmar is highly questionable.  The report calls on U.S. authorities to do more to regulate the timber trade and enforce sanctions to make sure companies and the public are not unwittingly financing the “brutal” military regime.  Vast quantities of timber from Myanmar continue to enter the United States despite sanctions on the country’s state-controlled timber monopoly, according to a new report from U.K.-based watchdog group the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).  Following the February 2021 military coup and violent crackdowns on citizens, countries including the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom placed sanctions on Myanmar’s junta leaders and military-run enterprises from the forestry, mining, and oil and gas sectors in an effort to curb the regime’s access to natural resource revenues.  However, according to the new report, U.S. timber traders imported more than 3,000 metric tons of Myanmar teak into the U.S. over the past two years.  The sanctions have had “no major impact on the trade of Myanmar teak into the US,” according to the report. “Instead, trade has continued at the same levels as before the coup, with the fourth quarter of 2022 seeing some of the biggest monthly imports since the time leading up to and after February 2021.”  Teak (Tectona grandis) possesses natural water resistance and is much sought-after for high-end furniture, flooring and for fitting out luxury yachts owned by some of the richest people in the world.  Given that Myanmar or Burmese teak is considered among the highest quality in the world, international demand for the timber is a major driver of deforestation in the country. With a Belgium-size area of forest lost between 2001 and 2018, the EIA predicts that Myanmar’s forests will disappear by 2035 if the current trend continues.  This would be a serious blow for biodiversity. Myanmar’s remaining tracts of intact forest include some of mainland Southeast Asia’s most biologically rich landscapes. They’re home to charismatic species like the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus), several gibbon species and critically endangered Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica). Moreover, species that occur nowhere else on the planet cling to existence in remaining forest refuges. Fewer than 260 Popa langurs (Trachypithecus popa) are thought to remain in the world, for instance, all of them residing in four isolated patches of forest in Myanmar’s central plains.  The 2021 sanctions were levied on state-controlled company Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE), which effectively holds a monopoly over the entire forestry sector. MTE regulates all harvesting and sales of timber in Myanmar and draws a percentage of all timber export revenue, thereby representing a key source of income for the military regime.  Secrecy stymies sanctions  The report identifies the top 12 U.S.-based companies that have imported Myanmar teak since the 2021 coup. Two companies, East Teak Fine Hardwoods and J. Gibson McIlvain, account for 88% of all teak imports during that period, trading a combined 1,600 metric tons of teakwood. Neither company responded immediately to Mongabay’s requests for comment.  The EIA says it provided all 12 company identities to U.S. authorities in December 2022 to give them an opportunity to investigate and act. At that time, the dozen firms had imported 2,760.46 metric tons of teakwood since sanctions were imposed. In the intervening period, up until May 2023, the EIA says a further 308.24 metric tons of Myanmar teak have entered the U.S.  U.S. traders continuing to import timber in defiance of the sanctions aren’t only acting beyond the law — they’re also essentially supporting a regime consistently committing human rights abuses, the EIA says. Since the coup, violent crackdowns on pro-democracy protesters and deadly airstrikes on civilian targets have been widely reported. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPPB), the military regime has killed 3,558 civilians and arrested more than 22,531 people since the coup.  “By closing their eyes to the brutality of the military regime, both traders and those consuming teak for their yachts and floors are supplying much needed hard currency to a junta bankrupting the nation, supporting ever-increasing criminality within the country and enabling corruption,” the EIA report says.  Further to the sanctions imposed in response to the 2021 coup, Myanmar teak also cannot be traded in compliance with the U.S. Lacey Act, which requires that imports of wildlife, fish or plants must be legally harvested under the exporting country’s laws. This should in theory prevent imports of illegally sourced timber into the U.S.  The report says that some timber trading companies claim their teak was harvested and stockpiled prior to the coup. However, with the MTE under military control, Myanmar’s timber auctions have become more opaque, making it difficult to trace the provenance and legality of timber, the report warns. The military junta rarely disclose revenues generated from timber sales, or make clear where timber traded at auctions is sourced from.  The lack of transparency essentially renders it impossible to tell whether exported timber came from stockpiles purchased before the coup and whether it was legally harvested. The likelihood that any legal timber is mixed with illegal timber “is extremely high,” the report says. It adds that the military is also unlikely to be following national laws that ban exports of raw timber and that any third-party verification of lumber via DNA testing is dubious due to the challenges of accessing trees and timber in Myanmar during the current unrest.  The continued trade highlights the challenges of tracing timber and enforcing sanctions and regulations. The EIA report is the latest in a string of investigations documenting the failure of sanctions to stem the flow of Myanmar timber into North America and Europe.  In 2021, advocacy group Justice for Myanmar (JFM) found that U.S. firms were circumventing sanctions by buying timber from private brokers, instead of directly from MTE, many of whom were shipping timber via intermediate countries like China.  Also in 2021, Forest Trends reported that almost one-fifth of Myanmar’s total timber exports reported between February and November 2021 went to countries with active sanctions on MTE. According to the Forest Trends report, the overall number of companies importing sawn teakwood into the U.S. dropped by two-thirds during that period, but total trade in the timber increased slightly.  Immediate action required  The EIA report urges the U.S. government and enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute those who continue to import Myanmar teak and to tighten controls on timber brought into the country. One way the EIA suggests to achieve this would be through the Timber Interdiction Membership Board and Enforcement Resource (TIMBER) Working Group, a task force newly formed in April 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Faith Doherty, the forest campaigns lead for the EIA, said inaction to clamp down on those continuing to violate timber laws is simply unacceptable. “Without action, it’s no wonder US-based traders blithely continue to import Myanmar’s blood teak when they know there will be no consequences,” she said.  “The US Government must act against all those involved in the trade of blood timber from Myanmar, using the full weight of the law to prevent profits from timber supporting the military regime and its cronies.”  Banner image: White-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) are one of many species of rare primates still found in Myanmar’s rapidly diminishing forests.

"political coup","1981-09-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T06:51:15","Turkish opposition, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has a chairman, but no leader. This reality was heard loud and clear in the first round of presidential elections on May 14, and now in the upcoming second round on May 28. However, it is too late.  The lack of a leader in the CHP may not be a problem for the new generations. Hence their carefree attitude and willingness to vote for “anything.” Yet this lack of care is likely to drive the CHP’s potential electorate – particularly youth – into a “political void.” We will be extensively discussing long after the elections the traumatic outcomes of politicizing at the table, on paper, and based on social media rather than on ideology and tradition.  Similar voids are observed not only at in communities, but at the “state” level as well. Europe and numerous Western countries are now sensing deeply the lack of a “powerful leader.” Our neighbor Greece’s unstable leaders and state of dependency on outside powers is obvious. We saw how expectations that heightened with Alexis Tsipras turned into disappointment. Germany’s political communication power collapsed post-Angela Merkel. Before the French media and public could digest President Emannuel Macron being crushed and dull against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, they faced confrontation by the leaders in Africa, which they used to exploit once-upon-a-time. Americans, who put their hopes in U.S. President Joe Biden to escape Donald Trump, now have a leader who “shakes hands with thin air and forgets he is president.” Everyone can see clearly now that Volodymyr Zelensky, who transferred from a comedy to politics and got Ukraine into war with Russia, is playing political influencer in his khaki-colored top.  Let’s make a sharp turn back to the CHP. The void caused by İsmet İnönü, who “seized” both the CHP, the country’s administration, and founding leader Mustafa Kemal’s legacy following his passing, as a result of his defeat against Adnan Menderes in three consecutive elections as of 1950, is yet to be filled despite the passing years. The CHP has never since then come to power in any election and via democratic means. Its votes could never surpass 25 percent.  Why is the CHP, the founder and protector of the Republic, and the engineer of the state systematic, not accepted by the public?  The first answer is very clear: They are unable to convince the public, because they display hostility towards the people who choose not to elect them, who do not share their opinions. The CHP’s name includes “people,” but it is disposed to nurture hostility towards the people. It is this very CHP disposition on which the insults after May 14 aimed at the earthquake victims, and the people who voted for Erdoğan are based.  I will share two quotes from the late Bülent Ecevit, a former president, in reference to whom the CHP now say, “We learned a lot from him. He was our dark boy.”  The first is from his initial statement when he became CHP chair after deposing İnönü in congress: “Those who believe revolution can be achieved not with the people, but based on intellectual crews outside and above the people, cannot be with us.”  This self-criticism by Ecevit was really an explanation of what the left-wing in Türkiye think revolution is. The İnönü-led CHP’s understanding of revolution was, “if the people do not elect us, the military will conduct a coup, and we will end up running the country anyway.” Ecevit took over the CHP leadership to wipe out this mindset. He achieved his objective in the 1973 election, and Ecevit, who made the CHP win for the first time, wanted to destroy the “Chief of General Staff rule the country” idea. However, the army was not pleased with this CHP. Thus, after the Sept. 12, 1981 coup, Ecevit carried over the “national left” politics he failed to do in the CHP to the Democratic Left Party (DSP).  There was a Social Democratic People's Party (SHP) (CHP) criticism that Ecevit made years later, and it points to the present times: “A party that carries to Parliament on its back those who openly state they want to divide Türkiye for the sake of gaining a little more vote in the southeast, cannot claim heirship to the Republican People’s Party.”  Deniz Baykal, who came to the CHP’s leadership when the party was re-established in 1992, he presented the political charisma needed to lead the Turkish left. Yet, he never received the support that is given to Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu today. His struggles to protect the CHP from outside intervention were revealed years later. Despite being a politician and statesman who counteracted Erdoğan, despite his articulateness, he was pushed to withdraw from office via plots.  The lack of a leader was exposed when Kılıçdaroğlu was brought to office after Baykal. Though Kılıçdaroğlu became the “Turkish left’s forced hope” with the pride he takes in his past despite his heavy baggage and unsuccessful bureaucracy, his inarticulacy, and inadequacy against Erdoğan, it could not make him the ""Turkish left’s leader.”  Kılıçdaroğlu is the presidential candidate of an alliance never before seen in Turkish politics. He is a candidate over which completely different ideologies and politicians agree. In other words, he is the implementer of an engineering operation. However, he is never a leader. If he was a leader, he would have been a presidential candidate with campaigns tailored to his politics rather than being an actor in whose name campaigns are organized, and who acts upon agencies’ ideas.  The origin of the Turkish left and its components’ anti-Erdoğan sentiment is great jealousy. The electorate, who is stuck between the inadequacy of their candidate and Erdoğan’s leadership charisma, thus has no choice but to be enslaved by various plots, lies, and slanders. This is why they cling onto figures like Mansur Yavaş and Ekrem İmamoğlu, who do not share the CHP sentiment, but act like they do as per the conjuncture, only to experience great disappointment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnllbmlzYWZhay5jb20vZW4vY29sdW1ucy9lcnNpbi1jZWxpay90aGUtdHJhdW1hLW9mLXR1cmtpeWVzLWxlZnQtd2luZy0zNjY0NDg20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-09","10:00:00","{""Mardan"", ""NorthWestFrontier"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-22T14:00:49","For much of the past week, former Pakistani Prime Minster Imran Khan’s house in Lahore has been surrounded by armed police, and the Rangers – a repressive force straddling the police and Army but under civilian control – have been on standby. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has ruled that Khan should not be arrested, but he doubts he will stay out of jail for long. The entire leadership of his party, the PTI, is currently behind bars. A state crackdown is in full swing.  This marks a dramatic escalation of the political war between the PTI and the Army, along with its favoured politicians and the government it manoeuvred into place after removing Khan from office last April. The new administration is essentially a coalition of Pakistan’s dynastic parties led by Bhutto-Zardari and the Sharif family. Since it was installed, Khan has repeatedly accused the US of orchestrating the congressional coup against him – motivated by his refusal to support their interventions in Afghanistan and Ukraine. Large numbers of anti-American protesters have taken to the streets, demanding his reinstatement.  Usually, Pakistani leaders can only be forcibly removed from office once they have lost some degree of popular support. If they haven’t, the choices are limited: exile abroad or judicial murder. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was executed after a 4-3 vote in the Supreme Court; Nawaz Sharif was whisked off to exile in Saudi Arabia; Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in mysterious circumstances at the start of an election campaign. But Khan? Every opinion poll shows him sweeping the country at the next general election. On 8 May, a nervous Army leadership – by no means unified – and a Sharif government fearing a political wipeout, took the decision to arrest Khan by sending in a team of Rangers while he was in the High Court dealing with an old corruption case. He was immediately dragged off to a squalid prison.  Before long, the Chief Justice ordered his release and reprimanded those who ordered the raid. But what happened on 9 May was dramatic. PTI supporters in their thousands launched frontal assault on the Army, invading cantonments in Lahore and Rawalpindi and destroying a model plane in Mianwali. The residence of the Lahore Corp Commander was firebombed. According to police, the leader of the attack was 34-year-old Khadija Shah: one of the most fashionable clothes designers in Lahore (daughter of a former Finance Minister, and granddaughter of Asif Nawaz, a former Army Chief of Staff) who has become something of an icon for the masses of women participating in the recent demonstrations.  In Mardan, an old town in Pakhtunkhwa province, there was another event that stunned the nation. At a huge public meeting demanding the immediate release of the PTI leader, a mullah took to the platform and described Khan as a ‘paighamber’ – or ‘prophet’. This was blasphemy of the highest order. Every Believer, regardless of sect, accepts the Prophet Muhammed as the final Messenger of God. Was the poor mullah overcome by emotion, or was it a deliberate provocation? We shall never know. The microphone was switched off; the anguished crowd began to chant ‘death, death, death’. The others on the platform seized the mullah and he was hacked to death. Problem solved?  Khan’s criticism of the Army and its constant interference in Pakistani politics (of which he himself took advantage not so long ago) has sparked a serious crisis. Those in uniform have been humiliated. The last taboo has been broken. Even in previously ultra-loyal areas like Panjab province, activists have been marching on the barracks. The Army has responded with mass arrests and announced that political prisoners will be tried in military courts. This draconian move is backed by much of the government, which – stupid and short-sighted as ever – has tried to expel PTI parliamentarians, a decision revoked by the Supreme Court. Sentences for dissenters are likely to be stiff: possibly a few hangings of those without elite connections in the hope of deterring future offenders.  Whatever anyone might think of him, Khan is the first political leader in the country who has publicly denounced the Army and insulted its Generals, going so far as to name the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer who allegedly organised the effort to assassinate him. How will the military respond to this unprecedented challenge? General Zia offered Bhutto exile, which he contemptuously refused, before Supreme Court judges ordered his hanging. Khan, too, may be offered exile or a military trial. The temptation to accept the former will be strong (his two sons already live in London with their mother), but a lot will depend on the advice of his current wife, Bushra Bibi, who masquerades as a spiritual leader of sufi persuasion, but is as proficient as any other politician at taking ‘gifts’ from billionaires. The most notorious of these is like a character from a Mohsin Hamid novel: Riaz Malik, a self-made man who has bribed every major politician and General in the land. This is hardly a secret, and Khan’s own dealings with him are the subject of a High Court trial, currently suspended. This involves the Qadir Trust, of which Imran and Bushra are the key trustees, and which, it is alleged, was set up with Malik’s laundered money: millions of pounds were uncovered by Britain’s National Crime Agency and returned to Pakistan. It was, some say, handed back to Malik, who provided a much larger sum, much of it earmarked for a ‘spiritual’ Sufi university in London and Allah alone knows what else. Did the entire PTI cabinet sign off on this project without being allowed to open ‘the sealed envelope’ containing the details? I honestly don’t know. (How long do we have to wait for a Netflix series?)  The function of a military court, meanwhile, would be to bar Khan from politics forever. The judges would probably refrain from executing him; not for moral reasons, but because it would risk unleashing a civil war of sorts. Khan remains popular among a layer of officers, junior and senior, which combined with his mass support means his opponents must tread carefully. At this stage, the military leadership cannot restore order by falling back on traditional sacralisations of the Army. Its legitimacy crisis runs too deep.  Throughout this century, and half of the previous one, political life in Pakistan has displayed all the characteristics of a permanently diseased organism. Commercial capitalism, foreign aid handouts, state-backed industrial monopolies, illegal import-export deals and money-laundering schemes: together, they have created a continuous crisis. Predators fight for the spoils of power and refuse to accept bureaucratic impositions such as paying tax. Every mainstream politician works hard to cultivate the art of clientelism, gathering around them a following of loyal dependents. The latter can make various offerings to those lower down the ladder, often by skimming public funds off elephantine military budgets. Percentage commissions remain hugely popular within the ruling elite.  Old-style corruption still rules the roost, but the emergence of the internet has made life a lot easier by eliminating paper transactions and allowing the rich to conceal their hidden spoils. Not that too much is hidden these days. People can see what’s going on, and have lost hope in politicians and their cronies. Khan is the exception for three reasons. He is no longer the incumbent; he is enough of a foreign policy maverick to deny the US the total subordination it demands; and he has capitalized on the country’s dire economic conditions. Pakitan is now hopelessly dependent on the IMF, experiencing non-stop inflation, and suffering from a corrupted and useless education system that weaponizes religion to prevent children from learning anything useful (the polar opposite of medieval Islam, which produced countless scholars, astronomers, mathematicians and scientists).  The PTI was complicit in all these failures, but it has the advantage of no longer being in office. At present, two of its factions are preparing for Khan’s departure from frontline politics. One is led by Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who has served in virtually every government over the last few decades and would be the safest bet for the Army; the other by Jehangir Tareen, who was once a marginally more radical figure and retains a strong middle-class power base. Whether the PTI can exist without Khan remains an open question. The Army hopes that things will revert to business-as-usual once they’ve dealt with him, and the governing parties will no doubt open their doors to defectors. It must be stressed that none of Pakistan’s political outfits, let alone its military, aims for even a modest change in social relations. They’re not in the business of creating a new society. When people take to the streets to demand one, their only response is repression.

About a week on from the vote, Move Forward has assembled a coalition of eight opposition parties -- including Thaksin's own Pheu Thai Party -- that holds 313 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1BvbGl0aWNzL1RoYWktZWxlY3Rpb24vVGhhaS1lbGVjdGlvbi1kZWZlYXQtc2hhdHRlcnMtVGhha3Npbi1zLW15dGgtb2YtaW52aW5jaWJpbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","2023-05-23T00:21:49","It’s an exquisite irony. One of the more appealing scenarios for Thailand’s generals following this month’s election is to form a coalition with the party they deposed in the 2014 military coup.  That fact alone sums up the futility of the Thai establishment’s two-decade effort to suppress wishes expressed by Thai voters at elections in 2001, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2019. Each time, populist parties backed by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra were the biggest winners thanks largely to the support of voters from Thailand’s populous rural northeast.  Because the opposition Democrat Party couldn’t win elections in this notionally two-party system, conservatives resorted to dissolving Thaksin’s parties in 2007, 2008 and 2019, or staging military coups in 2006 and 2014. They did so because Thaksin’s rapid ascent to power and electoral popularity threatened Thailand’s patrimonial power structures and the establishment’s vested interests and privileges.  Now, though — despite the benefits they gain from an undemocratic post-coup constitution adopted in 2017 — Thailand’s conservatives face a bigger threat than Thaksin ever posed. The biggest winner in this month’s election was not Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party, but newcomer Move Forward, a party contesting only its second election.  Move Forward’s agenda is radical for Thailand. It seeks wholesale democratic reform to limit the military’s role in politics, an end to military conscription, reform of the lèse-majesté law that prohibits criticism of the monarch, and changes to Thailand’s hierarchical and outmoded education system. Its leaders, including prime ministerial hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, are young, dynamic and often internationally educated, and frequently have a background in business.  Rather than just appealing to young people, Move Forward has attracted support from across different demographics in Thailand’s urban areas. It swept all but one of Bangkok’s thirty-three electorates, gaining 42 per cent of the vote there, and performed strongly in other urban centres — even including traditional Pheu Thai strongholds such as Chiang Mai in the country’s north.  For the establishment, these gains suggest troubling times indeed. The military-backed government, meanwhile, fielded two proxy parties at the election, both of which were trounced.  Yet conservatives still have live options if they wish to prevent Move Forward from taking power. The 2017 constitution allows 250 military-appointed senators to vote on the prime minister, meaning that any coalition will need a super-majority of 376 votes in the lower house to ensure their preferred candidate gets the job. So far, the Move Forward–Pheu Thai coalition has secured around 315 votes for Pita, a strong majority in any normal democracy but perhaps not enough in Thailand.  If Pita does secure sufficient support, perhaps from more independent-minded senators, he still risks being banned from politics or having his party dissolved. Thailand’s referee institutions — the Constitutional Court, Election Commission and National Anti-Corruption Commission — have a history of acting against popular politicians.  Either of these options would only be a temporary fix for the political establishment. The dissolution of Move Forward’s predecessor party in 2020 led to protracted youth-led protests on Bangkok’s streets, many of which attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators. This time, sympathy for the military is even thinner on the ground. Heavy-handed steps against Move Forward are likely to attract a significant backlash.  Perhaps more importantly, Thailand’s big businesses and corporate conglomerates wouldn’t necessarily support the military. The Thai Chamber of Commerce, for example, has already said that a transition to a younger generation of leaders isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and that political stability was important.  They are undoubtedly concerned by the state of the economy. Over nearly a decade, prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has failed to lead any meaningful economic reform. Thailand has lagged Vietnam and other neighbours in attracting investment. It hasn’t participated in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals. Long-term challenges, including an underperforming education system and an ageing society, haven’t been tackled in any meaningful way.  Move Forward’s and Pheu Thai’s leaders say they want to do things differently. Their leaders include successful figures who understand the need for Thailand to adapt to the changing global and regional economy. Pita is one of them — he is a former executive director of technology business Grab Thailand — and his predecessor as party leader was vice-president of Thailand’s largest automotive parts business. Pheu Thai’s Srettha Thavisin was a real estate mogul before entering politics.  Another area where Move Forward could quickly make a mark is the crisis in neighbouring Myanmar. Since a coup there in 2021, the country has slid ever more deeply into civil war. With close ties between the two countries’ militaries, Thailand has been reluctant to criticise the Myanmar junta or support tougher action within ASEAN. Thailand has even undermined ASEAN unity on this issue by giving the junta a platform at sub-regional diplomatic dialogues and meetings.  Move Forward has already flagged that it would approach Myanmar differently. Following the election, Pita foreshadowed a humanitarian corridor to provide assistance to the people of Myanmar. A Move Forward government also seems likely to engage with opposition groups in the country, as advocated by Indonesia and other countries in the region.  Relations with the United States would probably also improve. Although dealings have long been normalised since the 2014 coup, little love has been lost between the two notional treaty allies. The Biden administration’s framing of the world as democracies versus autocracies was always going to sit uncomfortably for a Thai government that had its roots in a military coup. By contrast, Move Forward and the Harvard-educated Pita are likely to see Washington as broadly sympathetic to their aims.  If Thailand’s establishment decides not to respect the result of this election, the future for the country will look very different. In this scenario, Pheu Thai might decide to ditch Move Forward and join forces with smaller conservative parties, but the resulting coalition would have little ideological or policy coherence. As has happened under the outgoing government, each party would seek lucrative ministries in order to dispense largesse to would-be voters.  Even if the country didn’t face international isolation for this sub-democratic outcome, the absence of impetus for domestic reform or regional leadership would make Thailand increasingly irrelevant to its international partners.  Pheu Thai itself would likely be punished by voters in future elections. (One of the reasons for its electoral underperformance in 2023 may have been the rumour that it would join forces with the military.) Support for Move Forward would grow stronger and Thai politics would become even more polarised. The risk of political conflict and violence would rise.  While the battle between Thailand’s popular and establishment forces is far from over, this election looks to be an inflection point. If the establishment can recognise the futility of its efforts to subvert democracy and allow this one to stand, Thailand may finally move a step closer to the stable democratic system its people deserve. But if they choose once again to intervene and confound the outcome, the country risks a political impasse more intractable than any it has faced before. •","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlc3Rvcnkub3JnLmF1L3RoYWlsYW5kcy13YXRlcnNoZWQtZWxlY3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2016-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T07:41:11","But what is surprising is not Erdoğan’s victory, as the Western press or the opposition in Turkey claims. After all these years, it was still Erdoğan in fact that was defining the elections as the electorate was being asked to either side with him or against him. Kılıçdaroğlu even took his election slogan from Erdoğan’s nickname for him and gladly accepted it: “(Bay Kemal) Mr. Kemal”! What is, in fact, surprising is that, yes, Erdoğan finished 5% and nearly 2.5 million votes ahead of Kılıçdaroğlu, but that Kılıçdaroğlu could still collect 44.88% of the votes!  This is a significant success for Kılıçdaroğlu, even though he has the full support of the Western world and that he has gathered five, large and small, political parties of various ideological orientations ranging from secular nationalist to religious conservative, plus, the HDP, the political arm of the PKK. The astonishing part of this success does not stem from the fact that he is an Alevi or, as the Armenian intellectual Sevan Nişanyan put it, “probably the most incompetent, defeatist and unrepresentative person in the history of politics, who ran and lost 10 [now 11] elections.”  What is surprising is that he achieved this vote share as the CHP leader in Turkey. As a matter of fact, the CHP, whose presidential candidate was considered the election favorite, received 25.35% in the parliamentary election, 10 points behind the AK Party, which still received 35% of the votes after all these years.  In Turkey, May 14, the 2023 election day, was also the anniversary of the transition from a one-party to a multiparty political life and the victory of the Democratic Party (DP), on May 14, 1950. DP leader Adnan Menderes was declared a “dictator” by the CHP just a week after the elections, just like President Erdoğan. May 14, 1950 marked the end of one-party political life in Turkey—in other words, the end of the CHP rule. The CHP has never even once been in power on its own, and on May 14, 2023, it received 25% of the votes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcG9saXRpY3N0b2RheS5vcmcvcmVjZXAtdGF5eWlwLWVyZG9nYW4tdHVya2V5LTIwMjMtZWxlY3Rpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:04:54","After one month, there’s no end in sight to the civil conflict between two rival military leaders in Sudan that has wracked its capital, Khartoum. The fight emerged from the messy politics following the 2019 social revolution and military coup that overthrew Sudan’s thirty-year dictator, Omar al-Bashir. But it’s also a new phase in a much longer set of civil conflicts that have beset the multi-ethnic country—as well as a new theater for the proxy conflicts that neighboring Arab states have pursued since the 2011 Arab Spring.  The current situation in Sudan is complex and those reporting on the conflict have a surplus of details to cover merely to describe what happened after the 2019 military coup, including the establishment of a civilian government after the revolution, its usurpation by the head of the armed forces, Gen. Abd el-Fattah Burhan, and Burhan’s rivalry with paramilitary leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (aka “Hemedti”). Briefly put, Hemedti’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are the rebranded and reorganized eastern Arab pastoralist militias known as the Janjaweed, which were responsible for many of the massacres of the civil war in Darfur two decades ago. Omar al-Bashir elevated Hemedti in the past decade as a counterbalance to other power centers in his government, in a vain effort to prevent a coup against himself. When renewed negotiations in 2022 to transition to civilian rule required Hemedti to demobilize a significant portion of his forces and subordinate himself to the regular army, Hemedti first delayed and then launched an attack against it on April 15, 2023.  Follow the Money  Jean-Baptiste Gallopin of the European Council on Foreign Relations provides more thorough detail on the financial structure of these new power blocks, shaped by the public aid and “dark money” granted—and withheld—by regional and global powers. Sudan had been on the US “state sponsor of terrorism” list since the 1990s, when al-Bashir harbored Osama bin Laden and other Islamists, preventing the World Bank and IMF from providing debt relief for the country. Even as the new civilian government struggled to stabilize the economy and fund subsidies on basic needs after 2019, the Trump administration didn’t hurry to lift this terrorism designation. Similarly, European states have pledged millions of Euros in aid but not delivered on their promises. Sudan, while stabilized, has simply not been a high priority for the global powers.  Despite their nominal alliance with the United States, this authoritarian “Arab Troika” has thus repeatedly undermined its diplomatic goals of supporting the transition to civilian government.  However, Arab regional powers, long interested in increasing influence in Sudan, have taken their opportunity to do so. The Sunni Islamist-oriented regimes of Turkey and Qatar had been al-Bashir allies. Their rivals Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE were eager to replace their influence. Egypt has strong ties to Burhan, while the UAE has become huge sponsor for Hemedti, a partnership that grew during the RSF cooperation with the UAE military in the Yemeni Civil War.  Despite their nominal alliance with the United States, this authoritarian “Arab Troika” has thus repeatedly undermined its diplomatic goals of supporting the transition to civilian government, uninterested in empowering a representative government in their neighborhood. While they have made pledges for support to Sudanese government programs, they too have not followed through, all while passing millions of dollars to their generals of choice through secret channels. The Sudanese Army and RSF have used this “dark money” to secure their control over parastatal corporations that dominate the fuel and wheat market, further reducing their dependence on the civilian government—and heightening the stakes of their rivalry.  The Tragedy of the Paramilitary Strategy  Understandably, the rise of Hemedti has led reporters to re-examine the origin of the Janjaweed in Darfur. Adam Mohammed explains that their rise has deeper roots than the conflicts of the 2000s, stemming from ecological change, and its complex interplay with war, economic policy, and nationalist ideology. The Janjaweed was composed of nomadic and semi-settled Arabic-speaking cattle and camel pastoralists, called the Baggara, in the Sahel grasslands just south of the Sahara. In the eighteenth century, they arrived in their current range, spanning modern day Chad, Libya, and Sudan, and intermarried with some of the non-Arab populations living there. Even during the intensification of agricultural settlement in Darfur in the early twentieth century, Mohammed notes that Arabic-speaking nomads and the non-Arab Fur-speaking farmers co-operated successfully.  This changed markedly during the 1970s, when a new climatic pattern of drought settled in the Sahel. This led to upheavals across northern Africa. Indeed, it was Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi that first organized Sudanese Arabs to fight against the government forces of Chad in its civil war in the 1980s. After their defeat, the flood of firearms that returned across the border with these tribes heightened violent clashes over the control of land and water between Arab pastoralists and Fur farmers in Sudan. This sparked a cycle of reprisals: Khartoum first canceled all forms of autonomous local government in Darfur, then revoked customary land ownership, reverting tribal farming claims to government ownership. When this fostered Fur cooperation in the 1990s with the ongoing rebellion in what is today South Sudan, the government began to directly fund and supply the Arab militias to fight back.  Why did the Sudanese government choose to empower these militias and stoke ethnic warfare, rather than intervening with formal state military forces? Ariel I. Ahram uses the War in Darfur as a lens to examine the paradoxical expansion of paramilitary activity in the twenty-first century. For states strapped for resources, or facing internal revolts, paramilitaries save money and can get results owing to “their decentralized command structure, ability to use and apply local knowledge of conditions, and ability to innovate faster than the bureaucracy-bound regular army.” Moreover, with stricter scrutiny of human rights abuses in the present day, states can (sometimes) deflect criticism of atrocities committed by militias they do not directly control.  And yet, the long-term impact of paramilitary activity is rarely positive for either states or the populations they hope to control. In effect, it denies what Max Weber identifies as the first principle of sovereignty—that a state holds a monopoly of legitimate violence over a specific territory. Sudan has certainly struggled to maintain its sovereignty over its vast and heterogeneous territories, conceding the secession of South Sudan by popular referendum in 2011. For decades, keeping the fighting “decentralized” meant the civil wars remained somewhat remote from the political and social elite in the Nile valley. But by empowering militias to the point they rivaled its own military, Sudan’s decades-long civil war has finally come “home” to Khartoum, with tragic consequences.  Support JSTOR Daily!

"political coup","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T02:05:00","Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of the Move Forward Party (center), at a rally in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 18 2023. Valeria Mongelli | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Thailand's preliminary election results was a triumph for the progressive Move Forward party but its reforms are set to threaten conservative forces that may move to prevent the pro-democracy party from governing. Move Forward's leader and chosen prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat has announced a six-party coalition that includes Pheu Thai, a populist, pro-democracy party that came second in the election. This gives the coalition 310 seats in parliament's 500-seat lower house. Whoever the coalition appoints as prime minister must win 376 parliamentary votes — a combined number from the 250-seat, military-appointed Senate and the lower house. The vote for PM is expected in August after the Election Commission certifies election results. Analysts say Move Forward faces a daunting task to shore up the remaining 66 vote due to its controversial proposed policies — a new constitution, ending military dominance in politics, abolishing mandatory military conscription, abolishing business monopolies and revising the lese-majeste law that punishes insults to the king with jail time.  Move Forward's agenda is an affront and a frontal challenge to the established centers of power. Thitinan Pongsudhirak professor, Chulalongkorn University  The Move Forward party recently said potential coalition partners don't need to support its stance on lese-majeste as it plans to table it in parliament independently — its refusal to compromise could also isolate prospective allies and most of the junta-led Senate. Ahead of the prime ministerial vote, political watchers anticipate a variety of outcomes, including the possibility of forced intervention by the country's powerful military-monarchy alliance. ""Move Forward's agenda is an affront and a frontal challenge to the established centers of power,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Political Science and a senior fellow at its Institute of Security and International Studies. ""It is likely a matter of when and how — not whether — they will strike back.""  Establishment-led escalation  Given Move Forward's dogmatic stance, experts expect some kind of power play that would tailor outcomes to establishment preferences. Arch-royalists could go as far as to ban Move Forward, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) warned in a report. It's a plausible scenario since royalist-conservative elites have sway over official bodies like the Constitutional Court, National Anti-Corruption Commission and Electoral Commission. Opposition party Future Forward, for instance, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court in 2020 for violating election laws in the 2019 election — a charge that Human Rights Watch called ""politically motivated.""  watch now  ""The courts could find ways to nullify enough Move Forward and Pheu Thai victories to alter the balance of power,"" echoed analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in a separate report. There's also a chance Pita himself could be targeted. He was recently charged with a constitutional violation for being a small shareholder of a now-defunct media company while serving as an member of parliament, which he denies. This could be potential grounds for his disqualification and enable the less-radical Pheu Thai to lead the coalition, according to Pongsudhirak. There is a precedent for Pita's case to be cleared, noted Napisa Waitoolkiat, a political scientist at Naresuan University.  Conservative forces have all the necessary tools at their disposal to prevent Move Forward from taking government. Susannah Patton Lowy Institute  In 2001, the Constitutional Court acquitted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra of concealing assets even after he was indicted for corruption charges, she said. ""If the elites choose to respect the votes of Thai people, they can certainly do the same this time as they did towards Thaksin in 2001."" There are other ways for the Senate to block Move Forward. Senators could abstain from voting and refuse to confirm Pita, leading to a stalemate, according to CSIS. T he Senate could also countermand lower house MPs' choice of prime minister, unless the hard-to-reach super majority of 376 votes is secured, Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute, said in a report. She pointed to statements from senators who hinted they won't automatically endorse the winning party's nominee. ""Conservative forces have all the necessary tools at their disposal to prevent Move Forward from taking government,"" Patton concluded.  A Pheu Thai betrayal  Led by the daughter of ex-prime minister Thaksin, Pheu Thai is an opposition party that is more careful about its messaging on the monarchy. Analysts say there's a chance it could break ranks with Move Forward to work with pro-military parties in order to negotiate strategic gains. ""Given Pheu Thai's desire for power, the party leadership may see Move Forward's progressive stances and its threat to the monarchy as a political liability,"" CFR stated in its report. ""If Pheu Thai abandons its pro-democracy peers in pursuit of power, the Bhumjaithai party will likely play a significant role as kingmaker in forming a coalition.""  watch now  Bhumjaithai, known for its strong support of marijuana legalization, is considered ideologically flexible as they are pro-establishment but open to working with pro-democracy outfits. There's one key reason Pheu Thai might abandon Move Forward, said Pongsudhirak — and that's to ""eke out a coalition deal that would include Thaksin's return to Thailand from exile on softened conditions related to his conviction and jail term."" Doing so, however, means long-lasting repercussions for Pheu Thai's image. ""Pheu Thai will run the risk of being punished electorally by the pro-democracy voters, who are the key supporters of Pheu Thai in the future,"" warned Waitoolkiat.  Playing the wait-and-see game  Move Forward's clear lead in preliminary election results gives it a clear mandate to lead in the eyes of the public. Any attempts to thwart that could result in widespread protests, as history shows. When the Future Forward Party was dissolved in 2020, it set off mass youth-led protests. ""If a prime minister is selected that is not a representative of a Move Forward-Pheu Thai alliance and instead is from pro-military parties and their allies and senators, expect major street protests,"" CFR said. In that scenario, there's a chance the military could stage yet another coup, CSIS added. Thailand is no stranger to coups — and has experienced at least 19 coups since 1932, according to the think tank.  watch now","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvaG93LXRoYWlsYW5kcy1taWxpdGFyeS1vbGQtZ3VhcmQtY291bGQtcmVzcG9uZC10by1lbGVjdGlvbi1yZXN1bHRzLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9ob3ctdGhhaWxhbmRzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LW9sZC1ndWFyZC1jb3VsZC1yZXNwb25kLXRvLWVsZWN0aW9uLXJlc3VsdHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2016-12-25","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-22T14:33:54","Understanding Putin’s Russia, like Russia of the Communist Commissars and the Tsars before that, has always been difficult for outsiders. The Kremlin invests substantial state resources to protect its monopoly on power, hide its intentions, and spread falsehoods. Russian citizens who have challenged the Kremlin’s narratives have been threatened, arrested, or killed.  Recently, Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza received 25 years in prison for criticizing the regime (serial killers and mass murderers in Russia receive more moderate sentences). Foreign diplomats and journalists in Moscow face oppressive surveillance, intimidation and disinformation. The arrest of Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich and the flood of false information pumped into western (and Russian) media streams make clear that the days of Potemkin villages and KGB repression are hardly things of the past.  Consequently, the West has often relied on spies and defectors to develop a basic insight into the Kremlin’s intentions. Professional intelligence services have had to uncover or steal the kind of information readily available to the public in the West.  Those Russian spies have told a consistent story to western leaders over the past century. They warned us again and again that the Kremlin is propped up by an evil state-within-a-state, and that Russia will never be a responsible member of the community of nations until its security services are destroyed. While the Soviet Union died over 40 years ago, former KGB officer Vladimir Putin has recreated the oppressive and brutal security system that jailed and killed domestic opposition, and engaged in relentless political warfare against the west. Even if Putin dies tomorrow, the KGB state endures.  Read More: Why Putin Is Right to Fear for His Life  The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) recruits spies and sources around the world, to gain access to specific programs and groups that are not accessible by academics, journalists, diplomats or collection by technical means. The motivations of those who cooperate secretly with the CIA are as varied as there are people. Sources may seek adventure, money, help for their families, revenge against their bosses or the ego gratification that comes with assisting a superpower.  In Russia it is different. The motivation and messages from Russian sources over the years have shown an uncanny similarity and consistency not found in other groups. That is, secret Russian sources almost always make the choice to help the west after concluding that their system is evil and must be destroyed. They usually express love for their culture and homeland, but are committed to smashing the leadership and secret security services that underpin their corrupt, murderous, and oppressive system. From my experience over decades working in the CIA, Russians tend to be the among the most committed sources. They are often their country’s best and brightest who eventually conclude that there is no hope in changing an evil system from the inside.  In recent months, Gleb Karakulov fled while on a business trip in Kazakhstan. Karakulov was a Captain in the Kremlin’s Federal Protection Service. His unit was responsible for protecting and setting up secure communications for Putin wherever he went. He traveled with Putin on over 180 trips abroad. During a recent interview, Karakulov commented that, “Our President has become a war criminal.” He described Putin as isolated and paranoid. He reported that Putin doesn’t use a mobile phone or the internet, insists that those who will be in the same room submit to a two-week quarantine, and avoids airplanes, usually traveling on an armored train. According to Karakulov, “All the information he receives is only from people close to him. That is, he lives in a kind of information vacuum…He is pathologically afraid for his life. He has surrounded himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantine and a lack of any information from the internet.”  In some ways Karakulov’s decision to flee is similar to that of Boris Bajanov, the first defector to come to the West after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Bajanov was Stalin’s personal secretary and in the Soviet Politburo until 1928 when he fled to British India. Bajanov reported that the Kremlin viewed the British Empire as the Soviet Union’s “main enemy.” He noted that propaganda and agitation were the Kremlin’s main weapons as part of a strategy to weaken Britain from within so that if war came it would be easier to win. Soviet cultural and diplomatic institutions were centers for propaganda, espionage, assassination and means to foment industrial and political unrest. According to Bajanov, their goal was to hoodwink western intellectuals by “throwing dust in the eyes of educated persons in the West.” He warned that the Soviet Union was a terrorist regime that suppressed domestic dissent and spread foreign disinformation because it could not survive if the world knew the truth.  In the decades to come, defector after defector has arrived in the West with the same message. The Kremlin had created a ruthless police state capable of mass surveillance, empowered to destroy perceived domestic threats, and intent on relentless attack on foreign foes.  In the early 1960s Soviet military colonel Oleg Penkovsky spied for the U.S. and Britain, providing the intelligence that allowed President Kennedy to navigate the Cuban missile crisis. Penkovsky was so motivated to destroy the Soviet system that he even offered to plant a nuclear device near to the Kremlin in central Moscow.  In 1980, senior KGB officer Victor Sheymov defected to the U.S. Among much else, Sheymov passed intelligence on KGB plans to kill the Pope, details of the KGB assassination of the Afghan President, and the massive technical penetration of the American Embassy in Moscow which forced the US government to spend billions to tear down and build a new, secure diplomatic facility. Sheymov was a brilliant analyst and became a successful U.S. businessman. While inside the KGB with access to secret files, Sheymov studied the Soviet system and concluded that the problem was much more than corruption of the leadership. “The evil in the system was fundamental, inherent in its nature.” Of his own institution he commented, the KGB “is supposed to defend the Soviet people, but it doesn’t. It works against them and the whole world.” He and his family risked capture and death in an effort to inflict as much damage on the system as possible.  The head of the KGB mission in New York City Sergei Tretyakov defected with his wife and daughter to the U.S. in 2000. He passed on details of Soviet infiltration of the United Nations and its diplomats. He was a bigger-than-life figure who appeared destined for the top rungs of the Russian intelligence services. Tretyakov was initially optimistic that the changes that led to the fall of the Soviet Union would lead to a new, democratic, and powerful Russia. However, Tretyakov quickly lost hope. “I saw firsthand what kind of people were and are running the country. I came to the ultimate conclusion that it became immoral to serve them…Russia has been repeatedly raped and looted by its leadership. I call this process genocide of the Russian people performed by a group of immoral criminals…I realized that the intelligence information I delivered was only used to contribute to the totally corrupt political system that didn’t show any signs of improvement.”  In democracies, security services exist to protect their citizens; while in Russia their sole purpose is to keep the regime in power. Countries that spring from revolutionary roots often create a powerful system of regime security rather than national security. Their rule is illegitimate and they need a powerful force to destroy any internal opposition. They are about protecting the leadership at all costs. Costs to the country be damned.  Indeed, the Soviet founding fathers were terrorists who were in and out of Tsarist prisons. Even today we know them by their underground revolutionary names – Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky. They knew when they took over the massive Russian landmass via a political coup, they needed to arrest or kill all potential opponents. Lenin’s first act was to create a powerful personal security service (the Cheka), calling for “merciless mass terror” and immediately ordering the arrest of opposition parties. The leader of the Cheka stated publicly, “We stand for organized terror…this should be frankly admitted. The Cheka is obliged to defend the revolution and conquer the enemy even if its sword does by chance sometimes fall upon the heads of the innocent.”  The Russian security services became an unaccountable state within a state. They killed and jailed tens of millions over the past century, and due to former KGB officer Vladimir Putin’s system of rule, are still alive and well today. The Kremlin engages in war, lies, and murder. We in the West experience it in a relentless form of political warfare of subversion, sabotage, agitation, disinformation, and even assassination. Russian citizens are unable to engage in politics and are under constant threat of being imprisoned or killed as a traitor for even mild criticism.  Western leaders and diplomats have long tried to find a means to work with the Kremlin in hopes of evolving the system. The Ukraine war has finally convinced many that Putin will never change. If we had listened to those hundreds of brave Russians defectors who came to us over the years with powerful warnings, we would have known long before 2022 that reforming Putin’s rotten system is a fool’s errand. Russia will never be a trustworthy member of the family of nations as long as the Russian security services maintain their power over the people.

"political coup","2014-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:15:22","Thailand’s progressive Move Forward Party has signed a coalition agreement with seven other parties, promising to draft a new constitution, end monopolies and allow same-sex marriage if they are allowed to form a government, but the deal made no mention of a controversial proposal to revise royal insult laws.  The 23-point agreement, unveiled on Monday, outlined the coalition’s policy plans and priorities as it seeks support among legislators to form a government after nine years of conservative, military-backed rule.  Move Forward, along with Pheu Thai, a populist party linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, dominated last week’s election in a resounding rejection of the royalist military-backed parties that have controlled the country since a coup in 2014.  “This is another historic moment that shows we can transform the government to democracy peacefully,” said Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat, who is seeking to become Thailand’s next prime minister. “The purpose of this Memorandum Of Understanding is to collect the agenda that all parties agree and are ready to push in government and parliament.”  The signing took place on the ninth anniversary of the military coup that brought army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha to power.  Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May 14 election, emerging with the most parliament seats with the help of young voters excited by an agenda that puts the party at odds with some conservative business interests and institutions, including a plan to amend a lese-majeste law that punishes perceived insults of the monarchy with up to 15 years in jail. Critics of the law say Prayuth’s government has used it to stifle dissent.  But Move Forward’s alliance members have expressed reservations, and Monday’s agreement did not include a proposal to reform that law.      It instead affirmed the country’s “status as a democracy under a constitutional monarchy framework, and the inviolable status of the monarch”.  Pita said on Monday he did not think his party’s independent attempt to push reform of lese-majeste laws will put off the upper house, whose backing the coalition needs to appoint a prime minister and form a government.  The eight-party coalition controls 313 seats in the lower house, a strong majority, but that is not enough to assure it can take power. Under the military-drafted constitution, the prime minister is selected by a joint vote of the lower house and the Senate, whose 250 members were appointed by the post-coup military government. That means the winning candidate needs at least 376 votes.  Several senators have said they will not vote for Pita because of the lese-majeste issue.  Pita said he has a team to explain how Move Forward plans to amend the law “so it cannot be used as a political tool” and “this will ease the concern of senators”.  The coalition’s agreement includes most of Move Forward’s flagship policies, such as drafting a new, more democratic constitution, passing a same-sex marriage law, decentralising administrative power, and transitioning from military conscription to voluntary enlistment “except when the country is at war”.  It calls for reforms of the police, military, civil service and the justice process, abolition of business monopolies, notably in brewing and other alcohol production, and the restoration of controls on the production and sale of marijuana after Thailand’s poorly executed de facto decriminalisation last year.  It also seeks reform of welfare and education, as well as a balanced foreign policy that revives Thailand’s role as a leader in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  It states that “all parties have the right to advocate for additional policies as long as they do not contradict the policies outlined in this agreement”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjMvdGhhaWxhbmRzLW1vdmUtZm9yd2FyZC1wYXJ0eS1hbGxpZXMtYWdyZWUtb24tY29hbGl0aW9uLXBsYXRmb3Jt0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjMvdGhhaWxhbmRzLW1vdmUtZm9yd2FyZC1wYXJ0eS1hbGxpZXMtYWdyZWUtb24tY29hbGl0aW9uLXBsYXRmb3Jt?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And while most people would agree that SIA staff deserve it and some have even praised the company as its senior management will not be among those receiving the bonus, some have joked online that the record profits could have come because of high ticket prices and “lousy food,” as there have been a number of posts that went viral pointing out that SIA food has decreased in quality.  One Reddit user called his breakfast on a flight from Singapore to Melbourne “Pathetic siol.”  On Thursday (May 18), the NUS – No Use Singapore Facebook page put up the following meme.  It has since gone viral, getting thousands of reactions as well as hundreds of shares and comments, and has also been shared across other platforms such as Reddit.  Earlier this week, the SIA Group said that strong demand was the driving factor behind record revenue, operating profit, and passenger load factor for the company. For the most recent fiscal year, its profits were $2.2 billion, a reversal from the net loss of $962 million the company suffered the year before.  SIA Group also reaffirmed its “commitment to best-in-class products and services, and continued investment in strategic initiatives”, that would position SIA Group “for future opportunities.”  Shortly after this announcement, Business Times reported the upcoming bonus for SIA staff, saying that those who are eligible will be receiving a profit-sharing bonus equal to 6.65 months’ salary plus a maximum of 1.5 months’ salary of ex-gratia bonus.  The second bonus will be given out in recognition of SIA staff’s hard work and sacrifices during the Covid-19 pandemic.

"political coup","2014-02-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T16:02:00","NINE years ago in Odessa, Ukrainian neo-Nazis burned 42 people alive in the House of Trade Unions and killed six more in the street. I thought the whole world would be horrified by this event, condemning it, calling the organizers and the Kiev authorities to account. Yet the world remained silent, and only Russia appreciated the horror of what had happened. So far, no one has answered for this crime.  But why did it happen? In late February, Elon Musk wrote on his page on Twitter that in 2014 there was undoubtedly a coup d’état and a violent change of power in Ukraine.  After the Maidan in Ukraine in 2014, forces promoting the ideology of neo-Nazism came to power. Now, the Kyiv regime promotes neo-Nazism. Nationalist sentiments among people are cultivated in Ukraine through state policy and efforts by authorities of all levels to whitewash and glorify Nazism.  Ukrainian officials express support for Nazis openly and frequently. Some examples: In September 2018, former Verkhovnaya Rada Speaker Andrey Paruby said on air in an ICTV show that “the greatest man who practiced direct democracy was Adolf Hitler.” On March 17, 2022, head of the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service Sergey Deineko called for killing Russian women and children in a Facebook post, which was later deleted.  On January 1 of each year, Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities host torch marches honoring the birthday of the Nazi henchman Stepan Bandera. Nationalist slogans are shouted and a show of Nazi symbols accompany the marches. Since 2019, Bandera’s birthday is celebrated as an official holiday. Supported by the authorities and with no accountability, the radical far-right forces use methods of violence and intimidation against their political opponents, activists, human rights advocates and journalists, putting pressure on government agencies to adopt decisions that suit their purposes. Neo-Nazi groups are openly active in Ukraine, the most famous being the Right Sector and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The radicals act with impunity. The open aggressiveness of these forces, combined with the negligence and sometimes connivance of law enforcers, is creating a dangerous situation in which marginal groups intimidate the rational majority.  Despite these, Western media have kept mostly silent about the role of neo- and classical Nazi groups in the Maidan and the war in Eastern Ukraine, choosing to airbrush them out of the narrative about “Russian aggression” they have created.  Still, the truth still comes out. After visiting Kyiv in May 2021, a group of French senators said the activities of neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine were a cause for concern. Attending a fair in central Kyiv during the Kyiv Day celebrations, they said they came across members of the Azov Battalion who taught children to assemble guns, a stand where volunteers were enlisted for a war in Donbass, and a shooting range where the far-right invited young people to shoot at a paper image of the Kremlin. In November 2020, the NGO Centre for Countering Digital Hate published a report naming Ukraine among the main promoters of the neo-Nazi ideology.  For the most part, neo-Nazi crimes are at best hushed up. In light of Russia’s special military operation, the Western media and NGOs are clearly ramping up their efforts to whitewash Ukrainian neo-Nazis whom they cast as fighters for freedom and independence in a “democratic” country struggling against the “aggression of a dictatorial regime.” The American IT companies provide tangible assistance to Kyiv. YouTube administrators and moderators do not object to dissemination of information by extremist organizations, primarily the Right Sector and Azov.  Nazism is also being promoted on UN platforms. Thus, the United States and Western countries ignore the resolution on combating the glorification of Nazism, thereby supporting the neo-Nazi regime of Ukraine. The countries of the former Hitler coalition set out to revise the causes and results of World War II, which contradicts the UN Charter. I hope the world community gives its negative assessment of the actions of these countries, especially Japan and Germany, which seek to obtain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council in the case of reform of the organization, and Article 107 of the UN Charter will be the basis for rejection of these plans.  And the real facts they try to hide and quickly forget. A report drafted by Amnesty International, which acknowledged that war crimes were committed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine against civilians, in particular, the use of civilians as “human shields” highlights the collective West’s efforts to whitewash Kyiev’s crimes. In fact, Amnesty has revealed Kyiv’s true nature and its terrorist tactics. But this report, after numerous threats to its authors by the Nazis, was discredited.  In other words, Ukraine, enjoying the silent encouragement of the collective West, ignores the concern of the international community and continues to promote neo-Nazi ideology.  Returning to the events of September 2, 2014 in Odessa: if the international community had condemned this heinous crime, perhaps there would not have been a conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Nazis continue to march with torches and poison Ukraine with their ideology of racial and national hatred.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvY291bGQtdGhlLWNvbmZsaWN0LWluLXVrcmFpbmUtaGF2ZS1iZWVuLXByZXZlbnRlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Badung Regency receives the most amount of tourism interest and is home to leading resort destinations like Canggu, Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Kuta, Legian, and Seminyak.  The three tourism villages up for the national award each offer something memorable, unique, and (to use Minister Uno’s words) Instragrammable about them.  Each is easily accessible from Bali’s bigger and more well-known destinations and makes for fantastic day trips for holidaymakers of every travel style.  Speaking from Serangan Village, Indonesia’s Minster for Tourism and Creative Economies, Sandiaga Uno shared his affection for the coastal retreat. He described the tourism experiences on offer at Serangan as ‘world-class.’  He added, “What is very, very memorable and Instagramable as well as being fantastic is the procession of releasing the [turtle] hatchlings. And this is a symbol of sustainable development.”  Top 5 Travel Insurance Plans For 2023 Starting At $10 Per Week  For beach lovers, Serangan Village offers everything tourists could wish for; a pristine stretch of coastline, quaint resorts, and plenty of coves and shallow shorelines to explore.

Serangan Village is just a quick 20-minute drive from I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport and an equally quick drive from central Kuta and chilled-out Sanur.  Whether you’re a returning traveler to Bali looking for somewhere new to explore or a first-time visitor seeking a beach getaway close to all the action (but free from the hustle), Seragan Village is a great shout.  The next unique destination to be shortlisted for the Indonesian Tourism Village Awards is Manistutu Tourism Village in Jembrana Regency.  West Bali is about to undergo a huge tourism redevelopment, and Manistutu is setting the standard high for where the region is heading in terms of tourism experience.  Speaking to reporters, the Regent of Jembrana shared his love of Manistutu Village and his hopes for how the attention the awards brings will help introduce the area to more tourists.  He said, “Tourist villages in Jembrana definitely have selling points for tourists. Tourist visits also mean an increase in the community’s economy.”  He continued, “With all of our hard work, I hope Manistutu can win the Indonesian Tourism Village Award.”  Local tour guide Ketut Master told reporters that nature lovers will adore what Manistutu has to offer.  Master said, “We invite visits to plant trees and other nature-loving activities.”  Tourism Villages is the term used for both small and newly established tourism experiences across Indonesia, but it is not exclusively grassroots efforts.  Tourism villages is a term also used to describe bigger resorts, like Kuta Village and Legian Village, both of which are Bali’s major hotspots.  Kendra Tourism Village in Gianyar Regency sits just north of central Ubud and is already a popular destination with international and domestic tourists alike.  For many visitors, Kenderan Tourism Village is already considered an extension of Ubud itself.  Home to some of the finest jungle resort hotels in Bali and a stunning jungle landscape that is just waiting to be explored, Kenderan Tourism Village is a serious contender for the Indonesian Village Tourism Awards 2023.  Whatever the result, the huge amount of attention that these three unique destinations will get as the competition rolls on will mean that the crowds are already on their way.  If you want to be amongst the pioneer tourists to discover these hidden gems, get yourself to Bali soon!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbXlkcm9sbC5jb20vdGhlc2UtdGhyZWUtc3VwZXItdW5pcXVlLWRlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy1pbi1iYWxpLW5hbWVkLWFtb25nc3QtdGhlLWJlc3QtaW4tYWxsLW9mLWluZG9uZXNpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2018-09-20","15:00:00","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:54:51","That was the message from the President of the UN General Assembly, Csaba Kőrösi, on an official visit to Salt Lake City in Utah, where he met with top state officials, students and academics, and local community members.  “There are commonalities because the entire world is in a water crisis, which is ignited by climate change and changing our water cycle,” Mr. Kőrösi said in a meeting with Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson.  Climate migrants  “I don’t want to scare anyone, but unless we solve the water management crisis, in the coming 60 to 70 years, hundreds of millions of people will have to move,” he added.  The senior UN official urged support for a global water information system, created as part of the UN system. A new study published in Science magazine on Thursday showed that climate change was a key factor in the shrinkage of more than half the world’s lakes and reservoirs since the 1990s.  This is one of the nine gamechangers agreed to at the UN Water Conference held in New York in March, which also includes:  Integrating water and climate policy at national and global levels  An early warning-for-all system  Decoupling agriculture, energy production and water  Valuing water accurately  A global water education network  Support for transboundary cooperation  Creating a unified water architecture managed by a Special Envoy with an independent scientific advisory panel  A follow-up to the UN Water Conference.  Colorado River and Great Salt Lake  The President made the ask after meeting with water experts from the Utah Department of Natural Resources. He was informed that Utah is now in its 23rd year of drought because of climate change, with significant consequences for the Colorado River and Great Salt Lake; the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere.  And while higher air temperatures have brought with it more precipitation, the heat also means there is more evaporation, and more runoff, as parched land is simply unable to absorb the water.  Historic floods  Drought-stricken Utah is currently facing flooding after an historic amount of rain and snow during early spring.  Complicating matters further is that the management of the Colorado River system is firmly anchored in the Colorado River Compact of 1922, giving rights to two countries and seven states, and stipulating water levels that – due to climate change and overuse – are no longer possible.  Local officials said that they are focused on “balanced solutions that are long-term,” with discussions touching on agriculture use, water treatment and reuse, and promotion of water conservation through legislative and public information means.  Sustainable development peaks  While in Utah, Mr. Kőrösi also focused on sustainable development on mountains, which is a topic highlighted in a 2022 Secretary-General report on that topic and the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development.  One of the challenges highlighted by representatives from rural communities was the lack of social development and inclusion, heightened by shutdowns and cut-offs enforced during the COVID pandemic.  “Everyone needs to be considered in policies,” said Alitha Thompson, a 36-year-old non-traditional student at Utah Valley University, who lives in a rural community of Gunnison Valley, about 1.5 hours outside the University.  “Just because you’re different doesn’t make you wrong. Everyone’s voice needs to be heard,” said Ms. Thompson, who because she didn’t have daycare that day, brought the youngest of her five children to the meeting with the President.  She said that about one-third of Utah’s population lives in mountain areas; some of the communities suffer levels of poverty more commonly experienced in developing countries.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbXlkcm9sbC5jb20vYWR2b2NhdGluZy1mb3Itc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtd2F0ZXItZ2FtZWNoYW5nZXJzLWtvcm9zaS1nb2VzLXdlc3QtZ2xvYmFsLWlzc3Vlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2019-07-29","Not Discerned","{""Abuja"", ""AbujaFederalCapitalTerritory"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-21T14:17:02","By Ehi Braimah    With food inflation at over 22 percent and national debt of about N78 trillion, the topic of discussion everywhere you go is the Nigerian economy. How are we going to survive as individuals and as a country? What will the incoming administration do differently and what needs to change? How will the economy bounce back? How can we create wealth for all Nigerians?    Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the president-elect, is gifted as a thinker, talent management expert, master strategistand problem-solver but there are no easy answers to questions on the economy with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting GDP growth rate of 3.2 percent this year and 3.0 percent next year.    The average GDP growth rate between 2015 and 2022 was only 1.35 percent and it was during this period that we also suffered two economic recessions. The first recession in 2016 was due to the sudden slump in the price of oil in the international market and low production levels at home due to the activities of non-oil actors. The second recession in 2020 was caused by the devastating impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy.    But we have also made poor economic choices. For example, why did we not remove fuel subsidy when it was no longer sustainable? Lack of FDIs and oil theft are putting pressures on our local currency, yet we pretend not to know where the shoe pinches us.    With the official exchange rate at N465, dollar scarcity will continue and you would be lucky to buy dollars at N800 in the parallel market.    When Patience Oniha, Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO), spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recently, she did not tell us anything new. She also did notpropose any solution.    Onihasaid that the rising debt was caused by budget deficits and low revenue.Most of these deficits, she repeated probably for the umpteenth time, were funded through local and external borrowing, resulting in the rapid growth of our debt stock and increases in debt service.    There is nothing wrong in borrowing when you have the capacity to pay back. But when we use 96.3 percent of our revenue to service our debt, according to the World Bank, then we have a problem.Nothing will be left for recurrent expenditure and investment. The solution is to continue to borrow. In 2021, our debt service to revenue ratio was 83.2 percent.    We now borrow to pay salaries!    According to Oniha, deficits in the annual budgets, including supplementary budgets, rose to N10.78 trillion in 2023 from N1.62 trillion in 2015. Between 82 percent and 99 percent of these deficits were funded by new borrowing which ranged from N1.46 trillion in 2015 to N8.80 trillion in 2023.    It is evident that our economy is in bad shape but what is Angola’s magic wand? The second largest oil producer in Africa – behind Nigeria – also has its own problems. According to a World Bank report, Angola’s economic fortunes have been tied to global oil demand – just like Nigeria.    With a population of less than 34 million but also rapidly growing like ours, inequality and poverty levels are high. Urban and youth unemployment, says the report, exceed 38 percent and 50 percent respectively.    However, reforms over the last five years have improved macroeconomic management and public sector governance. With higher oil prices, their currency (Kwanza)– which is being rated as the best performing currency against the dollar in Africa – appreciated by 26.2 percent in 2022. The current account surplus stood at about 11 percent of GDP driven by high growth demand in oil exports (51 percent year-on-year).    Angola’s international reserves stood at $14.5 billion at the end of 2022, or about six months of imports. Inflation has also fallen rapidly, allowing the Central Bank to moderately loosen monetary policy. The year-over-year rate fell from 27 percent in December 2021 to 13.9 percent in December 2022 – the lowest rate since 2015.    What is their growth strategy?    Angola has what it calls Country Partnership Framework (CPF) planned for FY23-28 – for the next five years – which concentrates on the promotion of more inclusive development consisting of two strategic pillars that revolve around building human and institutional capacity.    The first pillar focuses on strengthening the non-oil economy through national economic diversification by revitalising rural economies to create greater competitiveness and employment.    The second pillar is designed to enhance the quality of service delivery and instituting a strong social protection programme to improve the quality of life of the population and equip individuals to take a greater role in the development of the country.    It must be noted that we have never had a shortage of ideas or policy directions. Our biggest challenge has always been poor implementation and the lack of political will to act on the right decisions. The two growth pillars of the Angolan economy are contained in our ERGP (economic recovery and growth plan) – a medium all-round development initiative that was designed to restore economic growth and build a globally competitive economy.    Speaking at the Governors’ Forum in Abuja recently, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of The World Trade Organisation (WTO), said we have “challenges on the fiscal, debt and monetary policy fronts.” Nigeria’s gross debt level, she told the governors, climbed from N19.3 trillion in 2015 to N91.6 trillion in 2023.    Isn’t that a frightening jump? The debt-to-GDP ratio has almost doubled within the same period from 20 percent to 39 percent. These are sobering statistics under the Buhari administration that embarked on a borrowing spree.    Although global growth slowed down largely due to Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, what Dr Okonjo-Iweala said in plain language was that we have been suffering from fiscal indiscipline and on top of that, we do not borrow wisely.    “In this gloomy and global context,” she said, “Nigeria has to work much harder to avoid falling even further behind.” With food insecurity and youth unemployment becoming an albatross, over 130 million Nigerians have been pushed below the poverty line.    But there has to be a silver lining in the dark and ominous clouds to give us renewed hope. It was against this backdrop that foremost economist, Dr Ayo Teriba, shared useful insights and broad perspectives on our economic challenges and possible solutions.    Teriba was a guest speaker at the District Conference of Rotary International District 9110 which held at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta on May 13.    During his presentation, Teriba quoted Thomas Monson (1927 – 2018), the American religious leader and author. “When you can’t control the winds,” Monson noted,“adjust your sails.”However, Dolly Parton, Bertha Calloway, Jimmy Dean and several others have also been credited with the same quote.    We are being told that there are still opportunitiesdespite the economic challenges confronting us. If we ignore these opportunities, we would have ourselves to blame. Even when we cannot control or direct the winds, at some point, maybe through divine intervention, the winds could become favourable.    At that moment, what do you do? Adjust your sails in the direction of the favourable wind. Teriba said we are at that pointand we must act thoughtfully. He explained that falling revenues, rising debts, multiple exchange rates, galloping inflation and dwindling reserves are the flash points but we can still navigate our way out of the stormy weather.    Having made similar PowerPoint presentations countless number of times in the past to organisations, governments, bilateral and multi-lateral agencies, Teriba was on familiar grounds.    In making his recommendations, he x-rayed the global economic context and explained what the national and subnational governments as well as the private sector can doto unlock the opportunities that are available in the next four years – a period where hard decisions must be made by the incoming administration for the economy to bounce back.    The private sector is already creating wealth for the economy. Whereas the federal government can optimise our economic potential better, attention must be paid more tostate governments because, ultimately, they have the primary responsibility to grow our national wealth through their economic activities.    According to Teriba, Balance sheets will continue to be bigger sources of wealth than income statements. What does this mean? In its simplest from as we were taught in Economics, your balance sheet has assets and liabilities.    He cited China as a good example to buttress his point. We should also begin to focus on growing the balance sheet size of Nigeria because that’s where the action is.    Assets and equity investment inflows into them will put money in our pockets while debt liabilities will take money away from us, especially when such debts are IOUs or promissory notes issued in anticipation of future income.    Equity inflows unlock idle assets, especially foreign direct investment, while debt issues encroach on revenue, especially IOUs issued against income without links to assets.    What is the point of having an asset that wastes away without even knowing its value? Assets appreciate in value and they provide future economic benefits. Think of your landed property but get the experts to give you the economic value and see how it appreciates over time.    Other examples include cash, account receivables, marketable securities, distribution rights, trademarks and so on.    Dubai used the power of destination marketing to brand the city that literally grew out of a desert as one of the best tourist locations in the world. Dubai is the most popular emirate in UAE and it attracts visitors in droves, creating significant commercial value.    The city has eye-popping architecture, man-made islands, giant shopping malls and some of the best entertainment venues in the world.    Marrakech in Morocco has also been branded as a tourist destination. Our states and cities can do the same by promoting specific locations and their benefits.    “The outlook of the global asset prices over the next half decade remains mixed,” Teriba told his attentive audience for proper context in order to get a sense of what’s happening globally.    “The IMF projects in its economic outlook online database that commodity prices that are currently elevated by geo-political tensions will fall steadily back to 2021 levels from 2023 to 2027, while equity prices are widely expected to continue the strongly upward trajectory they have been following since 2018 through 2027.    “The outlook of global exports and FDI stocks will similarly remain mixedover the next half decade. Exports could rise up to 50 percent from US$22.4 trillion in 2020 to US$33.1 trillion by 2027, while FDI stocks could continue their stellar growth trajectory to surge nearly two-fold from US$41 trillion in 2020 to US$79 trillion by 2027.    “While both export flows and equity stocks are expected to expand, they will do so at different speeds; the gains in equity stocks on the global balance sheet would still be thrice the size of the gains of the export flows on the global income statement, with positive overall consequences for global economic growth.”    The global economic outlook suggests that exports will grow but FDI stocks will perform better as they will double in size by 2027. Smart investors will always put their money where their mouth is. Why are we unable to attract FDIs? Isn’t that better than collecting IOUs?    We complain of having a revenue challenge but how do we justify our rising debt profile?If we didn’t take IOUs from China, for example, our debt stock would have reduced. Instead of borrowing cash from China, why didn’t we consider the option of asset-linked debt as Teriba explained?    He said we should rely more on equity investments and FDIs rather than any type of debt.It is better to borrow against assets instead of income that may never come. Issuing IOUs or promissory notes is taking the path of least resistance.    The value of an asset will eventually go up and have a knock-on effect on the money you have borrowed. When we tie our debts to assets, such investments can be converted into equity or we can even issue equity outright at the onset of the transaction.    Teriba also said we pay too much attention to GDP while ignoring what our national assets can do to revive the economy. How do we get Nigeria to be liquid again? We can sell some of our national assets that are idle. India and Brazil are receiving close to $100 billion annual inflows of foreign direct investment into local assets in a bid to unlock liquidity from, or financialise, under-utilised assets.    When we entered the mobile telephone business in 2001, we auctioned licenses and raked in significant revenue while the mobile networks invested in the infrastructure required locally. After more than 20 years, MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9mobile are still in business and growing strong, paying taxes every year. Nigeria remains their biggest market in Africa.    We can also borrow a leaf from Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer. The company is owned by the Saudi Arabian governmentand it is the world’s most profitable company – richer than tech giants such as Apple and Google.    In 2022, Saudi Aramco made a profit of $161.1 billion, more than Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Tesla combined. Why can’t NNPC Limited use the same business model? Oil revenue will not last forever; so, oil producing countries are thinking of investment in the non-oil sector.    Amid high oil prices, Saudi Arabia transferred nearly $80 billion of Aramco shares into a Wealth Fund with more than $620 billion in assets to plan for the rainy day and expand investment opportunities. It would be the second of such transfers.    It appears we forget that Facebook is the biggest media company in the world but it produces no content. Facebook’s gross annual revenues are over $80 billion annually.    What of Air BnB and Uber? They neither own properties nor vehicles but they are minting raw cash providing accommodation and taxi services around the world. It is called innovation which can also grow the size of our balance sheet if we think outside the box.    For state governments that are struggling financially and cannot pay salaries and pensions, they can borrow this business model instead of rushing to Abuja every month begging for handouts. More importantly, Dr Okonjo-Iweala advised them to build trust with their people.    The United Arab Emirates (UAE), just like the Western region of old, is a good example of how states can unlock their potential in real estate investment. It explains why Lagos State, the economic and financial hub of Nigeria, thrives and is currently ranked as the fifth largest economy in Africa.    Lagos State with a GDP of over N45 trillion has a massive retail market that encourages manufacturing sector activities. According to the World Economic Forum, about 24 million people live in Lagos, and close to 2,000 people from across Nigeria arrive in Lagos every day in search of economic opportunities.    As the value of the real estate market goes up, investors also reap phenomenal profits.    Lagos has its own hail-a-cab service – similar to Uber and Bolt. It is called Lagride. Other states can do the same thing because it is no rocket science. If economic migrants travel to places such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Kano or Abuja, it is for their survival.    Every state in Nigeria can invest in real estate, create and leverage premium skills, brand products and services and regularly upgrade the value chain of those brands to attract investment. Delta is thinking in that direction by positioning the state as the destination for national sports events and the preferred Nollywood locationfor shooting movies in Nigeria.    Akwa Ibom State also plays host to most Super Eagles matches in Uyo using the ultra-modern Nest of Champions stadium which is also a form of destination branding. Imagine for a moment the impact on the value chain of the local economy: airline and taxi cab operators, hotels, restaurants and bars, merchandising and so on.    If you bought the stocks of a company and the share price doubles down the road, it means you have earned twice the value of your investment. This is a good example of how to make your money work for you without lifting a finger. State governments should also have this type of creative and investment mindset.    State governments can generate rental income per square metre from assets that they host such as city centres,rail and bus stations, airports, cinemas, stadiums, as well as entertainment, tourist and event centres, shopping malls, etc.    Yaba in Lagos has been branded as our own “Silicon Valley.” With the growth of the Fintech industry, states have incredible opportunities to build ICT hubs and tech-ecosystems with our vibrant youth population.    In the agro-allied sector, food brands can be created and exported by working with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC). Lagos and Kebbi states once worked together to produce LAKE rice – a remarkable partnership indeed.    In Cross River state, the Calabar Carnival was another excellent example of destination marketing and city branding. The fiesta held every December. Whatever happened to the beautiful idea where all the hotels and even private homes were fully booked for one month?

"political coup","2018-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T08:27:48","Uniparty propagandist and Deep State shill Bill Barr is waddling from one television studio to the next to tell audiences that the feds will almost certainly indict Donald Trump by late summer for mishandling classified documents. The Cheka FBI has been outed as a criminal enterprise engaged in subverting elections and spying on the American people, but sure, let's get all worked up about whether the president of the United States — in whom the Constitution's Article II executive powers are vested — has somehow inexplicably infringed his own declassification authority. Although Augustus Gloop Barr can barely conceal his joy, this tiring new chapter in the never-ending ""get Trump"" saga comes off as yet another manifestation of Bizarro World, in which a group of criminals running the American government get to pretend that nobody is ""above the law.""  Walrus Barr enjoys playing the ""scolding father"" who ""knows best"" in a worn-out daddy routine alongside scripted corporate news hosts performing for the cameras. Although he remains a consummate Deep State stooge who will do anything to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the Oval Office, he also spends a great deal of TV time burnishing his ""I'm the only adult in the room"" bona fides. He has called out New York State's vindictive lawsuits against President Trump as a ""political hit job"" and ""gross overreach."" He has excoriated Democrat district attorney of New York Alvin Bragg's Trump indictment as an ""abomination"" that ""makes us look like a banana republic."" He acknowledges that the Durham probe proves that ""Russiagate"" has not only been a ""grave injustice"" to Trump, but has also ""vindicated"" the president's accurate denunciation of the Clinton-Obama Russia Hoax conspiracy as a ""witch hunt"" from the very beginning. Barr readily admits, in other words, that state and federal prosecutors have shamelessly pursued Trump for recklessly and maliciously partisan reasons that have threatened both the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power in the United States.  After broadly recognizing the seriousness of the Deep State's crimes and the depth of its depravity, though, loyal palace guard Barr then sweeps these horrific State crimes to the side, shakes his head in disgust, and instead blames his former boss for being ""his own worst enemy."" Right. How dare the guy who has been doggedly persecuted for seven years fight back against Intelligence Community villainy? How dare the same guy who has been framed by agents of the Stasi FBI and DOJ now distrust those corrupted agencies? How dare Donald Trump call out the new batch of criminal investigations as part and parcel of the longstanding political ""witch hunt"" against him when Barr begrudgingly concedes that the ""witch hunt"" is real?  The more Barr excuses or ignores the long list of government criminals who have suffered no repercussions for betraying their offices, the more he looks like a willing co-conspirator. The more Barr chooses to look past the most grievous crimes committed against a duly elected president while sensationalizing Trump's supposed document infractions, the more ludicrously corrupt and farcically politicized the criminal ""justice"" system appears to be. In other words, if Barr's principal concern is to maintain the illusion of government evenhandedness and legal impartiality, then Barr is his own worst enemy!  The Durham Report confirms that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the U.S. Intelligence Community framed Donald Trump as a Russian spy in a criminal conspiracy to topple his presidency. That's a pretty big deal. In another age in which the thick ooze of State propaganda and censorship had not already blinded too many Americans from seeing clearly, the Obama-Clinton-I.C. plot to depose a sitting president would have been rightly understood not only as a politically destabilizing event with far-reaching consequences, but also as an unprecedented crime demanding heads to roll. Instead, the illustrious culprits behind this veritable coup not only walk freely but also do so while Barr and other Deep State sycophants shrink from speaking their names. Meanwhile, the Durham Report also confirms that FBI leadership sabotaged multiple criminal investigations into the Clintons during that same time period, corroborating Americans' suspicions that there is no law or justice — only politically motivated persecution. Additionally, even though the State-controlled press corps and federal law enforcement agencies have worked to bury overwhelming evidence of Biden family quid-pro-quo bribery schemes rendering the current White House occupant beholden to the blackmail of foreign governments, a majority of Americans have still managed to see through these orchestrated cover-ups and conclude that China Joe has committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" while in office.  Of course, because Americans are also very much aware that they now live under a two-tiered system of ""justice"" that specializes in propaganda and censorship, only a small minority expect Dementia Joe to be impeached or suffer any legal consequences. All this obvious government malfeasance is enough for Congresswoman Harriet Hageman from Wyoming to conclude, ""[FBI director] Christopher Wray and [Attorney General] Merrick Garland are corrupt. They know it, we know it, and the American people know it."" A rare exception proving the general rule that the federal government is run by vermin and swine, Hageman has been blunt: ""[a]s the DOJ and FBI have become more political, they have amassed more power. And as they have amassed more power they have become more political.""  Yet even now, while this avalanche of federal corruption and political persecution is obvious to all but the willfully blind, Bill Barr still expects Donald Trump to be arrested and tried for possessing documents that he alone, while president, was entirely empowered to declassify. Actually, according to the illegal leaks to the press, Special Counsel Jack Smith will most likely pursue Trump not for possessing the documents, but rather for somehow ""obstructing"" the federal government's investigation into whether he possessed the documents. So once again, the State political police have made President Trump a criminal target for opposing an investigation that should have never begun in the first place.  Hillary can willfully destroy evidence without consequence; Obama can organize a coup d'état of his successor without fear of punishment; the FBI and DOJ can get caught illegally spying on Donald Trump, fabricating evidence, and lying to the press about his criminal culpability — yet it is Trump whose efforts to oppose the Deep State mean he must be jailed. Just as the Durham Report proves that an elaborate government conspiracy existed to frame, depose, and criminally imperil President Trump, the same Department of (in)Justice complicit in those crimes will now seek an encore. And because the criminal conspirators continue to be rewarded for their crimes, the criminal victim, Donald Trump, will continue to be persecuted.  In 2016, Democrats accused candidate Trump of being a wannabe dictator for accurately noting that had anybody else stored top-secret communications on an unsecured, home-brew bathroom server — as Hillary Clinton had done — that person would already be in jail for having violated a bevy of national security laws. Earlier that summer, then–FBI director Jim Comey had laid out the compelling case against Hillary, before concluding that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would dare try for a conviction. The lesson to the public was clear: the feds would not go after Clinton or other prominent Democrats even when the evidence for wrongdoing was overwhelming.  Going into the 2024 election, though, corrupt Democrat prosecutors from New York, Georgia, and the federal government are inventing crimes to use against Trump that have never and would never be attempted against any other politician. They prove who the real dictators are. In Bizarro World, the criminals run free, and the innocent are imprisoned! A tyrannical Deep State engages in propaganda, censorship, and political repression. And large Bill Barr largely stays silent.

"political coup","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-21T07:26:59","News / Local  by Staff reporter  Zanu-PF's elaborate plan to deploy state security services such as the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and the military as part of its strategy to win the harmonised elections at all costs has been laid bare in internal communication.Since the 2017 coup that toppled long time ruler Robert Mugabe, his successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been increasingly involving the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and the military in Zanu-PF internal politics.According to the constitution, the intelligence services and the military are supposed to be apolitical.Last month, the CIO running under the shadowy Friends Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ) ran the ruling party's primary elections.FAZ, led by CIO deputy director general Walter Tapfumaneyi, had the major say in the primaries.The group was assisted by an army-linked group Heritage Trust, to conduct the elections.This publication has obtained a Zanu-PF internal memo addressed to provincial chairpersons by political commissar Mike Bimha, dated May 19 informing them that FAZ and Heritage will play a huge role in the upcoming voter registration inspection exercise.The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has not announced when it will open the national voters' roll for inspection.However, Bimha said the exercise will be done soon, raising questions about Zanu-PF's relationship with the elections management body.According to Bimha, Zanu-PF will set up national, constituency and polling centre command centres to monitor the voter inspection exercise.These shall be manned by provincial commissars from the main wing, women's, youth and war veteran's league, provincial FAZ and Heritage Trust liaison officers.""For this programme to be a success, cell chairpersons and a team comprising cell main wing provincial chairperson, cell women's league chairwoman, cell youth league chairperson and a war veteran at each polling station should be responsible and account for each member in the cell register,"" Bimha wrote.""This team led by the cell chairperson shall physically lead their cell members to the polling station, and retain an auditable record confirming each member's inspection status.""It is very critical that data capture is done diligently for this programme.""Constituency experts, (FAZ) and Heritage Trust constituency coordinators will monitor and capture data at each polling station as well as submit daily reports to the command centres.""The memo was copied to Zanu-PF second secretary Kembo Mohadi, secretary general Obert Mpofu, national chairperson Oppah Muchinguri and spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa.""Central committee members, national constitutional assembly (NCA) Members of Parliament (MPs)-elect, sitting MPS and district coordinating committee (DCC) members, constituency experts from FAZ and Heritage liason officers will assist with supervision of the programmes throughout the constituency as well as motivating and directing lower party structures to go and inspect their names,"" Bimha said.Bimha said the ruling party will use the exercise to audit and update its cell registers.""Undertake an audit of party members registered with Zec who are eligible to vote on the election day,"" he said.""Test the capability of party structures to mobilise members to inspect the voters roll and reflect the party's capabilities to mobilise on the election day.""Identify gaps in mobilisation capacity and implement appropriate remedies ahead of the harmonised elections and update cell registers and recruit new members.""He added: ""Ensure that party members identify and familiarise with new boundaries and polling stations following the just-ended delimitation.""Mnangagwa has said he will proclaim election dates before the end of the month.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vYnVsYXdheW8yNC5jb20vaW5kZXgtaWQtbmV3cy1zYy1sb2NhbC1ieW8tMjMwODUxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2015-05-29","12:00:00","{""Abuja"", ""AbujaFederalCapitalTerritory"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-21T13:26:32","Advertisement  By Prince Ejeh Josh & Ebubechi Eze  It’s the duty of lawyers to remove the veil of ignorance on the minds of people in matters of law by setting in motion the true position of the law especially in areas where confusion, misconception and lack of understanding abound. It’s an unacceptable act of notoriety for lawyers, whose duty is to inform and enlighten, to join the herd of ignorant citizens for fear of blackmail, cyberbully or ostracization, to conjecture speculations and falsehoods in a bid to distort the law. Let’s see through this short lens of constitutional voyage on the legal/constitutional impossibility of halting a presidential swearing-in ceremony.  Advertisement  One of the fundamental issues in the country today is the call by some Nigerians on the court to grant an injunction stopping the inauguration or swearing-in of the President-elect, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the substantive President of Nigeria on May 29 pending the substantive determination of the plethora of lawsuits at the presidential elections tribunal challenging his victory at the February 25 general elections.  Few lawyers and non-lawyers have even approached the Federal High Court and tribunal with applications praying the court/tribunal for an order restraining the Chief Justice of Nigeria from swearing in the president-elect, or in the alternative, to restrain the president-elect from presenting himself on 29 May for taking oath to the office of the president.  The question is whether the court or any other authority has the power to grant this order or stop the swearing-in ceremony. This is purely a constitutional matter, and it’s never in the contemplation of the Nigerian constitution that such would happen.  Advertisement  Nigerians are emotional with politics and law. While politics may allow emotion to determine the outcome of a cause, law, on the other hand, is bereft of emotion or sentiment. It’s all about evidence deducted through fact. Court can only draw its power and authority to grant an injunction or order or give judgment from the body of the extant law of the land. Copious reference(s) must be made to the statute or law from where the court derives its power in arriving at its decision.  Usually, these laws are written codes like the constitution, electoral law, or other statutes and stare decisis et non quieta movere or what is popularly called in our local parlance as judicial precedent/case law. The court does not pander to blackmail arising from bandwagon of ignoramuses to arrive at its decision. Any exercise of discretion by the court, where the law allows, must be done judiciously and judicially with the interest of the society vis-à-vis reconciliation of conflicting forces to bring them in conformity with the law and equity.  The provisions of the constitution are unambiguously spelt out as to the qualifications and requirements for the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Once these requirements are satisfied, the bodies sanctioned by the constitution for its implementation will activate the necessary machineries to bring the provisions into effect and execution. Other means at variance with the provisions of the law are regarded as ultra vires, null and void with dire consequences. This is why the constitution outlaws usurpation of power and authority by any means not recognized by it such as military intervention in politics or its intervention in other matters not within its functions or mandate.  Section 130 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended and hereinafter referred to as the “constitution”) establishes the office of president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, while section 131 of the constitution provides for the qualifications a candidate must meet before s/he can aspire for the office.  Advertisement  In particular, sections 133 and 134 of the constitution provide detailed situations where a candidate for the office of president will be deemed to have been duly elected. Where in a presidential election, a single candidate or what Nigerians call, unopposed candidate, is contesting, he shall be deemed to have been duly elected to such office if he has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation AND THE Federal Capital Territory, Abuja (emphasis mine).  Where there is more than one candidate vying for the office of president in Nigeria, it’s the contemplation of the constitution that a candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected, where he has the MAJORITY of votes cast at the election. He has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation AND THE Federal Capital Territory, Abuja (emphasis mine).  The arguments from different quarters following the declaration of Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress as president-elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) having polled the highest votes cast being a total number of 8,794,726 votes and maintained a clear lead of one quarter of votes cast in two-thirds of the States of the Federation to beat his closet rival and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar who got 6,984,520 votes, with Mr. Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria’s People Party trailing behind with some distant 6,101,533 and 1,496,687 votes respectively were two pronged; that Tinubu couldn’t muster at least, 25% votes from the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, robbing him victory since it was a mandatory constitutional requirement, and that the constitution does not make it obligatory or compulsory for a candidate to score at least 25% votes in the FCT since Abuja has no special status conferred on it.  Advertisement  The above constitutional provision has become a contentious issue with ripple effect and multiple interpretations by legal practitioners and analysts down to the common man on the street. In fact, it became a free-for-all intellectual excursion with people negotiating confusion into their minds. Fallacies are wrapped in sensationalism and packaged like the Catholic Holy Communion and sold out to undiscerning minds as unquestionably conclusive. Everyone assumed the position of a legal expert, heating up the charged political atmosphere spiraling the call for an interim government or in wild language, military junta.  A call for an interim government, I strongly hold, is a deviation from the freedom of expression or thought to an extreme state of treason and an invitation for military coup. The constitution creates an incontrovertible window of balance of interest and harmonious social order in situation where parties are aggrieved at the outcome of elections. It creates the tribunal and courts where justice will be speedily dispensed within a timeframe. Section 285 of the constitution provides for the expeditious proceeding in elections matters. It doesn’t contemplate coup as some Nigerians are presently calling for one in whatever nomenclature they had applied. It doesn’t envisage INTERIM GOVERNMENT (emphasis mine) which is an abrogation of the law of the land.  Indeed, the constitution is apposite as to where the tenure of the president can be extended. Section 135 (3) of the constitution provides that the extension of the tenure of the office of president could only be allowed with the sanction of the National Assembly where the country is physically at war and the president considers it IMPRACTICABLE TO HOLD ELECTIONS (emphasis mine). Aside this, no other act, commission or omission can give the president or any other authority such as the court the power and jurisdiction to extend the expiring tenure of a president or order for an interim government by whatever names or stop the swearing-in of a President-elect declared as such by INEC in exercise of its functions.  On the issue of the 25% requirement of a presidential candidate in the FCT, I have had the opportunity to peruse different opinions by senior lawyers, ripostes and arguments. It is interesting as they add to the corpus juris of our jurisprudence. However, let me quickly note that some positions taken by known senior lawyers were fraught with biases and veered from sound legal foundation. They’re at best, mere sociological and political in orientation and do not speak the language of the law. Some even applied mathematics without logic in the explanation of the word “AND” used by sections 133 and 134 of the constitution as regards the status of the FCT, Abuja.  The court is a court of justice rather than technicalities. It looks at the substance rather than the form. It’s in pursuit of justice that Equity evolved to ameliorate the harshness and injustice occasioned by the common law. It is, however, surprising that many senior lawyers still believe in the substantive application of technicalities to knock off rival parties and subvert substantial justice. The court had, over time, developed various canons of interpretation of statute in order to navigate a way out of the rigidity of the common law by giving it reasonable meaning that will dispense manifest justice. On this, rules such as the literal, golden, mischief, progressive, etcetera rules of statutory interpretation have provided latitude for reasonability in applying the law.  Section 299 of the constitution deals a fatal blow to whatever argument that the Capital Territory, Abuja, is conferred with a special status in the execution of the constitution. The section clearly provides that “the provisions of this constitution SHALL apply to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja as if it were one of the States of the Federation…” In order to leave no one in doubt, it goes further to provide that all the legislative powers, executive powers, judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the President of the Federation and the courts established for the FCT. The deliberate elucidation of the vestments of these powers on the above bodies is only for convenience in administration and not for any special purpose or status.  Sections 300, 301, 302 etcetera of the constitution further provide a foolproof module that liken the FCT to one of the states of the federation and no more subject to necessary alterations for conformity. The law is well settled that the High Court of the FCT as provided for in sections 255 to 259 and the High Court of a State as provided for in sections 270 to 274 are both referred to as courts of coordinate jurisdiction. This seals the coffin of whatever centrifugal argument creating a dichotomy between the status of a state and that of the FCT as one transmogrified with a special status.  On the word ‘AND’ (emphasis mine) as used in sections 133 and 134 of the constitution; a community reading of the provisions of the constitution, particularly, section 299 and the accompanying sections will leave no one in doubt that the intendment of the draftsmen were clearly unambiguous as the word is conjunctive. It does not separate or isolate the FCT from other states making it a special case. The FCT shall be treated, subject to specific provisions and adjustment in the constitution, as one of the states of the federation. It can be safe, therefore, to submit that barring military intervention—which is not feasible at the material time—no court or any other authority can stop the swearing-in of a President-elect. Aggrieved parties should exhaust the abundance of redress system the constitution has provided.

"political coup","2023-02-22","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-21T16:38:00","In early February of this year, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S., with Norway's help, had sabotaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines that supplied Germany and other European states with natural gas from Russia. The pipelines (two of which were not yet in operation) were blown up last Sept. 26, but the question of who was responsible has remained a mystery.  The U.S. government, which has long been concerned about Europe's growing economic reliance on Russia — and on the Nord Stream pipelines in particular — vehemently denied the charge, with the White House describing Hersh's story as ""false and complete fiction."" Then, on March 8, the New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence sources suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group, independent of the Ukrainian government, had been responsible.  The story of the Nord Stream sabotage illustrates how difficult it is to know what is true about the world today. Whether it is the Ukraine war, the COVID pandemic, a conspiracy to take control of the world or the wider pursuit of human progress (my area of research), truth is extraordinarily elusive and fiercely contested.  This matters. It is axiomatic that if we are to solve the problems (and opportunities) of the world, we need to know the truth of it — at least to the best of our ability. And, perhaps most important, knowing the truth helps us to see how these matters are themselves linked to each other: to see that the Ukraine war and the pandemic, the alleged conspiracy of world domination and humanity's problematic future are different facets, layers or scales of a complex, reciprocal process of symptom and cause that is creating a crisis in liberal democracies, especially the U.S., and even a threat to global civilization.  To seek to understand the truth about these matters also reveals how badly mainstream politics and media are failing us. For the most part, they are not interested in the truth, only in promoting a narrative that serves a limited and self-interested agenda.  The Ukraine war and COVID  The claims and counterclaims over the Nord Stream gas pipelines can be found reflected in almost every aspect of the Ukraine war, especially the key question of whether Russia's invasion was ""unprovoked,"" as the West insists. The debates also include whether the current conflict is part of a long ""hybrid"" war by Russia against the West or by the West against Russia; whether the eastward expansion of NATO was or was not a key provocation; whether the West's sanctions against Russia are working or not; whether or not Russia is willing to negotiate a peaceful outcome and the West is willing to negotiate with Russia; whether the war is about defending Ukraine's sovereignty or weakening Russia's military capability; whether its root causes lie in Russian imperialism or the U.S. determination to maintain its global hegemony. I have read accounts by experts and scholars that are poles apart on these matters.  The problem is made worse by the mainstream media's tendency to tell only one side of the Ukraine story, the ""official narrative,"" betraying a reluctance to interrogate different accounts of what is going on and thereby creating the inescapable suspicion that we are not being told the truth. Western governments and media appeared surprisingly indifferent to who was behind the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, a brazen act of international terrorism, even war. The mainstream media largely ignored Hersh's detailed account (see also this report). They reported the Times story, but without questioning its plausibility, a striking omission given the generally accepted view that only a ""state actor"" would have the capability to destroy the pipelines. Alternative media did report on Hersh's story (both favorably and critically), and challenged the reliability of the Times story.  On Ukraine, the mainstream media has tended to tell only one side of the story, the official narrative, thereby creating the inescapable suspicion that we are not being told the truth.  Let me give a few more details of the counter-narrative. Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs is a prominent critic of the official Western narrative, for instance. He argues that we have not marked the first anniversary of the Ukraine war but rather the ninth, going back to the 2014 revolution or coup in Ukraine (depending on your point of view), overtly supported by the U.S. and EU, which overthrew an elected pro-Russian government.  Both the former French president and former German chancellor have admitted in recent interviews that they never intended to honor the Minsk Agreements signed with Russia in 2014 and 2015 that were intended to bring a peaceful settlement in Ukraine. Their purpose instead was to buy time to build Ukraine's military capability. The U.S. has a long history of intervening in other countries' affairs, including invasion, regime change and electoral interference. Carried out in the name of promoting democracy and freedom, the interventions have also served another ""truth"" — American global hegemony.  A similar situation exists with the COVID-19 pandemic, which is also beset by claims and counterclaims: The virus spread from animals in the Wuhan wet market or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology; COVID is a serious and even fatal disease or is no worse than the flu; vaccines are effective and safe or ineffective and even dangerous; other treatments based on ""repurposing"" existing medicines are effective or useless; masks work or are damaging; lockdowns early in the pandemic were necessary or needlessly destructive.  The COVID counter-narrative does not come exclusively from anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, but sometimes from independent scientists, doctors and journalists, often citing studies published in scientific journals. People underestimate the inherent uncertainty of scientific processes and their vulnerability to politicization. Stories are rife of the pressures placed on ""dissenters"" to toe the official line.  As with the Ukraine war, the mainstream media has, by and large, only focused on and endorsed the official story, dismissing contrary claims and evidence as misinformation and conspiracy-mongering. Again, it is worth giving a few examples of the current state of play, emphasizing that it is not a matter of all or nothing in decoding the truth of the competing positions.  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  A recent investigation by Vanity Fair and ProPublica has provided compelling evidence (if not proof) that the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was also funded by the U.S. to perform ""gain of function"" research on viruses (see also this update). Some scientists favor this source. The U.S. Energy Department has reportedly changed its position recently to favor a lab-leak origin. On the other hand, China recently (and belatedly) released data on viral and animal genetic material collected from the Wuhan wet market, providing stronger evidence (but again not proof) that raccoon dogs at the market were a possible animal reservoir of the COVID virus, potentially infecting humans.  In the past few months mainstream media have run accounts of mistakes made during the pandemic response. True to form, some conspiracy theorists suggest these admissions are a channel for authorities to test new narratives about COVID and obtain amnesty for their mistakes.  My purpose is not to judge the truth of all the contested details about Ukraine and Covid, but to emphasize how difficult it is to know the truth. Most people I know, and most people likely to read this, accept both the government responses to COVID and the West's Ukraine narrative. I suspect few have gone beyond the mainstream media coverage in making up their minds.  As someone with no professional stake in these matters, but who has read widely across different media, I think the Russian invasion of Ukraine was wrong and unjustified, but am not convinced by the insistent Western message that it was entirely unprovoked (provocation is not the same thing as justification). I suspect the West contributed to what happened through its relations with Russia over the decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, and bears some responsibility for what has transpired — and also now has responsibility for bringing the war to an end. Learning and accepting the truth about the war's prehistory will be important to making peace in Ukraine, and also to avoiding an immensely destructive and dangerous possible war with China.  I now suspect that the coronavirus probably came out of the Wuhan laboratories, and that the U.S. may be indirectly implicated through its funding of research there. It seems evident that neither the U.S. or China has been open and transparent about the pandemic. I accept that vaccines have reduced the risk of serious illness and death, but on many other questions I remain undecided, happy to wait on future findings, studies and inquiries. As with Ukraine, getting to the truth is crucial, in this case to better prevent and respond to future pandemics. (Personally, I did as I was told, obeying lockdowns and other restrictions. That was an easy decision: I live in a rural community, work from home and do not have dependent children.)  A grand conspiracy?  The uncertainties and unknowns don't end with these matters. The counter-narratives on the war and the pandemic are also woven into a grand conspiracy theory, often described by its adherents as the Great Reset, the Fourth Industrial Revolution or New World Order. This envisions a deliberate plot by a global technocratic elite to take control of the world, subjugate the world population and drastically reduce its size. According to this theory, the COVID pandemic and the worldwide response were deliberately engineered to frighten people into accepting greater surveillance, control and loss of freedom. Climate change is also part of the conspiracy, another contrived scare story to groom people into accepting enslavement and domination.  Counter-narratives on the war, the pandemic and climate change have been woven into a grand conspiracy theory — the Great Reset or the New World Order — in which a global technocratic elite seeks to subjugate the world population.  In fact, conspiracy theories appear to have given new life to climate-change denialism. Climate change is a third topic of grave concern to us all, arguably much more so than either Ukraine or COVID. But here the uncertainties about what is true are different: the debate has already run for 30 to 50 years and the major questions are settled. But governments and the media have again failed us, this time by promoting doubt and delaying action long after the scientific data was clear. Even now, with virtually all global governments accepting the reality of climate change and the need to take action, what is being proposed falls far short of what the science says is needed to avoid unacceptable risks to our planetary system and human civilization.  All the same, unlike most of my friends and acquaintances, I don't treat the Great Reset conspiracy with derision. Conspiracy theories are one way many people make sense of the chaos, incoherence and contradiction of today's world, and manage their confusion and bewilderment. Such narratives are a means of responding to the suspicion that we are not being told the full story by those in power, and instead are becoming increasingly powerless.  This set of conspiracy theories incorporates disparate movements that have been around for a long time: movements against globalization, technological change and corporate greed, and in favor of democratization and decentralization. It also embraces some bizarre beliefs. Depending on how deeply people are drawn in, the conspiracy includes claims of Satanic rituals, pedophilia, child trafficking and human sacrifice — all allegedly engaged in by the global cabal.  Conspiracy thinking is not just a matter of what is true or false. It is not merely irrational or deranged. It reflects the deep psychosocial trauma of feeling uprooted and adrift in a world that no longer makes sense. Critics warn of the dangerous influence of conspiracy thinking on society and politics, especially in the U.S. But is it more dangerous than the ""rational"" actions of governments, based on worldviews that may be just as delusional?  Leaving aside the weirder elements, these interlocking conspiracy theories reflect a world situation that is truly worrying. Rather than a deliberate plot by a cabal intent on world domination, I think we are seeing the effects of other processes or forces: On one hand, elite cooperation toward generally agreed goals of national and global progress; on the other, elite collusion among governments, international organizations and global corporations to advance their interests and to further concentrate wealth, power and control.  This is more a matter of similar mindsets or worldviews about the way the world works, or at least about how it should work, than a conspiracy. The elite think and act alike, but do so according to their shared or divergent interests. Conspiracy thinking attempts to join up too many dots, forging tenuous or imaginative links between issues, organizations and individuals in an attempt to render today's chaos and confusion into a coherent narrative.  For me, the weakest link (again, the weird stuff aside) is between the conspiracy theory and climate change. To believe that thousands of scientists, hundreds of research bodies and dozens of national and international organizations are all engaged in the deliberate falsification of data and models to support the Great Reset is beyond belief. Similarly, the related goal of sustainable development is not part of the plot to control the world, as conspiracy theorists believe. It is objectively what we need.  Rather than a deliberate plot by a global cabal, I see a process of elite cooperation and competition involving governments, corporations and international organizations. It's more a matter of similar mindsets than conspiracy.  Yes, global corporations have far too much power, relative to governments and citizens. All too often, they capture the agencies that are supposed to regulate them in the public interest. Big Pharma has huge influence over national and international health policy, including the pandemic response; the military-industrial complex has immense political power, especially in the U.S., impoverishing society and profiting enormously from war. But not all elements work in unison. If climate change is a deliberate ploy to frighten people into subservience, why has the immensely powerful fossil-fuel industry spent decades denying its reality and dire consequences, long after its own scientists accepted the validity of the science?  Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, the club of the world elite, is often described by conspiracy-theory believers as a mastermind of the Great Reset. Ironically enough, Schwab warned us way back in 1996 that globalization faced a mounting backlash against its effects. His warning was not heeded, as a Guardian journalist wrote in 2017: ""There was no real attempt to make globalisation work for everyone. Communities affected by the export of jobs to countries where labour was cheaper were left to rot. The rewards of growth went disproportionately to a privileged few.""  Watching a video presentation sent to me by a conspiracy-minded friend has clarified my position and how it differs from that of the conspiracy theorists. The presenter, geographer Jacob Nordangård, sets out the case for an ""open conspiracy"" in which a global elite, spearheaded by the World Economic Forum, is attempting the ""technocratic reshaping of humanity and the planet.""  The implication here is that a sinister global cabal is creating or at least exaggerating crises in order to justify an undemocratic global takeover. I see something more mundane: the global elite's genuine effort, across several decades, to address real crises. This could be altruism, but more than likely it's just self-interest — the desire to save their own necks.  Avoiding calamity, making life better  This brings me to another dimension of what is or isn't true, one that has been a focus of my own research. The challenge is not just to discover the truth about Ukraine or COVID, or even to prove or disprove the existence of an improbable worldwide conspiracy, but to examine whether the whole cultural basis of how we live is true — in the sense of guiding us toward the right choices to avoid disaster and make life better.  This is speculative by definition, and I do not deny the roles of global political, economic, environmental and other factors. But I believe this deeper story of existential uncertainty and concern is also part of the picture. People know ""the system"" is not working. This dislocates or untethers us from official narratives, which then makes governments more susceptible to corrupt and self-serving behavior, and citizens more prone to mistrust and improbable beliefs. When the foundations of a civilization crack, all hell can break loose.  As I wrote in an earlier essay for Salon, changes in society over the past several decades have both reflected and strengthened the growing political influence of postmodernism, with its multiple narratives, relative truths, ambiguities, pluralism, fragmentation and complex paradoxes. We have yet to learn how to deal with this situation. Instead of accepting and working within it by being more flexible and open-minded, there is a tendency, especially within politics and the media, to rush into conflict, contest and censure, often over contrived or exaggerated issues. All this has badly fractured and divided American society, as well as other Western societies.  By and large, our political leaders fail to accept or understand how serious our situation is. I quoted Barack Obama in the earlier essay as saying in 2016: ""The world today, with all its pain and all its sorrow, is more just, more democratic, more free, more tolerant, healthier, wealthier, better educated, more connected, more empathetic than ever before."" This past January, Joe Biden echoed this optimism, tweeting: ""Two years in, and I've never been more optimistic about America's future."" Really?  In other words, as I argued in that earlier essay, our leaders live in a world at odds with people's lived realities, wishing away the gravity of the human predicament to continue pursuing, at best, incremental policy changes, which is what they know. This essay continues the themes of that essay and a second essay in Salon on culture, progress and the future, to present new arguments and evidence for the need for a new worldview or 'guiding story' for humanity if we are to have any hope of a just, equitable, sustainable future.  Asking people about the future  In the 1990s, as part of a larger program by the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council, I initiated and participated in a project that included a series of future-scenario workshops with young people. We then used the results to conduct a poll of young people. The questions were repeated in a 2005 poll of people of all ages. The results are fascinating, given how the 21st century has begun.  One question we asked was: Thinking about the world in the 21st century, which of the following two statements most closely reflects your view?  By continuing on its current path of economic and technological development, humanity will overcome the obstacles it faces and enter a new age of peace and prosperity.  More people, environmental destruction, new diseases and ethnic and regional conflicts mean the world is heading for a bad time of crisis and trouble.  In 2005, of people of all ages, only 23% chose the first, optimistic scenario, while 66% chose the second, pessimistic scenario.  In another question, we asked people to read two descriptions of possible futures of Australia in 2020, again based on the workshop scenarios. They read in part:  A fast-paced, internationally competitive society, with the emphasis on the individual, wealth generation and enjoying ""the good life."" Power has shifted to international organizations and business corporations.  A greener, more stable society, where the emphasis is on cooperation, community and family, more equal distribution of wealth and greater economic self-sufficiency. An international outlook, but strong national and local orientation and control.  We asked which of the two futures described or came closer to the type of society that they expected Australia would be? And which of the two described or came closer to the type of society they would prefer Australia to be?  In 2005, for all ages, 73% expected the first, ""growth"" scenario, and 27% expected the second, ""green"" scenario; but only 7% preferred the first, and 93% preferred the second. In other words, most people did not expect the future they preferred. The descriptions were an attempt to capture, however approximately, the essence of the scenarios that young people constructed in the workshops. The prevalent pessimism was left out of the survey scenarios to compare what I've called ""the official future"" — the one governments promise, and on which they base their policies — with the future real people actually prefer.  The results are probably applicable to other Western nations, and broadly consistent with findings of many other surveys that capture people's deep concerns for the future. I have described these surveys elsewhere, including in my first Salon essay and in a 2019 scientific paper.  One example I cited was a 2013 study investigating the perceived probability of threats to humanity in four Western nations — the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Australia — which found a majority (54%) rated the risk of our way of life ending within the next 100 years at 50% or greater. The responses were relatively uniform across countries, age groups, gender and education level. Almost 80% agreed that ""we need to transform our worldview and way of life if we are to create a better future for the world.""  The futurist Jim Dator said in the 1990s that he would like to avoid the 21st century and move straight to the 22nd — a time when, one way or another, by choice or compulsion, humanity would have dealt with all the challenges it faces.  The Pew Research Center found in a 2018 survey that 57% of Americans believed that when children today grew up, they would be financially worse off than their parents. A 2019 survey found that 60% of American adults predicted that the U.S. would be less important in the world in 2050. Two-thirds of adult Americans held the view that the U.S. was less respected by other countries today than it was in the past, a 2022 Pew survey showed. These findings are another reflection of the disjunction between people's perceptions and the political status quo.  The futurist Jim Dator said in the 1990s that he would like to avoid the 21st century and move straight to the 22nd, for which he saw some hope: a time when, one way or another, by choice or compulsion, humanity would have dealt with all the challenges it faces: population pressures, environmental destruction, economic equity, global governance, technological change.  Dator wrote that this century was not likely to be pleasant for anyone because we would pay the price for ignoring the future. ""Things may seem calm now: the West — the USA — firmly in control,"" he said. ""But that is not so. The eye of the hurricane is passing, and the fury of the future getting back at us will be felt for some time to come.""  This was not how most Western commentators saw things at the time, instead celebrating the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ultimate triumph of liberal democracy and capitalism; hubris dominated.  Our situation represents what I have called ""the demise of the official future,"" meaning a loss of faith in the future that leaders have promoted and claim they can deliver. This ""futures gap"" stems from political and journalistic cultures that are overly invested in the status quo, unable to see beyond their limited and constrained boundaries and horizons. Mainstream political and media players face a growing need to manage differently the cognitive dissonance between how they think about the world and their work, and the emerging realities of life today and its existential challenges, instead of largely ignoring the latter, as they have generally done.  Learning the truth, the whole truth, behind global threats such as climate change, the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine war is extraordinarily difficult. This difficulty is worsened by the failure of governments and their agencies to tell us the full stories. This failure is in turn deepened by the mainstream media's reluctance to investigate and interrogate the official narratives. This situation extends to the overarching grand narrative of progress, and how it is defined and pursued.  So how do we know what is true in today's world? The answer is that we do so with great difficulty, and can only do so by being skeptical, tolerant, open-minded, vigilant and determined.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2hvdy1kby13ZS1rbm93LXdoYXQtaXMtdHJ1ZS1pbi1hbi1hZ2Utb2Ytd2FyLWFuZC1jb25zcGlyYWN5LXRoZW9yeS1pdHMtbm90LWVhc3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Encrypted channels on messaging app Telegram reveal new evidence about the activities of the guns-for-hire - with pictures showing their activities in Africa and their links to southeast Asia & South America.  11 Yevgeny Prigozhin formed the Wagner paramilitary group  11 Wagner Group forces pictured in the Middle East  11 Wagner have been active in Sudan, as seen in shared photos on Telegram and official reports Credit: Telegram  Wagner Group have stepped from the shadows over the last year as they become increasingly involved in the war in Ukraine - including this weekend claiming they have seized the city of Bakhmut.  The fighters have often been seen as Vladimir Putin's private army who operate separately from Russia's military services.  They are led by the increasingly deranged warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, who rose from being known as ""Putin's chef"" to being one of the most powerful men in Russia.  It is believed Prigozhin has ambitions of replacing Putin in the top job - and Western intelligence has confirmed Vlad has fears over his attack dog's loyalty.  Prigozhin has openly raged against his former patron - appearing to call the 70-year-old ""grandpa"" and a ""complete a**hole"", before later denying he was talking about Vlad.  His stock amongst the Russian elite will once again be on the rise now as he is taking full credit for the capture of Bakhmut after a bloody 8-month battle.  And so The Sun Online took a deep dive into channels used by the Wagner Group - revealing a force with almost cult-like dedication to their cause and a wide global ranging operation.  Pictures and messages in the Grey Zone Telegram channel - which is closely affiliated with, if not run by, the Wagner Group - are mainly focused on Ukraine.  But there is also evidence that further supporting accusations that Wagner has been active in Africa and Asia - and hints they could be operating in Asia and Latin America.  Experts described the messages uncovered by The Sun Online as ""worrying"" - and said they could show previously unreported Wagner activity in countries such as Myanmar and Nicaragua.  Wagner - who often recruit former convicts and pump soldiers full of drugs before sending to the frontline - are open about their love of violence and battle.  Hauntingly, some of the images shared of soldiers holding guns in remote countries are tagged ""Война – отрада"", meaning ""war is a blessing"".  The messages also reveal Wagner's imperial ambitions - openly talking about a new Russian Empire expanding deep into Europe.  Since its formation, Wagner and other Russian paramilitaries have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan, Mali and Mozambique.  The 50,000-strong group have been accused of killing children, raping and torturing women, and carrying out brutal executions.  Putin is believed to used the group to give himself plausible deniability as they are not explicitly tied to the Kremlin.  It is however widely understood the the mercenary force acts with the full sanction of the Russian state.  Wagner mercenaries are often retired Russian soldiers and they reportedly earn around £2,000 pounds a month.  And a recent post shows the group continue to actively recruit in Africa, advertising ""tourist destinations"" in ""one of several countries"".  Recruits are asked to be aged between 22 and 50 - and Wagner notes they are particularly looking for medics.  They will earn 240,000 rubles a month - or £2,400 if they get the job.  The ad was accompanied with pictures of various Wagner mercs purportedly serving in Africa - but they did not specify which countries.  11 Pictures shared on Telegram appearing to show Wagner fighters in Africa  11 It is unclear exactly how many countries Wagner are operating in - pictured alleged in Africa  11 A member of the Russian paramilitary group ""Slavic Corps"" seen in Myanmar in the early 2010s Credit: Telegram  Katya Hakim is a senior researcher at the Dossier Centre - an organisation which tracks the criminal activity of those in the Kremlin.  She explained that the connection between the Kremlin and Wagner is clear - Wagner could not be nearly as influential as it is without assistance of the Russian government.  She told The Sun Online: ""Wagner doesn’t mean Prigozhin. Wagner means the Kremlin.  ""It’s just impossible to imagine that several hundreds and sometimes thousands of individuals would travel to the Middle East or to Africa for instance [for Wagner], do a coup and then come back without any charges against them.""  The Grey Zone published photos of a Wagner commander awarding Sudanese soldiers at a ceremony in 2019, and other images show Wagner soldiers posing with guns in the region.  Wagner has been supplying weapons to Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, which is currently engaged in a brutal conflict with Sudan's armed forces - leading to the mass evacuation of foreigners.  In a recent message via Telegram, Wagner CEO Yevgeny Prigozhin said: ""Our task is to expand the scope of Russia around the world from Alaska to Australia to South Africa.""  Attached to the message was a sickening map, showing a ""United Reconstructed USSR"" stretching from Alaska, through the middle east, deep into north Africa.  Katya continued: ""Usually countries picked by Wagner are quite poor, meaning they would depend on resources provided by Russia.  ""Resources doesn’t necessarily mean money - resources might mean military equipment.  ""In return, they get endorsement for most of the decision making made by the Russian government. In the international bodies - just take a look at how some African countries are deciding on UN panels.  ""The Central African Republic for instance is voting most of the time endorsing Russia.""  Referencing Wagner's involvement in Sudan from 2017 until roughly 2021, a Telegram message refers to it as an achievement, but shockingly suggests going even further with their influence.  It reads: ""We can go even further and recall groups of military advisers where there are none: in Venezuela, for example. In Nicaragua. In Angola. In Iraq.""  Katya revealed that while the Dossier Centre does not currently have intel on Wagner being active in Nicaragua, they ""could be present"" in the Latin American country.  For Alex Kokcharov, a London-based analyst focused on eastern Europe, these comments are worrying.  He provided context on these statements for The Sun: ""They mean deployments of military advisers where 'officially' there were none.  ""Soviets had their military advisers embedded in Nicaragua and Angola despite claiming none were present.""  The post on Telegram by paramilitaries also previously said: ""There is an amazing rogue country called Myanmar.  ""Take and send political consultants there, help resolve the situation - and a country that has historically sympathised with Russia will be served on a silver platter.""  The situation in question is Myanmar's brutal civil war, which has been raging for decades.  And pictures shared on the group appear to show a mercenary from the Russia paramilitary group the Slavonic Corps in Myanmar.  The corps was precursor to the Wagner Group which was dissolved around the same time as they emerged in 2014.  Russia vetoed a UN resolution which would have condemned human rights abuses at the hands of Myanmar's government.  Wagner's influence across the world is not slowing down, as it aims to spread the Kremlin's agenda worldwide and create a ""new and improved"" Soviet Union.  The group first appeared in Ukraine in 2014 where it played a key role in Russia's illegal seizure of Crimea.  And they have neo-Nazi roots, with the name even being taken from Hitler's favourite composer Richard Wagner.  It is believed to have been originally been led by former Russian special forces commando Dmitry Valerievich Utkin.  Utkin has tattoos honouring Adolf Hitler's evil secret police the SS and the eagle symbol of the Third Reich.  Prigozhin always denied involvement - but in the middle of last year he finally admitted that he heads up Wagner.  Since then he has increasingly been seen on the frontlines in military fatigues - and appears to be positioning himself as a rival to Putin.  11 A graphic has been shared showing a new USSR Wagner hopes to establish Credit: Telegram  11 ""Rewarding Sudanese military personnel with commemorative signs of military cooperation"" in 2019 Credit: Telegram  11 A member seen in Khartoum, posted in 2021.

"political coup","2018-07-24","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T22:58:24","Journalist Asa Winstanley has been one of the most consistent and compelling voices exposing the ‘Labour antisemitism’ scam perpetrated against Jeremy Corbyn and the left to prevent a left-wing government – a weaponisation since confirmed even by the Starmer-commissioned Forde Report. In his new book, ‘Weaponising Anti-Semitism’, Winstanley provides a convincing history of the development of the smear before Corbyn was ever in the frame to lead the party – and the way it was used to help bring Corbyn’s leadership down after the left terrified the Establishment by coming close to winning the 2017 general election.  In this exclusive extract, Winstanley examines one of the most prominent figures in the construction of the ‘Labour antisemitism’ narrative and the different aspects of the role she played, including her unfounded claims about Black activist Marc Wadsworth:  “Ruth Smeeth (strictly protect)”  Ruth Smeeth MP had good reason to delete the post [claiming Black activist Marc Wadsworth had used an antisemitic smear toward her at a Labour event] —the idea that Marc Wadsworth had said she was part of a “media conspiracy” was completely untrue. Importantly, he did not make any kind of anti-Jewish comment. In fact, he didn’t refer to Smeeth’s Jewishness in any way—he later clarified that he hadn’t even known she was Jewish. Wadsworth replied to Smeeth’s false allegations in a statement the same day, describing them as “poisonous slander.” He said her claims played “into a Jewish media conspiracy theory that I utterly reject and have never espoused.” [Video of the incident here]  Wadsworth’s instincts about Smeeth “working hand in hand” with the right-wing press to overthrow Corbyn were totally correct. Only three days earlier Smeeth had played her own minor part in the coup attempt against Corbyn. She announced on Twitter “with a heavy heart” that she was resigning from a junior role in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. It was timed to coincide with a series of resignations by dozens of hostile MPs, in a failed attempt to force him to resign. They came after the no-confidence vote tabled by Margaret Hodge and the firing of Hilary Benn, another right-wing shadow minister Corbyn had fruitlessly attempted to bring on board as part of his abortive “big church” approach.  But unlike Wadsworth and the others, as a journalist reporting on the UK’s pro-Israel lobby, I happened to be pretty well acquainted with Smeeth’s work.  I wrote a story about her in 2014, when she was selected as a Labour candidate. I did so because of two key facts, ignored by a media that would later pay her such close attention: she had worked as a spin doctor for the Israel lobby and had acted (wittingly or otherwise) as a secret Labour Party source for the US government.  * * *  Over the next two years, Smeeth campaigned relentlessly to have Marc Wadsworth expelled. In 2018, Smeeth rallied a group of white MPs to accompany her to a hearing of Labour’s disputes panel where she gave evidence against Wadsworth. His supporters later called this a modern-day political lynching. The case undermined Corbyn’s leadership and divided Labour’s newly enthusiastic left-wing mass membership. Smeeth wasn’t motivated so much by personal animus against Wadsworth as by a calculated political strategy. She was so dedicated to sabotaging her own party that she didn’t seem overly concerned that her campaign ultimately came at the cost of losing her own Labour seat in 2019.  Journalists gave Smeeth sympathetic puff-piece interviews. She told London newspaper the Evening Standard that her critics were motivated only by racism. “I don’t talk about Israel or Palestine,” she claimed. “This is not about anything I’ve said on Middle-East politics. I don’t participate.” This was, at best, incredibly misleading, as I knew from my prior reporting.  Smeeth was hired by lobbyists BICOM in 2005, the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, as director of public affairs and campaigns. A public relations industry publication reported at the time that she had arrived there from a position as head of government relations for Sodexho, a company providing support services to the military. BICOM’s chief executive told the publication that Smeeth would help strengthen their relationships with the “Foreign Office, party leaders, think-tanks, and academia.” She worked for BICOM until 2007. After a brief stint in public relations for Nestlé, she returned to the Israel lobby, joining the Community Security Trust for two years. Although a registered charity tasked with documenting anti-Semitism, the CST also has a more clandestine mission: lobbying for Israel.  According to Antony Lerman, the founder of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, the CST even has ties with the Mossad, Israel’s foreign spy agency. The CST is another key part of the network of pro-Israel lobby groups that constantly pushed the “crisis” narrative on Labour.  After several abortive attempts, in 2014 Smeeth made her move into politics. She was selected as Labour candidate for the then–safe seat of Stoke-on-Trent North. Smeeth seemed an odd choice. She’d tried once already as Labour’s candidate in nearby Burton, losing to the Conservatives by more than 6,000 votes in 2010. She finally managed to enter Parliament in 2015.  Far from cutting her Israel lobby ties while an MP, the register of MPs’ financial interests reveals that Smeeth was given thousands of pounds in donations by two key BICOM figures: Poju Zabludowicz and Trevor Chinn. The founder of Smeeth’s ex-employer BICOM, Zabludowicz is the scion of an Israeli arms dealer and a billionaire property speculator. Chinn is a retired motor industry tycoon who uses his wealth to support a raft of Israel lobby groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and BICOM.  While the nearest US equivalent to BICOM—AIPAC—has increasingly become more partisan and affiliated with Trump and the Republican Party in recent years, BICOM from its outset was closely aligned with the Atlanticist, neoliberal wing of the Labour Party. They were always going to consider the left-wing, pro-Palestinian leadership of Jeremy Corbyn to be a threat. Smeeth and her pro-American tendency aimed to keep the party stubbornly pro-Israel and pro-NATO.  The extent of Smeeth’s commitment to US empire was revealed by WikiLeaks in 2011. In one of the many classified US diplomatic cables revealed by whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, the US embassy in London secretly reported that “Ruth Smeeth (strictly protect)” had in 2009 given American diplomats inside information about Gordon Brown, then the UK’s prime minister. The intelligence concerned Brown’s strategy on when to hold a general election and the confidential cable’s author thought Smeeth’s report important enough to note that “this information has not been reported in the press.” Smeeth declined to deny the cable’s contents, claiming to the Daily Telegraph at the time of the WikiLeaks revelation that she had “no recollection of saying what has been attributed to me.” But she confirmed contact with the US embassy, claiming she had had “a friend” who happened to work there. “I would not consider myself to be a source for the US government,” she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vc2t3YXdrYm94Lm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1leHRyYWN0LWZyb20tbmV3LWJvb2std2VhcG9uaXNpbmctYW50aS1zZW1pdGlzbS1ydXRoLXNtZWV0aC1zdHJpY3RseS1wcm90ZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-07-29","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T10:17:50","By kola Johnson  In the ensemble of political actors in the contemporary politics of the Fourth Republic, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu easily stands out within the mix, and clearly far above others, in terms of his unalloyed puritanism as the most detribalized and extremely excellent bridge builder, whose cosmopolitan worldview, the humanistic creed of the universal brotherhood of men, and magnanimous large-heartedness, rebuff, and with unguarded effortlessness too, illusive segregationist trifles of race, tribe, ethnicity, religion, sex or distortively jaundiced vision of any sort. This indeed is an aspect which even his sworn enemies will concede, and all so readily too, in conscionable sincerity, if they really would.  To be sure, during his memorable gubernatorial epoch in Lagos State, Tinubu ran an all-inclusive government, in which Ibos were regaled with key appointments in government, ranging from commissionership, local government chairmanship, supervisory councillorship, councillorship, and even membership of the Federal House of Reps, and Lagos State House of Assembly.  You will agree with me, that in the medley of the heterogeneous diversities of tribes domiciled in Lagos State, Ibos constitute about the greatest numbers of tribal blocs. Empirical evidence availing illustrates in poignant clarity, that a good number of Igbo immigrants had decided to relocate to Lagos, in order to enjoy the health and educational amenities, which are not only excellent, but considerably liberal and devoid of discriminatory cleavages on tribal ground, or prejudicial conditionalities of any sort, to access.  And for the Igbos engaged in big-time businesses, one could well succinctly attest to the fact that successive governments in Lagos State, have often accorded them the optimum hospitality, as could ever be imagined.  However, under Tinubu, especially during his memorable gubernatorial epoch, our Igbo brothers have never had it so good, in terms of the conducive ambiance they have continued to enjoy in Lagos State, surpassing in quantum measures, the milieu as extant in regimes prior to Asiwaju’s tenure as governor of Lagos State.  We needn’t overly elaborate on this feature, which is crystally self-evident, in terms of his spiritedly sustained, and of course, intensified efforts, expended in integrating the Igbos into the mainstream of affairs, both in the sphere of political administration and governance and socially too, in the bid to instill a reciprocal sense of belonging which comfortably settles them to feel at home, as members of the same family, with the vast mass of natives of their home states, especially Lagos and Yorubas as a whole  This is why developments unfolding over the years, had signally expressed no cause for cheers, in terms of the inability of our Igbo brothers to reciprocate his markedly affectionate passion, through their patently unfriendly attitude, bordering on outright hostility, indubitably reckoned in the general mind, in their ever sustained and intensified consistency, ever before Asiwaju’s gubernatorial ascension, as a genetic staple of common behavior  Remember that it was no other personality than Oba Rilwan Akiolu, who sometime in 2015, summoned a meeting of Igbo leaders, during which he gave them a bitter piece of his mind, with regards to their broiling belligerence, notoriously stuck over the years, as a distinctively unique epaulet, perennially unleashed against their ever hospitable Yoruba hosts, and worse still, Tinubu, who presided as the political leader of the ruling party in the state, and who by that token, appertain to their chief host.  On this, could it be recalled, how a highly disturbed Asiwaju, quickly rallied the Ibos together, with a spiritedly passionate appeal, to assuage their aggrieved mind?  To be sure, Tinubu’s passion and manifest sense of kinship for the Ibos, going by the manner in which he had ostensibly gone beyond himself to accord them a filial sense of oneness, as an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, is simply amazing.  Indeed some of those privileged to be quite close to Tinubu, could divulge with competent authority, that quite a good number of times, not a few of the intensely concerned ones, had perennially essayed to awaken the renowned APC leader to the mortal danger, posed by the Ibos, particularly in Lagos State, citing their purulent pus of bad blood, bordering on intensely unbridled hate-mongering, despite all spirited attempts by Asiwaju to encourage and re-assure them from time to time, that not only are they an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, but an esteemed and privileged one for that matter. However, Tinubu in his characteristic quixotry and magnanimous large-heartedness had often dismissed such insinuations as mere figments of the imagination.  But today, Tinubu will need no one sounding the reveille for an intelligible cognizance of the message, visibly unfurled in its ominous augury.  This lamentable show of bad blood, which had quite lingered over the years, sadly attained a climax, the moment Asiwaju emerged at the recently concluded primaries as the APC flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election.  Right from that moment, hell was immediately let loose, with an orchestrated campaign of hatred and calumny, emanating from our Igbo brothers, becoming increasingly vicious, worrisome, and extremely alarming, bordering on something else.  Ordinarily and of course sincerely, one perceives nothing bad or odious with criticisms constructively offered, just as giving your mind, a free rein of expression in the public space, in as much as the laws of the land entrenches the inalienable right to free speech; however, the critical moment of departure, that it begins to negotiate an alarming descent to inflammatory hate words and a flurry of conflagratory verbiage, as our Igbo brothers have indulgently elevated to trivial pleasurable razzmatazz, then every right thinking Nigerian, and lover of peace, should be so verily concerned as to raising an eye brow, for the premium sake of peace, growth and unity of this potentially great nation.  No wonder, popular spectacles of fierce and bitter verbal exchanges between the shamelessly ungrateful Igbos on one hand and their highly considerate and hospitable Yoruba hosts continue to greet the public space with disturbing ubiquity, just as the social media is ever awash with vitriols of all sorts, unleashed with unmitigated fury, by these overzealous dacoits of pan Igbo irredentism, giving a clear and undoubted impression that these are clearly the handiwork of hired hatchet men, at the behest of their “invisible” taskmasters, dictating the shot.  As we could all recall, it soon attained a most infuriating point that FolashadeTinubu Ojo, the Iyaloja-General, who also happened to be Asiwaju’s daughter, could not but chip in a piece of her mind, on the need for these ungrateful stock, to temper their vitriolic vituperations, daily being orchestrated, against the eminent Nigerian statesman, with unfettered restraint.  Indeed, it couldn’t have been anything but shock, an exceedingly severe one for that matter, when a group of Igbos, in an unwarranted rage of defiance, stirred tremors of warning that she was fanning the embers of wild belligerence; hauling, in a rave of uncontrolled lunacy, that they were ready, and indeed more than capable to respond squarely to any drum-beat of battle, as their hospitable Yoruba hosts might bring to bear in the contest. Haba!  A curious aspect of the charade in progress was that as Asiwaju was all this while, at the receiving end of the untrammeled aspersions, perennially hurled by the Igbos, in their possessive fury of hate words, Atiku had all along remained virtually off their scurrilous purview, except for occasional scratchers, which in no way compared in severity, with the lethal verbal assault and saber-rattling incendiaries increasingly being orchestrated against Asiwaju, with sustained and intensified angst.  Yet, this is a man, who as governor, presided over the affairs of Lagos, at a time, when the nagging question of high-frequency migration of the Igbos to Lagos State, attained a peak, continually stretching the existing infrastructure almost beyond the limit of endurance, thus keeping successive administrations sleeplessly on their toes in the herculean toilsomeness that grappled to cope with the increasingly alarming population explosion, daily being witnessed as a result of the accelerating incursion of people in quest of greener pastures, on account of it’s a conducive ambiance to flourishing endeavors.  Of course, it cannot be too often emphasized that Igbos constitute the most considerable chunk of this category. This is why their pestiferous and patently uncouth outpourings against Tinubu indeed herald such a huge surprise, so to say.  Why is it, that Igbos incubate such pathologically inscrutable loathsomeness for their Yoruba brothers, perennially let loose, with frenetic ruthlessness and the most unimaginable vitriol on Asiwaju, who ironically happens, in exceedingly befitting terms, to be their foremost benefactor and ardent lover of their progress?  During Asiwaju’s heroic reign as governor of Lagos State, he succeeded in lifting Lagos to hitherto unprecedented heights, while in the process, making the state, not only the premier state of the federation but also the benchmark of excellence, whose dynamic policies, spreading like an amazing contagion, were emulated with religious fervor, by other states, far and wide.  Why is it therefore, that our Igbo brothers would always with fervent impulsiveness be ready to throw reason to the dogs, ever haunting and hounding this unusually detribalized statesman, at their capriciously whimsical will, and woolly sentimentality, while literally looking less at the individual governors presiding in their own primordial states of the South-East?  Why is it that you come to Lagos; make a huge fortune and big money, and yet, reserve nothing but sheer bilious angst and hate, for your accommodating hosts and their leaders, who hitherto have accorded you such a bosomy familial embrace devoid of any shred of discrimination?  If the governors in your respective native states of the South-East had done even a fraction of Tinubu’s accomplishments in Lagos, with the transformative impetus that has elevated it to one of the leading cities in Africa, would you dare have descended on them with such whorish pang of depredation, so terrifying to imagine? Pray. Why are Igbos so envious, panicky, and intensely jittery even of the slightest shadows of the Yorubas?  Imagine again, the umbrage devoid of the traditional African deference for old age, quite in tune with the Igbo behavioral stereo-type, befittingly evocative of the landmark “ranting of an ant” of Chuba Okadigbo, in his message to the Great Zik, with which they swooped on Wole Soyinka just for his reasoned elderly admonishment on the nutsy band of off-hook scoundrels, parading as pyrate fraters; consigning the cultivated virtue of home training to the dogs, in their reprobative burlesquing of the revered patriot and statesman?  Could you imagine their effusive gibberish rant answering, quite in character with the monocultural racial herd in their wanton abrasiveness against the Yoruba-born globally acclaimed genius of all times, who dominates the global literary fraternity like a colossus, for no imaginable reason whatsoever? Imagine again, the latest in their primitive savage streak, displayed with untamed recklessness, in their churlish and petulant pepper-market jabs unleashed in their brusquely uncouth mannerisms, against the global literary giant, just because of his latest post-election commentaries, in which he made very apt and cogent points.  In the same vein of bilious ingratitude, one recalls that Victor Adebunkola Banjo, a lieutenant colonel of Yoruba extraction, in a sacrificial fit of immolation, discountenanced the implicating tag of a traitor, expectedly coming from his Yoruba kinsmen, to fight on the side of Biafra; but as it were to turn out, Ojukwu’s reciprocal code of appreciation, was an outright summary execution by firing squad, of that brilliant, charismatic and courageous soldier and intellectual.  Same with Adekunle Fajuyi, the then Governor of the old western region, who in an exemplary fit of chivalry, unprecedented in the annals of human existence, staked his life, by choosing to die with his guest and the then military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi ironsi. Yet our Igbo brothers will far from appreciate it.  On this patrimonial inheritance of genetic anti-Yoruba obsession, Chinua Achebe, a foremost exemplar of anti-Yoruba racial hatred, could poignantly be seen as taking the lead, as of course signally evident in the retrospective play-back, 37 years ago, when in the wake of the frabjous ambiance heralding the exhilarating announcement of the Yoruba-born literary giant, he (Achebe)ascended the roof-top, with an unwarranted gaffe, that the global literary diadem, was by no implicit assumption, a caveat for the Asiwaju title of African literature.  Indeed, looking back decades ago; that moment of destiny when Soyinka bagged the Nobel literary diadem; unarguably a staggering all-time feat in the annals of black achievements, he had, even if unknown to him, unwittingly stepped on the wounded toes of the collective mass of envious and inferiority-ridden Ndigbos, who in turn, will never forgive him, just for that singular feat, which they had cherished with passionate fervor, that it should have belonged to one of them or a non-Yoruba rather than a Yoruba.  Indeed, Soyinka himself could not help but describe the banal effusion of the arch-Igbo tribalist as “uncalled for and disappointing”. “I was a little bit disappointed, and didn’t see the necessity…that particular subject under contention didn’t relate to literature”, stressed the world-renowned writer.  Even Soyinka himself, in an article personally written years ago, in an edition of this Day Newspaper, could again, not help but lament a conspiratorial wave of propaganda, insurgently saturating the public space; then championed by an Igbo-born professor; animated by a weird hunch of diabolism, had mischievously sought to forge an interpretatively suspicious link between Achebe’s fatal accident, that rendered him mortally crippled, shortly after a particular edition of his birthday anniversary; to the gift of a live cow, presented to him on that particular occasion by Soyinka; ostensibly as an innocent well-intentioned goodwill gesture, to a comrade in the literary fraternity; but which the arch Igbo tribalist, and a supposedly enlightened professor, had in an unguarded magisterial whim effectively poisoned the vulnerable willing herd of fellow arch tribalists who in their bizarre flight of fancy, had came to construe in the grotesque coloration of occultic wickedness.  Yet, this was the same Soyinka, whose sacrificial immolation for the Biafran cause, in the thick of the civil war, earned him a harrowing 22-month ordeal in the gulag, during the Gowon era.  Again, Achebe would not allow any moment to slip by, without a paludal inveighing of Awo, as the ominous harbinger, paving the fenestra for the demonizing incursion of the tribal monster, into the political firmament.  In the inexpungible quibble of revisionism, we would all recall the ever unrepentantly chronic tribal bigot, who was so quick to the post, harassing Awo as the primordial agent of dispersal of tribal infiltration, advancing a rather meretricious make-belief that the revered statesman of the Yoruba stock, it was, that engineered the parliamentary cross-carpeting that put paid to Zik, in oppilating his visionary misadventure for the Leviathan premiership of the Old West.  Lamentably, his curious quirk for selective amnesia would least avail to advert in reference to the doctrinaire chauvinism of the great Zik, as of course unfolded in his reprobative heresy, way back in 1949, that “….the god of Africa, has created the Igbo nation to lead the children of Africa from the bondage of ages.”  It is, of course, a popular staple of common knowledge, how Zik as the incumbent vice-gerent, in the NCNC, following the glorious demise of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay, would without qualms of conscience, cannibalize the NCNC as an exclusive inheritance, of which the Igbos were the sole legatees; a signally disturbing trend, which in turn elicited the vexatious discountenance of people like Adegoke Adelabu, who were verily uncomfortable with the unstatesmanly descent to base pertavinity.  At this juncture, I shall proceed to expound three signally illustrative instances, in which the defective strabism of Igbo leaders, Zik and Ojukwu in particular, in terms of their myopic preferences of political alliances, had not only dragged the larger mass of their collective filial kins into the excruciating marginalization conundrum, celebrated over the years, in inconsolable crocodilian canticles, but also in the process, dragooned the collective Nigerian nationhood into its contemporary tumult.  However, let me affirm, right before the narrative just about coming on the heels, that this does not in any way, vitiate a jot, the credible moral force, latent in Asiwaju’s fraternizing parley with a vastly enlightened North, as currently extant – contrasting in its progressive paradigm with the feudal fascism of the era of old; for which Awo desperately needed fellow progressive fraters in collaborative synergy; to square up to; for ultimate libertarian triumph, of the Northern Talakawas in an avowed visionary pursuit which unfortunately footled to failure for lack of a willing mate in response to the clarion call, for a united solidarous front, particularly from the strategic North.  Going down memory lane,1959 to be precise, one recalls that Awolowo advanced an alliance overture towards Zik, premised on the logic that a combination of the Action Group, led by him, and the Zik-led NCNC, will overwhelm the Hausa-Fulani NPC, whose narrow feudal bent was clearly ill at variance with the vision of a united and virile Nigeria, and the liberation of the down-trodden, especially the highly pauperized Talakawas of the north.  Zik was crystally enamored of Awo’s unassailable logic, or so it seemed. But dramatically, all of a sudden, Nigerians woke up one day, only to discover that the great Zik had indeed gone with the Hausa-Fulanis! Thus did the Hausa-Fulani NPC seize power, and promptly grabbed it as a much-awaited opportunity to annihilate Awo.  Of course, those who knew at that time would easily recall Akintola’s machiavellian deployment, being a willing myrmidon of the north, for a head-on collision against Awo, his erstwhile leader – as inspired and engineered by the Hausa-Fulani oligarchs, animated by a subterranean cant for a greater Lebensraum and hegemonic continuity – and the violent conundrum in the West; eventually culminating in January 15, 1966, military coup, master-minded by a cross-section of Igbo-born army officers, and the assumption of power by Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, as the first military Head of State, after the gruesome assassination of the then Prime-Minister of the federation, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and the then premier of Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, a direct great-grandson of Shehu Usman Dan Fodio.  The January coup was to inspire the July 29 coup, spear-headed by the Hausa-Fulani elements in the army, in unconsolable revanche to the killing of Balewa and Ahmadu Bello.  Of course, the then ruling military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, among sundry top army officers of Igbo extraction, also lost their lives in the retributive backlash of the same tribal-motivated coup, which in disastrously fatal turn, catalyzed a massive wave of inter-tribal killings between the Igbos and Hausas; triggering the declaration of Biafra, by Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, and the inevitable consecution of a civil war; a gory celebration of blood bath, in which an estimated two million souls perished.  In yet another ominous turn, 1979 would again witness an unfortunate rehash of the same charade, as Awo again made an alliance overture to Zik, ostensibly premised on a mutual synergy between the Awo-led Unity Party of Nigeria, on one hand, and the Zik-led Nigerian People’s Party, aimed at counteracting the Hausa-Fulani-led NPN, a feudal ideological resurgence of the Northern People’s Congress of the First Republic. Again, the entire nation woke up one day, only to discover that the Zik-led NPP had unabashedly flocked along, in parley with the Hausa-Fulani NPN, a feudal reincarnation of the First Republic Northern People’s Congress.  Of course, we could all well attest to how the alliance fortified the NPN, which had ripped off on their fortune-hunting partners, the NPP, to install their men into principal offices in the legislature, now embarked on a pleasurable binge of massive tyranny, as unfolded in the politically motivated mass killings of the Bakolori farmers in Sokoto, the deportation of the Majority Leader of GNPP, Alhaji Abdul-Rahman Shugaba, the terrifying tomfoolery of the 1983 elections, and the devastating quake and tumult, coupled with the demonic prodigality in public spending; a saturnalian frenzy of high-wire corruption, which again was to culminate in the Buhari-Idiagbon coup of December 31, 1983.  Of course, as an intensely agitated Zik cried out, following the massive electoral chicanery, we would all recall the horrifying reckless rant of the notorious rantipole, ChubaOkadigbo, who unsurprisingly typical of his coprolitic gutter-rant style, which would go down as a locus classicus in intellectual hooliganism, dismissed the rightful democratic remonstrance of the great Zik as” the ranting of an ant”  Looking back, one could well affirm without any shred of doubt, that Zik’s preferential cohabitation with the then Northern People’s Congress at the time in question, was motivated by a pathologically embedded narcissism that he could use the benefit of an alliance with the then feudal Northern People’s Congress, to acquire greater leverage for his fellow Igbo brethren against the Yorubas, then renowned for their elevated notch of superior education. Unfortunately, as it would turn out on each occasion, none else, but the Igbos, came out the greatest losers as patently expressed in an unremitting pathos of mournful dirge, in their lachrymal canticles on marginalization.  This unimaginable faux pas of history would also derive an unfortunate replication in the inexplicable choice that saw the Ikemba of Nnewi, Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu who on his return from exilic sojourn in Ivory Coast, now Cote d’Ivoire, had sought for a political party to enlist in, and found none, except the Hausa-Fulani NPN, thus betraying an arrant lack of grasp of the causative dynamics of history.  On what note does one, therefore, reckon with such a big goof in cognitive dissonance, emanating from a supposedly learned Oxford-educated historian of an elevated Master’s degree cadre, as the Ikemba of blessed memory, one may ask?  Not until the devastating defeat he suffered in the Senatorial duel from Dr. Onwudiwe of the NPP, just as his party, the NPN, barely did reckon with him, did it eventually dawn on him that he was already demystified and his terror value which hitherto had stared the Northern feudal oligarchs inwardly scared stiff, effectively defused.  Still, on the Biafran warlord of blessed memory, it would well be apt and relevant at this point, to ask:”In taking recourse to the Hausa-Fulani NPN, as it were, at that time, whose interest was he serving? The collective interest of the Igbos or his own personal interest? If the interest of the Igbos, he should tell that to the marines.  Similarly, in a back-track reminder as might well be deemed for strategic emphasis, we would all witness the manner in which Zik had jettisoned two crucial and strategic overtures for progressive synergy, as advanced by Awo, firstly in 1959, and secondly in 1979, exactly twenty years after; and the catastrophic aftermath for the corporate national existence.  No wonder, Sir James Robertson, the last British governor-general of Nigeria, during the colonial era, daubed him in his memoirs, as mercurial, unpredictable, and unreliable, while the Late Professor Ayodele Awojobi, the engineering genius of blessed memory described him categorically as ‘consistently inconsistent’.  Now pray: in taking recourse to the feudal Hausa-Fulani NPC, and NPN in 1959 and 1979 respectively, exactly 20 years after, whose interest was Zik, indeed the Great Zik of Africa serving? National interest or the interest of his Igbo kith and kin? As for national interest, he could well tell that to the Marines!  Ironically, going down the lane of history, one recalls with definitive clarity, that Zik actually rode to dominantly prosilient fame and eminence, on the political war chest of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay – the then leader of the NCNC, at a time that Zik held forte as the Secretary-General ­­– who at various public fora, openly expressed his passionate love for Zik, as his beloved son, in whom he was well pleased.  This in effect is to say that the wider national appeal that the Zik-led NCNC enjoyed after the demisé of Macaulay, erstwhile leader of the party, was largely due to the immense populist clout and towering larger-than-life imagery of the legendary Macaulay, who at the zenith of his fame and glory, bestrode the Nigerian political hemisphere like a colossus.  It was a tribute to these grave political miscalculations of the great Zik, that no less a personality than the former Premier of the Eastern region, Dr. M.l. Okpara of blessed memory, recanted in agonizing lament, that he will regret till his dying day, his failure to advise Zik, to rather go with the Awo-led Action Group, as against the parochial expedience of the Hausa-Fulani feudal NPC.  Unfortunately, by the time the Zik-led NPP would negotiate corrective ideological repentance for the progressive configuration, of “The Twelve Progressive Governors”, Awolowo’s brain-child in progressive synergy, which Zik had twice rejected, initially in 1959 and again in 1979, it was already too late in the day, as the looming surge of anarchy, had irrepressibly waxed beyond redemption, and could thus not avail as a viable counter-force to rebuff the incursion of the Buhari-Idiagbon duo, who on December 31st, 1983, sprung forth to upstage the apple-cart of the corrupt and purulently decadent Shagari-led civilian administration of the second republic.  And in the case of Ojukwu, we would all recall, how having been politically demystified and deflated sequel to his attendant fiasco at the Senatorial election, he in angered repudiation of his erstwhile Hausa-Fulani allies, recanted in the fashion of a new convert to doctrinaire proselytism of an East-West understanding fanatically propounded and propagated as a counter-force to the monolithic geo-political behemoth of the north.  Unfortunately, and on a tragic note of paradox, the average Igbo man would see nothing wrong in the political leaders of their own genitive breed, let alone the discerning cognitive intellect that essentially exposes these two key leaders of the Igbo tribe, in the context of the endemic faux pas in their choices and preferences borne of narrow personal and at best, tribal promptings, in terms of their dialectical linkage to the conundrum prevalently etched for decades, with increasing virulence on the polity; of which the Igbos were to come out the worse, arising from the seminal outpourings of the blighted vision of their own leaders.  On this, the Ghanaian statesman of blessed memory, Joe Appiah remarked in his autobiography, in which he exposed Zik as the veritable fugleman providing the primeval irritant for the irruption of the anti-Yoruba racial hate, uncontrollably festering the general Igbo psyche.  Going down the lane of history, Appiah recalled the historic moment of the formation of Egbe Omo Oduduwa in London, and the conflagratory rhetorics immediately following on the heels, as Zik in the September 8 edition of the West African Pilot, thus issued the provocative cassus belli: “Henceforth, the cry must be one of the battles against Egbe Omo Oduduwa, its leaders at home and abroad, uphill and down dale, in the streets of Nigeria and in the streets of London and the residence of its advocates’.  According to Chinweizu, a notable Igbo intellectual, “the testimony from a Ghanaian, who for many years, was a member and president of W.A.S.U in London, should give Igbos pause about the version of the Igbo-Yoruba cold war they had accepted. The key point is that the Ibo Union had been in existence before the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was founded. Yet Zik declared war on Egbe Omo Oduduwa. Why? If it was because the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was not pan-Nigerian, then what of the pre-existing Ibo Union?”  “In other words, it wasn’t the Yorubas who introduced tribal unions and tribal politics into Nigeria but the Igbos. But whatever his reason, Zik was the one who declared war on the Yorubas; he was the aggressor”.  “With that aggression as background, the carpet-crossing becomes an understandable response to Zik’s declaration of war. If somebody who declared war on your people arrives to govern your homeland, what should your leaders do? Welcome him and let him govern, or drive him out by any means necessary? The carpet crossing accomplished just that, and Igbos following Zik, the instigator of the response, I commend the Yorubas for defending themselves against aggression”.  “Zik’s conduct is an example of how Igbos can act without thinking of how their actions might look to those their proposed action might adversely affect. That is a weakness Igbos should be on guard against and should work to eliminate by extra self-awareness and constant self-criticism.”  “For seven decades we have paid for Zik’s aggression against the Yorubas. The cold war, which Zik started, made it possible for the British to install the NPC in power in 1959 when Zik refused to join with Awo to form the federal government. He explained it away by alluding to his distrust of Awo that stemmed from the carpet-crossing affair. In other words, Zik is ultimately responsible for our disasters and oppression under the caliphate. But the pertinent issue at this time is that we, not the Yorubas, are responsible for the Yoruba-Igbo feud. We are not the innocent victims of Yoruba tribalism and hatred. That fact should inform our attitude in seeking reproach with the Yorubas, especially now that we need a Yoruba – Igbo alliance to help create conditions.”  Unlike Achebe, whose world-view horrifyingly begins and ends with a segregationist chauvinism of pan Igboism, to the extent that he would see nothing bad in Zik, Ojukwu, and the primitively untamed Onyeama, but rather a blanket sweep sentiment of everything good, while in the obverse, he will faint blink an eye, before taking Awolowo, the foremost heroic symbol, to the cleaners on sheer sentimental illogic, which exposes his grossly deficient intellect – Soyinka on the other hand, had more than sufficiently ample space to literally take the three-some to the hangers by virtue of their incredibly horrifying fumblings, sacrilegious deportments, and heretic rantings and vituperations; but he would rather not plow that path, borne of his magnanimous large-heartedness and unifying propensity.  Similarly, he had the discretion to take on Achebe and his demented, warped, infantile, and mediocre intellect, yet he would rather choose to lie low, actuated by sheer pacifist impulse and of course a macro-dimensional, all-encompassing vision of a united and indivisible Nigeria.  To be sure, as could not be too often repeated, Tinubu succeeded in lifting Lagos State to hitherto unprecedented eminence, thereby making it, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose progressive, dynamic, and pragmatic policies were emulated all over the federation.  In the libertarian struggle for democracy, he was prosiliently sui-generis as the hero of the struggle, as of course attested to, by the likes of Wole Soyinka, Colonel Nyiam, Dele Momodu, Kayode Fayemi, and even the Ayo Adebanjos, Abraham Adesanyas, Olanihun Ajayis among several others.  Besides, Asiwaju’s vast expanse of the network built over the years, coupled with his personal charms, mobilization, and organizational acumen, and his peculiar gift of the sixth sense, which his competitors could verily not match, are such rare but highly cherished treasures that money cannot buy.  But apart from the fact of his personal talent and endowment, is the law of Divine compensation, which is to say that Asiwaju is a man who had paid his dues.  As an arrowhead of NADECO’s struggle for democracy under the totalitarian fascism of General Sanni Abacha, Asiwaju’s heroic role in this regard, will as much, demand an entire voluminous book to do justice to.  Of course, it’s a generally acknowledged fact of history that, unlike the reactionary elements who would not give a damn in parleying with Abacha, Asiwaju refused to sell his conscience, but would rather negotiate a tedious journey to exile, despite the assurance by the management of Mobil, where he held forte as the Chief Treasurer, that he should not hesitate to retrace his step back to his plum job if his romance with politics appeared bleak.  Evidence abounds from the very horse mouth of people like Dele Momodu, Colonel Tony Nyiam, Kayode Fayemi, Bayo Onanuga, and co, as to the immense sacrifice which Asiwaju made in assisting financially disadvantaged exiles whom he quartered in his houses both in the U.K .and the U.S., and even assisted financially, with regards to their daily upkeep.  At least, Bayo Onanuga did not mince words in divulging Asiwaju’s benevolent gestures in permitting him to draw a regular allowance of hundreds of dollars weekly, from proceeds issued from Asiwaju’s Gas Station in Chicago.  Femi Ojudu, Osibajo’s Chief Campaign Man, similarly did reveal, how Asiwaju from his base in the U.S. was regularly remitting money for the payment of staff salary, and also for the daily running cost of PM NEWS and THE NEWS, at the harrowing moment when Abacha’s killer squad were let loose against the newspaper organization and its editorial staff.  Asiwaju did all these, despite the fact that he was not a shareholder in the organization. Rather, as a progressive politician and democrat to the core, he was solely fired by the zeal to boost the morale of the rank-and-file staff of the newspaper, in the struggle for democracy. The same thing Asiwaju did for TELL Magazine when things were direly so rough.  Similarly, Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, also narrated how at a point in time, as an exile in the U.S., Asiwaju embarked on the sale of Rice which involved a shuttle between Thailand and some African countries, while dedicating the proceeds from the business to the collective cause of the NADECO struggle.  Kayode Fayemi in his writings, also attested to this, in his remarks on how Asiwaju stretched his financial resources to the limit in the collective struggle for democracy.  The same incumbent governor of Ekiti State also narrated the crucial role that Asiwaju as a member of the Board of Trustees of NALICON, founded by Wole Soyinka, during that era in exile, played in encouraging and convincing the Olof Palme Foundation, based in Sweden, to assist NALICON with the urgently needed fund for the establishment of the Radio Station which subsequently contributed in no mean measure, to a formidable propaganda armada which attracted international condemnation that increasingly debilitated and devastated the defenses of the Abacha regime, making its eventual exit a matter of time, before the dramatic demise of the notorious military dictator.  At this juncture, the crucial point to be noted is that Asiwaju had barely spent two years as a senator before Abacha took over. In this circumstance, a lesser mind would have wallowed in regret, cursing the day he went into politics; and would surely not hesitate in retracing his step back to his plum job, or fall headlong in romance with Abacha, just like a huge lot of members of his political class actually kowtowed at that time, while throwing honor and principles to the dogs. To be sure, it was apparent that Asiwaju was not looking forward to any gains. Rather, his main point of satisfaction consists in the fact that it was a worthy struggle.  In a nutshell, this is the democracy we all enjoy today. How many people ever bordered to imagine, the valley of the shadow of death, Asiwaju passed through in his struggle for civilian governance which we are all enjoying today, and how many of us who knew, do indeed appreciate it?  All the political eaglets, neophytes, and nonstarters, including state governors who had hardly spent 100 days in office, to whom an Angel had appeared and handed them the divine mandate to be president overnight, including those of them that Asiwaju made, where were they at that harrowing moment when Asiwaju was leading the battle from the trenches, far away in exile? How many members of the political class, who would not like to see even Asiwaju’s shadow, ever knew or appreciate or remember, as the case may be, what Asiwaju went through in those days; the dastardly vandalization of his residence in Lagos and eight of his cars destroyed beyond repairs, the accusation that he wanted to plant a bomb at Ejigbo NNPC Depot, just because of his frontline involvement in the June 12 struggle, and how he escaped death by the whiskers by wangling through the borders of Benin Republic, for a harrowing life in exile?  Yet, Asiwaju never allowed his distinguished achievements in the struggle, to get into his head, through an overnight fancy for the presidency.  Reliable authority even had it that on arrival from exile, Asiwaju in his characteristic selflessness, had actually intended to go for a Senatorial seat, but Afenifere top-notchers at that time, prevailed upon him to head on for governorship.  For close to thirty years, after he had been in politics, Asiwaju had refrained from announcing any ambition for the presidency, rather, he had over the years, provided a platform for others like Falae, Atiku, Ribadu, Buhari, and Co; to run for the presidency, while in the process, risking his life, and everything dear to him, to accord them maximum support.  Imagine, for instance, the immense role he played in the formation of APC, which eventually provided the platform for the fructification of Buhari’s passionate presidential ambition after three previously failed attempts which on a particular occasion, publicly drew tearful pathos of lament from him. For this, Asiwaju was bugged by some morally suspect media which obviously had kowtowed for the bargain of settlement; yet he refused to budge, until his unflagging support, inspired Buhari to a roller-coaster ride to presidential victory.  As an eminent political figure, an accomplished veteran of the battle for political liberty, a courageous leader of the opposition, and an arrowhead of the progressive forces, coupled with the fact that Asiwaju commanded more States in his own regional constituency than any other politician could claim to command in their own respective regions, Asiwaju nevertheless conceded to Buhari.  Indeed in a more civilized clime, Asiwaju would have had no need to embark on any campaign spree or consultation. Rather, he would have been literally co-opted, without the slightest opposition, and with strong plea and persuasion too.  To be sure, people in Asiwaju’s class are rare. Not only is he an enigma, but an enigma within an enigma, the category that the Yorubas would describe as “Akanda Eeyan”. You can only toy with him at your own peril.  In all the geo-political Igbo-speaking states of the South-East, how many of Asiwaju’s contemporaries as state governors, command any conspicuity on the political radar, in astonishingly wide-berth comparison with Tinubu, who has continued to rise and rise like a meteor, to the enviable height which has deservedly earned him the treasurable eulogium of the ” Main Issue In Nigerian Politics”.  Imagine Igbos boasting that Lagos is no man’s land. Imagine the falsidical bunkum that they contributed the most in building Lagos. Why then do they not take recourse to their primordial native home and bring it to par with Lagos, after all, charity, they say, begins from home.  Familiar popular domiciles like Kaduna, Kano, and Abuja, are notable spots with beehive ubiquity of Igbos. In other words, Igbos are virtually etched on the minutest space in these places; yet they would only tread cautiously, and would never stretch their luck too far, contrary to their licentious spoilt sport brag in Lagos, cashing in on the traditional hospitality of Yorubas and Lagosians in particular, stretched more than ever before, during the Tinubu era – in the embrace of our Igbo brothers whom the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello would daub in the awry imagery of pathologically ungrateful usurpers.  All the excesses Igbos perpetrate in their host states, how many non-Igbos dare try an inch of that, in their own land, knowing Igbos for their characteristic hostile intolerance of non-Igbos in their own land?  When will Igbos rise above their genetically ingrained anti-yoruba hate and phobia, truculently unleashed this time around, on Soyinka and Tinubu, simply borne of their Leviathan stature and glowing distinction, waxing so discomfiting, dizzying, and unbearably unsettling in bewildering wide-breadth gap to their lilliputian frame.  The magnitude of hate words and outright rage of curses daily being unleashed on these great leaders of African continental and global renown by these over-zealous hordes of incurable anti-Yoruba Igbo haters, is not only amazing but simply unimaginable, in this civilized epoch of modernity. It is amazing that Tinubu’s innocent biological offsprings are not even spared on this celebrative savage haul of unremitting outright curses.  The same threat of searing hate words, they also unleashed on Sam Omatseye. In one of the finest pieces, ever written, the cerebral chairman, the editorial board of the NATION newspapers marshaled a forensic psychosis of primeval savage deportment of the Igbo mass behavior in the dotting voyage to electoral destiny, come 2023; as a ready revanche; ever latent in the Igbo mass sub-conscious driven by a cathartic vent of the Biafran frustration.  No, sooner had the publication greeted the public space, than all hell, literally let loose on the highly endowed writer, courtesy of the unabashed herd of bigots, putting his precious life on the hanger with all manner of threats; which in turn elicited an outcry, from the larger mass of the Omatseye clan, pleading that nothing must touch their son.  But here are the same herd of over-zealous pleasure bullies making so much fetish of their miniature political god-head, who like Napoleon, can never be wrong and therefore above any reproof, or else Amadiora the mythical god of thunder, will descend in terrimotive wrath on the accuser  It is amazing that over fifty years after the civil war, Igbos would simply refuse to let go, as they continuously let loose the subdued pang of their latent Biafran frustration and segregationist chauvinism of anti Tinubu-Soyinka-cum-Yoruba hatred expressed through their primitively effusive farrago of empty balderdash  Just because they saw Tinubu as their main obstacle to the garrison conquest of Lagos State and the totalitarian circumambience of the larger Nigerian frame. Dear Ndigbo, why embroiled in a battle you know you cannot win, with all your soaring din of loud, but ineffectual pleasure stunt of empty grandstanding? Come May 29, 2023, the great leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will surely keep faith with history.

"political coup","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Amudalavalasa"", ""AndhraPradesh"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T23:15:00","Harm biodiversity at our own peril  The International Biodiversity Day is celebrated worldwide on May 22 every year. Our India is very diverse in terms of flora and fauna. Our country is one of the 17 most diverse countries in the world. This variation has several advantages. But due to the selfish interests of some, the biodiversity of our country is at risk. Already some bird species, forest animals, animals and plants are entering the endangered list. Human survival has become dangerous due to this. Central and state governments should create awareness among people. Conservation of biodiversity is our responsibility.  J M R Dunga, Amadalavalasa  The term ‘Biodiversity’ means a wide variety of life found on earth. Biologically rich habitats and many species are now disappearing due to human activities and pollution, which is a grave concern. It is man’s duty to adopt environment-friendly practices which don’t interfere with nature and conserve various species. Mahatma Gandhi said “What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.”  TS Karthik, Chennai  Need for thorough probe into trading in Adani stocks  The Expert Committee constituted by the Supreme Court on Adani issue said it cannot, as of now, arrive at a finding of “regulatory failure” of SEBI in dealing with the alleged contravention of securities law by the Adani Group or any other companies. This kind of result, in corporate related controversies, is not a new thing for the people of India. Many previous findings like the Panama Papers had been swept under the carpet and the accused were allowed to move scot-free. The entire winter session of Parliament was washed away because of the ruckus that it witnessed. And the country suffered a lot due to the silence maintained by the government on the issue. A thorough investigation is a must to unravel the truth and make the markets confident.  G Thirupathaiah, Hyderabad  Rs 2000 withdrawal a move to trouble oppn  The RBI has announced withdrawal of Rs 2,000 denominations from circulation. One fails to understand the intention of the RBI move. Demonetisation of 2016 failed to achieve its intentions of cracking down on black money, and to choke finances to terrorists operating in the country. The move will not impact citizens as the 2016 demonetisation showed. Because, these times have seen physical currency become obsolete, with people depending on net transfers and money payment apps for transactions. But this move will definitely impact businesses which engage in transaction of big money.  Dr George Jacob, Kochi  A good number of economists opine that the RBI’s latest decision to take Rs 2,000 notes out of circulation can have a disruptive effect on the economy especially vis-a-vis small traders, farmers, and MSME. If the move is with a view to dealing with stash of black money and making it vanish, the number of hoarders will be very thin and negligible this time. Still, we are in a cryptic condition as to what we have achieved from the exercise in 2016. The objective of the government is still not clear, miserably.  E Sethuramalingam, Kollam  It is only the big businessmen and the politicians who are caught between a rock and a hard place. There is no doubt that the timing was a coup. BJP is still stung by the reverse in Karnataka and the government is aware of the coming state elections and their significance. Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh are slated to go for elections later this year and BJP is not very confident in at least three of the four states. What with anti-incumbency both in Madhya Pradesh and in Chhattisgarh, BJP wants to make things as difficult as possible for all the opposition parties including the Congress and the BRS. It is no secret that all political parties favour the Rs 2000/- note as the easiest way of doling out money to the voters. The politicians will be forced to bring out the black money and get it changed. Many political parties might see this as an opportunity and distribute the money right away. It could mean an early Dussehra or Diwali gift for the voters.  Dr M Anil Ramesh, Miyapur  A paper currency gets soiled on its exchange multiple times. Every paper currency has to either become anew or get completely extinct after a certain specified noumber of years. The RBI decision is to make it invisible and extinct. Rs 2,000 comes in handy while transacting huge volumes of cash. But as it perhaps has outlived its shelf life, it needs to be destroyed. The government could have decided to recycle it andprint brand new Rs 2,000 notes. This involves enormous expenditure. To avoid this, it has taken a decision to completely destroy the same.

"political coup","2021-02-01","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","2023-05-21T17:48:45","Senator may be on the verge of being prosecuted for money laundering and other offences if the country’s Attorney General gives the say-so following a decision on Friday by investigators to indict the upper house member on criminal charges.  Prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) have decided to indict a sitting Thai senator whose son-in-law was arrested in September last year accused of drug and money laundering offences, also on money laundering charges and other crimes, it was revealed on Friday. A decision must be made to go ahead with the prosecution by the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) by July 26th next with the upper house member, Senator Upakit Pachariyangkun, strongly vowing his innocence in the matter and suggesting that the investigation of his affairs is politically motivated.  The announcement was made by Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) spokesman Kosolwat Inthuchanyong on Friday and follows weeks of reviewing evidence in the case by police investigators and prosecutors assigned to it.  The file on the matter has now been passed to the Attorney-General Ms Naree Tanthasathien, the first female to hold the position, who will decide on whether to proceed with the prosecution before July 26th.  Senator Upakit Pachariyangkun is to be indicted for money laundering and other criminal charges which have not yet been clarified.  Senator met with investigators at the end of March when key allegations in the case were put to him  At the end of March this year, Senator Upakit met with officials and investigators at the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) reviewing the case against him and vehemently denied that there were any grounds for charges that were put to him by investigators.  That case was handed over by a Metropolitan Police Bureau task force by order of the National Police Commissioner General Damrongsak Kittiprapas on the basis that it was properly the domain of the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) since it involved activities outside the jurisdiction of the state.  Senator Upakit subsequently submitted further information to the office complaining about difficulties his company network was having as a result of the ongoing enquiries and probe by authorities particularly into the provision of electricity services to customers outside the kingdom in Myanmar.  Case linked to arrest of the senator’s son-in-law and Myanmar tycoon Tun Min Latt in September 2022 charged with drug and money laundering offences  The news comes after strenuous denials by the upper house member who has suggested that the pursuit of the case by police may have a political motive.  The case is understood to be linked to a controversial arrest warrant sought and obtained for a senior unidentified official on October 3rd 2022 at the instigation of a police officer at the head of a drug suppression task force within the Metropolitan Police Bureau only to have it be cancelled hours later.  A subsequent police internal investigation into whether proper procedures were followed, against the officer who requested the rescinded warrant, was set up at the same time as the case against the senator was handed to the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG).  The revelations caused Senator Upakit to issue defamation proceedings against outgoing MP Rangsiman Rome of the Move Forward Party for ฿100 million.  A press conference in mid-March heard the senator strenuously and emotionally deny any involvement with money laundering, drugs or transnational crime.  Move Forward Party’s Rangsiman Rome has been at the centre of allegations surrounding this matter and the subject of court defamation proceedings  Mr Rangsiman was also criticised by senior officials of the United Thai Nation (Ruam Thai Sang Chart) Party aligned with Prime Minister Prayut Chan ocha when he raised the fact that Senator Upakit owned the land on which the party’s headquarters have been based since August 2022 during a debate on the outgoing government in parliament and called for the circumstances surrounding the ongoing case to be investigated.  This came about after Senator Upakit’s son-in-law, 38-year-old Mr Dean Young Gultula, the husband of the senator’s daughter Adisara, was arrested in September 2022 and later appeared in court in December 2022 under heavy security charged with similar offences along with Myanmar tycoon and junta business associate Tun Min Latt.  ฿200 million in assets seized and frozen after police raids in Bangkok in September linked with Myanmar’s Tun Min Latt and senator’s son-on-law  The choreographed raids were part of an operation mounted by the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) and the Metropolitan Police Bureau in which over ฿200 million in assets were seized or frozen.  Senator Upakit has consistently denied any links with that case but it is understood police and prosecutors are investigating the use of a network of companies to channel the proceeds of criminal activity while the company network also has links to Thailand’s electricity generation industry.  Evidence linking the Myanmar conglomerate tycoon and junta associated with family members of Myanmar’s dictator and strongman Min Aung Hlaing  There was evidence discovered in September and in the course of this investigation including surveillance, showing links between Mr Tun Min Latt and family members of Myanmar’s de facto dictator and strongman General Min Aung Hlaing currently fighting a civil war with a growing majority of that country’s population supporting a progressively more violent revolt since February 2021 when the military toppled the elected government there in a coup d’état.  The senator, if a decision is ultimately made to prosecute him, faces extraordinary punishment from the courts because of his unique position of responsibility.  Under Thailand’s Transnational Criminal Organisation Act 2013, if convicted, he will face twice the normal penalty for the offences.  Electricity supply to the gambling mecca of Tachileik  In March, an emotional Senator Upakit insisted on his innocence. He explained that his affairs and business interests were quite complex.  Senator Upakit has never denied that he was known to Mr Tun Min Latt who he has described as an honest and honourable businessman in his own experience.  However, he denied the ties were close after the Burmese man’s arrest in September 2022.  The two are understood to be involved in an electricity supply business which has a relationship across Thailand’s border with Myanmar particularly concerning the supply of power to the notorious Myanmar gambling and nightlife mecca of Tachileik, an urban centre near theThai border.  Nonetheless, Senator Upakit is adamant he was never involved in illicit activities or transactions linked with the Myanmar tycoon now held on remand in a Thai prison.  In March, he told reporters that if he had been able to wield undue influence because of his position as a senator, his son-in-law would not have been arrested by police.

"political coup","2022-09-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T05:01:00","This story was originally published by Grist, and in partnership with HuffPost. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.  Stewart Rhodes, the infamous leader of the anti-government Oath Keeper militia, was standing on a street in Conroe, Texas, a city about 40 miles north of Houston. The sky was clear blue, but remnants of darker days were everywhere. Residents were shoveling up splintered lumber and debris. A boy holding a broom was halfheartedly scooping lawn scraps into a garbage bag a few feet away from where Rhodes was conducting an on-camera interview.  A Category 4 hurricane named Harvey had just dumped feet, not inches, of water on the state, sparking one of the most expensive disasters in United States history. The scale of the damage was so vast that the then-director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, put out a request for volunteers. “We need citizens to be involved,” he said on August 28, 2017, a few days after the storm struck Texas. The Oath Keepers answered the call.  Rhodes was wearing an Oath Keepers cap and T-shirt. He was there with another Oath Keeper, the organization’s Southeast regional assistant coordinator, Alex Oakes. The men were interviewing Beau Sullivan, a Conroe local who had been organizing hurricane relief efforts after the storm.  “Thank you, gentlemen, for coming out here,” Sullivan said, shaking Rhodes’ and Oakes’ hands. “You know, normally y’all gotta be a little more brass tacks, but y’all come out here with a message of love this time, and camaraderie, and I really appreciate that. That’s what’s needed now in this rebuilding effort.”  #Pennsylvania #OathKeepers Signups: 1499 (TX most 3301)  Elected Officials: 4 (TX most 8)  Law Enforcement: 19 (NY most 45)  Military: 8 (VA most 15)  First Responders: 3 (IL most 10)  Read @ADL's The Oath Keepers Data Leak: Unmasking Extremism in Public Life https://t.co/I7WUd99YT5 pic.twitter.com/1pF6bPAEw5 — BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) September 7, 2022  The exchange, captured on video and disseminated by the Oath Keepers on AltCensored, a right-wing alternative to YouTube, neatly distills why a group mainly preoccupied with uncovering made-up evidence of government tyranny might participate in hurricane relief efforts: It wins people over.  For nearly a decade, the Oath Keepers — which formed in 2009 in the wake of Barack Obama’s election to the presidency — have responded to disasters like hurricanes and floods by administering rescue operations, serving hot meals, and doing construction work. Disasters provide the Oath Keepers with opportunities to fundraise and gain the trust of people who might not otherwise be sympathetic to their anti-government cause. By arriving to crisis zones before federal agencies do, the Oath Keepers take advantage of bureaucratic weaknesses, holding a hand out to people in desperate circumstances.  This all serves to reinforce the militia members’ conviction that the government is fallible, negligent, and not to be trusted. And every time a new person sees the Oath Keepers as the helpers who respond when the government does not, it helps build the group’s fledgling brand.  The group has been in disarray since some of its leaders and most active members, including Rhodes, were arrested, tried, and convicted for their participation in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021. Facing public backlash and social media bans, the Oath Keepers have retreated from the public sphere. For a time, they took down their website and stopped gathering in public. But the retreat has been short-lived. “Militia groups are finding some footing again,” said Hampton Stall, a research specialist at Princeton University who runs a watchdog site called MilitiaWatch. “2023 will be the year they start to reactivate.”  #BucksCounty #PA01's far-right are flying all-black American flags. The flag means ""no quarter given"" and implies a willingness to use (lethal) violence against perceived enemies: liberals. Spoke w/ @AmyCooter to make sense of this troubling development. https://t.co/SCXU18qM7O — Cyril Mychalejko (@cmychalejko) October 27, 2021  The first phase of an Oath Keepers remobilization is taking place in Chino Valley, Arizona. A man named Jim Arroyo, the former state vice president for the Arizona Oath Keepers chapter — the group’s largest state contingent to date — is on a mission to rebrand his chapter as a disaster assistance organization. His group, which he has registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is called the Yavapai County Preparedness Team, named after the county it’s based in. Arroyo is fond of calling the outfit, known as YCPT, a “nonviolent, apolitical, nonpartisan” organization.  “Our main issue is disaster preparedness,” he told Grist, an assertion local officials and others in Arizona have taken at face value. But that’s not the full story. The fringe group is trying to ride the coattails of disaster preparation and relief work into the mainstream, experts told Grist. Its success thus far hints at a frightening post-disaster outcome in a warming world: What happens if the government fails to show up and communities start to rely on the extremists next door?  Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers on the premise that a violent clash between American citizens and the United States government wasn’t just possible, it was inevitable. Rhodes subscribes to the far-fetched notion that the government is conspiring to strip its citizens of their rights and force them to participate in a “new world order” defined by a “tyrannical, globalist, and socialist one-world government.” Fear of government tyranny isn’t a new concept; it’s one of the tenets upon which this nation was founded.  Anti-government militias are a key part of the so-called patriot movement, a loose coalition of nationalistic and often violent far-right groups. The Oath Keepers recruit current and former members of the military, first responders, and law enforcement. Like other sects of the patriot movement, the Oath Keepers are overwhelmingly white, but otherwise they look and act differently than many of their allies.  “They live much more on the side of the spectrum that wants mainstream political legitimacy,” Sam Jackson, a University of Albany professor and the author of Oath Keepers: Patriotism and the Edge of Violence in a Right-Wing Antigovernment Group, told Grist. “One of the ways that Oath Keepers has done this is by trying to portray itself as a civic organization.”  In 2013, Rhodes launched a program aimed at preparing communities for a natural disaster, a civil war, or anything in between. He originally said the program — a national network of community groups akin to neighborhood watches — was intended to create “civilization preservation teams.” He soon gave them a far more innocuous-sounding new name: “community preparedness teams,” or CPTs. CPTs provide volunteers with medical, disaster, and fire safety training. As the Oath Keepers grew, changed, and increasingly made themselves known in the public sphere, the CPT program remained a relative constant — something “the group seems to view as core to its identity,” Jackson wrote in his book.  The CPTs kept their eye on events with potential for conflict with government agencies. In 2014, they responded to Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s call to arms, after he refused to pay federal land management agencies millions of dollars in required fees to graze his herd of cattle on public land. They defended a gold mine from the Bureau of Land Management in Oregon in 2015. They were present that same year in Ferguson, Missouri, providing security, according to the group, for business owners during widespread protests on the anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager who was killed by police in 2014. And they provided relief in Conroe after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in 2017.  That year saw the dawn of a new era for FEMA. Harvey and two other hurricanes called Irma and Maria made landfall on U.S. soil in the same 30-day period, claiming thousands of lives, causing widespread destruction, and generating hundreds of billions of dollars in cumulative costs. The back-to-back disasters made it exceedingly clear that the federal government is unprepared for the consequences of climate change — more intense hurricanes, heavier floods, rising sea levels.

Experts say that federal lawmakers, who decide how much funding FEMA gets every year, lack the foresight required to actually prepare for climate change. Instead, disaster management centers around response, which means FEMA is constantly playing a game of catch-up.  The agency’s shortcomings leave gaps for militias to step in. Teams of Oath Keepers moved into Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico in the wake of the 2017 trio of hurricanes. They showed up again in Florida in 2018 after Hurricane Michael struck the state. Leaked Oath Keeper chats, shared with Grist by the nonprofit watchdog group Distributed Denial of Secrets, show that members of the group put out a call for volunteers following a damaging outbreak of tornadoes in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee in the spring of 2021.  It’s not just the Oath Keepers. Armed vigilantes reportedly set up roadblocks and interrogated people fleeing wildfires in Oregon in 2020; a different militia tried to recruit people affected by the Oak Fire in central California last summer. “Disaster relief in this country is pretty broken because of the way it often takes months to get federal funding activated,” Stall said. “There’s a long time during which groups can often get active.”  And FEMA’s large-scale efforts to help communities in the aftermath of disasters inadvertently provide these groups with fodder for their conspiracy theories. When a hurricane hits, FEMA goes to work building out a massive network of field camps, relief stations, and other physical infrastructure that makes the work of disaster aid possible. Where the unindoctrinated might see logistics at work, the far right sees a sinister plot unfolding.  “There’s a long-standing conspiracy theory among the far right that everything that FEMA does is dual use,” Jackson said. “It has this surface-level purpose of responding to emergencies and disasters and all that kind of stuff. But also it’s building up the infrastructure so that one day when martial law is declared, there are these huge detention camps and there are deployed resources to be used by troops who are enforcing martial law.”  Many Oath Keepers subscribe to that belief, but they’re not vocal about it. Publicly, Jackson said, they portray themselves as supplementing FEMA’s efforts and even working in tandem with the agency. It’s part and parcel of the group’s founding ethos — understand the system, work within the system, and be prepared to defeat the system when the time comes.  If there’s one thing Jim Arroyo, leader of the Yavapai County Preparedness Team, understands, it’s how the system works. The 62-year-old gunsmith trained as an army ranger in the early 1980s, regularly volunteers with the Chino Valley Police Department, and assists his county’s local emergency management program, in addition to serving as the Arizona chapter vice president for the Oath Keepers for several years starting in 2014. Arroyo insists that neither his organization nor the Oath Keepers qualify as militias, and he vehemently rejects accusations that the Oath Keepers are in any way anti-government.  “That’s completely stupid,” he told Grist. “We are the government.”  Grist reached Arroyo on his landline in mid-March. He answered questions with occasional coaching from his wife Janet, who helps him run YCPT. In 2022, as the groups that stormed the U.S. Capitol confronted mounting legal and social repercussions, Arroyo officially broke ties with Oath Keepers national. He says his chapter is no longer in contact with the larger organization or Stewart Rhodes. But he still puts up the Oath Keeper flag at meetings and sports branded Oath Keeper gear.  “We still believe in the mission of the Oath Keepers,” Arroyo said, though he admitted that his efforts to partner with local governments outside of Arizona since the Capitol insurrection have been difficult due to his association with the organization. For the time being, he’s focused on building YCPT into a national network. “At this stage of the game, our mission is to train individuals,” he said. He declined to say what he aims to do with the group in the future, but the YCPT website claims the group has outposts in 14 U.S. states and three countries — Canada, Panama, and the U.K.  Arroyo offers YCPT attendees training in person and via Zoom twice a month. He lectures in front of a large banner that lists some of the threats the group says it’s focused on mitigating: fires, floods, food shortages, and economic collapse, to name a few. Many of the trainings focus on skills that come in handy during natural disasters — like contacting people by radio in the event that internet and cellular networks break down, or administering CPR and other emergency medical procedures. Topics have also included how to prepare for electrical outages, plant a garden, and keep warm in freezing conditions.  But the group isn’t just preparing for hurricanes and floods; it’s getting ready for war. In fact, that’s the bulk of the “preparedness” work it’s doing. Though the YCPT website makes it seem like the organization is primarily focused on teaching participants basic survival skills, recordings of the group’s monthly general meetings make it clear that YCPT’s agenda goes far beyond those mainstream offerings. At every meeting, Arroyo invites a guest to give a lecture or offers one himself, an Oath Keeper cap perched on his graying head and a handgun holstered to his hip.  At one recent meeting, a self-described information warfare officer and retired Army lieutenant colonel named Steven Murray preached a potent cocktail of misinformation. “Trans, gay, transhumanist agendas” were infiltrating the public sphere. China had undermined every office in Arizona’s government, and the sovereignty of Yavapai County had been “transferred” to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will ultimately “usurp the constitution.” FEMA had built a “containment” camp in Arizona, he said. “That should bother everybody in this room.” Each point Murray made was aimed at inspiring action. “Our job now is to resist,” he said, “to outthink, outsmart, and out-act our enemy.”  The next guest, the head of YCPT’s security team, taught attendees how to build their own tripwires, decoys, and booby traps. One mechanism, a tripwire that makes a loud noise to scare off intruders, requires a shotgun blank, he said. “It doesn’t have to be a blank,” a member of the crowd shouted.  Arroyo later warned the group about the legal consequences of putting a live cartridge in a trip alarm. But he closed out the meeting with a warning about the “police state,” which he said controls elements within federal, state, and local law enforcement as well as the media, corporations, and the court system. Those entities, he claimed, are preparing to attack. “I’m getting prepared for the inevitable,” Arroyo said. “We’re already engaged in the preliminaries before we get ready to go full kinetic.”  Arroyo told Grist that YCPT’s goal isn’t to teach people how to participate in a civil war. “Face it,” Arroyo said, “the vast majority of our people here are in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. We are not teaching them to fight in a war. We’re teaching them how to survive it.”  YCPT has the idea “that there will be some eventual moment when they are going to need particular skills,” said Rachel Goldwasser, a research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center who studies the Oath Keepers and has kept track of YCPT meetings. “There’s going to come a day when the government is going to go, essentially, full tyrant.” According to Arroyo, that day isn’t too far off.  YCPT’s political arm, a group called the Lions of Liberty, staked out ballot dropboxes in Arizona last November as early voters submitted their ballots. Arroyo told Grist that he organized the surveillance effort in Yavapai County, and said “there is overlap” between the groups. “People who are Oath Keepers or people who come to the YCPT trainings and meetings also attend the Lions of Liberty meetings.” The unauthorized surveillance came to a halt after roughly a week when the League of Women Voters of Arizona sued the Lions of Liberty for violating the Voting Rights Act.  Arroyo told Grist that he believes that the world’s economic systems are on the verge of collapse, that unnamed attackers might disable U.S. power grids with an electromagnetic pulse, that the U.S. has already entered a civil war, and that the globe is in the first phase of a third world war. Unlike his guest speaker, Arroyo says he doesn’t believe that FEMA is currently planning to imprison Americans in its camps, though he told Grist he does think FEMA could overstep its authority at some point down the line.  “Governments all the time can do crazy things,” he said.

Arroyo said that between 100 and 150 people regularly show up to his gatherings. Goldwasser and other experts who track these meetings confirmed they’re well attended. Republican candidates running for seats in Arizona’s House of Representatives, Senate, attorney general’s office, and Department of Education have spoken at YCPT meetings. In 2022, Eli Crane, a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, spoke at a meeting. He subsequently ousted the Democratic incumbent in the midterm elections. An Arizona state representative, Quang Nguyen, has been a guest speaker at least three times. Mitch Padilla, candidate for local justice of the peace, spoke at a YCPT meeting before winning his 2022 race. Multiple current and prospective county sheriffs have given speeches.  For attendees, the risks are minimal. Though YCPT meetings are fueled by conspiracy theories, the organization has a harmless name and isn’t bogged down by the controversy surrounding the national Oath Keepers organization. That may allow the group to expand its reach in coming years.  “There is a gap now and a vacuum where Oath Keepers was,” said Goldwasser, who thinks Arroyo will hoover up Oath Keepers who have been standing idly by as the national organization’s leadership has splintered apart.  Disasters are already chaotic. Adding in teams of armed volunteers, jacked up on conspiracy theories about the government, civil unrest, and global war, adds an unpredictable dimension to already complicated and flawed state and federal relief efforts. “The vast majority of Oath Keeper beliefs and activities are still embodied in YCPT,” Goldwasser said. “Even if Arroyo doesn’t agree with an all-out coup attempt, the things he might agree to that are dangerous, that are intimidating, that are potentially in conflict with the government, those still exist.”  Some well-established relief groups, like the Red Cross, might link up with the Yavapai County Preparedness Team without realizing it’s a spinoff of the Oath Keepers, Goldwasser said.  And then, of course, there’s the matter of who, exactly, these groups are targeting for disaster assistance.  It’s hard to say how these older, majority white veterans and other volunteers currently think about the communities they aim to provide disaster assistance to, but in the past, Jackson said, Oath Keeper relief missions have focused on helping predominantly white communities. “They’re focusing on the suburbs, and they’re seeing the inner city as a source of problems and threats that need to be patrolled rather than people that need help.” FEMA has faced persistent criticism for shortchanging minorities and low-income Americans in its relief efforts. If the Oath Keepers bring racist bias to their disaster recovery work, it could make disasters even more dangerous for communities of color.  Arroyo disputes the idea that his group discriminates. “We’ve got transgenders in our organization, we’ve got members of the LGBTQ community, we’ve had Democrats come in and participate in our training,” Arroyo said. “The narrative that the Oath Keepers are white nationalist, white supremacist, that’s a false statement.”  As the planet warms, more calamities will strike the U.S. and, if the recent past is any indication, create new opportunities for militias and other extremist groups to mobilize and recruit. But researchers have been examining productive counter-extremist messaging methods for decades now, and experts told Grist they see a few interventions that could limit militias’ power during natural disasters.  Brian Hughes, co-founder of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University, said his group has had success using credible messengers — a trusted community group, a loved one, or an authority figure — to teach potential recruitment targets to avoid being manipulated by extremists. Those targets are people who are disillusioned with the “system” or simply have too much time on their hands. “We try to reach people as early in the radicalization process as possible and ideally even before it begins,” he said.  Hughes has had success experimenting with a technique called “pre-bunking,” a mix of media literacy and counter-propaganda education. The method teaches people how to recognize extremist recruitment tactics and reject them on sight. “You can say something like, ‘If somebody is telling you a story that sounds like they’re saying you need to stockpile guns because society is going to collapse, there’s a good chance this person is representing an extremist group or an extremist point of view,’” Hughes said. His lab’s research has shown that people who have been pre-bunked are less likely to find extremist messaging credible and are more likely to develop their own counterarguments against it.

Many states have laws on the books that prohibit private militias from operating, but most state attorneys general don’t enforce them. In fact, some states are trending in the opposite direction. Idaho lawmakers recently passed a law that repeals legislation prohibiting militias and paramilitary activity.  “The states seem reticent” to enforce anti-militia laws, “and some states don’t even know that they can utilize this,” Goldwasser said. “But it’s something that is absolutely necessary moving forward.”  Stall is particularly heartened by organizations that enlist retired law enforcement and veterans — the same groups targeted by the Oath Keepers — to do relief work while ditching the heavy dose of extremist ideology. Team Rubicon, a humanitarian organization headquartered in California, recruits veterans, first responders, and other volunteers to help communities prepare for and recover from disasters. The group has built out a network of 150,000 volunteers, half of whom are veterans, and conducted some 1,500 missions in its 13 years of operation. Art delaCruz, Team Rubicon’s CEO and a veteran himself, told Grist that the organization’s work in disaster zones helps make the transition from soldier to civilian easier for its volunteers.  “I like to say that military veterans and people who have retired out of law enforcement or fire departments, whatever it might be, you have muscles that you’ve built up over the years and you love to use them,” delaCruz said. “The ability to use those muscles in a manner that’s meaningful is really, really powerful.”  Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

"political coup","2019-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-21T14:00:18","Award-winning journalist and filmmaker Hopewell Chin’ono says the galloping inflation Zimbabwe is currently experiencing has been caused by bad Government policies.  According to Zimbabwe Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT), the year-on-year inflation rate for the month of April 2023 as measured by the all items Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 75.2%.  However, American economist Steve Hanke recently said Zimbabwe’s annual inflation stands at 666%.  Posting on Twitter, Chin’ono said President Emmerson Mnangagwa should address the economic fundamentals that are not sound for the economy to function. He wrote:  What I know is that the inflation that Zimbabwe is experiencing at the moment has been caused by terrible and misguided Government policies.  We predicted that this would happen as far back as 2019, this is not rocket science but just common sense.  Using Government draconian decrees on economics will have only one outcome, EMPTY shelves like in 2007/2008.  President Mnangagwa and his regime must stop the State corruption, stop the looting of public funds and stop the plunder of the country’s natural resources which is happening on their watch!  He should stop the abuse of the central bank by ZANU PF political elites and their surrogates, something which has been ongoing since he took office.  He needs to allow good economic policies to be implemented, and not interfere with the running of the central bank.  He should hire or employ competent people hired on the basis of their competence, and NOT party affiliation or ethnicity!  This is just good old common sense! Is he able to do that?  He has failed to do so every day of his life as President of Zimbabwe since the 2017 coup.  All I can say is that political or presidential decrees don’t work, fix the economic fundamentals first!  Since it is a Sunday, I would say he needs to read Mathew chapter 6 verse 33.  It says; “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”  It means if you do your part to make your relationship with God your highest priority, He will do His part to provide for your every need, and that is something we can count on.  In Economics, it means; Implement the fundamentals of economics and you will get results as the economy responds to the fundamentals.  The purpose of work is to increase wealth, and the wealth of a country can only be increased if the leadership of that country understands the covenant of economic fundamentals, and follow them.  The President can shout all he wants from the top of a hill, but if the economic fundamentals are wrong, the economy will not hear, fear or respond to his shouting.  The Herald can write as many propaganda articles as it wants, but the economy will be headed to oblivion regardless.  The inflation this week is at 666%, and the Black Market rate is now at 4 000.  You can’t use button sticks (batons), the police Law and Order section or captured magistrates and jails to force an economy to do as you wish!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbmR1bGEuY28uencvMjAyMy8wNS8yMS9kcmFjb25pYW4tZGVjcmVlcy1vbi1lY29ub21pY3Mtd2lsbC1yZXN1bHQtaW4tZW1wdHktc2hvcC1zaGVsdmVzLWNoaW5vbm8td2FybnMtZ292dC_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5waW5kdWxhLmNvLnp3LzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvZHJhY29uaWFuLWRlY3JlZXMtb24tZWNvbm9taWNzLXdpbGwtcmVzdWx0LWluLWVtcHR5LXNob3Atc2hlbHZlcy1jaGlub25vLXdhcm5zLWdvdnQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1799-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T03:33:59","​ For the last two years, the world has been restricted to homes. Daily activities that couldn’t be managed without stepping out, came indoors all at once — from office to grocery shopping and schools. As the world accepts the new normal, News18 launches weekly classes for school children, explaining key chapters with examples from happenings around the world. While we try to simplify your subjects, a request to break down a topic can be tweeted @news18dotcom  The French Revolution was a period of social and political upheaval that occurred in France from 1789 to 1799. This revolution had a profound impact on the course of modern history, and it is widely considered one of the most paramount events in Europe. The French Revolution was a turning point in European history and marked the end of the Old Regime and the beginning of a new era of political thought and social reform that influenced the rest of the world. It also had a significant impact on the arts, literature, and culture of the time.  In this week’s class with News18, we are discussing the French Revolution and the three most important events that shaped it.  The French Revolution began in 1789 with the meeting of the Estates-General, a legislative body made up of representatives from the three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The commoners, who made up the vast majority of the population, demanded more representation and greater political power. When their demands were rejected by the other two estates, they formed the National Assembly and vowed to write a new constitution for France.  The Storming of the Bastille  The Storming of the Bastille marked the beginning of the French Revolution and is widely regarded as the most crucial event of the time. The storming took place on July 14, 1789, when a group of Parisians stormed the Bastille prison, which was a symbol of the French monarchy’s power. The Bastille was also known to house political prisoners, and its fall was seen as a victory for the people against the oppressive regime.  The Storming of the Bastille inspired people all over France to join the revolution and overthrow the monarchy. The fall of the Bastille also led to the formation of the National Assembly, which drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, a document that established the basic principles of democracy and human rights.  The Reign of Terror  The Reign of Terror was a period of extreme violence and political repression that occurred during the French Revolution. It began in 1793 when the Committee of Public Safety, led by Maximilien Robespierre, gained control of the government and lasted a whole year. Robespierre led the Jacobin club, whose membership was largely composed of people from the less affluent segments of society. However, his government implemented regulations that resulted in the rationing of food, and policies of severe control that were rigorously enforced leading even his followers to call for moderation. The Reign of Terror was characterised by mass executions of those suspected of opposing the revolution. It is estimated that over 16,000 people were executed during this period.  The Reign of Terror was an important event because it demonstrated the radicalisation of the French Revolution. It showed how the ideals of the revolution could be corrupted by those who sought to use violence to achieve their goals. The Reign of Terror also led to the downfall of Robespierre and the end of the radical phase of the revolution.  The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte  Napoleon Bonaparte was a military general who rose to power during the French Revolution. He became a hero of the revolution by leading successful military campaigns that expanded French territory and defeated its enemies. In 1799, he seized power in a coup and established himself as the First Consul of France. He eventually crowned himself the emperor of France in 1804.  Napoleon’s rise to power was a critical event because it marked the end of the radical phase and brought stability and prosperity to France after years of turmoil. He also introduced a series of reforms, including the Napoleonic Code. The Napoleonic Code, also known as the French Civil Code, established a uniform legal system throughout France, replacing the patchwork of laws that had existed before the Revolution. It codified civil law, including property rights, contracts, and family law, and introduced many new legal principles, such as the notion of equality before the law.  However, Napoleon’s rule was also marked by a series of costly wars that ultimately led to his downfall. His invasion of Russia in 1812 was a disastrous defeat that weakened his hold on power. In 1815, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later.  top videos  In conclusion, the French Revolution was a defining moment in European history, characterised by a series of significant events that carved the course of modern history and its legacy can still be seen in modern political and social structures.

"political coup","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T15:27:00","“Most Americans will be shocked to learn that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.” –Professor Lance deHaven Smith in his 2013 book Conspiracy Theory in America; emphasis in original  “Thus the conspiracy-theory label has become a powerful smear that, in the name of reason, civility, and democracy, preempts public discourse, reinforces rather than resolves disagreements, and undermines popular vigilance against abuses of power. Put in place in 1967 by the CIA, the term continues to be a destructive force in American politics.” – Professor Lance deHaven Smith, 2013  The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, coordinated by the CIA and Mossad, is a watershed, not just in U.S. history. It is a watershed in twentieth century history and its evil effects continue with increasing intensification as the first quarter of the twenty-first century nears its end. The assassination was a coup d’état aimed at capturing the White House and ensuring that all future occupants of the White House shall follow the dictates of the wealthiest families on the planet.  The great Eustace Mullins was spot on when he wrote: “Few Americans can grasp the disturbing fact that the governing power in the United States is not a governing agency, or laws or political parties. Rather it is the power of the Assassins, those behind the scene figures who have the power to order the assassination of anyone whom they can no longer control. We have seen two Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, assassinated because they ordered the Treasury of the United States to print non-interest-bearing dollar bills, a development which threatened to deprive the international bankers of billions of dollars in unearned interests.”  The CIA is one of the arms of these banking families, which have a share in every major business and industry, including the military industry. The Western mainstream media, “presstitutes”, as Paul Craig Roberts names it, is a propaganda arm of these families. The media serves only to prevent the public from finding out the truth and to stifle discussion on genuine questions that bother the public mind.  The CIA has had a longstanding program of controlling the entire mainstream media. It started as Operation Mocking Bird in the early 1950s, and has now spread its tentacles worldwide, with “leading” journalists and media persons, not just the in the U.S., but in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, on the CIA payroll. This has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the rebel German journalist Udo Ulfkotte in his German book translated in 2019 as Presstitutes: Embedded in the Pay of the CIA. Ulfkotte, who himself was on the CIA payroll, died at age 57. There are question marks surrounding his death.  When John Kennedy was assassinated, the assassins ensured that, in contravention of Texas law, no autopsy would be carried out at the Dallas Parkland Hospital. It was also ensured that no police investigation, as required by law, would be carried out. Instead a Commission, known as the Warren Commission, was set up to investigate the crime! It was studded with those who had either planned the murder or worked for the planners of the murder.  Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested within 90 minutes of the assassination and was charged with the murder. This was despite the fact that a nitrate test given to him on that very day showed that Oswald had not fired a gun in the past 24 hours! For ten months this explosive information was kept hidden and never made it to the mainstream media. The media, generally, propagated the theory that Oswald was a lone gunman who had shot Kennedy and there was no conspiracy. The Warren Commission report reiterated this fraudulent thesis. As early as December 1963 the lawyer Mark Lane had written to Chief Justice Earl Warren to allow legal representation for Oswald. Within four weeks of the assassination Mark Lane published an article in the National Guardian with the title “Oswald Innocent? A Lawyer’s Brief”. He challenged the Dallas county District Attorney who held Oswald responsible for the murder.  The Warren Commission Report came out at the end of September 1964. Once the Warren Commission Report had been made public, criticisms of the report began. Soon books challenging the lone gunman theory made their appearance. Mark Lane, the lawyer, was among the very first to question the official narrative. His book Rush to Judgement, a critique of the Warren Commission Report came out in 1966 and became a bestseller. By 1966 at least three books questioning the lone gunman theory had appeared. And as the criticisms gained ground the CIA stepped in quietly.  A memo dated April 1, 1967, entitled: “Countering Criticisms of the Warren Report” was sent to all field offices of the CIA. This document, identified as CIA document number 1035-960, was released in September 1976, as a result of a Freedom of Information lawsuit. The memo opens as follows: “1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy’s assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility of the murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report, various writers now have had time to scan the Commission’s published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission’s findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission’s report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled though the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.”  The opening paragraph shows that that CIA was very concerned that the suspicion of a conspiracy in the JFK assassination was gaining ground in the public mind. Why would the CIA be concerned unless it was itself involved in the conspiracy and feared exposure? The document goes on to mention that “This trend of opinion is a matter of concern for the U.S. government and our organization.” The memo also states that President Johnson being the beneficiary is also suspected of “in some way being responsible for the assassination.” It also states “Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us.” It is now established that Oswald worked for the CIA.  The memo then comes to the point. “The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit circulation of such claims in other countries.” Point number 3 of the memo is titled “Action.” It includes a total of seven suggestions (a-g) on how to tackle criticisms of the Warren Commission. It suggests that CIA officers discuss the publicity problem with “friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors)” and tell them that the Warren Commission had done a thorough job, “that the charges of critics are without serious foundation, and further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition.”  The CIA memo then injects a damaging suggestion or false innuendo against those who question the official narrative. “Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk are deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.” In the post-McCarthy, post-Bay-of-Pigs era the charge of being linked to Communists was something highly damaging to anyone questioning the Warren Commission report. Questioning the official version has been dubbed “unfounded and irresponsible speculation” and thus dismissed.  The CIA memo goes on: “To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.” The memo suggests: “Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (II) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories.” One may note that the memo uses the word “ploy”. This clearly shows that the CIA was not interested in the truth but in obfuscating the search for truth by attacking those seeking it!  Dr. Richard Crenshaw, who was present in Trauma Room One at the Dallas Parkland Hospital, and who, through his books since 1992, has exposed the medical cover-up of the JFK assassination, has made important observations on the CIA memo. He writes: “Notice the memo instructs recipients of the memo to ‘provide material’, utilize ‘editors’, employ ‘propaganda assets,’ and use ‘feature articles’ in countering the critics.” Dr. Crenshaw notes further: “Notice also that the attack is to be directed toward the Warren Commission critic and his motive rather than toward the allegations. This agenda has become the most commonly used ploy with respect to critics of the official version of the assassination – always attack the messenger rather than the message – for to do otherwise might cause confrontation with the real issue – and perhaps the truth.”  Professor Jim DeBrosse has carried out an exhaustive study of how the US mainstream media has dealt with the JFK assassination in his 2018 book See No Evil: The US Media and the JFK Assassination. He writes: “America’s mainstream media have choked the parameters of the debate and stifled the search for answers to the Crime of the Century.” This is in accordance with the CIA strategy outlined in the memo. DeBrosse notes: “Mainstream journalists continue to marginalize opponents of the Warren Commission by a variety of fallacious means, including ad hominem attacks, loaded words, and broad-brush criticisms.” Ad hominem attacks, i.e. attacks on a person’s character or motivations rather than a position or argument, are what the CIA memo of 1967 advocated.  Jim DeBrosse quotes a fiftieth anniversary (i.e.2013) article by Executive Editor Jill Abramson in the New York Times: “Conspiracy speculation abounds – involving Johnson, the C.I.A., the mob, Fidel Castro or a baroque combination of all of them. Many of the theories have now found new life on the Internet, in websites febrile with unfiltered and at times unhinged musings.” Please note that without addressing the reasons of the suspicions, the journalist employs words to belittle, disparage and trivialize what she calls “conspiracy speculation”. Also note the sarcasm and contempt in the phrase “febrile with unfiltered and unhinged musings”.  Similarly, DeBrosse cites the example of a 2013 Washington Post review of a book The Kennedy Half Century authored by Larry J. Sabato. After “chiding” the author for devoting several chapters to JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the reviewer, David Greenberg, writes: “While the book’s first section is perfunctory, the second part which deals with the assassination, is somewhat wearying and likely to interest only those hard-core buffs – I realize there are many – who wallow in outraged speculation about who was behind Kennedy’s murder.” Note the choice of words “wearying”, “hard-core buffs”, those who “wallow in outraged speculation” about who was behind JFK assassination. One may notice how the mainstream media discourages people from trying to pursue the question of who was behind the assassination and to keep people away from books that deal with the issue.  In his study of book reviews of JFK assassination books in major newspapers, DeBrosse writes: “Book reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post have overwhelmingly defended the conclusions of the Warren Commission against alternative assassination theories. The reviewers often resorted to broad criticism of conspiracy researchers as paranoid, obsessed, or just plain mercenary.” As an example he quotes from a 1992 Washington Post column “Historians, Buffs and Crackpots” by freelance writer John G. Leyden who, as DeBrosse puts it, “burned through nearly thirty years of assassination books, writing off whole categories of them in a sentence or two.” He quotes Leyden: “Most of the contemporary crop of assassination writers have a more global view and tend to mix and match their conspiracy theories according to the latest fashion. The only consistent element throughout is the alleged involvement of the CIA.” The very title of the article implicitly labels those who question the Warren Commission and suspect the CIA, as “buffs” and “crackpots”, just as the CIA memo advises.  What began as a ploy to counter criticisms of the Warren Commission, and cover the truth about the JFK assassination, has been extended to all similar operations, particularly 9/11. When this author googled the term conspiracy theory on 9/11/21, he got 123 million results in 0.94 seconds; a day later he got 147 million results in 0.72 seconds. And this author knows from experience that, for any search, google search engines give a far larger number of results in the West compared to Pakistan. The google search for conspiracy theory on 9/11/21 also listed two top stories: A BBC report titled: 11 September 2001: The conspiracy theories still spreading after 20 years; and a Washington Post opinion titled: False, toxic Sept. 11 conspiracy theories are still widespread today. One may notice that the concern about conspiracy theories about 9/11 being widespread. One may notice the disparaging tone about 9/11 conspiracy theories, quite similar to the tone about JFK assassination conspiracy theories.  One may also take up a discussion about the name 9/11. Does one remember Pearl Harbor as 12/7 (December 7, 1942)? Or is the JFK assassination called 11/22 (November 22, 1963)? No. These events have a name, not a date by which they are remembered. But that discussion will take us in a somewhat different domain. One may however ask the reader to think as to why is the event, when the twin towers, and a third tower fell, the twin towers said to have been hit by planes, called 9/11 and what kind of implications such a name have? What should be the name given to 9/11?  We may end by quoting two professors of communication at Boise University, G. Husting and M. Orr. In 2007 they published a peer reviewed article entitled “Dangerous Machinery: ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ as a Transpersonal Strategy of Exclusion.” The opening paragraph of the article states: “If I call you a ‘conspiracy theorist,’ it matters little whether you have actually claimed that a conspiracy exists or whether you have raised an issue that I would rather avoid. As part of the machinery of interaction, the label does conversational work no matter how true, false, or conspiracy related your work is. Specifically, when I call you a ‘conspiracy theorist,’ I can turn the tables on you: instead of responding to a question, concern, or challenge, I twist the machinery of interaction so that you, not I, are now called to account. By labeling you, I strategically exclude you from the sphere where public speech, debate, and conflict occur.”  All this civic and social damage is the result of a CIA conspiracy regarding conspiracy-theory that began in 1967. As a counter to the term conspiracy-theory scholars have proposed the phrase State Crimes Against Democracy – SCAD!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZGFpbHlwYWtpc3Rhbi5jb20ucGsvMjEtTWF5LTIwMjMvY2lhLXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcnktY29uc3BpcmFjedIBWmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZGFpbHlwYWtpc3Rhbi5jb20ucGsvMjEtTWF5LTIwMjMvY2lhLXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcnktY29uc3BpcmFjeT92ZXJzaW9uPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kenyatta who is expected by law to have retired as a leader of political party will host a beleaguered axis of the former ruling party at Nairobi's Ngong racecourse on Monday.  Bomas of Kenya, Kenyatta's preferred venue, was reported to be unavailable due to what its management termed as scheduled routine maintenance.  ""Notice is hereby given that the venue of the Jubilee NDC has been moved to Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi,"" Kenyatta who unsuccessfully backed opposition leader Raila Odinga to succeed him announced in a notice dated May 20.  ""All other details remain as per the notice published on April 29, 2023.""  The last-minute change of venue despite initial defiance against a letter from Bomas of Kenya came amid a sustained onslaught by the party's lawmakers having since shifted allegiance to President William Ruto's United Democratic Alliance-led Kenya Kwanza Alliance.  Leadership coup  The group led by East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA) MP Kanini Kega convened party organ meetings which ratified leadership changes which saw Kenyatta ""retired"" as Party Leader with all his allies toppled.  Kega replaced Jeremiah Kioni as Secretary General pending the convening of an NDC to formally constitute the party's leadership.  Others expelled are Vice Chairpersons David Murathe and National Treasurer Kagwe Gichohi who was suspended for two years.  The Kega-led faction which controls all of Jubilee's elected Members of Parliament dismissed Kenyatta's intended NDC as inconsequential.  This even as Kioni termed alleged attempts to deny his faction a avenue for the NDC as an ""expensive experiment on multiparty democracy.""  Kioni on Thursday claimed the Kenya Kwanza was attempting to interfere with the Jubilee party.  ""The Kenya Kwanza regime wants to take away this jealousy-protected right.

Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu may need to perform another minor miracle if he is to convert his May 14 performance into an outright victory next Sunday.  It is a mark of how far Kılıçdaroğlu, whom few outside Turkey have heard of, has come that his first-round result came off looking like a disappointment.  Erdoğan picked up 49.5 percent of the ballot, thus falling short of a first-round victory for the first time in 20 years of dominant rule.  Kılıçdaroğlu won more votes than any of Erdoğan’s past rivals finishing with 44.9 percent of votes cast.  But pre-election polls had shown the secular opposition leader within a whisker of breaking the 50-percent threshold needed for outright victory.  “Don’t despair,” the 74-year-old told his despondent supporters as the outcome became apparent. “We will stand up and take this election together.”  The May 28 runoff will present Kılıçdaroğlu with a chance to reverse a dire electoral record that has seen him lose his 2009 bid to become mayor of Istanbul and then half a dozen national votes to Erdoğan and his Islamic-rooted party.  Study of contrasts  The usually soft-spoken Kılıçdaroğlu is a study of contrasts to the brash and bombastic Erdoğan — a populist whose gift for campaigning has helped him become Turkey’s longest-serving leader.  Kılıçdaroğlu’s silver mane and square glasses give him a professorial air that betrays his background as an accountant who worked his way up to head Turkey’s social security agency.  The first stage of the campaign saw him ignore Erdoğan’s personal barbs and instead stress the hardships all Turks have suffered over years of political and economic turmoil.  One of his main pledges is to hand over to parliament many of the powers Erdoğan has amassed in the last decade of his rule.  The ambitious goal touches on the fear that Erdoğan instilled across swathes of Turkey’s society during purges he unleashed after surviving a failed 2016 coup.  It may also never happen. Erdoğan’s allies retain a parliamentary majority that can block any attempts to dilute presidential powers.  Kitchen chats  Other elements of his appeal look more enduring.  Kılıçdaroğlu’s support has been helped in no small part by a cost-of-living crisis that analysts — and plenty of Turkish voters — pin on Erdoğan’s unorthodox economic beliefs.  But it is backed up by a viral social media campaign that bypasses the state’s stranglehold on television by speaking to voters in snappy clips recorded from his retro-tiled kitchen.  One of the most famous saw Kılıçdaroğlu break taboos by talking about being Alevi.  The group has been targeted by decades of violent repressions because it follows a more spiritual Islamic tradition that separates it from both Sunni and Shiite Muslims.  Erdoğan once accused Alevis of inventing a “new religion.”  “God gave me my life,” Kılıçdaroğlu said in the video. “I am not sinful.”  The late-night post racked up nearly 50 million views on Twitter by the following morning.  Nationalist turn  But Kılıçdaroğlu also has a steelier side that evokes the nationalism of Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk — the first and most important leader of Kılıçdaroğlu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP).  Kılıçdaroğlu has doubled down on his vow to send nearly four million Syrians who fled civil war back to their homeland.  “As soon as I come to power, I will send all the refugees home,” he said in his first post-election address.  The promise represents his most concerted attempt yet to win over right-wing voters who propelled Erdoğan to win the first round vote.  Kılıçdaroğlu argues that the refugee issue is not one of “race” but of “resources” during Turkey’s economic troubles.  He tries to soften the message by recalling his own humble upbringing in the Kurdish Alevi province of Tunceli.  He once invited reporters to his pitch-black apartment to discuss his decision to stop paying his electricity bills.  It was a campaign-savvy statement of solidarity with Turkey’s inflation-hit voters that tried to bridge political divides.  “This is my struggle to claim your rights,” he said next to an old-fashioned lantern casting a glow across his desk.  © Agence France-Presse","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEva2lsaWNkYXJvZ2x1LWJvb2tpc2gtcmV0aXJlZS10YWtlcy1vbi1lcmRvZ2FuL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEva2lsaWNkYXJvZ2x1LWJvb2tpc2gtcmV0aXJlZS10YWtlcy1vbi1lcmRvZ2FuLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Both the voicemail message and the leaked letter all acknowledge the words to overthrow Hun Sen…by military coup d’état, using the color revolution used in many places, many countries with different names, with the same goal of overthrowing or overthrowing, to the point of assassination or any other act, just to get rid of the people it has to get rid of…Poch and his party have this character forever and become a culture of endless revenge for both parents and children.”  “I do not accept the apology, Poch thinks to himself, what should be done?

Nyoro said Sunday during a church service in Isiolo that Kenyatta should learn from his predecessors -- late Presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki -- and support his successor by steering away from politics.  Instead of engaging in politics, the Kiharu legislator urged the ex-president to call the incumbent President William Ruto and seek a truce.  ""Our Presidential Retirement Benefits Act is very clear on Section 6 that when a President retires, that you should cease as a former President to hold any position in a political party,"" Nyoro said.  ""We are now eight months since elections, we are respectfully requesting you as the people of Kenya to please respect Presidential Retirement Benefits Act so that you can lead by example.""  Highlighting the consequences of disregarding the Retirement Benefits Act, Nyoro reminded Kenyatta that the law is explicit about the actions that should be taken in such cases.  Nyoro appealed to Kenyatta to respect the will of the Kenyan people, who elected President Ruto, and suggested that quitting politics would earn him the respect of the nation.  Advisory role to government  Section 6 (1) of the Presidential Retirement Benefits Act provides that a retired President shall not hold office in any political party for more than six months after ceasing to hold office as President.  Additionally, Section 6 (2) requires retired presidents to play a consultative and advisory role to the government and the people of Kenya.  Nyoro's comments come at a time when Kenyatta has been embroiled in a leadership dispute within the former governing party Jubilee.  Despite the legal requirement to exit politics, Kenyatta has organized a contested Jubilee Party National Delegate Conference (NDC) bringing together expelled officials.  Kenyatta who is expected by law to have retired as a leader of political party will host a beleaguered axis of the former ruling party at Nairobi's Ngong racecourse on Monday.  Bomas of Kenya, Kenyatta's preferred venue, was reported to be unavailable due to what its management termed as scheduled routine maintenance.

The group led by East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA) MP Kanini Kega convened party organ meetings which ratified leadership changes which saw Kenyatta ""retired"" as Party Leader with all his allies toppled.  Kega replaced Jeremiah Kioni as Secretary General pending the convening of an NDC to formally constitute the party's leadership.  Others expelled are Vice Chairpersons David Murathe and National Treasurer Kagwe Gichohi who was suspended for two years.  The Kega-led faction which controls all of Jubilee's elected Members of Parliament dismissed Kenyatta's intended NDC as inconsequential.  This even as Kioni termed alleged attempts to deny his faction a avenue for the NDC as an ""expensive experiment on multiparty democracy.""  Kioni on Thursday claimed the Kenya Kwanza was attempting to interfere with the Jubilee party.  ""The Kenya Kwanza regime wants to take away this jealousy-protected right.

"political coup","2016-11-08","22:00:00","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T09:44:51","To Donald Trump’s MAGA minions, I ask a tripartite question:  Do you know, and do you care, and do you care to know?  In other words, do you really know, care, and care to know Donald Trump’s actual character: that he only cares about himself and his self-interests while caring little about the concerns and needs of the people of the country he once was elected to serve and protect?  Do you know, care, and care to know of his incompetence in business and in politics, and that he is a scam artist who hasn’t any glimmer of understanding anything even approaching the art of any deal?  Do you know, care, and care to know of his severe personality flaws and narcissism rendering him literally incapable of functioning as an effective President of the United States? Rather, this man (dis)functions as an exceedingly dangerous force in undermining our standing around the world and bringing us to the point of rupture in our constitutional form of government.  And if you know this, those of you who are apparently so concerned with maintaining and expanding your “personal freedom” and “liberty,” why would you even consider supporting and voting for Trump? By doing so, you have essentially relinquished your personal freedom and your liberty as the cost for admission to his personality cult and some intangible promised security.  As someone who has studied World War II and the Holocaust virtually all of my life, I have struggled to comprehend how authoritarian leaders gain ascendancy in presumably liberal democracies built on guiding principles of freedom and the rule of law.  Authoritarianism as a form of government is characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. These regimes may be either autocratic (concentrated in the hands of one person) or oligarchic (small number of powerful, often rich people) and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military.  Influential political scientist Juan José Linz defined authoritarianism as composed of four qualities:  Limited political pluralism with severe constraints on the legislature, political parties, and interest groups. Political legitimacy based on appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat “easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.” Minimal political mobilization and suppression of anti-regime activities. Ill-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting, which extends the power of the executive.  During the late 1940s, researchers, led by Theodor W. Adorno, studied the historical conditions that paved the way for the rise of fascist regimes in the 1930s, World War II, and the Holocaust. They theorized about individuals who supported the growth of fascist regimes.  They suggested that people of a certain personality type, which they labeled the “authoritarian personality,” were most ripe for extremism, in this case, those most susceptible to anti-Jewish prejudice and anti-democratic political beliefs.  These individuals suspended their autonomy and critical thinking facilities, and they pledged obedience, allegiance, and freedom to a powerful leader or social institution for the promise of going back to a future reminiscent of a (mythic) idealistic past of economic, political, social, cultural, and personal security, where their “ingroup” won and led, and “outgroups” served obediently and acquiesced to “ingroup” needs and demands.  In other words, they surrender their freedom for the promise of social and personal security, which usually includes suppressing and even oppressing those outside the circle, the “others.”  Now enters the would-be mighty authoritarian strongman, Donald John Trump.  After painting a gruesome image of a post-apocalyptic U.S.-America, replete with vicious marauding gangs, gunshots whizzing throughout inner cities, decrepit crumbling structures and highways, rampant poverty, declining health care systems, imminent terrorist attacks, ruthless criminal-drug-dealing-rapist invaders from our southern border.  After inciting violence at his rallies, leading to the deadly insurrection by his fascist militia at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and his second impeachment, and fear, stereotyping and scapegoating all Muslims and so-called “illegal aliens,” after promising to punish women who had and their doctors who performed abortions, after asserting that he will reestablish the Supreme Court to an ultra-conservative majority, and after promising to reverse both Roe v. Wade and marriage equality, and most importantly, after promising to “Make America Great Again,” Heir Donald non-so-solemnly proclaimed during his meandering diatribe in 2016 at the Republican National Convention:  I am your voice! I alone can fix it. I will restore law and order.  Trump never asked anything of his supporters other than their total loyalty to follow by placing their complete faith in him. And the authoritarian personalities followed brown-shirted in lockstep.  Trump had his followers wax nostalgic to the television shows from many of their youth: “Father Knows Best,” “The Donna Reed Show,” “Ozzy and Harriet,” “Leave it to Beaver,” “The Brady Bunch,” “Happy Days,” and “Full House,” all reflecting the mainstream popular image of the U.S.-American family as white, middle class, with a nice home in the suburbs, and with all family members accepting their assigned raced and gendered scripts.  Democracy, though, demands an educated electorate. Democracy demands responsibility on the part of the electorate to critically examine their politicians and the issues of the day so they can make truly informed decisions. Democracy demands us never to relinquish our freedom and authority for some promise of a comfortable security by returning to a fairytale past.  Those peaceful bygone days where lovely children played in beautifully landscaped yards within lily-white neighborhoods surrounded by rainbows above and unicorns strolling down the freshly cleansed sidewalks never existed except in the mind of the cult believers.

He shot his latest salvo of democracy-killing lies and deceptions at a supposed TV “townhall” on CNN, Wednesday night, May 10, 2023, hosted by reporter Katlin Collins. But this was no regular town hall since the audience members came directly from central casting of MAGA world to bow to their cult leader.  Though Collins tried to constrain the twice impeached failed former president by calling out his continual stream of lies and dehumanizing characterizations of Trump’s critics and attacks upon herself, Collins was simply no match for the would-be dictator and his minions.  Though Trump has been convicted of sexual harassment, is under investigation for conspiring to lead a coup to remain in power, to abscond with classified documents, to change the outcome of the electoral vote in Georgia, and to submit false tax forms in New York State and to the Internal Revenue Service, his minions kept cheering on their deranged leader.  Though he would not address whether he wished Ukraine or Russia to win the deadly incursion by Russia against its neighbor, stated that if reelected he would continue to separate children from their migrant parents, would support a national ban on abortion, and he doubled downed on his contention that it is both normal and natural for men to grab women’s genital “which has been going on for the past one million years,” even though the oldest fossil remains of homo sapiens date back only to approximately 300,000 years, but since Trump was never very interested in history and facts, his minions kept cheering on their deranged leader.  We have long known that Donald Trump is a liar and a racist neo-nationalist. Republican leaders and their supporters who don’t speak out are enablers and are themselves co-conspirators!  “Enabler” is the term given to those who fail to act to help abusers. “Passive bystander” or “bad Samaritan” is the name for people who are conscious of bad actions developing around them but fail to intervene.  Enabling and passively standing by take many forms, including literally offering an addict substances or conspiring with an abuser in a sinister plot, contributing to the denial of addicts and aggressors by asserting that they don’t have a problem, to downplaying the seriousness and making excuses for their behaviors, translating for others what the person “really meant,” downright lying, and so on.  I often wonder how Trump enablers can sleep at night and get back up in the morning still willing to degrade and prostrate themselves by attacking our democratic institutions and seriously dismantling our country’s standing in the world.  Each time anyone enables an abusive action, they keep perpetrators and themselves further from the truth and from help, and they diminish themselves and their integrity more than just a bit.  I have been stuck time and time again by Trump’s lies and deceptions throughout the past post-factual seven years since he first announced his campaign for the presidency, through the transition following his election, his four years in the White House, and his constant promotion of the Big Lie that led to an attempted coup, and now in his newest campaign  Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free  He continues to spread his lies, his verifiable lies, big and small.  So questions remain:  How long will it take for Trump’s supporters to finally realize they have been duped by this con-artist who sold them his snake-oil-of-a-campaign-and-presidency of little value, which can have disastrous consequences?  How much longer can Trump’s enablers, and passive and active supporters understand that they are hurting the country and sacrificing their own integrity and sense of dignity for the mere promise of a few shiny coins of glittering gold and the hot glow of fleeting power?  When voters relinquish their freedom for some sort of promised security, we are left with nothing at all.  ***  Join The Good Men Project as a Premium Member today.

"political coup","2016-07-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T15:43:02","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has beaten back his rivals at one of his most vulnerable movements and regained his old aura of invincibility ahead of next Sunday’s historic runoff election.  The ultimate political survivor, Erdogan, 69, has overcome jail and a bloody 2016 coup attempt to emerge as Turkey’s most important leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the post-Ottoman republic.  An unprecedented opposition coalition, galvanised by a biting economic crisis and fury over a calamitous February earthquake, represented his latest challenge in last Sunday’s general election.  But while coming closer to defeat than ever, Erdogan beat the odds yet again, looking increasingly likely to extend his two-decade rule for one last time until 2028.  A transformative and divisive figure, Erdogan is revered for unshackling religious restrictions in the officially secular but mostly Muslim state, overseeing ambitious infrastructure projects and turning Turkey into a geopolitical force.  Detractors accuse him of slipping into authoritarianism reminiscent of the Ottoman sultans, shaking Turkey’s democratic foundations and impoverishing millions through misguided beliefs that contradict conventional economics.  Next Sunday’s runoff is turning into a referendum on his rule, with its result likely to leave the sharply polarised nation of 85 million deeply divided.  – Rewriting the rules –  Known to his inner circle as “beyefendi” (sir) and to admirers as “reis” (the chief), Erdogan prides himself on being able to woo doubters through tireless campaigning.  This passion has helped him and his party win more than a dozen local and national elections, allowing Erdogan to claim a people’s mandate for his foreign military adventures and domestic clampdowns on dissent.  Erdogan risked his political domination on a 2017 referendum over abolishing the office of prime minister and handing greater powers to the president.  Erdogan eked out a narrow win, enfeebling parliament and enabling him to effectively rule by decree. It also gave him the constitutional loophole needed to run for two more terms in office — an outcome acquiring the air of inevitability.  – Power and protests –  Born in a working-class harbour district of Istanbul, Erdogan made his name in nascent Islamic movements that were challenging secular domination, becoming the city’s mayor in 1994.  His term in office was cut short when he was convicted and jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred when he recited a fiery poem that compared mosques to army barracks and called minarets “our bayonets”.  Among supporters, this only seemed to magnify his appeal.  Founding the AKP after an earlier Islamic party was banned, Erdogan spearheaded its 2002 landslide election victory and became premier less than six months later.  Erdogan’s signature early achievements included a series of reforms that gladdened the European Union, including abolishing the death penalty and beginning a peace process with Kurdish militants.  Mass protests in 2013 over plans to turn an Istanbul park into a shopping mall marked the start of a more divisive era that included corruption allegations levelled against his inner circle.  Turkey’s bid to join the EU faltered and peace talks with the Kurds imploded in 2015, when a Kurdish opposition party helped to wrest control of parliament from Erdogan for the first time.  Turkish military operations against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq soon followed, creating new tensions with the West.  – Abandoned by allies –  In its early days the AKP, lacking allies and experience, forged an alliance with Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who moved to permanent US exile in 1999 but retained strong influence in Turkish society and government.  Erdogan blamed Gulen for masterminding a bloody coup bid in July 2016, by a renegade army faction — charges he denies.  The president, on holiday in the Aegean, appeared on the FaceTime app on live TV to urge supporters out onto the streets.  It became the defining moment of his subsequent rule.  Erdogan fought back with sweeping purges that led to 80,000 arrests, brought most media under government influence and created a sense of looming peril among those opposed to his rule.  Washington and the EU’s hesitation to openly support Erdogan in the first hours of the coup bid eroded his trust in the West and created diplomatic frictions that linger to this day.  Unorthodox economic policies, including lowering interest rates to fight soaring inflation that officially reached 85 percent in 2022, hurt many ordinary Turks as the lira slumped and bills spiked.  Opponents accused him of turning a blind eye to corruption and lax building standards that allowed entire cities to crumble in this year’s earthquake.  Despite the widespread loss and anger, Erdogan’s popularity held up in parts of southeastern Turkey laid to waste by the disaster — a testament to a loyal bedrock of support built up over two decades.

"political coup","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Aden"", ""Aden"", ""Yemen""}","2023-05-22T00:57:00","Yemeni leader reiterates unity amid calls for secession  Xinhua) 08:57, May 22, 2023  ADEN, Yemen, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) Rashad al-Alimi on Sunday issued a fresh call for national unity ahead of the country's National Day, amid calls to demand the southern region's secession from the republic.  In an eve-of-celebration speech delivered from his temporary office in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, al-Alimi stressed the importance of the 1990 unification of North and South Yemen after decades of struggle.  While acknowledging the mistakes that came along with the unification, he voiced the PLC's commitment to pushing forward political reforms.  He also warned of the Houthi militia's threat, accusing them of falsely advocating for ""unity or death"" while planning to invade the country's southern regions.  The Yemeni leader urged all political factions to unite around the council to achieve common goals, put an end to the Houthi coup, restore state institutions, and alleviate the years-long suffering.  Despite al-Alimi's appeal for unity, calls for secession are growing louder, particularly in Aden and other major southern cities that are now controlled by the Southern Transitional Council (STC).  Earlier in the day, chief of the STC Aidarous Zubaidi, who also serves as the deputy to al-Alimi in the PLC, kickstarted the sixth session of the National Assembly that convened in Mukalla, the capital of the Hadramout province.  Zubaidi made it clear in his speech in Mukalla that the STC, which is headquartered in Aden, is determined to pursue its political goals, one of which is seeking ""outright independence.""  Yemen, an impoverished Arab country plagued by violence and political turmoil, is teetering on the brink of further fragmentation as the southern region's grievances threaten the country's unity, according to local observers.  As part of efforts to address southern grievances, al-Alimi announced last week the reinstatement of more than 52,000 civil, security, and military employees who were forcibly dismissed from their jobs in the country's southern provinces after the 1994 civil war.  In 1994, a civil war erupted in Yemen, four years after the unification of North and South Yemen to form the Republic of Yemen.  The conflict was caused by a secessionist movement by southern Yemen that sought to break away from the northern part of the country.  One of the consequences of the war was the mass dismissal of thousands of employees, who had previously held jobs in various sectors of the southern region, including government, security, and the military.  The abrupt dismissals were seen as a punitive measure against those who had supported the secessionist movement.  The secessionist sentiment in the southern part of Yemen continued to grow, fueled by the feeling of economic and political marginalization and discrimination. The Yemeni government has repeatedly denied allegations of discrimination against the southern provinces.

During the first round of prisoner swap talks in Switzerland in March, the Yemeni government and the Houthis agreed to swap almost 900 prisoners during the holy month of Ramadan, as well as exchange visits to prisoners in each other’s cities, and launch the second round of talks immediately after Ramadan, which ended on April 21.  Both parties this week accused one another of impeding prison visits.  Majed Fadhail, a member of the government’s delegation to prisoner exchange negotiations, told Arab News that the Yemeni government delegation postponed a visit to Houthi prisons after the militia refused to allow them to visit Mohammed Qahtan, a Yemeni politician held captive for eight years.  “The agreement stipulates that everyone, including Mohammed Qahtan, is permitted to visit,” Fadhail said.  Yahya Kazman, head of the Yemeni government’s delegation, also told Arab News that the second round of talks was scheduled to begin at the end of this month but was delayed because the agreement to swap visits to Marib and Sanaa prisons failed to be put into practice.  “I anticipate that it will be delayed until mid-June, as it is dependent on visits that have not yet been implemented,” Kazman said.  In Sanaa, the Houthis accused the Yemeni government of setting preconditions on their Saturday trip to prisoners in Marib.  “We view these actions as a blatant obstruction designed to thwart the visits and, in turn, the next round of negotiations,” Abdul Kader Al-Murtadha, head of the Houthi delegation, said on Twitter.  During the second round of talks, the Houthis say they will discuss exchanging 1,400 prisoners, while the Yemeni government says it will push for “emptying” Houthi prisons of abductees and forcefully disappeared persons.  Similarly, Yemen rights groups and activists that work for the release of war prisoners and abducted civilians voiced dissatisfaction with the postponement of prisoner swap discussions between the warring factions and urged the UN Yemen envoy, Hans Grundberg, and the Arab coalition, to push for the talks to resume as soon as possible.  “We hold them accountable for their inaction, accusations and procrastination. Mothers are extremely distressed and monitor this case with great interest,” Amat Al-Salam Al-Hajj, chairperson of the Abductees’ Mothers Association, an umbrella group representing thousands of women family members of civilian war captives, told Arab News.  The prisoner swap talks were postponed as the head of the Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad Al-Alimi, warned wrangling Yemeni political parties in Yemen that the collapse of the council, the government, and other public institutions would deprive the war-torn country of vital humanitarian aid and prevent Yemenis from traveling abroad.  “The presence of the legitimate authority, which is represented by the Presidential Leadership Council, the government and modern national institutions, is the decisive guarantee for the continuation of political support for our just causes, the flow of aid and the facilitation of the cross-border movement of Yemenis,” Al-Alimi said in a speech on the eve of the 33rd anniversary of Unity Day on May 22.  He urged Yemenis to support the council until the Houthis are defeated and Iran’s schemes in Yemen are foiled.  “Our ultimate objective will continue to be to restore state institutions, and we will continue to unite the inside and outside of the country against the Houthi militia’s coup and terrorism, as well as the Iranian project that supports it,” he added.  The Yemeni government would comply with peace efforts to end the war in Yemen, including the Saudi initiative, as well as revive state institutions and alleviate the country’s worsening humanitarian crisis, Al-Alimi said.  “We will also continue our serious engagement with the peace efforts led by our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, along with the option to deter any hostile threat posed by the Houthi militia.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc0MjEvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3NDIxL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2013-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-21T14:00:22","Lebanon PM condemns Hezbollah military maneuver  BEIRUT: Lebanon Prime Minister Najib Mikati has condemned a military exercise by Hezbollah that used live ammunition, warning against any action that “undermines the authority and sovereignty of the state.”  His remarks came in response to a question from US Special Coordinator for Lebanon Joanna Wronecka regarding the Hezbollah maneuver, which was held on Sunday in southern Lebanon.  The exercise included demonstrations of heavy weapons, missiles and drones.  Mikati said: “The issue of Hezbollah’s weapons specifically is linked to a reality that requires a comprehensive national consensus, and it must be a priority for the upcoming phase.”  He added that the government is focused on maintaining security throughout Lebanon and deterring actions that threaten stability.  Mikati also highlighted the cooperation between the Lebanese army and UNIFIL within the UN Mission’s operational area, emphasizing Lebanon’s commitment to Resolution 1701.  He called on the UN Security Council to establish a permanent ceasefire in the south and pressure Israel to halt its violations of Lebanese sovereignty.  Wronecka said in a statement: “What matters to us is the stability of Lebanon, and we always encourage the prompt election of a new president to support Lebanon and its people.”  Hezbollah’s military maneuver — conducted ahead of the anniversary of the liberation of southern Lebanon from Israeli occupation — took place within a military camp belonging to the party in the Aaramta area, north of the Litani River, outside the UNIFIL operational zone.  The maneuver sparked outrage among Hezbollah’s opponents and raised questions about the group’s objectives, particularly as it took place the day after the conclusion of the Arab League Summit in Jeddah.  Attendance at the maneuver was open to Lebanese and foreign journalists, though communication in the area was banned to prevent unauthorized filming and broadcasting.  Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces Party, strongly condemned the exercise, saying he “completely rejected” the maneuver.  He added that the Hezbollah exercise undermined efforts by the Lebanese public, who are “working day and night to rebuild their state and regain Arab and international confidence in the country.”  Geagea said that Hezbollah’s actions demonstrate its indifference to developments in the region, as the party is maintaining the same strategy it has deployed for two decades.  He described the maneuver as a “reckless act” that would only harm Lebanon and undermine the aspirations of its people for the establishment of a genuine state, while also negatively impacting recent progress in the Arab region, ultimately benefiting only Israel.  In a joint statement, the National Council to End the Iranian Occupation in Lebanon and the Lady of the Mountain Gathering said that the maneuver appeared to sideline the role of the Lebanese Army and Resolution 1701.  The exercise came less than a month after a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to the south, where he declared that Iran, through Hezbollah, is active on the Israeli border, the statement added.  The two groups warned that Hezbollah’s intentions were to send a message, both domestically and internationally, that it was leveraging the rapid changes in the region to solidify its dominance within Lebanon, particularly in the presidential battle.  The exercise was designed to intimidate potential new leaders, the statement said.  Despite the attention surrounding the Hezbollah maneuver, the case of Central Bank Gov. Riad Salameh — who is facing legal action in Europe — remains the subject of significant scrutiny.  On Monday, the First Investigative Judge in Beirut, Charbel Abou Samra, appointed two units within the Internal Security Forces in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to notify Raja Salameh, the governor’s brother, and Marianne Hoayek, his assistant, of their scheduled interrogations in a Paris court on May 31 and June 13, respectively.  Salameh did not appear before the Paris court on the previously scheduled session on May 16 due to his unavailability for notification, as required by Lebanese law.  Consequently, the French judiciary issued an arrest warrant for Salameh through an Interpol red notice, which was delivered to Lebanon last Friday.  Former Attorney General Hatem Madi told Arab News that the French judiciary’s memorandum does not have any legal effect in Lebanon.  He added that it is impossible to execute an international arrest warrant against a Lebanese citizen and extradite them to France.  “However, if a Lebanese citizen is under suspicion, they should be questioned and a lawsuit must be filed against them in Lebanon,” he said.  Madi said that the non-execution of the international warrant does not mean that Salameh has escaped justice.  Reformist MP Elias Jarada criticized the handling of Salameh’s judicial case by some Lebanese judges, accusing them of negligence and contributing to the French judiciary’s action.  He claimed that there was a deliberate decision taken to prevent Salameh’s arrest among the political class that controls the judiciary, over fears that the former governor could implicate them in financial scandals.  Jarada said that the failure to notify Salameh of the May 16 session before French Judge Aude Buresi was “insulting.”  He called on the Lebanese judiciary to prosecute Salameh for the charges brought against him before the French judiciary, in compliance with the provisions of the Penal Code.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc1MjEvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3NTIxL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T09:15:50","By Helen Regan, Teele Rebane, Salai TZ and Paula Hancocks, CNN  (CNN) — Abdul Hussein wipes away tears as he describes the day waves churned by Cyclone Mocha took his wife and three daughters from him.  His family – all 11 of them – had huddled together in their house in Sittwe, on the coast of Myanmar’s Rakhine state, as ferocious winds intensified overhead.  “When the water started to flood, I held my small granddaughter very tightly,” Hussein said.  As the water rose, the family ran to escape the storm surge but they got separated in the chaos. Most of them made it to higher ground, but his wife and three of his daughters ages 20, 18 and 11, were swept away.  “The water took them,” Hussein said, distraught.  Hussein said he found their bodies when the cyclone subsided, and buried them.  Hussein and his surviving children and grandchildren are now without proper shelter or food. They have spent the past few nights in a shack cobbled together from what was left of their house. Everything around it was razed.  The children, he said, cry all night for their mother and sisters.  “I’m thinking only about them, I can’t even eat, I can’t even do anything,” Hussein said, adding that he has had to beg for food for the children.  Coastal areas in Rakhine bore the brunt of Cyclone Mocha’s winds, which tore over the state at over 200 kilometers per hour (195 mph) on Sunday, as one of the strongest storms to ever hit Myanmar.  Video and witness accounts show widespread devastation, with entire villages wiped out, shelters destroyed and piles of debris stretching over miles.  More than 400 people are estimated to have died, according to Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government, but the true toll and extent of the destruction is hard to know due to flooding, blocked roads and downed communications that have made access difficult.  A massive clean-up operation is underway for the millions of people affected by the storm, but clean water supplies and fuel are running low, and there is a critical need for shelters, food, medicine and healthcare services, according to the UN’s humanitarian office (OCHA).  Aid agencies say they have finally begun reaching affected communities, a week after the cyclone hit and following claims Myanmar’s military junta had been impeding access.  “Humanitarian assistance has begun reaching people affected by Cyclone Mocha in Rakhine State,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a recent update.  “In recent days, initial humanitarian supplies have been transported via trucks… and humanitarians are exploring a range of approaches to try and move supplies to the impact zone from inside and outside the country, pending approval,” OCHA said.  Emergency food has been delivered to cyclone shelters and humanitarian workers are now trying to gauge the full impact of the cyclone in areas where they have access, it added.  “However, there is still a shortage of fuel – particularly for essential public services such as health facilities and water treatment. Other critical needs include shelter, food aid, medical supplies and healthcare services.”  Crisis upon crisis  While western Rakhine state took a direct hit from the cyclone, the UN estimates 150,000 people in the country’s northwest were also heavily affected.  Houses, schools and hospitals were destroyed across Chin state, and about 85,000 people in Sagaing region were impacted – a situation exacerbated by ongoing conflict and the presence of troops hindering access to safe shelter, UN OCHA said.  Since the Myanmar military seized power in a coup in 2021, the country has been rocked by violence and instability. Fighting between junta troops and resistance groups under the People’s Defense Forces (PDF) unfolds almost daily across the country.  One resident from Magway, where around 11,000 households were affected by the storm, said her husband died in flooding caused by Cyclone Mocha.  She said they were moving their belongings away from the floodwaters in the forest after they had been forced to flee what she said was military fire.  “We were getting our belongings back from the jungle where we hide from the military soldiers. When that happens, there were gun shots around so we had to hide,” said the resident from Pauk township, who did not want to be named for security reasons.  Her husband had made her return home first with the cart while he went back to save their dog.  “He told me that he will to try to rescue the dog that was swept away by the current. Even though I told him not to go, he still left,” she said.  She said neighbors helped her search and they later found his body.  “With gunshots everywhere and with two old people and one child, I don’t know what to do,” she said.  ‘Absolute brink’  Concerns are high for thousands of vulnerable people because Rakhine is a largely impoverished and isolated state, which in recent years has been the site of widespread political violence.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced in the state due to the protracted conflict, many of them members of the stateless Rohingya minority group, long persecuted in Myanmar.  Rohingya in Rakhine are mostly confined to camps akin to open air prisons, where authorities place strict controls on their movement, as well as access to schooling and health care.  “Rohingya and Rakhine communities alike are heavily impacted by conflict and successive humanitarian crises, relying almost entirely on humanitarian assistance for their survival,” said Paul Brockmann, Medecins Sans Frontieres’ operations manager for Myanmar.  “The impact of Cyclone Mocha has pushed people’s coping mechanisms in Rakhine state to the absolute brink.”  Brockmann said the scale of the medical humanitarian needs created by the storm are “enormous,” and many of their mobile clinics have been destroyed, cutting people off from essential health care.  “In the townships of Sittwe, Rathedaung, Buthidaung and Maungdaw, damage has been extensive. In Rathedaung we estimate that 90% of homes in each village have been destroyed. People are desperate to repair their homes as the monsoon season is fast-approaching,” he said.  Of particular concern has been Pauktaw township, south of the capital Sittwe, where people were without assistance for four days, according to Brockmann.  The area is “only accessible by boat” and is home to an estimated 26,500 internally displaced people who have been living in camps for 12 years.  However, OCHA said in its update that on May 18 the World Food Programme had received permission to distribute emergency food in eight townships, including Pauktaw.

"political coup","2023-11-07","Not Discerned","{""Dubai"", ""Dubai"", ""UnitedArabEmirates""}","2023-05-22T05:19:32","Finding solutions to climate change, conflict in Mideast are urgent challenges for COP28  DUBAI: With Earth on the precipice as the devastating impacts of climate change loom ominously, it has become an urgent imperative to respond to this rapidly transforming world. As the international community prepares for the 28th Conference of the Parties, or COP28, hosted by the UAE, it is crucial to underscore the significance of this global gathering in addressing the complex interplay between climate resilience and conflict-affected regions.  A recent policy report released jointly by the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, and the Norwegian Red Cross, sheds light on the alarming exacerbation of humanitarian needs in the region. This report, titled “Making Adaptation Work: Addressing the compounding impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and conflict in the Near and Middle East,” sheds light on the dire situation faced by communities in the region.  The ICRC report emphasizes that climate change is not solely an environmental issue but a significant threat to human security, further exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The report highlights the intricate connections between marginalized communities, armed conflicts, and humanitarian crises, emphasizing the urgent need to address these interconnected challenges.  To delve into the intricate interdependencies between climate resilience, conflict-affected regions, and the imperative need for climate financing, a panel of experts convened in Dubai recently to explore this multidimensional crisis. The participants of the forum included Clare Dalton, the ICRC’s head of delegation in the UAE, Trond H.G. Rudi, charge d’affaires of the Norwegian Embassy in the UAE, and Helena de Jong, senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team.  Climate financing for conflict-affected regions  In conflict-affected countries, the challenge lies not only in combating climate change but also in navigating complex socio-political dynamics. Dalton emphasized that climate financing must be effectively channeled to countries grappling with conflict. The outcome she hopes to see from COP28 in the UAE is that “climate financing is better directed to countries experiencing conflict in ways that they can practically apply and use.” However, the current state of affairs presents obstacles, such as unreliable banking systems and numerous other factors that impede effective climate financing.  The report sheds light on the formidable barriers faced in accessing multilateral climate finance for state-led adaptation projects in conflict-affected countries. These challenges materialize as a result of stringent governance prerequisites and a certain aversion toward investing in volatile contexts.  As of January 2022, a mere 19 single-country projects in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have successfully secured funding approval, with the disbursed amount accounting for less than 0.5 percent of the global allocation of climate project funds. This stark disparity underscores the pressing need to address the limited access and utilization of climate financing in conflict-affected regions.  To overcome these obstacles, Dalton advocates for the collaboration of all sectors of society, emphasizing the necessity for concerted efforts in order to develop tangible, implementable solutions.  While the ICRC acknowledges that it operates at the periphery of climate negotiations, it recognizes the necessity of addressing climate change due to its impact on the regions it serves. Achieving this requires tangible strategies and concrete actions that go beyond mere agreement on the importance of adaptation.  “It’s not the fact that we all agree this needs to happen, but it’s the how. What are some very concrete ways that this could happen tomorrow because it’s needed then after the COP. And I think that happens in two ways because it’s not just in the form of negotiations, but it’s also in providing the space for actors to come together and look at some of these issues. So I think my second expectation is that we find a way to do that. You know, the remaining question is who can help us achieve that outcome. So yeah, money in places like Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, and any of these places that need that support,” Dalton said.  Dalton also touched on how small-scale initiatives play an important role in building community resilience amidst the challenges associated with the de-prioritization of climate action in conflict-affected settings, citing solutions such as education on sustainable agricultural practices, and the distribution of climate-resilient seed varieties to strengthen food security and build community resilience.  Armed conflicts exert a dual impact on the environment, both directly and indirectly, with profound consequences for human well-being. Such conflicts erode environmental governance structures and disrupt societal order, thus perpetuating the conditions conducive to environmental degradation. Consequently, the direct environmental harm caused by conflict and the subsequent degradation of ecological systems undermine the availability of natural resources, rendering communities more susceptible to the repercussions of climate change.  The report presents compelling instances that highlight how deliberate acts of environmental degradation can heighten the immediate jeopardy faced by significant population groups. A notable example is the seizure of Iraq’s Mosul Dam in 2014, which precipitated a looming risk of dam collapse. The accompanying threat to intentionally destroy the dam and flood downstream Baghdad underscores the urgent requirement for increased vigilance and accountability in safeguarding critical infrastructure systems and protecting vulnerable communities.  Dalton highlighted the imperative of engaging with the inhabitants of conflict-affected regions, acknowledging their lived experiences and incorporating their perspectives into climate resilience initiatives, stating: “We need to listen to those people about what changes they’ve seen, about what solutions they perceive might be.”  This approach recognizes the significance of local knowledge and ensures that adaptation strategies are contextually relevant and responsive to the specific challenges faced by these communities. By fostering connections between local, national, regional and global levels, a comprehensive and integrated framework can be established, incorporating diverse solutions and approaches to address the multifaceted issues arising from climate change and conflict.  “Communities need to understand how they can be part of the solution as well and what they can do in their own way not to make the situation any worse. And that’s exactly the same for humanitarians. We have that ‘do no harm’ principle. How can we respond to people’s needs but without making it any worse for them in terms of the assistance we give?” she said.  Revisiting climate-finance priorities  The report draws attention to the discrepancies between climate finance flows, vulnerability to climate change, and countries torn by conflict. De Jong, the senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team, highlighted a distressing statistic: out of the 46 countries listed as least developed, 22 are affected by conflict and fragility.  Paradoxically, these conflict-ridden nations receive the least amount of climate finance, exacerbating their vulnerability to both conflict and climate change. This predicament perpetuates a vicious cycle, hindering governments’ capacity to tackle these intertwined challenges effectively. To break this cycle, De Jong advocates for a paradigm shift in climate financing, with a renewed focus on prioritizing conflict-affected nations. She highlights the importance of engaging climate finance providers, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, and peacebuilding actors in finding solutions.  “This is something that we would like to see changed. It’s not easy. This is a fairly complicated problem. But the advantage of focusing on this as a COP28 presidency is that we can talk to all these climate finance providers, so we can talk to the multilateral development banks, and we can talk to humanitarian actors and peacebuilding actors in this space to really bring all of them together to look at the solutions. Because the solutions are there. We know that there are plenty of actors that are able to work in these settings,” De Jong said.  Global pact for climate adaptation  To address this imbalance, De Jong proposes a paradigm shift in climate financing, with a renewed focus on prioritizing conflict-affected nations. She highlights the importance of engaging climate finance providers, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, and peacebuilding actors in finding solutions. A global pact that includes actionable solutions such as streamlined application procedures, adjusted eligibility criteria for conflict-affected actors, and increased flexibility in project locations could drive progress in climate adaptation efforts.  “It won’t be all different at COP28, but we do really want to see a very big step forward at COP28. And this could, for example — and that would be my dream outcome — be in the form of some sort of global pact that all of these actors would sign up to that doesn’t include just principles that we all agree on, but that also would include at least a couple of solutions to these issues,” De Jong said.  “Our proposal is mainly the global pact that I mentioned. So this would focus more, I guess, on changes in the policy spectrum. But it could, for example, also include like a regional capacity-strengthening facility that would help governments apply and develop strong adaptation projects that would then basically build a pipeline of adaptation projects which would help them in the long run, so it wouldn’t necessarily include a fund,” De Jong said.  With the presidency of COP28, the UAE aims to create a platform that brings together various actors to collectively explore solutions. De Jong stresses the need to leverage existing momentum for change, emphasizing that COP28 is a stepping stone toward addressing these complex issues comprehensively.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc4NTbSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3ODU2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:30:00","Intergovernmental panel on climate change  Climate Change impact, adaptation in water, agriculture  The monsoon paradox  Unequitable impacts of the climate risks  For example, the class difference can be simply understood as the heat waves do not affect those who have the luxury of working indoors and in air-conditioned spaces while it has a profound impact on day laborers or people who are out in the fields. The additional layers of caste and gender are other important dynamics around which these vulnerabilities actually manifest.    No wheat crop will be able to endure when temperature reaches 50˚C in March and we are close to that    For example, there are many communities just like the one in Ladakh who are solely dependent on the ice capped Himalayas are currently facing a huge water scarcity as climate change is resulting in the variability in the water availability in these regions.  Climate change extremes, adaptation in India Subimal argued that unlike the western countries where there is a continuous fight to prove that climate is changing, in India there is comparatively more acceptance about and people/policymakers are looking for solutions and adaptive tools to improve the adaptive capacity. Climate extremes are realized under 2 situations, i.e., hot extremes or heat waves, and precipitation extremes (floods and droughts).  Anthropogenic activities have led to an increase in heat waves in the South Asian region. We are already living in a 1.2˚C world and the situation will be out of our hands beyond that. This simply suggests that adaptation also has its own limits.  For example, no wheat crop will be able to endure when the temperature reaches 50˚C in March and we are already close to that. The major ways in which people are adapting are changing cropping patterns on farms, irrigation as well as water and soil moisture conservation. However, despite all the efforts, we will have to focus on cutting down our emissions.  Many studies show rising trends in terms of extreme precipitation in South Asia however, many scientists have limited agreement to say that human contribution has resulted into change of this extreme precipitation. This is because, precipitation is a very difficult variable as it is extremely difficult to predict it. Indian Monsoon has seen a lot of periodicities and because of that the mean looks very similar but extremes have increased so essentially. The low to medium rainfall have reduced resulting into extremes such as more soil moisture and drought.  The concept of compound extends, which means when two of the extents are occurring together like sea level rise and storm surge or precipitation in combination with strong winds, seems inevitable for now. Such extends are critical in terms of planning for adaptation to disaster related risks.  The IPCC Sixth Report suggests that the Indian coast will be under the combined threat of increasing cyclones plus extreme rainfall plus storm surge and plus sea level rise. To deal with such complex issues, some major strategies identified are:  Urban flood forecasting  Flood risk forecasting considering the vulnerability and exposure kind of component  Flood evacuation Urbanization caused due to increasing migration into the floodplains has substantially increased the trend of devastation due to floods in a developing country like India. For example, in Chennai and the surrounding suburban areas, torrential rainfall associated with low-pressure systems engulfed the city during December 2015, affecting over 4 million people along with economic damages that costed around 3 billion USD.  In view of the above-mentioned extreme event and disturbance in Chennai, it was felt necessary that an expert system be designed for flood forecasting along with flood inundation maps and possible means of flood management through appropriate interventions for dealing with any such future events (  Predictions in Flood evacuation is a very complicated process and combining it with situations such as Covid19 makes it even more critical. For example, when the cyclone Amphan was about to hit the coast of Odisha during the spread of coronavirus, the authorities had no idea how to carry out the evacuation as the risk of spread of virus was also to be considered.  Talking in terms of preparation for forecasting and evacuation as part of adaptation is stressed by scientists all over. Forecasting the risks already becomes part of adaptation to climate change impacts.  Water sustainability for adaptation to climate change Vimal argued that human induced climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water cycle since the mid-twentieth century. Anthropogenic activities have further driven detectable large-scale changes. Local and regional water cycle responses are also influenced due to unplanned land-use changes and over exploitation of ground water for irrigation.  Under these circumstances, when already known that the precipitation projections are very complex, it is a huge challenge for policymakers to find out most suitable strategies for adaptation.  Water sustainability and adaptations to climate change involves understanding the inter-relationship between climate and human interventions (aerosols, Land-use changes and unsustainable irrigation practices) affect the changes and variability in the summer monsoon. This is also linked with the capacity of ground and surface water sources in future. A major reason in the case of India is also the presence of aerosols.  Most of the projections say that there will be increased rainfall in the future but more than 80% of the country-level flash droughts occurred during the monsoon season in India.  Similarly, four out of six homogeneous precipitation regions experienced more droughts during the monsoon season than the non-monsoon season  During the drought years when groundwater recharge goes down, abstraction goes up with roughly 15 to 20% increase in pumping and about 20 to 30% decrease in recharge. This combined with extremely warm conditions put pressure on the groundwater systems.  It is therefore, very important to work on the prediction models and understand whether future monsoon will be able to recharge the ground water sources to explore and plan to re-establish some of the natural water cycles in the drought prone areas in India.  Conclusion Water remains at the center of adaptation to climate change. We need to certainly do more to know the impacts of climate change on and device technologies such as early warning systems and real-time monitoring besides crucial policy changes on water, agriculture, energy and even lifestyle. Considering agriculture as a profession to explore innovation is extremely helpful to get over the social taboo of class-based profession and solutions.  We have to improve our climate services which is an urgent challenge on hand. Addressing water services through SDG 05 and SDG12 are certainly way out. Importantly, we have to see development not in silo from adaptation.  The development has to be in a way that helps us adapt and become more resilient. Also, important is to resolve the dilemmas involved in decoding valuable reports like IPPCC into simple decisions, actions or suggestions for people at large. For example, forecasting and evacuation strategies are crucial.  For humanity, the biggest challenge and task on hand is to work on the long-discussed (not yet well negotiated) disparity in the society through the impacts. The focus on vulnerable communities to have sustainable development as climate distress is now more about disparity and discrimination. Adaptation is not only optimism but it is only the way out from the biggest threat to the existence of (human) life on earth.  *** Wednesdays.for.Water is an initiative of the Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.  ---  *Independent scholar and fellow at ED(R)C Ahmedabad and WforW Foundation; **Entrepreneur, researcher, educator, speaker, mentor. Environmental Design Consultants, Ahmedabad (www.mansee.in and www.wforw.in) Hence, climate change impacts are not only about physics but equally about justice and equity issues. In addition to micro scale at a macro scale, often those who are most vulnerable and are facing the maximum impacts are actually the ones who have not even contributed to carbon emissions or global warming.For example, there are many communities just like the one in Ladakh who are solely dependent on the ice capped Himalayas are currently facing a huge water scarcity as climate change is resulting in the variability in the water availability in these regions.Subimal argued that unlike the western countries where there is a continuous fight to prove that climate is changing, in India there is comparatively more acceptance about and people/policymakers are looking for solutions and adaptive tools to improve the adaptive capacity.

To deal with such complex issues, some major strategies identified are:Urbanization caused due to increasing migration into the floodplains has substantially increased the trend of devastation due to floods in a developing country like India. For example, in Chennai and the surrounding suburban areas, torrential rainfall associated with low-pressure systems engulfed the city during December 2015, affecting over 4 million people along with economic damages that costed around 3 billion USD.In view of the above-mentioned extreme event and disturbance in Chennai, it was felt necessary that an expert system be designed for flood forecasting along with flood inundation maps and possible means of flood management through appropriate interventions for dealing with any such future events ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ).Predictions in Flood evacuation is a very complicated process and combining it with situations such as Covid19 makes it even more critical. For example, when the cyclone Amphan was about to hit the coast of Odisha during the spread of coronavirus, the authorities had no idea how to carry out the evacuation as the risk of spread of virus was also to be considered.Talking in terms of preparation for forecasting and evacuation as part of adaptation is stressed by scientists all over. Forecasting the risks already becomes part of adaptation to climate change impacts.Vimal argued that human induced climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water cycle since the mid-twentieth century. Anthropogenic activities have further driven detectable large-scale changes. Local and regional water cycle responses are also influenced due to unplanned land-use changes and over exploitation of ground water for irrigation.Under these circumstances, when already known that the precipitation projections are very complex, it is a huge challenge for policymakers to find out most suitable strategies for adaptation.Water sustainability and adaptations to climate change involves understanding the inter-relationship between climate and human interventions (aerosols, Land-use changes and unsustainable irrigation practices) affect the changes and variability in the summer monsoon. This is also linked with the capacity of ground and surface water sources in future. A major reason in the case of India is also the presence of aerosols.Most of the projections say that there will be increased rainfall in the future but more than 80% of the country-level flash droughts occurred during the monsoon season in India.Similarly, four out of six homogeneous precipitation regions experienced more droughts during the monsoon season than the non-monsoon season (Mishra et al., 2020). Low intensity rainfall has declined across the country and this is a significant change because that is crucial for groundwater recharge.During the drought years when groundwater recharge goes down, abstraction goes up with roughly 15 to 20% increase in pumping and about 20 to 30% decrease in recharge. This combined with extremely warm conditions put pressure on the groundwater systems.It is therefore, very important to work on the prediction models and understand whether future monsoon will be able to recharge the ground water sources to explore and plan to re-establish some of the natural water cycles in the drought prone areas in India.Water remains at the center of adaptation to climate change. We need to certainly do more to know the impacts of climate change on and device technologies such as early warning systems and real-time monitoring besides crucial policy changes on water, agriculture, energy and even lifestyle. Considering agriculture as a profession to explore innovation is extremely helpful to get over the social taboo of class-based profession and solutions.We have to improve our climate services which is an urgent challenge on hand. Addressing water services through SDG 05 and SDG12 are certainly way out. Importantly, we have to see development not in silo from adaptation.The development has to be in a way that helps us adapt and become more resilient. Also, important is to resolve the dilemmas involved in decoding valuable reports like IPPCC into simple decisions, actions or suggestions for people at large. For example, forecasting and evacuation strategies are crucial.For humanity, the biggest challenge and task on hand is to work on the long-discussed (not yet well negotiated) disparity in the society through the impacts. The focus on vulnerable communities to have sustainable development as climate distress is now more about disparity and discrimination. Adaptation is not only optimism but it is only the way out from the biggest threat to the existence of (human) life on earth.Wednesdays.for.Water is an initiative of the WforW Foundation , a think tank, built as a Citizens Collective. The idea of Wednesdays.for.Water is to connect the water worries and wisdom with the water warriors through dialogues/discussions/debates. The objective is to get in conversations with policy makers, practitioners, researchers, academicians besides the youth towards water conservation and management. The other team members of WforW are, Prof. Bibhu P Nayak (TISS-Hyd), Dr. Fawzia Tarannum (Climate Reality India) Ganesh Shankar and Vasantha Subbiah (FluxGen-Blr), Megha Gupta, Monica Tewari, Harshita Pathak, Proshakha Maitra, Monami Bhattacharya, Anubhuti Shekhar (ED®C-Ahmd), Vandana Tiwari, Kalpana Patel, and counting.

The WforW Foundation social media are reachable at Instagram ---  Climate change induced devastations of all the life forms on earth have begun by hampering the natural processes and their ability to adapt. Water, which has its own natural process of availability through water cycle is heavily impacted. Climate change is directly affecting the ability to predict the periodic availability of water which forms the basis of life on earth.According to UNICEF , around 74 per cent of natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were water-related, including droughts, floods and cyclones. The frequency and intensity of such events are only expected to increase with climate change.In addition, the rising water epidemics comprising of almost 80% of world diseases ( World Health Organization, WHO ) is making water a serious issue equivalent to pandemic. The increasing natural disasters and diseases have to be further seen through the lens of inequity in access to water and sanitation. In aggregate, climate crisis can be considered as most manifested in water crisis.Much of the climate crisis discussions, debates and discourses now are officially maneuvered through the reports and meetings. As the Seventh Assessment Report of the IPCC and meeting are in the making, we took an opportunity last year to dig into the nuances of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 2022 with a few contributing authors.The Wednesdays.for.Water conversations titled, ‘ Climate Change and the IPCC report ’, discussed some of the water concerns that are covered in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 2022 . The session speakers are Dr. Aditi Mukherji Prof. Subimal Ghosh and Prof. Vimal Mishra and the session is moderated by Dr Mansee Bal Bhargava.Through the discussion with the authors during the session, we also get to understand the current approach of how water is perceived, studied and conveyed across disciplines, sectors and regions with respect to climate change and crisis.The IPCC , alias Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. It provides regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation.The IPCC was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The objective is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC reports are key inputs into international climate change negotiations.The IPCC is divided into three Working Groups. The scope of Group I is on The Physical Science Basis of Climate Change, Group II is on Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, and Group III is on Mitigation of Climate Change.Climate Crisis is Water Crisis yet water is neglected in most climate change negotiations. Climate change has led to changes in all layers of the water cycle, be it precipitation in the form of rainfall or snowfall, evapotranspiration or melting of Glacier, each of those components of the water cycle has been affected.Since water is the basis of life, these impacts in the water cycle have transferred to almost every aspect of social-economic, culture and even politics in the society. A huge evident is on the sector that is humanly created, we are totally dependent on and that it is entirely dependent on water, i.e., Agriculture.Though in the urban areas people experience climate change through extreme heat but when it comes to agriculture, climate change is experienced through delayed monsoon due to higher variability in rainfall, floods and droughts.Mitigation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is currently a known strategy to combat climate change, however water also plays a critical role in adaptation through strategies such as, irrigation, rainwater harvesting, other water conservation and management approaches. ‘If mitigation is about carbon, then adaptation is about water’, Aditi has a strong argument to defend the phenomena.With variability in the duration of rainfall, the amount of precipitation is also adversely impacted. Heavy precipitation is increased over many areas in the world and approximately over 700 million people globally are experiencing heavier precipitation conditions as compared to 1950s.At the same time, 700 million people globally are seeing longer dry spells conditions as compared to 1950s. The dry spells have increased creating the paradox of monsoon, i.e., more rain but also longer drier spells. Thus, concurrent appearance of floods and droughts of is now common in climate change.Both result in crisis to water, sanitation and importantly agriculture. For example, the drought of 2017 across Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya and Eastern Africa was a result of similar phenomenon that contributed to extreme food insecurity where human induced climate change is likely the main driver.Along with creating more intense droughts and floods, the ability of the earth’s atmosphere to hold more water vapor can also amplify the warming effect of climate change. This is because water vapor, the gaseous form of water, is considered a greenhouse gas.The drought of 2017 in the Northern Plains of USA where the chances of drought increased due to increased evapotranspiration which was clearly due to climate change. It is severely affecting the agricultural practices and pushing people to rethink and explore new approaches.The IPCC report identifies four major climate risks across South Asia which in combinations and combined altogether have devastating effects, heat stress, water scarcity, food security, and flood risk.Exposure to extreme heat will increase heat-related morbidity and mortality along with decreased labor productivity. With rising temperature, lack of access to water for irrigation will result in decrease in addition to the rising drought.In India, 20% possible decline in availability of water for agriculture may impact rice production up to 30% by 2050. Higher warming also means higher flood risks and especially coastal population severely affected. All these attributes to infrastructure losses, crop damages and increased diseases, epidemics and pandemics.Ironically, the climate impacts and risks are uneven and are mediated by non-climatic factors and not everybody will face these climate risks equally due to the unequal society that we have built over the time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJ2aWV3Lm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1L2NsaW1hdGUtaW1wYWN0LXJpc2stdW5ldmVuLWR1ZS10by5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We are off the map.  In general, the response has been disinterest. It’s not that nobody cares, but it’s either too terrifying or the rest of the social dysfunctionality is too crushing for any real response.  On the radio one morning last week, the items were: A celebration of the number of cruise ships visiting Orkney; a celebration of the number of American tourists visiting Scotland, and the blossoming number of transatlantic flights; news that the proposed bottle deposit scheme will be dropped; extended coverage of the relationship break-up between Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby; and the breaking news that Eddie Murphy is lined up to be Inspector Clouseau in a Pink Panther reboot.  None of this makes any sense.  The media we consume reflects our general air of complete indifference but also confusion.  Extreme weather events are being experienced across the world, in Italy, the Formula One grand prix scheduled for this weekend has been cancelled, and at least nine deaths have been reported so far as torrential rain submerged the dried-out landscape of the Emilia-Romagna region, forcing thousands to evacuate.  In Nunavut, Canada, temperature records were broken last weekend. Last Saturday a temperature of 21.2C (70F) was recorded by a weather station next to Hudson Bay, beating the previous record of 14.5C by an astonishing 6.7C.  This pattern of drought and torrential rain is seen everywhere.  In Somalia, the torrential rain and floods, coming on top of the country’s worst drought in four decades, have forced 250,000 people to leave their homes.  If you think the “migrant crisis” is a problem now, you haven’t really thought this through.  In Australia, following the example of our own lovely government, the Government has rushed through emergency legislation against climate activists. The move – which appears to have been hashed out on talkback radio on Thursday morning, comes after the mining and energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, told the industry the state government was “at your service”.  South Australia’s minister for energy and mining has told a conference of the oil and gas industry in Adelaide that his state government is “at your disposal”.  Koutsantonis made the extraordinary comments during his address to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association national conference last Monday morning.  He said oil and gas companies were needed to achieve net zero by 2050, claiming “we cannot transform our economy to net zero without this industry”.  “The South Australian government is at your disposal, we are here to help, and we are here to offer you a pathway to the future,” he said.  We knew, of course, that our political class is aligned with, and often funded by, the fossil fuel industry, but as the breakdown continues, this relationship becomes more exposed and more grotesque.  READ MORE: British army veteran trapped in UK asylum system tells of 'disrespect'  AS the state of the climate emergency becomes more stark, a new pattern is emerging, where “ordinary people” are protected from “disruptive protesters” so they can go about their lives, get to work, and so on.  In the populist playbook, now not confined to some far-right conservative government but absolutely normalised and mainstreamed, the anger that should be directed at government intransigence, corporate greenwashing, and general inertia is redirected at the bloody environmentalists.  The new Australian laws, which threaten to impose fines up to A$50,000 and possible three-month jail terms where a person “intentionally or recklessly obstructs the free passage of a public place” are of course mirrored here at home.  The new Public Order Act 2023 has been designed to allow the police to shut down every form of effective protest.  It is not just completely repressive; nor is it that it specifically imposes blanket bans on protests against new roads, fracking, or any other oil and gas works – it operates on the basis of “pre-crime”. That is, it is going to arrest you and imprison you for an anticipated crime. This is not dystopian sci-fi. This is now.  Even as the undercover policing inquiry continues to reveal appalling abuses by police spying on peaceful campaigners – the police are being given new unprecedented powers of arrest and surveillance.  READ MORE: If United for Independence wins a majority of the seats, we claim that as a mandate  As George Monbiot has pointed out: “These are the state-of-emergency laws you would expect in the aftermath of a coup. But there is no public order emergency, just an emergency of another kind, that the protesters targeted by this legislation are trying to stop: The collapse of Earth systems. We are being compelled by law to accept the destruction of the living world.”  Intelligent, respected friends on my timeline tell me that the environmental movement is the most influential political movement of our time, and that net zero is being achieved.  To point out that this simply isn’t true and doesn’t relate to the realities of our predicament provokes anger and resentment.  How can we justify or understand such complacency? I suppose, at some level, we want to suppress this reality. We want to celebrate a record number of cruise ships and American tourists, and that bloody recycling scheme sounds terrible, doesn’t it?  The Scotsman, always with its finger on the pulse, has a story in its “Environment” section: “Climate change: Are Spain, Portugal, and the rest of the Mediterranean getting too hot for a summer holiday?”  Mediterranean countries are suffering from catastrophic climate change.  But rather than write a story in your “Environment” section about what that might actually mean for the people who live there, the story is parsed as a problem for us “Brits”.  The problem is NOT about climate catastrophe or that parts of Europe are becoming unliveable, the problem is an inconvenience to our holy right to fly away for our summer hols.  We are, of course, complicit in sustaining these fantasies and these narratives. Like with politicians, we get the media we deserve. It’s comforting to think that if Spain gets too hot, we can just fly somewhere else, or that, despite the evidence, we are probably on course for net zero, whatever that means.  It’s comforting to think that the establishment of draconian new police laws won’t affect you and that new powers will be put to good use by the trusted authorities.  As we break 1.5 degrees, believe that if you will.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsLnNjb3QvcG9saXRpY3MvMjM1MzY0NjMud29ybGQtYnVybnMtdWstbWVkaWEtcG9pbnRzLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlcy1ob2xpZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-11-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T19:39:02","Finding solutions to climate change, conflict in Mideast are urgent challenges for COP28  DUBAI: With Earth on the precipice as the devastating impacts of climate change loom ominously, it has become an urgent imperative to respond to this rapidly transforming world. As the international community prepares for the 28th Conference of the Parties, or COP28, hosted by the UAE, it is crucial to underscore the significance of this global gathering in addressing the complex interplay between climate resilience and conflict-affected regions.  A recent policy report released jointly by the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, and the Norwegian Red Cross, sheds light on the alarming exacerbation of humanitarian needs in the region. This report, titled “Making Adaptation Work: Addressing the compounding impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and conflict in the Near and Middle East,” sheds light on the dire situation faced by communities in the region.  The ICRC report emphasizes that climate change is not solely an environmental issue but a significant threat to human security, further exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The report highlights the intricate connections between marginalized communities, armed conflicts, and humanitarian crises, emphasizing the urgent need to address these interconnected challenges.  To delve into the intricate interdependencies between climate resilience, conflict-affected regions, and the imperative need for climate financing, a panel of experts convened in Dubai recently to explore this multidimensional crisis. The participants of the forum included Clare Dalton, the ICRC’s head of delegation in the UAE, Trond H.G. Rudi, charge d’affaires of the Norwegian Embassy in the UAE, and Helena de Jong, senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team.  Climate financing for conflict-affected regions  In conflict-affected countries, the challenge lies not only in combating climate change but also in navigating complex socio-political dynamics. Dalton emphasized that climate financing must be effectively channeled to countries grappling with conflict. The outcome she hopes to see from COP28 in the UAE is that “climate financing is better directed to countries experiencing conflict in ways that they can practically apply and use.” However, the current state of affairs presents obstacles, such as unreliable banking systems and numerous other factors that impede effective climate financing.  The report sheds light on the formidable barriers faced in accessing multilateral climate finance for state-led adaptation projects in conflict-affected countries. These challenges materialize as a result of stringent governance prerequisites and a certain aversion toward investing in volatile contexts.  As of January 2022, a mere 19 single-country projects in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have successfully secured funding approval, with the disbursed amount accounting for less than 0.5 percent of the global allocation of climate project funds. This stark disparity underscores the pressing need to address the limited access and utilization of climate financing in conflict-affected regions.  To overcome these obstacles, Dalton advocates for the collaboration of all sectors of society, emphasizing the necessity for concerted efforts in order to develop tangible, implementable solutions.  While the ICRC acknowledges that it operates at the periphery of climate negotiations, it recognizes the necessity of addressing climate change due to its impact on the regions it serves. Achieving this requires tangible strategies and concrete actions that go beyond mere agreement on the importance of adaptation.  “It’s not the fact that we all agree this needs to happen, but it’s the how. What are some very concrete ways that this could happen tomorrow because it’s needed then after the COP. And I think that happens in two ways because it’s not just in the form of negotiations, but it’s also in providing the space for actors to come together and look at some of these issues. So I think my second expectation is that we find a way to do that. You know, the remaining question is who can help us achieve that outcome. So yeah, money in places like Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, and any of these places that need that support,” Dalton said.  Dalton also touched on how small-scale initiatives play an important role in building community resilience amidst the challenges associated with the de-prioritization of climate action in conflict-affected settings, citing solutions such as education on sustainable agricultural practices, and the distribution of climate-resilient seed varieties to strengthen food security and build community resilience.  Armed conflicts exert a dual impact on the environment, both directly and indirectly, with profound consequences for human well-being. Such conflicts erode environmental governance structures and disrupt societal order, thus perpetuating the conditions conducive to environmental degradation. Consequently, the direct environmental harm caused by conflict and the subsequent degradation of ecological systems undermine the availability of natural resources, rendering communities more susceptible to the repercussions of climate change.  The report presents compelling instances that highlight how deliberate acts of environmental degradation can heighten the immediate jeopardy faced by significant population groups. A notable example is the seizure of Iraq’s Mosul Dam in 2014, which precipitated a looming risk of dam collapse. The accompanying threat to intentionally destroy the dam and flood downstream Baghdad underscores the urgent requirement for increased vigilance and accountability in safeguarding critical infrastructure systems and protecting vulnerable communities.  Dalton highlighted the imperative of engaging with the inhabitants of conflict-affected regions, acknowledging their lived experiences and incorporating their perspectives into climate resilience initiatives, stating: “We need to listen to those people about what changes they’ve seen, about what solutions they perceive might be.”  This approach recognizes the significance of local knowledge and ensures that adaptation strategies are contextually relevant and responsive to the specific challenges faced by these communities. By fostering connections between local, national, regional and global levels, a comprehensive and integrated framework can be established, incorporating diverse solutions and approaches to address the multifaceted issues arising from climate change and conflict.  “Communities need to understand how they can be part of the solution as well and what they can do in their own way not to make the situation any worse. And that’s exactly the same for humanitarians. We have that ‘do no harm’ principle. How can we respond to people’s needs but without making it any worse for them in terms of the assistance we give?” she said.  Revisiting climate-finance priorities  The report draws attention to the discrepancies between climate finance flows, vulnerability to climate change, and countries torn by conflict. De Jong, the senior advisor of the UAE COP28 team, highlighted a distressing statistic: out of the 46 countries listed as least developed, 22 are affected by conflict and fragility.  Paradoxically, these conflict-ridden nations receive the least amount of climate finance, exacerbating their vulnerability to both conflict and climate change. This predicament perpetuates a vicious cycle, hindering governments’ capacity to tackle these intertwined challenges effectively. To break this cycle, De Jong advocates for a paradigm shift in climate financing, with a renewed focus on prioritizing conflict-affected nations. She highlights the importance of engaging climate finance providers, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, and peacebuilding actors in finding solutions.  “This is something that we would like to see changed. It’s not easy. This is a fairly complicated problem. But the advantage of focusing on this as a COP28 presidency is that we can talk to all these climate finance providers, so we can talk to the multilateral development banks, and we can talk to humanitarian actors and peacebuilding actors in this space to really bring all of them together to look at the solutions. Because the solutions are there. We know that there are plenty of actors that are able to work in these settings,” De Jong said.  Global pact for climate adaptation  To address this imbalance, De Jong proposes a paradigm shift in climate financing, with a renewed focus on prioritizing conflict-affected nations. She highlights the importance of engaging climate finance providers, multilateral development banks, humanitarian organizations, and peacebuilding actors in finding solutions. A global pact that includes actionable solutions such as streamlined application procedures, adjusted eligibility criteria for conflict-affected actors, and increased flexibility in project locations could drive progress in climate adaptation efforts.  “It won’t be all different at COP28, but we do really want to see a very big step forward at COP28. And this could, for example — and that would be my dream outcome — be in the form of some sort of global pact that all of these actors would sign up to that doesn’t include just principles that we all agree on, but that also would include at least a couple of solutions to these issues,” De Jong said.  “Our proposal is mainly the global pact that I mentioned. So this would focus more, I guess, on changes in the policy spectrum. But it could, for example, also include like a regional capacity-strengthening facility that would help governments apply and develop strong adaptation projects that would then basically build a pipeline of adaptation projects which would help them in the long run, so it wouldn’t necessarily include a fund,” De Jong said.  With the presidency of COP28, the UAE aims to create a platform that brings together various actors to collectively explore solutions. De Jong stresses the need to leverage existing momentum for change, emphasizing that COP28 is a stepping stone toward addressing these complex issues comprehensively.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDc3MTYvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3NzE2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T19:53:18","The networks use code words, aliases, encrypted messages, burner phones and other tactics to disguise their activity. Most participants don't know one another, or any specifics beyond their role in the chain that ultimately provides information and the abortion pills endorsed by the World Health Organization.    Some Latin American countries -- Argentina, Colombia, Mexico -- are widening access to abortion, while many U.S. states are restricting it. Honduras doesn't enforce its ban as strictly as its neighbors, but the possible punishment of up to six years in prison is a constant threat.  WHAT DOES HONDURAN LAW SAY?  Honduras' total abortion ban dates to 1985. Previously, abortion was permitted in three instances: rape, risk to the mother or nonviability of the fetus.  After the 2009 coup d'état that removed then-President Manuel Zelaya, husband of current President Xiomara Castro, the emergency contraceptive pill was banned. It marked the start of several administrations linked to ultraconservative churches.  In 2021, an amendment to add the abortion ban directly to the constitution was adopted. The measure also increased the number of lawmakers needed to change that part of the constitution. It cannot be ""repealed or modified"" by other legal provisions, according to the text.  HOW DO THE NETWORKS WORK?  Activists learn tricks of the trade little by little. ""Now there is less naiveté and more technology, virtual phone numbers, disappearing messages,"" said an activist with 12 years of experience.  Some women seeking abortions call a hotline publicized on the internet as ""La Línea."" They're asked questions to try to confirm the request is real and not an attempt to track down activists. Later, calls are triangulated; sometimes phone chips are switched to avoid identifying numbers.  Other women learn about the networks via hushed word of mouth. Either way, women seeking abortion help are ultimately put in touch with the person who will be her guide, introduced via pseudonym.  The guide asks basic health questions, including how far along the pregnancy is, and requests that an ultrasound be sent through a secure application. Then the challenge is obtaining the pills – never referred to as medication abortions, or with their pharmaceutical names, but as ordinary objects, code names that change from group to group.  The networks often sneak misoprostol and mifepristone in from Mexico.  WHY IS THERE SO MUCH FEAR IF NO WOMEN ARE KNOWN TO BE CURRENTLY IMPRISONED?  With the law as it is, the threat of prison is always there.  Women also worry they'll be stigmatized or shamed, sometimes by those closest to them, because of social pressures and the enormous influence of the Catholic and Protestant churches.  There are criminal consequences outside prison. Some women may be banned from leaving the country or may be unable to obtain the criminal record clearance needed for most employment.  Some activists say they received intimidating and threatening messages, sent anonymously to their phones and generally coinciding with political instability. They also say some women have fled the country over harassment and legal complaints.  The Honduras Gynecologists Association says the current legislation is inconsistent with science and leaves doctors vulnerable to accusations of violating the constitution every time they save a woman's life.  ARE THESE KINDS OF MEDICAL ABORTIONS SAFE?  The use of the abortion pills is endorsed by the World Health Organization.  The network makes sure each woman has a guide during her abortion who can monitor how it is going remotely and respond to questions, in an attempt to make it as safe as possible.  But advocates say that forcing these abortions to take place in secret always implies risks. If there is a problem and the woman has to seek medical care, if there's clear evidence of an abortion, doctors are obligated by law to report it to authorities.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd2d4YS50di9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC90YWtlYXdheXMtZnJvbS1hcHMtcmVwb3J0LW9uLXNlY3JldGl2ZS1uZXR3b3Jrcy1oZWxwaW5nLXdvbWVuLWNpcmN1bXZlbnQtaG9uZHVyYXMtYWJvcnRp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Their friendship has become a symbolic bridge between Asian Americans and the African American communities.  We can’t oversimplify the complexities that exist in building friendship and solidarity between our two communities. However, it is important to remember the historical interactions that Yuri reminded us of — to give direction and fortification to our struggles.  The rest of this article is Yuri’s own words, as this occasion is most befitting to hear what she wanted you to know. The following is from a talk Yuri gave at the “African/Asian American Roundtable” at San Francisco State University on Oct. 1, 1997.  “African/Asian, Black American/Asian American Interactions in History Bring Linkages of Diverse Peoples and Areas”  Yuri Kochiyama on the occasion of her 88th birthday, San Francisco, June 2009. Yuri is surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren (on stage behind her) and friends. (Photo by Mary Uyematsu Kao)  There has been much history where people have interacted without violence and bloodshed; exchanged resources through friendly and peaceful relationships; especially between China and Africa from about the 11th century. This story is not well known.  True history has often been hidden, obscured, lied about, distorted. It is up to students, progressive scholars, and truth seekers to “dig into history” and find the gems. It will be an exciting task. And many young people, filmmakers, and researchers are doing it.  Several years ago I had the good fortune to run into Steve Wong, who once owned the People’s Bookstore in San Francisco, and who graciously let me borrow two eye-opening books. “Smoked Yankees”1 has letters from Black soldiers in all of America’s wars. The section about Black soldiers who were sent to the Philippines and how they felt is enlightening.  The other book is the “Star Raft: China’s Encounter with Africa,”2 about the time before Christopher Columbus. Yes, history is important!  Remember, Malcolm X used to admonish: “Study history. Learn about yourselves and others. There’s more commonality in all of our lives than we think. It will help us understand one another.” But history, according to the way it is told, can be used as a weapon to divide us further.  The East African slave trade was the slavery of Africans and Asians on European ships in the Indian Ocean, carrying trade that took Asian slaves from Bengal, South India, Sri Lanka, the Indonesian archipelago, the Philippines, China and Japan to Dutch and Portuguese possessions in Asia and Africa.  Between 1870 and 1890, when Congress was debating the infamous Chinese Exclusion Bill, Black leaders like Frederick Douglass and Augustus Straker spoke out against it. They declared that opponents of the Chinese were opponents of Blacks. One lone courageous senator, Blanche K. Bruce, the only African American senator, challenged the bill on the Senate floor. He voted against limiting the rights of the Chinese.  At the turn of the century, there arrived in the U.S. from Japan, a man by the name of Sen Katayama. He is considered the first Asian who attended a Black college in the South. Together with the highly acclaimed Black writer of the Harlem Renaissance period, Claude McKay, he organized the Communist Party in New York. And they went to Moscow together.  Katayama made an indelible mark on the history of ethnic laborers in the U.S., but is sadly unknown even among Asian Americans.  By 1920, another Asian arrived, interacted with Blacks, and in the course of his own nation’s liberation struggle, rose to international fame. He was Ho Chi Minh. Ho lived in the ghettoes of both Chicago and Harlem, became an admirer of the formidable Black leader Marcus Garvey, and supported him. He wrote probably one of the earliest books on racism in the U.S., and racism in Africa, both printed in the Soviet Union in the 1920s.  Considered one of the world’s greatest leaders, Ho struggled unrelentingly for the independence of his nation. He was forced into self-exile for 30 years, but he became the inspiration for anti-Vietnam War activists around the world in the ’60s and ’70s.  In the 1930s, another giant, a Black man, W.E.B. Du Bois, historian, writer, teacher, political leader, this time crossed the water traversing the other way to Asia. He visited China, Manchuria, and Japan. DuBois met Mao and other Chinese leaders. Other famous Black Americans have visited the People’s Republic of China — Langston Hughes, Vickie Garvin, Robert Williams, and several members of the Black Panther Party. Asian American activists who traveled with the Black Panthers to China and North Korea were Pat Sumi, who passed away, and Alex Hing, still an activist in New York.  In the early 1940s, one of the Black leaders who was sent to jail because he would not support the war against Japan was Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam. He and other NOI leaders were all sent to prison. Some years after Elijah Muhammad came out of prison, a wealthy Japanese businessman by the name of Seiho Tajiri was so impressed with Elijah that he joined the Nation of Islam. Tajiri opened two offices called the Japanese/African American Society, one in Chicago and the other in Atlanta, for the purpose of friendship and commercial cooperation between the two people.  One of the most significant events in modern history was the 1955 Bandung Conference, led by Ahmad Sukarno, head of Indonesia. It was the first conference of its kind, attended by Third World leaders, predominantly Africans and Asians, on a diplomatic level. The U.S. government was irked not being invited, but many prominent Blacks attended, like Adam Clayton Powell, Bill Worthy, and Margaret Cartwright, who was the first Black reporter assigned at the U.N.  Malcolm held him in high esteem because Sukarno would not accommodate himself to the white man. Sukarno flung out the words “To hell with U.S. aid!” The U.S. had Sukarno ousted in a coup. Sukarno never regained his position of power, but he brought about the converging of Africans and Asians on world issues.  Also in the ’50s, just as America became embroiled in the Korean War, which the U.S. called a “police action,” a distinguished, charismatic Black spokesman, Paul Robeson, declared at a rally at Madison Square Garden that “it would be foolish for African Americans to fight against their Asian brothers.” (Yes, he called the Koreans his “Asian brothers”). He urged Blacks to resist being drafted for the Korean conflict, adding that if we don’t stop our armed adventures in Korea today, tomorrow it will be Africa. “The place for the Negro people to fight for their freedom is at home.”  Despite Robeson’s multi-gifted talents and dynamism as a football hero, lawyer, actor, singer, and speaker of world reknown, he became a threat to the U.S. Robeson was a lover of humanity; precursor to the revolutionary Black internationalists of the ’60s. You can see why he became such a target for red-baiting and vindictive assaults. And sure enough, there are American troops in Africa today.  The ’60s brought many pertinent events. One that received media attention was the declaration of support for Blacks in America in their struggle by none other than Mao Tse-tung, the highly recognized leader of the emerging People’s Republic of China. During the 1968 riots, he publicly declared: “On behalf of the Chinese people, I hereby express resolute support for the just struggle of the Black people in the U.S.”  The most charismatic Black leader who made an impression on Asian Americans was Malcolm X. His universal appeal was his love and pride of his race, respect for all peoples of color, his strength in his conviction for self-determination, his pursuit for equality, human rights, human dignity, and truth. Young Asian Americans of the ’60s were as much in awe of Malcolm as were other Third World activists.  We must break down barriers and phobias; building working relationships; but also understanding, recognizing that each ethnic group has its own primary issues, and need ethnic privacy and leadership. However, as a united force, together, we can challenge the system where those with wealth and political power live high off the toil and desperation of the marginalized. We must see one another as friends and neighbors and sincerely be concerned of one another’s plights and problems.  If we want to change society, we can first begin by transforming ourselves; learning from one another about one another’s history, culture, dreams, hopes, personal experiences. We’ll find that we seek the same lofty principles and values and visions of the best in society. We must become one for the future of society.  1.

Mandatory credit Kyodo via REUTERS  Heading into the G7 summit, the US and its allies knew they needed to do more to win over global swing nations also courted by China and Russia. The weekend meeting in Japan showed they face a long road ahead.  The gathering in Hiroshima, the site of the first atomic bombing in 1945, showcased the horrors of nuclear weapons following threats by Russian leader Vladimir Putin to use them in Ukraine. A surprise visit from its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave him a chance to appeal to leaders from emerging economies who were also invited to the summit and have taken a neutral – and at times ambivalent – stance on the war.  Yet tangible progress was hard to see for the Group of Seven wealthy nations, even though some Western officials said the bloc was heading in the right direction compared with years past.  Three key invited guests – Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, India's Narendra Modi and Indonesia's Joko Widodo, who collectively oversee a quarter of the world's population – spoke of the need for peace in general terms without endorsing the G7 view on Ukraine. One Brazilian official said the grouping was even hurting peace efforts by clearly taking sides in the war.  Lula was caught off guard by Zelenskyy's appearance, with Brazilian officials describing it as a potential ""trap."" They didn't meet over the weekend despite a plea from French President Emmanuel Macron, who urged Lula to understand that there is an aggressor and a victim in Ukraine, according to an Elysee official. The Brazilian leader had previously said the US and Europe were also to blame for Putin's invasion.  But there was little sign throughout the summit that Lula was moving closer to the G7 stance on Ukraine, according to a Western official who asked not to be identified to discuss confidential information. The official said Lula seemed more focused on providing an off-ramp for Putin and avoiding an escalation in the war rather than on securing Ukraine's territorial integrity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkYml6L3BvbGl0aWNzL2c3LXN0cnVnZ2xlcy13aW4tb3Zlci1zd2luZy1uYXRpb25zLWNvdXJ0ZWQtY2hpbmEtcnVzc2lhLTYzNTY3ONIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkYml6L3BvbGl0aWNzL2c3LXN0cnVnZ2xlcy13aW4tb3Zlci1zd2luZy1uYXRpb25zLWNvdXJ0ZWQtY2hpbmEtcnVzc2lhLTYzNTY3OD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-02-01","11:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T06:26:00","Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.  Howdy. I’m Sarah Wheaton, POLITICO’s chief policy correspondent and author of EU Influence, helming your Brussels Playbook on this Monday morning.  FOR YOUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS  NATIONAL STRIKE IN BELGIUM: It’s probably a good day to work from home if you can. Public transport and some other services may face disruption as trade unions go on strike and around 10,000-15,000 demonstrate in defense of the right to take industrial action and against social dumping.  Practical info: The demonstration will start at 11 a.m. at Gare du Nord and will continue to Gare du Midi. STIB will have live information on Twitter from 6 a.m.; De Lijn on their site. SNCB doesn’t expect issues.  Selfish thought bubble: How will the preponderance of people working from home — due to a strike inspired by limits on workers’ right to strike at the grocery chain Delhaize — affect the usually dreadful Monday evening lines at Playbook’s local Delhaize? Don’t pretend you didn’t have the same thought.  **A message from Google: Google is optimistic about a world with AI. We believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. To us that means developing AI in a way that maximises the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles.**  DRIVING THE DAY: SANCTIONS COMPLICATIONS  EU FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTERS TO DISCUSS UKRAINE’S BLACKLIST: At their meeting in Brussels today, the EU’s foreign affairs ministers will discuss Ukraine’s list of private companies that it claims are “war sponsors” (a number of European firms among them). It’s not technically part of the 11th sanctions package — but the issues are now intertwined.  Naming, shaming, blaming: Hungary and Greece want some of their companies off this list before they agree to the next sanctions package against Russia, several EU diplomats said. The Hungarian OTP Bank is a sticking point for Budapest, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said earlier this month.  ‘Groundless witch hunt’: That’s what another diplomat familiar with the discussion called Kyiv’s blacklist. The diplomat recounted Athens’ complaints that Greek companies were included “without any advance warning” for activities that are legal under the EU’s sanctions. “If Kyiv has any indications of breach of sanctions, they should approach the member states and share the facts, so that they [can] be duly investigated,” the diplomat said, calling the list “totally counterproductive.”  Side show: Others object to tying this discussion to the next sanctions package, which includes measures to tackle circumvention. “It is totally unacceptable to link Ukraine support to the blacklist; there are many countries on the blacklist,” said one EU diplomat, who accused some capitals of holding the sanctions file “hostage” to an unrelated issue.  What’s next? After today’s discussion by ministers, EU envoys will continue negotiations on the next sanctions package at their meeting on Wednesday. Although most EU diplomats played down the chance of striking a quick deal on the package, they remain optimistic of eventually getting an agreement together. “Each package has proven to be more difficult, but we always got there in the end,” said one of the diplomats. Barbara Moens and Jacopo Barigazzi have more on the other sensitive discussions in the sanctions package here.  G7  HIROSHIMA, NON AMOUR: For all the consternation over Kyiv’s blacklist, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has bigger problems when it comes to countries’ economic collaboration with Moscow. On the sidelines of the G7 — held in the Japanese city that’s one of just two examples of the horrors of nuclear war — Zelenskyy tried to twist the arms of two key BRICS leaders who have resisted Western calls to cut ties with Russia and condemn leader Vladimir Putin: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (with some apparent success) and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva (less so).  Why did Zelenskyy’s Lula meeting fall through? “I had an interview, a bilateral one with Ukraine here in this room at 3:15 p.m. We waited and received the information that he was late,” Lula said, according to Reuters. But Zelenskyy “did not show up … Clearly he had appointments and he couldn’t come.”  On the topic of nuclear war: Also in Japan, the U.S. inched closer toward backing a plan to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine — an idea that “carries enormous risks,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister warned. More from Ashleigh Furlong.  Bakhmut status unclear: “I think no,” Zelenskyy said, when asked at a G7 press conference about Russian claims that Bakhmut was fully under Moscow’s control.  COMPROMISE ON CHINA: The main agenda item of the G7 was to hash out language on a collective message to Beijing. As Stuart Lau reports, the result was a call on China to urge Russia to drop its war on Ukraine out of respect for “territorial integrity” (ahem, Taiwan, ahem). A new theme on “domestic interference” criticized Beijing’s overseas police stations targeting dissidents. But there was also language reflecting Germany and France’s more conciliatory approach, with an emphasis on “de-risking, not decoupling.”  Blind quote of the day: Via Stuart: France pushed back on the idea of a tough stance on China, “so much so the Germans didn’t need to say much,” said an anonymous G7 official.  Beijing unhappy: China summoned the Japanese ambassador to register its ire over “hype around China-related issues” at the G7, according to a foreign ministry statement. Reuters has more.  French defense: Critics of French President Emmanuel Macron say his plans to increase military expenditure to €413 billion over the next seven years don’t take account of the nature of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Despite an increase in overall funding, the plan would see France cut back on spending on things like tanks in favor of ploughing money into nuclear weapons and enhancing French capabilities in cyberspace, deep seas and space. A final vote is due before June 14. Clea Caulcutt and Laura Kayali have more on the blind spot in Macron’s military splurge.  THE CONVERSATION THAT DIDN’T HAPPEN: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had to leave Japan early to deal with devastating floods in Emilia Romagna and Le Marche that have left at least 14 dead. But if she’d stayed, according to a (minimally sourced) dispatch from Corriere della Sera, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen would have pulled Meloni aside to discuss the slow pace of talks over Rome’s problems rolling out the EU’s post-COVID stimulus scheme, the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The problem, per economics journalist Federico Fubini, is that key Italian interlocutors with Brussels — including European Affairs Minister Raffaele Fitto — don’t speak English. (Hey, no judgment from us; we read the article with Google Translate.)  EU flood response: Eight other EU countries are sending pumping equipment via the Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission said Sunday.  HAPPENING TODAY — RUSSIA-CHINA MEETUP: Moscow’s Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev will meet in Moscow with Chen Wenqing, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo with responsibilities for police and intelligence, according to Russian state media.  GREEK ELECTION  WIPEOUT VICTORY FOR THE RIGHT: Greece’s ruling conservative party won a landslide victory in an election on Sunday. With about 45 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ New Democracy didn’t quite manage to get a governing majority — so another election is in the works — but the double-digit lead over the main opposition is a striking result.  Left in shock: Alexis Tsipras, head of the left-wing Syriza party, acknowledged that the results were extremely negative for his team. New Democracy’s growing dominance across Greek government, despite facing political headwinds including a spying scandal, spiraling inflation and mounting concerns over the rule of law, paints a bleak picture for opposition parties. Nektaria Stamouli has a full rundown.  Conservatives see vindication in Brussels: This isn’t just a Greek story, if you ask Thanasis Bakolas, a pugilistic former adviser to Mitsotakis now serving as secretary-general of the European People’s Party. “The resounding victory of New Democracy sends a clear and undisputed message all over Europe,” he said, calling the result a “devastating defeat of populism.”  In Brussels specifically, Bakolas continued, the outcome should be read as “a clear message against all those outside Greece who have consistently questioned the quality of Greek democracy and the will of the Greek people.”  WHAT’S NEXT: Mitsotakis is unlikely to bother trying to form a coalition before calling another vote — a new system gives the first-round winner a boost that would likely give New Democracy a governing majority in the next round. As Nektaria reports, that will likely be held on June 25 or July 2.  MEANWHILE, OUT AT SEA: The New York Times published video evidence over the weekend of Greek authorities putting asylum seekers on boats and abandoning them — including kids.  **How can we protect European consumers from soaring energy prices and build a workforce with the skills for a sustainable energy future?

Nothing like a fat fine for a birthday present. On this fifth anniversary week of the EU’s landmark privacy rules, Meta is bracing for what could be the largest fine yet under the General Data Protection Regulation. The Irish Data Protection Commission is expected to decide today on a case on Meta’s transfers of Europeans users’ Facebook data to the U.S.  Reminder: The saga goes back to a decade-old complaint from privacy activist Max Schrems that Facebook is shuttling troves of Europeans’ data back to the U.S., where there’s insufficient protection from spooks’ access. In 2022, the Irish watchdog — which oversees Meta’s compliance with the GDPR — shot down Meta’s attempt at a legal workaround. That verdict was backed up in April by a pan-European group of regulators.  Reels leaving you? Will Meta have to shut down Facebook and Instagram? Unclear, POLITICO’s Clothilde Goujard and Mark Scott tell Playbook — it depends on whether the EU and U.S. can finalize their new data flows deal in time. But it will more broadly send chills down the spines of thousands of other companies relying on the same legal instrument as Meta.  IT’S NOT JUST UKRAINE  MOLDOVA WANTS IN: Almost a year on from being granted EU candidate status, the Eastern European nation of Moldova is piling pressure on Brussels to begin negotiations over its accession to the 27-member bloc. At a rally in the capital, Chișinău, tens of thousands of Moldovans cheered as the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, declared that “Europe is Moldova. Moldova is Europe.”  Russian plot: But the country still has a long way to go in its efforts to crack down on corruption and meet tough criteria for prospective new members. And, worse still, there are warnings that Moscow isn’t prepared to give up its influence in Moldova. In February, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s security services had disrupted Russian efforts to stage a coup against its pro-Western government.  Ball in Brussels’ court: Now, Moldovan President Maia Sandu is pushing for accession talks to begin in the coming months, telling POLITICO that joining the EU “is the best way to protect our democracy and our institutions.” According to Siegfried Mureșan, a Romanian MEP and chair of the Parliament’s delegation to the country, now is the time to ensure stability in the sensitive region because “the safer the Republic of Moldova, an immediate neighbor of the EU, is, the safer we all are.” My colleague Gabriel Gavin is in Chișinău and has the story here.  Selfish thought bubble: The fact POLITICO had a reporter *on the ground* in the Moldovan capital did not prevent your poor substitute Playbooker from being bombarded at home in Brussels on Sunday afternoon with pitches from people who wanted to see the rally mentioned in this newsletter.

BRUSSELS CORNER  REBRANDING BRUSSELS NORTHERN QUARTER: Brussels wants to make its crime-ridden Northern Quarter hip like Saint-Gilles or Châtelain, according to the new city plans for the redevelopment of the business area. Rebranding includes hotels, restaurants, rooftop bars and better connections to the city center — but also a new name, which will be unveiled in a month.  A bit of history: The northern business district was born in the 1960s from an idea to create a “little Manhattan” in Brussels. The transformation required demolition of an urban residential area, ending up in 15,000 inhabitants being forced out without having been provided any alternative for their homes. Following various up and downs, the area has become home to many businesses — including illegal ones, such as drug trafficking.  Drugs? How shocking. Eurocrats have previously expressed outrage at the suggestion of moving to the Northern Quarter. Though their argument that it was simply too full of drugs prompted State Secretary for Urbanism Pascal Smet to suggest some of them spend some time looking in the mirror.

"political coup","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Beijing"", ""Beijing"", ""China""}","2023-05-21T13:10:00","U.S. President Joe Biden meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/File Photo  US President Joe Biden said he expected ties with China to improve ""very shortly"" after a spat over an alleged spy balloon earlier this year derailed relations.  Speaking to reporters on Sunday at the end of the Group of Seven summit in Japan, Biden said the US's move to shoot down a ""silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars worth of spying equipment"" changed the dynamic after his meeting with President Xi Jinping in November last year.  ""I think you're gonna see that began to thaw very shortly,"" Biden said on Sunday. He added that his administration was considering whether to lift sanctions on Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu, whom Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is seeking to meet at an event in June in Singapore.  Biden has previously voiced optimism the two would schedule a long-anticipated phone conversation, though he didn't give any indication on how soon that might take place. Beyond the balloon incident, China has accused the US of seeking to contain its rise by restricting access to advanced technology and providing support to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.  Biden also reiterated that the US would intervene if China moved to invade Taiwan, saying there needs to be a ""mutually agreed"" outcome between Beijing and Taipei.  ""There is clear understanding among most of our allies that, in fact, if China were to act unilaterally, there would be a response,"" Biden said.  China has long opposed any US official engagement with Taiwan, and said again in a statement over the weekend that the matter ""must be resolved by the Chinese.""  ""No one should underestimate the determination, resolve and capability of the Chinese people in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  China also hit back against a G7 initiative to counter ""economic coercion,"" saying the US's sanctions and export controls ""makes the US the real coercer that politicises and weaponises economic and trade relations.""  Micron probe  On Sunday, China said it found serious cybersecurity risks after conducting a review of Micron Technology Inc, and ordered operators of key information infrastructure to stop purchasing the US company's products.  That came shortly after Micron cut a deal with Japan for financial aid to make next-generation memory chips, an agreement that US Ambassador Rahm Emanuel said set a precedent for countering Chinese ""coercion.""  G7 leaders said in a communique released over the weekend that they wanted ""constructive and stable"" relations with China even as they pushed ahead with steps to reduce dependence on Beijing for critical supply chains. The leaders emphasised that they were ""not decoupling or turning inwards,"" saying ""economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying.""

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China's top diplomat Wang Yi in Vienna last week, and China's Commerce minister Wang Wentao next week is set to meet with both US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Washington and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai in Detroit.

"political coup","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Chisinau"", ""Chisinau"", ""Moldova""}","2023-05-22T04:02:25","Over 75,000 Moldovans on Sunday (21 May) rallied in Chișinău in favour of EU membership, with the bid accelerated by Russia’s war in Ukraine and amid fears of Moscow’s increased pressure on the country.  Moldova, a former Soviet republic of 2.6 million people, was granted EU candidate status in June 2022 alongside Ukraine.  ‘EU member by 2030’  “We came to say loudly, confidently and proudly that Moldovans are Europeans!” the country’s President, Maia Sandu, who called the rally, told the crowd, who waved EU flags and chanted pro-European slogans.  “We don’t want to be on the outskirts of Europe anymore,” she said, pledging that Moldova would become an EU member by 2030, adding that “the coming years will be about our transformation”.  “Moldova is rising (…) This is the chance for our people to live in peace and prosperity,” Sandu said.  She added that fulfilling the necessary criteria for joining the EU was “a road of great efforts (…), but it is the only road”.  Speaking alongside Sandu, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said the EU would support Moldova’s bid, adding it was “already ready for European integration”.  “I am here to confirm your choice to Europe, to support you, to emphasise that you need the same protection that the EU gives to all other citizens,” Metsola said, adding in Romanian: “Europe is Moldova. Moldova is Europe.”  “In recent years, you have taken decisive steps, and now you have the responsibility to see it through, even with this war on your border,” Metsola said. “The Republic of Moldova is ready for integration into the single European market.”  Demonstrators asked Moldova’s political leaders to amend the constitution to mention the country’s European orientation.  In parallel, exiled Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, leader of the pro-Russian opposition Shor party, announced his plan for a referendum on Moldova’s foreign policy direction.  Shor, declared a Russian influence agent by the US and sentenced in absentia to 15 years for his involvement in the 2014 theft from Moldovan banks, addressed his followers at smaller, predominantly pro-Russian, competing rallies via video link.  Protection from Russia  Sandu also addressed growing Russian pressure on the country, which already has the breakaway region of Transnistria, to keep the former Soviet republic within its self-declared sphere of influence.  “War is far from us today because Ukrainians are giving their lives. This war clearly shows us that we no longer want to be blackmailed by the Kremlin,” Sandu said, adding, “As EU members, we will not be alone, and we will have security.”  In February, Sandu accused Moscow of backing a coup to try and seize power in the country.  It came after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned that his country’s security forces had disrupted a Russian plot to overthrow Moldova’s pro-Western government.  On 1 June, Moldova is expected to hold its first major European summit, bringing together all 27 EU member state leaders with 20 of the bloc’s immediate neighbours, with regional security and repercussions of Russia’s war expected to feature high on the agenda.  Road to Brussels  Research by Chișinău-based pollster CBS in February found that while almost 54% of Moldovans say they would vote in favour of EU membership, almost a quarter say they prefer closer alignment with Russia.  Meanwhile, citizens were split on who to blame for the war in Ukraine, with 25% naming Russian President Vladimir Putin and 18% saying the US.  Last week, Sandu again asked the EU to begin accession talks “as soon as possible” to protect Moldova from growing threats from Russia.  EU membership, however, could take a decade or more to attain, given the long list of requirements.  ”Helping Republic of Moldova is in the very interest of the EU,” MEP Siegfried Mureșan, vice-president of the European People’s Party Group in the European Parliament, told EURACTIV, speaking from Chișinău.  “The safer the Republic of Moldova, an immediate neighbour of the EU, is, the safer we all are within the borders of the 27 member states of the EU,” Mureșan, who is the chair of the European Parliament‘s Delegation to the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Association Committee, added.  According to Mureșan, Moldovans with Sunday’s pro-EU rally ”have sent a very strong message of European integration, we see that the people of Moldova are united behind this objective.“  “They deserve all our and the EU’s support to ensure the economic stability of the country, tackle the current challenges the country is facing, implement the reforms needed, and continue the EU integration process,“ he added.  Addressing the likely long path towards actual membership of the bloc, Mureșan said this would “come with the understanding that this means reforms and years of work, but they are ready for this, and they are committed“.

"political coup","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-22T02:01:42","(Bloomberg) -- Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s surprise visit to Japan for the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima met a warm public welcome and may bolster enough support for his host Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to prompt him to call an early general election.  Kishida’s coup in hosting the Ukrainian president on his first visit to Asia since Russia’s full-scale invasion adds to broader reputational gains from hosting the global leaders in his hometown of Hiroshima. TV channels went live as Zelenskiy was driven from the airport to the city flattened by the bomb almost 78 years ago, with people taking to the streets to try to catch a glimpse of him.  A poll carried out by the Mainichi newspaper during the two days Zelenskiy was in Japan showed Kishida’s support rate leaped by 9 percentage points to 45%. Another survey by the Yomiuri newspaper over the same time period also found a 9 percentage point surge to 56%.  “It’s obvious they should do it now,” said Shibenobu Tamura, a political analyst and former staffer with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. “The LDP will swing into action.”  Kishida’s approval ratings had already been recovering over the past two months, prompting speculation he would seize the opportunity to set a date for an election. Though no vote need be held until 2025, renewing his mandate while approval is relatively high would shore up his position at the helm of the LDP ahead of a party leadership contest next year.  It would also help him maintain control of his long-ruling LDP amid an internal battle over how to pay for the deeply indebted country’s plans for a 60% hike in defense spending and a doubling of outlays on children and families. Voters struggling with rising prices are mostly opposed to any new tax hikes.  Local media outlets such as Kyodo News have speculated a vote could come as early as late June, after the parliament dominated by Kishida’s ruling party approves a government package of fiscal and policy measures aimed at supporting families and heading off a demographic crisis that poses long-term economic risks.  Hiroshima Visit  Kishida reiterated his denial that he was currently thinking of calling a vote at a press conference after the G-7 summit came to a close Sunday.  In a scene full of symbolism a few hours later, he and Zelenskiy laid flowers together at a monument to the tens of thousands of victims of the 1945 atomic attack, while Zelenskiy told journalists that photographs of the aftermath reminded him of the ruins of Bakhmut and other Ukrainian communities. The only country to suffer a wartime nuclear attack, Japan has repeatedly condemned Russia’s threats to use atomic weapons in its war on Ukraine.  The Japanese premier’s own visit to Kyiv in March helped turn around public opinion, which had slid to dangerously low levels after a series of scandals and mis-steps last year.  The recent warming of long-fraught ties with South Korea has also met with public approval, at least in Japan, as did Kishida’s decision to keep on campaigning in an April by-election after an attempted pipe-bomb attack.  Public support for Ukraine remains strong in a country where many fear a failure to push back against Russia could embolden China to take similar action against the democratically governed island of Taiwan. A survey by the Nikkei newspaper in February found two thirds of respondents said Japan should continue to support Ukraine even if doing so affected jobs and livelihoods.  Still, even with the stock market hitting its highest level since 1990 last week and data showing the economy expanding at a faster pace than expected, Kishida won’t have everything on his side if he does opt to call an election soon.  A $518 Billion Rally Shows Japan Stocks Are All the Rage in 2023  While Kishida’s pledge to bring about wage hikes has yielded some results, persistent inflation has undercut the effect, leaving many voters worse off than before, despite government subsidies on utilities.  The LDP is also set to lose 10 constituencies in rural areas in the latest revision of seat numbers to reflect the ongoing population drift to the cities. Kishida’s party is engaged in a battle with its longtime coalition partner Komeito over which of them will run a candidate in a new constituency that’s been created in Tokyo, according to Jiji Press and other media.  There’s the potential threat from the upstart opposition Japan Innovation Party, also known as Ishin, which showed strength outside its traditional base of Osaka in a series of local elections in April. The right-leaning party favors spending cuts and lower taxes.  “There’s a need for another option,” Osaka governor and prominent Ishin member Hirofumi Yoshimura said in an interview this month. “There will be an election in the next few months and we are preparing quickly to be able to go head-to-head with the LDP.”  --With assistance from Takashi Hirokawa.

"political coup","1945-04-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T09:39:27","Ilya Budraitskis: A few years ago, you wrote The New Faces of Fascism, where you defined post-fascism as a new threat that is simultaneously similar to and different from classical fascism of the 20th century. Post-fascism, as you describe, grows out of the fundamentally new soil of neoliberal capitalism, in which labor movements and forms of social solidarity have been attacked. You emphasize that post-fascism grew out of post-politics as a reaction to technocratic governments that ignore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, your analysis is limited mainly to the European Union and the United States, where fascism results from liberal democracy. Can this approach be expanded to the transformation of authoritarian regimes like the one in Russia, especially after the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine? In Russia, the regime in the first decade of its existence in the early 2000s also presented itself as a technocratic post-political government. It was based on mass depoliticization and lack of political participation in Russian society.  Enzo Traverso: Well, it’s important to emphasize that “post-fascism” is an unconventional analytical category. It’s not a canonical concept like liberalism, communism, or fascism. It’s rather a transitional phenomenon that has not yet crystallized or clearly defined its nature. It can evolve in different directions. Nevertheless, the starting point of this definition is that fascism is trans-historical, transcending the historically framed experience of the 1930s. Fascism is a category that can be useful to define political experiences, systems of power, and regimes that take place after the period between the two world wars. It’s common to speak about Latin American fascism during the military dictatorships of the 1960s and the 1970s.  “Global post-fascism is a heterogeneous constellation in which we can find shared tendencies: nationalism, authoritarianism, and a specific idea of ‘national regeneration’”  That said, when we speak of democracy, it is worth noticing that although Germany, Italy, the United States, and Argentina share this label of liberal democracy, this does not mean that their institutional systems are the same. Nor does it mean that they correspond with Pericles’ democracy in Ancient Athens. So, fascism is a generic term that takes a trans-historical dimension. You are right to say that my book on post-fascism primarily focuses on the European Union, the United States, and some Latin American countries. When I wrote it, Bolsonaro had not yet come to power in Brazil. However, I also wrote that post-fascism could be considered a global category, which tendentially includes authoritarian political regimes such as Putin’s Russia or Bolsonaro’s Brazil. I am not sure that this category can be used to define Xi Jinping’s China, simply because this regime was created by the communist revolution of 1949 (I similarly do not think we could describe Stalin’s Russia as “fascist”). Maybe this category can be used to depict some tendencies that shape Modi’s India or Erdogan’s Turkey and raise legitimate worries. But I do not suggest extending or transposing my analysis of Western Europe to other continents and political systems; I would rather say that Western European post-fascism can be located into a global post-fascist tendency, including regimes with entirely different historical trajectories and pasts. Otherwise, it would be a very problematic way of creating for the umpteenth time a Eurocentric paradigm of fascism, which is not my approach.  The problem of how to define post-fascism, however, still remains after these considerations. Global post-fascism is a heterogeneous constellation in which we can find shared features and tendencies. They are nationalism, authoritarianism, and a specific idea of “national regeneration.” Within this constellation, these tendencies might appear differently combined and in varying degrees. For instance, Putin’s Russia is much more authoritarian than Meloni’s Italy. In Italy, we have a chief of government who proudly claims the fascist past (her own and that of her country), but Italy’s dissident voices are not censured, persecuted, or put to jail like in Russia. There are no Italians who are exiled because their lives are threatened in Italy. This is a significant qualitative difference. Another relevant difference is the relationship to violence. We are speaking about Russia, which is a country involved in a war. The violence displayed by this variety of post-fascist regimes cannot be compared.  There are a lot of relevant discrepancies distinguishing all these forms of post-fascism from classical fascism. Their ideologies and their ways of mobilizing the masses are not the same… The utopian dimension, for instance, which characterizes classical fascism, is utterly absent from current fascism, which is very conservative. We could mention other cleavages.  “Italian post-fascists do not wish to install a dictatorship or to dissolve the parliament, but emotionally and culturally they remain fascist”  Ilya: I would like to go through these features of post-fascism. If I understand you correctly, after reading the book and some of your interviews, you stress that post-fascism came from the crisis of democracy. Democracy not as a normative term, but electoral politics, to be more precise. The difference between classical fascism and post-fascism is that the latter does not challenge democracy. Classical fascism had the task of overthrowing democracy. Post-fascism still tries to use electoral mechanisms. The transformation towards an openly fascist dictatorship should take place through legal institutions. I am interested, in particular, in this moment of transition. You also write in your book that post-fascism can be understood as a stage for the new quality of political regimes with authoritarian or dictatorial features. How do you think this transition differs in different regions? I believe that in Russia fascist tendencies developed from the top. Twenty years ago, elements of the authoritarian regime were already installed, and since then Russia has been transformed into some kind of fascist dictatorship.  Enzo: A straightforward historical overview shows that many authoritarian regimes with fascist features have appeared without mass movements, but were introduced through a military coup, for instance Franco’s regime in Spain or Latin American regimes in the 1960s and the 1970s. They were not supported by a mass movement unlike the canonical examples of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Both Mussolini and Hitler were appointed to power by the King (of the Italian monarchy) and by the President (of the Weimar Republic) respectively, according to their constitutional prerogatives. I don’t think that we can create a compelling or normative fascist paradigm. It is a large category including different ideologies and forms of power.  “Post-fascists win elections because they oppose neoliberalism, but when they come to power, they apply neoliberal policies”  An enormous difference that separates post-fascism from classical fascism is the huge transformation that has taken place in the public sphere. At the time of classical fascism, charismatic leaders had an almost physical contact with their community of followers. Fascist rallies were liturgical moments that celebrated this emotional communion between the leader and its disciples. Today this connection has been replaced by the media, which create a completely different kind of charismatic leadership, at the same time more extended and pervasive, but also more fragile. Nonetheless, we cannot avoid the fundamental question: What does fascism mean in the twenty-first century? All observers constantly face this question: Is Trump/Putin/Bolsonaro/Le Pen/Meloni/Orban fascist? The simple fact of putting this question means that for us it is impossible to analyze all these leaders or regimes without comparing them to classical fascism. On the one hand, they are not fascist tout court; on the other hand, they cannot be defined without being compared with fascism. They are something between fascism and democracy, oscillating between these two poles according to the changing circumstances.  There are also contradictory dynamics. Russian nationalism is going through a process of radicalization, reinforcing these post-fascist tendencies. In Western Europe, the Italian case is emblematic of the opposite tendency. Until very recent times, Georgia Meloni was the only political leader who shamelessly claimed her fascist identity in the Italian parliament. In this she differed from other far-rights in Europe, for example Marine Le Pen, who had explicitly abandoned the ideological and political models of her father by changing the name of her movement (Rassemblement National replacing Front National). Marine Le Pen claimed her belief in democracy, affirming her support to the institutions of the French Republic, and so on, when Meloni celebrated the accomplishments of Mussolini’s Italy. The latter won the elections — thanks to a favorable electoral system and the division of the center-left — not because of her ideological references but rather because she appeared as the only and most coherent adversary of Mario Draghi, the chief of a governmental coalition supported by the European Union.  However, since she came to power, Meloni is conducting the same policies of her predecessor and no longer criticizes the EU institutions. As chief of government, she celebrated the anniversary of the Liberation, the anniversary of the triumph of democracy over fascism that took place on April 25, 1945. Meloni reminds me of those paradoxical figures that, in the 1920s, were called in Germany Vernunftrepublikaner (“republicans by reason”). After the collapse of Wilhelm’s Empire at the end of 1918, they had accepted — by reason — the democratic institutions of the Weimar Republic, but their heart still beat for the empire. Italian post-fascists are a similar case, one century later. They do not wish to install a dictatorship or to dissolve the parliament, but emotionally and culturally speaking they remain fascist. Their fascism requires many adjustments to a changed historical context.  There is also the case of Trump. In 2016, he was a worrying and enigmatic political innovation. During his presidency, and particularly on January 6, 2021, we experienced a significant political turn that revealed a clear fascistic dynamic. Today I am not sure that the Republican Party, that was one of the pillars of the US establishment, can be defined any more as one of components of the American democracy. It is a political party in which very strong post-fascist or even neofascist tendencies have become hegemonic, a political party that puts into question the state of law and the most elementary principle of democracy: the alternation of power through elections.  Ilya: I hypothesize that in countries with a limitation of political power because of oppositional political movements or various state institutions which reduce the power of the president or prime minister, the transformation towards an authoritarian state is more complicated. Whereas in Russia, all the political institutions have lost any source of independence (no parliament, no court, no serious political opposition), and there are no limitations to the actions of the president, the only sovereign. In countries like the US, the president has many obstacles to his independent decision-making and setting of policies, and the president’s decisions are not totally decisive.  Enzo: I agree with you. I am far from idealizing liberal democracy and market society, but there is undoubtedly a difference between the United States, where democracy has existed for two and a half centuries, and Russia, where it has almost never existed. We do not need to mobilize Tocqueville to explain this. In Russia, democracy is the legacy of a few years of Glasnost and Perestroika, at the end of the USSR, as well as a byproduct of the resistance of civil society against an oligarchic power that managed the transition to capitalism three decades ago.  “Post-fascism is reactionary, and as such it is a reaction to neoliberalism”  However, there remains a cleavage between the new radical right and classical fascism that should also be considered: the relationship of post-fascism with neoliberalism, as you said at the beginning of our conversation. My book suggests that one of the keys to understanding the post-fascist wave in Western Europe is its opposition to neoliberalism. Of course, as the case of Meloni proves, it is a very contradictory opposition. They win elections because they oppose neoliberalism, but when they come to power, they apply neoliberal policies. Italy is a great example. Neoliberalism is embodied in Western Europe by the European Union, the European Commission, the Central European Bank, etc. Those institutions are trusted interlocutors for the financial elites, who can (also?) find a compromise with Marine Le Pen, Giorgia Meloni or Victor Orban, without trusting them completely. Emmanuel Macron, Mario Draghi, and Mark Rutte are much more reliable and trusted leaders.  In the US, one key to understanding the Trump election in 2016 was his opposition to the establishment. Hilary Clinton embodied the establishment much more than Trump did, despite the obvious fact that a powerful section of American capitalism supports the Republican Party. Nonetheless, there is an evident tension between Trump — sometimes an opposition — and the most significant elements of neoliberalism. Think of the very bad relationship between Trump and California’s multinational companies, new technologies, and so on. There is also an almost “ontological” or constitutive discrepancy between neoliberalism, which works through the global market, and post-fascism, which is deeply nationalist. Post-fascists demand state interventions and protectionist tendencies that contradict the logic of financial capitalism.  Ilya: My next question is related to what you just said about current capitalism’s neoliberal transformation. You mention in your book that one of the differences between post-fascism and classical fascism is the lack of a project for the future. While classical fascism was a modernist project with a vision of another society (opposite to any emancipatory socialist perspective), post-fascism has no consistent project, only a no-horizon view. There’s an idea that we have to go back to some beautiful past without any vision of the future. This reminds me of one of the main features of neoliberalism. There’s no future, no alternative. Capitalist realism is dominant, as Mark Fischer once pointed out. Another feature is the temporal experience of the post-fascist leaders. People like Putin and Trump are older people. Classical fascism was mostly the movement of the young. Do you think this lack of the future and retrospective, nostalgic element of post-fascism somehow relates to the neoliberal lack of view on the future?  Enzo: You point out some relevant issues. Classical fascism possessed a powerful utopian dimension. It wanted to be an alternative to both liberalism and communism, but it even strived to be a new civilization, something related to a different conception of existence itself. They launched very ambitious projections of society: the myth of the new man, the myth of the “thousand-year Reich,” and so on. This utopian dimension was rooted in the depth of the European and international crisis of capitalism. It does not exist today because capitalism in its neoliberal form appears as an insuperable and indestructible framework. Between the two world wars, there was an alternative to capitalism, created by the Russian Revolution, and communism as a utopian project was able to mobilize millions of human beings. This is a huge difference. Contemporary post-fascist currents are extremely conservative. They wish to save traditional values. They want to return to the traditional idea of a nation, conceived as a cultural, religious, and ethnically homogeneous community. They wish to restore the Christian values on which the history of Europe was built. They want to defend national communities against the invasion of Islam, immigration, etc. They wish to protect national sovereignty against globalism. This does not remind us of the fascist utopianism or Nazi Germany, much more of the German “cultural despair” Kulturpessimismus of the end of the nineteenth century.  “While post-fascism opposes neoliberalism, it is simultaneously rooted in its social structure”  Post-fascism is reactionary, and as such it is a reaction to neoliberalism, which does not wish to come back to national borders and sovereignties. Neoliberal historical temporality is “presentist,” not reactionary. It posits an eternal present that absorbs both past and future: our lives and society must run and can be destroyed if they don’t fit the compelling rules of capital development, according to a temporality rhythmed by the stock exchange, but the general framework of capitalism is immutable. Capitalism was “naturalized,” and this is probably the major achievement of neoliberalism. Post-fascism is an illusory alternative to neoliberalism, just as fascism often depicted itself as “anti-capitalist”; but the difference is that today the ruling classes do not choose this fake alternative. Their institutions are not so deeply unsettled to accept such an option.  The same can be said about its expansionism. Italian fascism wished to conquer new colonies; Nazi Germany wanted to conquer the entire continental Europe. Today’s post-fascism is very xenophobic and racist, but its xenophobia and racism are defensive. They say: we must protect ourselves against the threat embodied by the “invasion” of non-white and non-European immigrants. We are not going to conquer Ethiopia; we are going to protect ourselves from Ethiopian immigration. The comparison between Putin’s aggression of Ukraine and the fascist or Nazi conquests in Europe does not work because Putin’s expansionism wishes to recreate the Russian Empire in Central Europe by reintegrating a country that Russian nationalism has always considered its own vital space, culturally belonging to Russian history. But the Ukrainian war, if we can make a counterfactual comparison, is as if the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 had been stopped in two weeks and the Wehrmacht had to give up occupying Warsaw.  Ilya: I agree that Hitler was much more successful than Putin.  Enzo:The nature of expansion is not the same. The Nazi aggression against Poland was imperialistic and expansionist; the Russian aggression of Ukraine is revanchist and “defensive,” especially considering Kiev’s goal of joining NATO. There are also some relevant demographic differences. In the 1930s, Nazi Germany had, like Russia today, suffered a significant loss of territories and population, but its population was dramatically growing. As for Italy, its population grew despite a structural emigration that weakened its economy. If today Putin embodies an illusory nationalist response to the collapse of 1990, it is also because his defensive expansionism is not supported by a powerful demographic dynamic. Russia is declining and struggling to preserve its status as a superpower. Of course, it has some advantages: nuclear weapons and so on. But economically and demographically speaking, its radicalized nationalism is defensive.  But let me add a last consideration on neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is not only a set of economic policies: free market, deregulation, global economy. It is also an anthropological model, a conduct of life. It is a philosophy and a lifestyle based on competition, individualism, and a particular way of conceiving human relations. In the twenty-first century, this anthropological paradigm has been imposed on a global scale. This means that all post-fascist movements are rooted in this anthropological background. This explains why there are so many significant changes compared with classical fascism. First, we have powerful post-fascist movements led by women. This would have been inconceivable in the 1930s. Second, the movements must accept certain forms of individualism, individual rights, and freedoms. Their Islamophobia, for instance, is sometimes formulated as a defense of Western values against Islamic obscurantism. This way, while post-fascism opposes neoliberalism, it is simultaneously rooted in its social structure.  “The Ukrainian Resistance is conducting a national liberation war that is forcefully plural and heterogeneous”  Ilya: You have mentioned that one of the primary emotions of post-fascism is the defensive line.  In fact, the whole war in Russia was presented by the official propaganda as a defense not just against NATO but also fake values, especially the infiltration of LGBT and gender politics. In this sense, one can say that in this kind of regime, the borders between international politics and domestic politics are blurring. However, we can also see that the neoliberal mindset you have just talked about dominates all explanations of the international situation. Of course, Putin is very much preoccupied in his political imagination with the role of Russia in the global arena. Still, Putin and other Russian officials explain that international relations are a kind of market where you have competition, where the same self-interest paradigm is defining the position of states, where the multipolar world that they advertise instead of American hegemony is the true free market against monopoly. They see the world as the US’s monopoly, which should be challenged by true, honest, fair competition of multiple strong players. How do you see these relations?  Enzo: I am not well equipped to answer this question satisfactorily. Of course, the tenacious and admirable resistance of Ukraine against Russian invasion deserves to be supported, both politically and militarily. I don’t agree with the currents of Western left that denounce Russian aggression and simultaneously refuse to send weapons to Kiev. This seems to me a hypocritical stance. The Ukrainian Resistance is conducting a national liberation war that is forcefully plural and heterogeneous. Like all Resistance movements in Europe during the Second World War, it includes right- and left-wing currents, nationalist and cosmopolitan sensitivities, authoritarian and democratic tendencies. Between 1943 and 1945, the Italian Resistance gathered a large spectrum of forces, going from the communists (the hegemonic tendency) to the monarchists (a small minority), and passing through social-democrats, liberals, and Catholics. In France, Resistance had two souls — De Gaulle and the communists — beside which there were also fighting Catholics, Trotskyists, and a constellation of small (but very effective) organizations of anti-fascist immigrants from Central Europe, Italy, Spain, Turkish Armenia, etc. This diversity is inevitable in a national resistance movement.  Having said that, I am quite pessimistic about the outcome of this conflict. If Putin wins, which is improbable but not impossible (particularly in case of an involvement of China on his side), this will have tragic consequences not only for Russia and Ukraine but also on a global scale. Fascist and authoritarian tendencies will be reinforced in Russia; post-fascist tendencies in Europe and internationally will strengthen equally. On the other hand, a Russian defeat, which is desirable, would mean not only the affirmation of a free and independent Ukraine but also, very probably, an extension of NATO and the US hegemony, which is much less attractive.  The Ukrainian war is often depicted as an entanglement of conflicts: a Russian invasion which is an inacceptable aggression; a self-defense war of Ukraine which wants to be supported; and a Western indirect military intervention which the US aims at transforming into a NATO proxy war. Ten years ago, there was a civil war in Ukraine, which created some premises for the current conflict. This is a very complex situation, in which the left needs to be nuanced. Whereas in Russia we must struggle against Putin and in Ukraine we must struggle against the Russian invasion; in the US and the EU countries we cannot support an extension of NATO or the increase of our military budgets.  “The Western left should prove that it is possible to fight against the neoliberal order without being the friends of Putin”  This situation is not completely new. During the Second World War, the Resistance movements and the Allied armies fought together against the Axis powers, but their convergence was limited, and they did not share the same final goals. This became evident in Greece, where the collapse of German occupation threw the country into a civil war in which the British army helped to repress the communist Resistance. Tito and Eisenhower struggled together against Hitler, but their objectives were not the same. Today, we are in this whirl of contradictory tendencies: on the one hand, we must support the Ukrainian Resistance, as well as the dissident voices in Russia; on the other, we must be able to say that a neoliberal order is not the only alternative to post-fascism. The left should be able to speak to the non-Western countries that did not condemn this invasion. The Western left should prove that it is possible to fight against the neoliberal order without being the friends of Putin.  Ilya: My last question is about anti-fascism. You wrote that anti-fascism as a tradition and a view, was lost in recent years, and you believe that the re-establishment of the anti-fascist tradition could be the only proper answer to the rise of fascism. However, this also means that the anti-fascist tradition should be reinvented, it cannot be the same movement it was in the middle of the twentieth century. Of course, there are a lot of difficulties with this tradition. For instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was also labeled as anti-fascist (against the Ukrainian “Nazis”) by Russian official propaganda. Of course, the idea of anti-fascism was devalued from various sides. What can this reinvention of anti-fascism look like?  Enzo: Again, it is difficult to answer this question. I depicted post-fascism as a global phenomenon, but I am not sure we can speak of global anti-fascism. It depends on contingent circumstances. Of course, we can say that fascism is bad everywhere at any time, but anti-fascism does not have the same meaning and political potentialities everywhere at any time. I do not know how anti-fascism can be perceived today in Russia, India, or the Philippines. Different countries have different historical trajectories, and anti-fascism cannot be understood and mobilized in the same way everywhere. In Western Europe, anti-fascism means a specific historical memory. In Italy, France, Germany, Spain or Portugal, in countries that experienced fascism, with shared collective memories, it is impossible to defend democracy without claiming an anti-fascist legacy. In India, for instance, the relationship between the struggle for independence and anti-fascism is much more complex. During the Second World War, being anti-fascist meant renouncing, at least for a while, to the struggle for independence. In Russia, Putin endorses a demagogic rhetoric by depicting the invasion of Ukraine as the final stage of the Great Patriotic War. Of course, demystifying this lying propaganda and re-establishing the true significance of anti-fascism is crucial for Russian democrats and dissidents. In Ukraine, things are more complicated because the fight against Russian oppression is older than anti-fascism and was not always anti-fascist. The history of Ukrainian nationalism includes a fascist and right-wing component which cannot be forgotten. At the same time, the memory of anti-fascism is that of an anti-Nazi war — as epic and heroic as it was tragic — that Ukrainians fought as part of the USSR. Therefore, being anti-fascist means claiming a tradition that is not consensual in Ukrainian history. It means to defend a certain political identity within a plural Resistance movement. Things are incredibly complicated. Roughly speaking, we could say that anti-fascism means a free and independent Ukraine not opposed to but rather allied with a democratic Russia. Unfortunately, this will not happen tomorrow.  18 May 2023  Source: Posle.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbHZpZXdwb2ludC5vcmcvc3BpcC5waHA_YXJ0aWNsZTgxMDLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1984-07-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T05:47:00","JALANDHAR: Clamour to save the Shiromani Akali Dal and return to its original ideology has been increasing, especially after its decimation in assembly elections a year back and then finishing fifth in Sangrur parliamentary bypoll. Now, in the Jalandhar parliamentary byelection, SAD-BSP alliance has come a distant third — getting just 1.2% votes above the limit to lose the security deposit.That SAD, the country’s second oldest political party, is in crisis is being seen as an objective reality in the Sikh community, apparent from Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh underlining it on a few occasions. At Holla Mohalla at Anandpur Sahib in March, pointing out mutation in original character, he said it was originally a party of farmers and mazdoors (labourers) and not of sarmaaedaaran (capitalists).He suggested that the party return to the original model to struggle and win. The Badals are being accused of drifting far away from its original ideology and ending up annoying most of the party’s core constituency – the Sikhs. The report of Iqbal Singh Jhoonda committee, formed to know the reasons for party’s drubbing and to suggest corrective steps, has not been made public.SAD president Sukhbir Badal has made it clear through his actions that he would remain in complete hold of things and the ‘restructuring’ would happen within the confines he defines. However, apart from leadership, the fundamental question of the party’s core identity and politics would also have to be addressed.When formed on December 14, 1920, at the Akal Takht, a month after formation of SGPC, its mandate was to protect the latter (SGPC) and gurdwaras. Later, it became a representative political party of the Sikh community. “Shiromani Akali Dal is sole expression of collective will of the Sikh Panth and authority to represent the Panth in-heirs in it,” read the “principle” of SAD in it’s ‘policy programme ‘, also called Anandpur Sahib Resolution, of 1973. Against this backdrop, the community now faces unprecedented structural challenges in politics and there is a common refrain that Akali Dal must survive and thrive.“Akali Dal was distinct as all its existence revolved around Guru Granth Sahib, Sikh tenets and to act as a hedge around gurdwaras and Sikh community. It entered electoral politics later and then, too, primarily to protect the Sikh interests,” said Balkar Singh, former professor and head of Punjabi University’s Guru Granth Sahib department.The party’s old constitution reads: “Akali Dal’s main purpose is to serve Panth, country and the oppressed; to endeavour for improving gurdwara management and sewa (service).” Words like Panth, Sikh or gurdwaras do not even figure in the 143 word long “vision and mission” statement and 174-word long note on “history” of the party’s website. “Shiromani Akali Dal is the oldest regional party of India.Secular in outlook, it has constantly worked to uplift the weaker sections of society. It has always been at the forefront of all movements against social evils. The party leaders have been greatly influenced by the Pride of Punjab, Sardar Parkash Singh Badal,” reads the first paragraph of this brief history-note. Word “development” figures under both the titles.These differences between the old and current “mission” statements underline the gap between the original and current Akali Dal. It also reveals the dichotomy in which the party and its leadership are caught. The change in the character and identity of the Akali Dal was effected in 1996, when celebrating its platinum jubilee with a big conference at Moga, Badal, the former CM who died recently, announced to change its identity from Panthic to Punjabi.Earlier, too, it represented a community but did not target another community and its politics was not against any community. “Immediately after... I cautioned that it was like killing the spirit of Akali Dal. They were leading the community and suddenly abandoned it and started implementing the politics and policies which Akali Dal had opposed till then.I even wrote an article in Punjabi, titled ‘Akali Dal ke akaal chalaane ki saakhi’ (The story of Akali Dal’s demise),” said noted Sikh author and former IAS officer Gurtej Singh. Now, when Sukhbir has done a bit of restructuring while repeating old methods and using old loyalists, the moot question remains, can he address the fundamental issues? Can he really cross the line drawn by his father in 1996 to return to the party’s original identity? When on an earlier occasion, the Akal Takht jathedar urged Akali Dal to start a journey from Punjab to Panth, it was about reversing this paradigm shift. The questions are not for Sukhbir alone.Barring a few exceptions, most of the current leaders of the Badal-led SAD are a product of the Badal era of the 1990s and still talk more about “development” during the Badal rule. That secular idiom or agenda are proving to be of little help and that space for Panthic or larger Akali politics is still very much relevant has been confirmed by Sangrur bypoll with Simranjit Singh Mann’s return from the margins.Emergence of Amritpal Singh of “Waris Punjab De” a few months back further proved this. “The Akali Dal does not just require restructuring but reinventing itself according to the vision of 1920. It needs to be democratic, protecting Sikh interests and working for federalism. It is not just about faces but more about ideological positioning. But the biggest challenge would be to win the community’s trust,” said Gurtej Singh.TINA factor In a 102-year old party, which had quite a few stalwarts and a glorious history of huge sacrifices, Badal senior happens to be the only leader finding a mention in the brief “history” note on SAD’s website, reflecting the family’s absolute control on it in the last over two decades.Though Akali Dal president’s personality always carried huge influence on the party, there was no familial control. At the same time, other stalwarts also remaining around would maintain the balance or provide alternate leadership. “Mutation in character of Akali Dal started in the 1960s, after a coup engineered at Jawahar Lal Nehru’s behest, in which central agencies were also involved, to replace Master Tara Singh with Sant Fateh Singh. Later, Badal brought the whole change and completed his familial control,” said veteran journalist Sukhdev Singh .Master Tara Singh had his spell on Akali Dal and SGPC for close to four decades but during his lifetime none from his progeny could contest any election or hold office in SGPC or Akali Dal. He and most other Akali stalwarts had a very frugal lifestyle. When he died in 1967, according to his family, there were Rs 36 in his bank account.He and other Akali stalwarts produced several leaders whereas as now Badals’ acolytes claim TINA (There Is No Alternative) factor, making the party appear as a compulsion for the family . Those opposed to the Badals, including former Punjab assembly speaker Ravi Inder Singh and former Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa , have often argued that there can be unity among Akali ranks and the party can be put on revival path very easily once Badals are out.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvbHVkaGlhbmEvY2FuLWFrYWxpLWRhbC1nby1iYWNrLXRvLWZ1dHVyZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDA0MTA4MDMuY21z0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9tLnRpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5jb20vY2l0eS9sdWRoaWFuYS9jYW4tYWthbGktZGFsLWdvLWJhY2stdG8tZnV0dXJlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDA0MTA4MDMuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2024-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T04:00:00","Drawing from OpenAI's Sam Altman's testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday, India must improve its regulatory efforts to shape a safe and responsible AI ecosystem.  Echoes from the Senate: Sam Altman's Warning  ""The more general ability of these models to manipulate, to persuade, to provide sort of one-on-one interactive disinformation... given that we're going to face an election next year and these models are getting better. I think this is a significant area of concern"" - a warning by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, before a U.S. Senate subcommittee.  His words of caution should resonate loudly in the corridors of power in India, a nation of over a billion people rapidly digitising and increasingly vulnerable to the potential dangers of AI.  Altman is slated to visit India in early June. It's a trip at crossroads - when nations like the U.S. and the European Union grapple with restless nights contemplating AI's societal impact and regulation. Altman's visit offers a golden opportunity for India's policymakers and tech community to initiate a dialogue, not just about AI's role in India but about India's potential role in shaping global AI. It's time for India to contribute to the worldwide conversation and ensure that artificial intelligence, this era's defining technology, is harnessed efficiently and ethically. It is not enough for AI to be for the people; it needs to be 'of' the people and 'by' the people, catering to India's diverse mosaic.  India's 2024 Elections: A Playground for AI Manipulation?  As we approach the 2024 elections in India, the potential for AI to be weaponized presents a sobering thought. With over 600 million internet users and an increasing reliance on digital communication, the country offers a vast and vulnerable battlefield for AI-driven disinformation campaigns.  Consider the case of ChatGPT, a language prediction model by OpenAI. While it's touted for its ability to write human-like text and is celebrated for its potential in assisting tasks from drafting emails to writing code, its misuse can have serious consequences. In the wrong hands, it could be used to automate the production of misleading news and persuasive propaganda, or even impersonate individuals online, contributing to the disinformation deluge.  Take the example of deepfake technology, which allows the creation of incredibly realistic and often indistinguishable artificial images, audio, and videos. In a country like India, with its diverse languages, cultures, and political ideologies, this technology could be leveraged maliciously, manipulating public opinion and disrupting social harmony.  The Spectre of AI in Elections: Global Examples  Indeed, the weaponization of AI during elections and campaigns is not a futuristic dystopia; it's a reality we are already beginning to grapple with. An alarming precedent was set in 2016 during the US presidential election. Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, was accused of harvesting data from millions of Facebook users without consent and using it to create psychological profiles of voters. Jump ahead a few years, and we have seen deep fake videos spark a political crisis in Gabon. In Gabon, a deep fake video of President Ali Bongo in 2018 led to a political crisis, with rumours about the President's health sparking a failed coup. In India's own backyard, the 2019 general elections saw accusations of AI-driven bots being used to flood social media with propaganda and dominate online conversations.  Photoshop on Steroids  ""When photoshop came onto the scene a long time ago, for a while, people were quite fooled by photoshopped images and then pretty quickly developed an understanding that images might be photoshopped. This will be like that, but on steroids,"" Altman told the US Senate.  The photoshop analogy hits the nail on the head regarding AI's potential to deceive. Just as photoshop ushered in an era where images could no longer be accepted at face value, AI technologies are reaching a point where they can generate content so convincingly real that it blurs the line between reality and fabrication.  As Altman rightly noted, the challenge is the speed and scale at which AI can produce this content. Unlike a photoshopped image, which requires individual time and effort to create, AI can generate a multitude of misleading content at an unprecedented speed. It's photoshop on steroids, indeed.  This is a clear and present danger in a country like India, where the rapid spread of misinformation can have severe societal implications. Imagine a deep fake video of a prominent political figure spreading hate speech or fake news articles generated en masse by AI, fueling divisive narratives just days before the election. The potential for chaos is immense.  The Urgency for AI Regulation in India  India must heed the global wake-up calls and look inward and address its unique challenges. The policymakers need to understand that if India doesn't act and develop its approach to using AI and generative AI tools, it may lead to societal and cultural issues.  The Altman warning bell is sounding at a time when India's digital landscape is experiencing unprecedented growth. However, the noise of this growth should not drown out the alarm. As the world's largest democracy gears up for another dance with destiny in its upcoming general elections, the call for stringent AI regulation has never been more pressing.  Now, imagine this scenario playing out in India during an election year. With over 600 million active internet users and millions more coming online every year, the potential for AI-driven disinformation to spread and influence is enormous. It's a daunting prospect for a nation where electoral decisions often teeter on the razor's edge of public sentiment.  AI's ability to tailor content to individual users can be especially dangerous in a country as culturally and linguistically diverse as India. AI models can generate disinformation in local languages, tailored to prey on regional fears and prejudices, polarising communities and stoking discord.  The Quagmire of AI.: India's Moment to Act  IP protection, creativity, and content licensing are all areas that could become a morass if India does not act now. Without regulations, the misuse of AI in these areas could lead to many legal, ethical, and societal issues. It's time to stop looking towards Washington and Silicon Valley for directional policies and create a tailored, comprehensive approach that considers India's unique socio-political dynamics.  The country has a vibrant tech ecosystem, dynamic startups, and a growing community of AI researchers and practitioners. Harnessing their knowledge and expertise will be critical in understanding the nuances of AI and developing informed regulations.  A Call to Arms  In the face of these potential threats, complacency is not an option. Policymakers, tech industry leaders, and society at large need to engage in a comprehensive dialogue about AI and its implications. Awareness needs to be raised, and safeguards must be implemented. Regulatory measures need to strike a balance between promoting innovation and preventing misuse.  Sam Altman's alarm bells should resonate not only within the US but also across the globe. It's an urgent call to action for nations like India, where the stakes are high and the consequences are far-reaching. The 2024 elections may seem distant, but the time to prepare our defences against the onslaught of AI is now.  If there is one thing that history has taught us, it's that forewarned is forearmed.

Abu Sayeed Chan, a top BNP leader from Rajshahi, has publicly directed his activists for the 1975-styled assassination bid against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in an oblique reference to the gruesome massacre of almost her entire family in a military coup then.  advertisement  “No more movement to realise our 27-point or ten-point demands. Rather, our movement now should only revolve around one point- send Sheikh Hasina to her grave”, threatened Abu Sayeed Chan, convener, Rajshahi Zila unit.  Sheikh Hasina's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, and members of his family were killed in cold blood on August 15th, 1975, by senior army officers, which plunged Bangladesh into political chaos. The massacre resulted in a military regime running the country for a number of years, thereby suspending the democratic process.  The BNP leaders have been calling for the ouster of this government in the next three months without an election. After the video went viral, Bangladesh Awami League’s verified Facebook page posted the clip with a caption “BNP publicly threatens to assassinate our leader Sheikh Hasina”.

This latest round of threat came months after a Juba Dal leader publicly threatened to restage “another 1975 kind of incident"", pointing to the grisly massacre that saw as many as 19 family members of Sheikh Hasina including her father, mother, sister among others gunned down by a group of disgruntled army officers, and journalists believed to be backed by powerful countries.  “Take up arms and restage another 1975,” Abdul Kader Bhuiyan, secretary of the Volunteer Front, a wing of the BNP had threatened months back.  Sheikh Hasina has already survived more than 19 assassination attempts, including the grenade attack in 2004 on an Awami League rally, in which around 32 leaders and activists were killed. BNP’s acting Chairperson Tarique Rahman has been convicted by a court for his involvement in planning the grenade attack.  Calling Abu Sayeed Chan's statement a “pointer of death threat”, Bangladesh's Muktijuddho Mancha, has demanded the immediate arrest of the BNP leader.

The Republican primary field will be expanding this week as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott both jump into the 2024 race.  GOV. RON DESANTIS:  I think the party has developed a culture of losing.  SEN. TIM SCOTT:  It’s time for us to be proud to be Americans and proud of our president.  CHUCK TODD:  Can either candidate make the case he's the better alternative to Donald Trump and unite the party in the process in the primary battle ahead?

CHUCK TODD:  President Biden's 2024 campaign is already planning to focus on the new ban in the swing state of North Carolina. How will the battle over abortion rights impact the 2024 race? I'll talk to North Carolina's Democratic Governor, Roy Cooper. Joining me for insight and analysis are NBC News Managing Washington Editor Carol Lee, Dan Balz, chief correspondent for The Washington Post, former Republican Congressman Carols Curbelo and Symone Sanders-Townsend, former chief spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press.  ANNOUNCER:  From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.  CHUCK TODD:  Good Sunday morning. This is going be one of the busiest weeks yet in the presidential campaign, as the 2024 Republican field grows, so do concerns among some Republicans that none of Donald Trump's current rivals are going to be able to beat him in a primary. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is announcing his campaign tomorrow in his hometown of North Charleston before heading to the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to formally file paperwork for president this week, a bit of a soft launch of his campaign with a video and a donor retreat at the Four Seasons in Miami, before formally having the big campaign rally announcement later in the month. But when the year began, DeSantis had the look and feel of not just of a frontrunner, but of a potential juggernaut. But the last five months have not been kind. Trump has relentlessly attacked him, and under those attacks, DeSantis has floundered a bit. He has struggled with big donors who have complained quite publicly that he “doesn't even return phone calls.” Others don't like his position on abortion, the six week ban, and believe it would be a problem in a general election. And still others worry about his charisma. He launched a book tour. It was immediately overshadowed when he called the Ukraine war a ""territorial dispute.” He walked it back after some donors complained. Then, there's the fight with Disney, where he took a political advantage and a victory, and it has now turned into a political problem. The DeSantis slump has made more Republicans, who believe Donald Trump cannot win a general election, flirt with jumping into this race themselves. From New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. And if no alternative materializes there, donors are likely to keep shopping for Republicans with general election appeal like Governor Brian Kemp or Governor Glenn Youngkin — who himself rolled out a curious video this week casting himself as the successor to Ronald Reagan. In the meantime, it appears that the first big fight between the two current frontrunners for the Republican nomination will actually be over the issue of abortion, and whose position makes them more electable. Ironically, that electability fight may not be about January 6 and Trump's growing legal baggage. This week Trump said that ""many people within the pro-life movement"" feel DeSantis's six-week abortion ban was “too harsh."" Well, DeSantis responded to Trump earlier this week:  [START TAPE]  GOV. RON DeSANTIS:  As a Florida resident, you know, he didn’t give an answer about “Would you have signed the heartbeat bill that Florida did, that had all the exceptions that people talk about?” The legislature put it in. I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He won’t answer whether he would sign it or not.  [END TAPE]  CHUCK TODD:  And joining me now is Republican Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida. Donalds, by the way, introduced DeSantis at his election night victory party in November. And last month, he became one of 11 Florida congressional Republicans to endorse Donald Trump. Congressman Donalds, welcome to Meet the Press.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Yeah, it's good to be with you, Chuck.  CHUCK TODD:  Before we start with the politics, sort of the political junkie conversation, let's talk about the debt ceiling. You’re a member of the Freedom Caucus on here. Where – are you going to be comfortable with a deal that you probably personally won't like, but it's a deal that sort of maybe progressives don't like and the Freedom Caucus doesn't like, but it’s – it can pass? Are you going to be able to accept a deal like that?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Chuck, to be blunt with you, we're not really sure what deal's even on the table. The White House is not serious. They came up with a proposal to spend another $30 billion more than they already wanted to spend. They're not taking a look at the reality of where our country is fiscally. Look, Joe Biden is saying that he's cut $1.7 trillion from the deficit. But everybody's saying that's not true. That’s – what he actually has done is he's $1 trillion over what CBO was projecting spending was going to be because after all of the COVID spending in the last year of President Trump, that Congress wasn't going to extend that, and Joe Biden did. So we're in a situation right now where the only plan in Washington has been passed by the House of Representatives. It's the only plan. Joe Biden's not serious at the negotiating table. I've talked with my colleagues who are in that room. So at this point, really the question is: what's the Senate going to do? Where's Chuck Schumer in all this? Because the Senate has not done any work at all. And Joe Biden has not done any work at all.  CHUCK TODD:  Let me get you to respond to something former President Trump said about the debt ceiling of 2019. Take a listen.  [START TAPE]  FMR. PRES. DONALD TRUMP:  I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking of using the debt ceiling as a negotiating wager.  [END TAPE]  CHUCK TODD:  Why don't you agree with him on this?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Well, first of all, he also said the other day on a rival network that he said that when he was president, and when they asked why he wasn't saying it now, he said because he's not president. Listen, Donald Trump is always negotiating —  CHUCK TODD:  Do you realize how absurd that sounds?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That is not absurd. He's always negotiating, Chuck.  CHUCK TODD:  How is that not absurd? It's absurd.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Chuck, he's always negotiating. That's what he does. And it's actually one of the reasons why so many deals for our country worked out to our benefit, as compared to his predecessors, both Republican and Democrat, because he's always negotiating.  CHUCK TODD:  But do you realize how partisan that sounds?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That is not a partisan statement.  CHUCK TODD:  ""What is – what is good for me is not for thee."" He's basically saying, ""When I'm president, –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Right.  CHUCK TODD:  – there's no negotiating on this. But, hey, when somebody else is president, screw them.""  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Well, no, here's the thing. Let's be – let’s be realistic now. When Donald Trump was negotiating debt ceiling with Nancy Pelosi, mind you, they negotiated that.  CHUCK TODD:  – No, they didn't.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  When they were –  CHUCK TODD:  They raised it without any restrictions.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  When they were, when they were, when they were doing that, our economy was thriving, our debt levels were not where they are right now. We were about $24 trillion, not $32 trillion. We weren't having massive deficits the way we are right now. It was a very different environment. Now, you have $32 trillion on the credit card. And all House Republicans are saying is, ""Let's go back to pre-pandemic spending."" That's common-sense stuff.  CHUCK TODD:  But there's one more thing House Republicans are asking for, which is they want fewer IRS agents. They want fewer attempts to try to properly get tax receipts into the federal government’s coffers. I have never understood the resistance of extra IRS agents, unless you knowingly cheat on your taxes.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That – First of all, that's salacious and you know that. Most Americans, by far, pay their taxes and they do it honorably. What House Republicans, and, frankly, Republican party is concerned about is having IRS agents go after middle-class families and small business owners. When you have that many more agents, it's not to go after the rich. It's to go after the middle class.  CHUCK TODD:  Again –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That's what it's for.  CHUCK TODD:  Again, if you're paying what you're supposed to pay, then you should have nothing to fear.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  You would make the assumption that IRS audits are up, that they're putting out more liens on the American people. That's not true. That data's not there. All Joe Biden's trying to do is find every possible nickel out of every couch from every American to pay for his radical spending. Why would we do that? Listen, let me contrast for you. When we passed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, CBO said it was going to cost $2 trillion. That's actually not true. What ended up happening was the federal government took in $1 trillion more than CBO actually projected. The economy grew another 1% over projections.  CHUCK TODD:  In fairness, we can't litigate the tax cuts because of what happened with Covid. We don't know how much –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Chuck –  CHUCK TODD:  This ate into everything, but it certainly looks like there were going to be fewer revenues coming into the government. But we don't know. In fairness, there's no –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Fewer, fewer revenues now?  CHUCK TODD:  There’s no – there’s no, there's no ability to litigate this because of what happened with COVID and the extra spending.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That is not true, Chuck. In 2019, we took in more revenue than we ever have in the history of our nation, as bunch of a percentage of our economy than we ever have, as a nation. That was 2019.  CHUCK TODD:  It also added. It also add –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Tax receipts were still up.  CHUCK TODD:  You realize that President Trump has added more to the deficit than Joe Biden?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  You’re going to use –  CHUCK TODD:  I – I – digress –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  But most of it is Covid.  CHUCK TODD:  Now let’s be clear –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  But most of it was Covid.  CHUCK TODD:  I'm listening. About half of it's Covid and half of it's the tax cut.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  That is not true because we raised more –  CHUCK TODD:  The numbers are numbers.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  We raised more revenue than CBO projected. If you bring in more money than your projections are, how are you adding to your deficits, Chuck?  CHUCK TODD:  Yeah. And if you pay – if somehow, you keep cutting taxes but more revenue comes into the government, that math doesn't work over time. You can have it in the first, first year, due to some various accounting tricks. But it doesn't work over time.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  No, Chuck. That is not true. The purpose of tax policy is to raise revenue for the federal government, not to equalize society. After the Trump tax cuts were passed, more tax revenue has come to the federal government than in any other time in the history of our nation. Those are the facts.  CHUCK TODD:  Raw dollars can happen because we do have a growing economy –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  And a percentage of the economy.  CHUCK TODD:  But we do have a growing economy. Let me ask you this on caps. There is – do you want to see caps on defense spending, as well as domestic spending? Because right now, there seems to be a dispute, whether there's going to be budget caps only on domestic or Republicans are also wanting caps on defense spending.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  So internally, we're having this discussion about defense. We're looking at trying to see a way to keep defense spending in line because, you know, there are threats all over the globe. We see it in Ukraine. We see what's happening with China's saber-rattling with Taiw – Taiwan, etcetera. So we want to make sure that our military preparedness is where it needs to be. But at the same time, House Republicans are not looking at just letting the Department of Defense just have massive radical increases as well. We have to control spending everywhere in our government.  CHUCK TODD:  Let me go back to the reality of politics. Tom Cole said, ""Any deal is going to lose people like you in the Freedom Caucus and people on the progressive side."" And he, and he added this to The Dispatch. He said, ""We're not going to have a deal if the President of the United States doesn't sign it. And we're not going to have a deal if the majority of the House doesn't support it. So each side's not going to just simply give the other side what it wants. It's politics 101."" I go back to my first question: Do you accept that premise?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I accept – I accept the premise, but Joe Biden's got to come up with a deal. He doesn't have one. I would ask him – you should ask him, if he actually would take your question. You should ask him if he has a plan, if he has a strategy. The only thing he's ever said is, ""we should – it should just be clean."" But nobody with an economic mind is saying, ""Yeah. Sure. Just give the federal government a blank check.""  CHUCK TODD:  So are, are you comfortable with breaching the debt ceiling?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  No. I'm not comfortable with that. This should have been done 100 days ago. House Republicans have been working on this for three months. I've been in the room. I've been in those meetings. And while we were working on a strategy to raise our nation's debt ceiling, which is something the House of Representatives has passed, Joe Biden was ignoring it and Chuck Schumer was ignoring it. And I think that he has been derelict in his duty.  CHUCK TODD:  Let me ask you about the presidential race. So we've got off – more on the debt ceiling than I think either one of us expected. I want to play your celebration of Governor DeSantis and ask about it on the other side.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Sure.  [START TAPE]  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  The newly re-elected, Democrat-beating, freedom-standing-for, America's governor, Ron DeSantis.  [END TAPE]  CHUCK TODD:  Obviously, you chose to support, right now, Donald Trump, instead of, who you described as, ""America's governor,"" there. What could Governor DeSantis have done to convince you to stick with him and not the former president?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Well, first of all, that, that speech was pretty good, Chuck. You've got to acknowledge that. That was good stuff. Anyway, to me, it's not really about Donald Trump versus Ron DeSantis, it's about what America needs. That's where I've been, really, since day once. We – I talked a little bit about foreign policy in the last block. We have a situation right now where Russia's on the move and China is on the move. We need somebody who can step in, day one, look at Vladimir Putin, look at Xi Jinping, and say, ""Okay. Enough. I'm back. We're going to get everything —""  CHUCK TODD:  – And you don’t think DeSantis has that ability?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I think it's going to take them time. I think there's only one person who has that ability right now and it's Donald Trump. And for all the naysayers who would say, ""Oh, he's unpredictable. Oh, we don't know what he's going to do,"" let's be very clear. When he was president of the United States, the world was in a much safer place. Nobody can say that the world is safer now than when it was when he was president.  CHUCK TODD:  He called January 6th, “a beautiful day."" That is not something many people associate January 6th with. Do you really think that's an electable position?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Look. I think what happened on January 6th was a terrible day for the country.  CHUCK TODD:  You don’t think it was a beautiful day?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I was on the House —  CHUCK TODD:  Yeah.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I was on the House floor. It was a terrible day for the country. But that also being said, we have a situation where we've got to get the country back on track. I made a comment the other day that as, as bad as January 6th was, the American people aren't consuming January 6th the way the media and Washington is consuming, consuming January 6th. Our country has to get back on track.  CHUCK TODD:  It’s pretty scarring in Washington. In fairness to Washington, it was a pretty scarring day for Washington.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  It was. It was. But what's happening to our southern border right now? That's scarring for people who live at the southern border. What's happening for middle-income families when their wages are being eroded by a massive inflation brought to us by Joe Biden? That is the stuff that the American people are concerned about right now.  CHUCK TODD:  There's been some talk that you might be interested in running for governor in 2026. So let me ask you this. Would you have signed the six-week ban or do you think that's too much?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  You know, honestly, that's something where you have to deal with your legislature on that. You have to look at your legislature. You have to deal with the people in, in your state. And you figure out what that process is going to be.  CHUCK TODD:  It sounds like that – it sounds like you think six weeks is too much. You're not comfortable saying –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Well, they also put – they also put lot of exceptions into it. But I wasn't in the legislature when they did this. I want to be blunt with you.  CHUCK TODD:  I understand.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I'm not sure where the, where the governor was and the legislature was on this. What I would tell you is this is a far better place to be than when Roe v. Wade was the law of the land.  CHUCK TODD:  Donald Trump thinks it's too much, it's too extreme. Do you agree with him on that?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  I think he is going to figure out what he thinks is going to be the best thing for the country. He said that already. He's on the record with that. Look, abortion politics is very personal. It's very, very personal. And it’s obviously – we all know it's, it’s hyperbolic in our country. People are all over the place.  CHUCK TODD:  Isn't that a reason not to have government try to get so involved in it, by the way?  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Well, I would argue that the Supreme Court already did that. They did that for 50 years. And that's why it was important to return this back to the states because the country's never really had to deal with the politics of abortion. Compare us to the European countries. America's abortion policy is radical compared to the European countries. Most European countries are ten to 12 weeks. That's where they are.  CHUCK TODD:  They also have exceptions that allow abortion all the way, all the way –  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  The Florida law has exceptions, as well.  CHUCK TODD:  – all the way there.  CHUCK TODD:  I'm going to do more on abortion here in a few minutes. Byron Donalds, Republican congressman from Southwest Florida, thanks for coming in. Appreciate your time.  REP. BYRON DONALDS:  Anytime. Thank you.  CHUCK TODD:  Speaking of abortion, Republicans in North Carolina took advantage of their new supermajority to push through an abortion ban of 12 weeks over Governor Roy Cooper's veto. The new law bans abortion after 12 weeks, requires patients to meet in person with a physician at least 72 hours before the procedure. It includes 20 week exceptions for rape and incest, and a 24 week exception for what they call, ""life-limiting fetal abnormalities."" So joining me now is the Democratic Governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper. Governor Cooper, welcome back to Meet the Press.  GOV. ROY COOPER:  Glad to be with you, Chuck, as always.  CHUCK TODD:  So let me – let me throw this – we've described how this bill came to be. It is a less restrictive bill than some of North Carolina's surrounding states. So let me ask you about how The Washington Post described it. They called it this, ""It is the first new abortion ban to pass since the fall of Roe v. Wade that does not outlaw all or most abortions, effectively allowing roughly 90% of abortions to continue."" Are they correct in that assessment? Do you agree with The Washington Post's assessment of that?  GOV. ROY COOPER:  I don't think so, but I hope so. We're going to make sure that this bill gets implemented in a way that we provide the most access possible to women. This bill was contradictory, conflicting, confusing. They wrote it in the middle of the night. It's going to be open to interpretation. This is in no way a reasonable compromise as Republicans have presented it. It's a compromise between the right wing and the radical right wing. It is better than some of the surrounding states. But we know that Republicans are unified in their assault on women's reproductive freedom. Not a single one of them, not a single one of them stood up even when they had made promises to the people that they weren't going to change North Carolina's abortion law. That tells us where we are right now.  CHUCK TODD:  Well look, the bill also includes millions of dollars of funding to expand access to contraception for low income and uninsured patients. It increases payments for foster families and expands access to childcare, and it increases paid parental leave for state employees. Did you find those provisions that were included something you could support?  GOV. ROY COOPER:  Well first, I've already issued an executive order for paid parental leave for state employees, and they should be doing these kinds of things anyway. What they spent a lot of time doing is dressing up this bill so that they could attract their swing Republicans, because they knew they needed every single vote in order to be able to get this bill passed. Democrats were unified on a Roe v. Wade standard. So what they did is try to make this bill ugly. It's the old lipstick on a pig kind of thing. Yes, those investments are important and should be made anyway. But when you look at what this bill does, I don't think we can even comprehend yet the pressure that these clinics are going to be under by these additional restrictions. Women who are working hourly wages and already have children and have to make multiple trips in order to get reproductive care. North Carolina has been an access point in the Southeast. We already have long waiting lines. And when you compress the time that women have to make these decisions, I don't think it's reasonable to call this thing a 12 week ban because inside of that 12 weeks there's a lot going on that would be obstacles to women in being able to get care.  CHUCK TODD:  Yeah, the 72-hour provision certainly is a hurdle at a minimum, and perhaps a full-on obstacle. I want to ask about the party switcher, Tricia Cotham, who was a Democratic state representative, switched parties allowing the supermajority to be there. A fellow state rep., Democratic State Rep. Cecil Brockman, said the following and I'm curious of your response, ""I didn't see it coming,"" referring to the party switch, ""but I do get how she feels resentful from the constant character attacks that she has received, and a couple of us have received. It is a lot of eating your own. The biggest issue with Democrats in the state of North Carolina is that we'd rather be right than win elections."" The implication that the progressive left so attacked Tricia Cotham that she felt unwelcome in the party, is that a fair critique?  GOV. ROY COOPER:  You can't make major policy changes because you get your feelings hurt. Here in North Carolina, we are on a razor's edge. Major policy changes can happen because of one legislator making a decision. Because of our gerrymandered districts, we are so close to a supermajority. The last four years we've had enough Democrats to be able to stop all of the bad legislation. All of my vetoes have been upheld. But when you're talking about investments in education for our children, when you're talking about expanding Medicaid, which we were able to get done by the way, when you're talking about bills that discriminate, bills that attack voting rights, bills that affect our democracy, those one votes matter. And yes, it's a lot of pressure to make sure that we don't have these radical policy changes in a state that has kept our purple nature. One of the reasons we're the number one state in the country for business is because businesses say we are stable, we have a good business environment, but we also have stayed out of the culture wars. And if you run for elective office, you have to be tough. You have to be ready to jump into these issues and understand that there are going to be differences of agreement – differences of opinion, and that people can be pretty rough in that kind of situation.  CHUCK TODD:  Yeah, politics sure ain't beanbag. We do know this; I think abortion and the issue of abortion will be the number one issue in North Carolina come 2024 we will see what it does to the state's politics. Governor Cooper, Democrat from North Carolina, thanks for coming on and sharing your perspective.  GOV. ROY COOPER:  Thank you, Chuck.  CHUCK TODD:  When we come back, when will the federal government run out of money? Can a deal still be reached to avoid a catastrophic default? You're going to hear from the Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, next.  CHUCK TODD:  Welcome back. As the Treasury Department warns that the U.S. could breach the debt ceiling as soon as June 1st, this week negotiations were on, and then they were off. Then they were on again as the bases of both political parties balked at some of the compromises that were being made public that were supposedly on the table. A Republican aide told NBC News that House conservatives are, quote, ""privately seething"" at how the talks have been going, saying Republicans are giving away their leverage. Well, then you had 11 progressive Democrats in the Senate and 66 in the House are arguing that President Biden should invoke the 14th Amendment and pull out of talks completely, saying the Constitution requires the government to pay its debts. So with the bases of both parties unhappy, in theory, we're in the sweet spot for a deal to get done. Or, will the bases derail this deal? Joining me now is Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen. Secretary Yellen, welcome back to Meet the Press.  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Thanks so much, Chuck. It's a pleasure to be with you.  CHUCK TODD:  All right. I want to start with today's May 20th. Twelve days is June 1st. How hard is 12 days? President Biden seemed to hint earlier this morning that he thought we're two to three weeks away. And, you know, 12 days, two weeks, we could argue there, but how hard is this June 1st deadline?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June, and possibly as soon as June 1st. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven't changed my assessment. So I think that that's a hard deadline.  CHUCK TODD:  I want to point out something, that a lot of House conservatives just simply don't believe what Treasury is doing. I'm going to read you one quote here. Some conservative Republicans have said for months that they felt, ""Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had exaggerated the risk of the default in June, in a bid to put pressure on the House Republican majority. 'She's going to play it out now, saying it's a crisis, the day is here,' said Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the Freedom Caucus."" What do you think you could do to convince Congressman Norman that this early June deadline is real?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, Treasury has a long history of informing Congress about how much cash and headroom we have under the debt ceiling. And we take pride in the credibility of the forecasts that we make. I would point out that the Congressional Budget Office has recently indicated that they expect that early June will be a problem. And forecasters on Wall Street, who look at information daily on our cash balances and resources, agree. So there will be hard choices to make if the debt ceiling isn't raised. And, you know, I would simply say: Since 1789, the United States has a history of paying its bills on time. That's what the world wants to see, a continued commitment to do that. It's what underlies U.S. Treasury securities as the safest investment on the planet. And it's not an acceptable situation for us to be unable to pay our bills.  CHUCK TODD:  I just want to sort of understand the go or no-go to June 15th in this way. It's clear that June 1st is not hard, but it's the beginning of that period. What is the likelihood we can get to the June 15th tax receipts to avoid breaching the debt ceiling? Can you put a percentage on it? Is it 20%, 40%, something like that?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, there's always uncertainty about tax receipts and spending. And so it's hard to be absolutely certain about this, but my assessment is that the odds of reaching June 15th, while being able to pay all of our bills, is quite low.  CHUCK TODD:  Fair enough. Let me ask you about what are the sticking points here. It does appear as if – we heard President Biden bring up revenue, meaning taxes. Maybe it's closing loopholes, or maybe it's actually raising a percentage here or there. Is it a hard and fast line? Is the White House going to accept a deal on this to raise the debt ceiling that includes spending caps but does not include any increased revenues or taxes?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, look, you know, the White House is negotiating in good faith with the Republicans to try to find a bipartisan solution. I don't want to negotiate in public and put down any red lines, but certainly, the president has pointed out, and it's important for the American people to understand, we're all concerned about deficits and fiscal responsibility, but deficits can be addressed both through changes in spending and also through changes in revenue, and the Republicans have taken that off the table. Something that greatly concerns me is that they have even been in favor of removing funding that's been provided to the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on tax fraud. We have an enormous gap between the taxes we're collecting and what we should be collecting, if everyone paid the taxes that they really owe. And that's really a reflection of tax fraud. It amounts to an estimated $7 trillion over the next decade. So equipping the IRS with the funding they need to audit high income individuals and corporations, that's something that doesn't cost money. It nets money substantially for the federal government. And, you know, of course, there are revenue proposals that we think make the tax code fairer.  CHUCK TODD:  Let's end with a phrase that I talked to you about at the beginning, and that is this idea of extraordinary measures. Is the 14th Amendment fall into the category of extraordinary measures?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, ""extraordinary measures"" is used in a different way, but there has been —  CHUCK TODD:  I understand.  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  — much discussion of the 14th Amendment. And, as President Biden said, I believe, this morning, it doesn't seem like something that could be appropriately used in these circumstances, given the legal uncertainty around it, and given the tight timeframe we're on. So my devout hope is that Congress will raise the debt ceiling —  CHUCK TODD:  But are you just going to —  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  — and we'll pay all of our bills.  CHUCK TODD:  If it doesn't happen, okay, and we're at this point, are you just going to sit there and pick and choose, or why not go and pay, and then, you know, it's one of those are you going to pay all of our debts and essentially let the Courts tell us you shouldn't have? I mean, if we breach this debt ceiling – I understand not wanting to use it now – but are we really going to sit there and just let some bills go unpaid, not even trying it?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, we take the debt ceiling seriously as a constraint on our ability to pay bills that are coming due. And my assumption is that if the debt ceiling isn't raised, there will be hard choices to make about what bills go unpaid. And, you know, defaulting on any of our payments —  CHUCK TODD:  What you're saying is if the debt ceiling is not raised, that there's going to be a default on President Biden's watch, even though he doesn't want it, that you're not going to try any other measures? You'll allow a default on some debt if Congress doesn't raise this debt ceiling?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Well, there will be some bill. We have to pay interest in principle on outstanding debt. We also have obligations to seniors who count on Social Security, our military that expects pay, contractors who've provided services to the federal government, and some bills have to go unpaid.  CHUCK TODD:  So there will be some bills unpaid if the debt ceiling is not raised?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Yes. And many people, including in the credit rating agencies —  CHUCK TODD:  Have you decided which bills those are going to be yet?  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Look, I would say we're focused on raising the debt ceiling. And there will be hard choices if that doesn't occur. There can be no acceptable outcomes if the debt ceiling isn't raised, regardless of what decisions we make.  CHUCK TODD:  Secretary Yellen, Treasury Secretary for President Biden, appreciate you coming on and sharing the administration's perspective. Thank you.  SECRETARY JANET YELLEN:  Thanks.  CHUCK TODD:  When we come back, Ron DeSantis is about to make it official. But there's a whole wave of other contenders who are suddenly betting he's already missed his moment. Is there room for more alternatives to Donald Trump? Panel is next.  CHUCK TODD:  Welcome back. Panel is here: NBC News Washington Managing Editor Carol Lee, Dan Balz, the chief correspondent at The Washington Post; former Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Symone Sanders-Townsend. She's host of Symone and the former chief spokesperson of Vice President Kamala Harris. Look, I want to mostly stick to the Republican primary but Carol, let's you and I quickly, on this debt ceiling. I feel like it's a lot of theater and that almost the lack of urgency on the specifics of the end game from Secretary Yellen, tell me the White House wants to land this plane almost in any way possible.  CAROL LEE:  They do. And they also want to be able to land it in a way where all sides declare victory. That's been the goal from —  CHUCK TODD:  Or don't all sides declare defeat?  CAROL LEE:  — well, all along. Well, you know —  CHUCK TODD:  I just think they all have to admit that they lost something here, right? Yeah.  CAROL LEE:  Yes. But the president wants to be able to say that he went in, he fought for priorities that matter to the Democratic party, that he didn't give away too much and look, they raised the debt limit. The noise that we're hearing is, as those of us who covered this, these fights in the past, know, is part of the process. And so the president's speaking with the speaker. He's likely to meet with the speaker and others this week. And they expect to have some sort of deal by the end of the week.  CHUCK TODD:  Our advice: Pay no attention to the posturing for social media and cable news consumption. Let me set up the presidential race. We had a little bit of back and forth already between DeSantis and a Trump supporter, sort of. Let me give you this back and forth this week from DeSantis and the new nominee for governor of Kentucky.  [START TAPE]  GOV. RON DeSANTIS:  We were supposed to have this big, red wave, and other than, like, Florida and Iowa, I didn't see a red wave across this country. And so I think the party has developed a culture of losing.  GOV.-ELECT DANIEL CAMERON:  A big thank you to President Donald J. Trump for his support and his endorsement of this campaign. Let me just say, let me just say the Trump culture of winning is alive and well in Kentucky.  [END TAPE]  CHUCK TODD:  So Dan Balz, Ron DeSantis finally going to come in this week. I can't help but wonder, imagine, had he flipped his switch on the exploratory committee in January of this year, where he would be. Would Tim Scott be even announcing this week?  DAN BALZ:  Well, Chuck, I mean, I think the question is, was he ready in January and is he ready today, to be a national candidate? And I think what we've seen is somebody who's been, you know, far from sure-footed in his first steps in trying to run a presidential campaign. But he also caught himself in a situation which he wasn't quite in, but he was trying to get in. And so I think what we have seen is, in some ways, what may be the worst of Ron DeSantis during this period. And I think the question going forward is, ""Will we see a different and more effective Ron DeSantis?"" I mean, you know, Chuck, from campaigns past, candidates, even ones who start out with a lot of hype, have trouble. Barack Obama in 2007 had trouble in the early spring. And a lot of people were saying, ""What's the matter with this guy? I thought he was a really good candidate."" We've seen it in a variety of other campaigns. So, I think that the real challenge for Ron DeSantis is to now step up and show that he's a national candidate with a national message, and with a kind of confidence about how to deal with and go after Donald Trump.  CHUCK TODD:  You know, Carlos Curbelo, I had somebody who's wanting DeSantis to get there, sort of wonder here, jeez, a lot's been lost over these last four months. And does see that, you know, maybe Tim Scott and Nikki Haley don't have big donors coming to them. Maybe Chris Christie doesn't have Scaramucci and Steve Cohen saying, ""Yeah, we'll fund your campaign."" You know, all of this is because, not of Donald Trump, but it's actually because Ron DeSantis has looked weak here.  CARLOS CURBELO:  So, look, two different kinds of candidates getting into the race this week. Tim Scott, who's going to try to get around Donald Trump, and Ron DeSantis, who doesn't have a choice but to try to go through Donald Trump in order to get that nomination. I think, you know, if the brawl between DeSantis and Trump gets nasty enough, candidates like Scott could become interesting, could become attractive. And I also think it's a little early to write off Ron DeSantis. I mean, if any of us were starting a presidential campaign today and we had all that money, all the resources he has –  CHUCK TODD:  And already in double digits –  CARLOS CURBELO:  And —  CHUCK TODD:  — by the way.  CARLOS CURBELO:  — in second place, we would probably be happy. On top of that, DeSantis has a strong record to run on for a Republican primary in a general. You know, the social issues might be a challenge, but he has a strong economic record to run on. So look, been a tough last few months. But it's a bit early to say this guy can't make it.  CHUCK TODD:  Symone, what have you learned here? You were involved in a massive, what some people thought was going to become, a demolition derby on the Democratic side in 2019. All of a sudden, I think we thought we were going to have a smaller field, the field is growing. By the way, is Tim Scott the Pete Buttigieg of this crowd, meaning that he may pop here if people don't, if people aren’t careful?  SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND:  Is he the Pete Buttigieg, or is he the Cory Booker, the person that everyone liked, but just could not catch fire with the voters? And I say that, and I like Cory Booker personally, but we saw what happened in the 2020 election. If there were less candidates then, if maybe if there were other people not in the race, could someone like Cory Booker, could have caught fire? I think it's a question that Tim Scott himself has asked him a couple of times, his team. Obviously, this is something they've had to weigh. And they've weighed that it's better to get in than stay out. Look, I think I'm with you. I think it's early, but it's also late. And, you know, we had this conversation —  CHUCK TODD:  Yogi Berra. Exactly.  SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND:  — earlier this week, you know? It's late early because it's early, first debates, Republican primary debate is not until the end of August. But it's late because Republican primary voters start voting on January 8th. That's the Iowa caucuses. So how do you build the infrastructure? How do you become a national candidate that can connect with voters from state to state?  CHUCK TODD:  Well, the other issue, of course, is the abortion issue. I want to put up this graphic, Carol, that we put together. Since Dobbs, it is a consistent issue here for Republicans across the board. So in 2022, you had the Kansas abortion referendum. You had a special congressional election in New York. And you, of course, you had the midterms themselves, where it was clear abortion was a huge issue. And then look what we just learned over the last couple of months. You had the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, that abortion rights clearly helped the left there.  And you have new mayors on the Democratic side in Jacksonville and an Independent; Republicans knocked out in Colorado Springs, all of them over being perceived as too out of the mainstream on social issues. Will this Republican primary even matter in the presidential because of those numbers?  CAROL LEE:  Well, I can tell you that the Biden team is certainly looking at this and thinking that this is an opportunity for them to expand the map in North Carolina, as well as Florida. A Biden official has told me that they think the six-week ban that Governor DeSantis signed is very significant. That they —  CHUCK TODD:  That's why they want to go to Florida, you think?  CAROL LEE:  And they are already, they're ""testing the waters there."" They're on the air. They see an opportunity here. And it all comes down to abortion.  CHUCK TODD:  And Dan, you pointed out in your terrific piece today two key groups in 2022 showed up for Democrats that they didn't expect — women without a college degree, and voters under the age of 35.  DAN BALZ:  Yeah. And I think that the women without college degrees are a prime target. But I think it was the abortion issue that drew them. And I don't know whether that'll be the case in 2024. They could easily slip back to the Republicans.  CHUCK TODD:  All right. We have more time, I promise. Up next, the Covid public health emergency has been declared over. So after living with three years of this virus, what was the real impact? Data Download's next.  CHUCK TODD:  Welcome back. Data Download time. Earlier this month, the national emergency that surrounded the Covid-19 pandemic was officially declared over. So we wanted to take a look at just how much this three-year pandemic impacted the country as a whole. And let's start with the greatest statistic of all, the loss of life. Overall, more than a million Americans died of Covid-19 since it first appeared here in early 2020. That is more people than the populations of Austin, Texas or Jacksonville, Florida, and it's more people than live in the entire state of Montana. But the good news is, the current death number are among the lowest they've ever been. Look at this, just 281 reported last week nationwide. At its peak in early January of 2021, nearly 26,000 Americans lost their life in just a week. Just a week. Now, speaking of that – of those vaccines, according to the CDC, over 81% of Americans received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. That number dropped off a little bit on second doses, as you could see here, nearly 70%. Well, let me tell you this. The boosters? They're not getting – they’re not getting bought – used by many folks very often. Mostly this is folks over the age of 65. It's an indication of just how comfortable we are now living beyond this virus. But, of course, the economic impact was huge with this pandemic. Did you know we threw over $4 trillion in money from the government to try to offset what was just a huge disruption in the American economy? And even though we threw all that money at the economy, it still impacted our overall national economic trends here. Fourteen trillion dollars in lost economic activity from 2020 through the end of last year, according to researchers from the University of Southern California. Before we go to break, this week special counsel John Durham released his long-awaited report on the Russia investigation. Well, back in 2001, Bill Clinton investigator Robert Ray joined Meet the Press days after striking a deal with the president to avoid an indictment, and he talked about the lessons he learned as an independent counsel.  [START TAPE]  ROBERT RAY:  The most important thing I learned is that achieving a – a just result for a prosecutor's not so easy. I – one can think exclusively within the box of being a federal prosecutor, but the position of independent counsel brings I think a larger responsibility not only to the, to the interests of justice, but also to the country's best interests. And achieving a result that's satisfactory to all of those concerns is not, is not an easy one. It is important for the country's confidence to know that law enforcement with regard to the integrity of public officials can work.  [END TAPE]  CHUCK TODD:  We look forward to hearing from John Durham. We've invited him to be on this show. When we come back, we're going to look at the impact of the Durham report on the FBI, and what role it may play for an institution that's increasingly under partisan attack.  CHUCK TODD:  Welcome back. If you only consume media on the right, you might be excused for thinking this week's 306-page Durham report on the Russian inquiry was a “bombshell” and “damning” and that the investigation was an “abomination” and a “soft coup.” But special counsel John Durham's actual sharpest conclusions after a four-year investigation were that the FBI suffered from confirmation bias and, quote, ""discounted or willfully ignored material information” that countered the narrative of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.The report recommended no “wholesale changes” to FBI rules for regulations or wiretaps, and Durham did not send a single person to jail, even though former President Trump once predicted that Durham would uncover the crime of the century. That said, Dan Balz, this is not an FBI that should feel good about what Durham discovered because at a minimum, this issue of confirmation bias, it goes to the heart of how James Comey seemed to worry so much about what the perception of the FBI was that he – whether it was overdid or underdid Hillary stuff and then overdid or underdid Trump stuff.  DAN BALZ:  Well, since, since Comey, the FBI has been under attack. And the Durham report in many ways confirms what the DOJ IG –  CHUCK TODD:  It's almost identical, really –  DAN BALZ:  It's almost identical.  CHUCK TODD:  Yeah.  DAN BALZ:  And in some ways backed off some of the rhetoric that they had going into it. But the FBI's been in a compromised position. And part of that has to do with the nature of our politics today. The FBI has become a politicized institution and a political target, and this is going to make it much more difficult for Merrick Garland as he goes forward with these investigations, and I don't see any way out of that in the – anywhere in the near future.  CHUCK TODD:  No. And let me throw in this headline from your newspaper, Dan. ""FBI misused surveillance tool on January 6th suspects, BLM” —- Black Lives Matter – “arrestees and others."" Symone, look, trust in the FBI is eroding left and right. Feels like we're in a moment that we need a real Church Committee, that this is a moment like J. – when the J. Edgar Hoover FBI clearly was no longer helping the American people, there was a moment. This feels like we might be in one of those moments.  SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND:  I would say yes and no, okay? Yes, because obviously, we – I mean, as Dan was talking, I thought about the activists – the civil rights activists, Black Lives Matter activists, Black Panthers –  CHUCK TODD:  Who have also been –  SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND:  – who have been targets of the FBI for eons and years, okay, going back to well before this current political climate that we sit in. But FBI agents, law enforcement across the country, people who work for the government, they are in a precarious position because of this belief in the quote unquote ""deep state"" that does not – I would argue it doesn't exist. But depending on what you read about this report, you could be persuaded to believe that it does. FBI agents' offices have been targeted, right? Their lives have been put in danger. And so would a Church Committee do anything but play to – right into the hands of those in the far wing spaces and places of America?  CHUCK TODD:  I hear you, but we got to – it seems like we have to do something to restore trust. We have to – and it has to be moderate trust.  CARLOS CURBELO:  And the reason, Chuck, is that the FBI – you know, the opponents of the FBI, the conspiracy theorists, the people who want to diminish our institutions, they just need, you know, 10% of the truth, 15% of the truth –  CHUCK TODD:  If that.  CARLOS CURBELO:  – to make a living and to bring down the institution. So the FBI has to raise its standards because they can't even give these people an inch. With an inch, they can bring down these institutions.  CHUCK TODD:  And I'll be honest. Christopher Wray hides.  CAROL LEE:  Well –  CHUCK TODD:  He hides. He does – he only goes before Congress, and he doesn't defend the institution publicly.  CAROL LEE:  There is a lot of consternation within the FBI about that, about the way he postures publicly. There’s a couple places where this is really going to come to a head this year, and that is the two special counsel investigations, the Hunter Biden investigation and the reauthorization of Section 702 —  CHUCK TODD:  With those FISA warrants, yeah.  CAROL LEE:  — of the FISA warrant. And that is something that's going to be a huge fight. The White House has been worried about it already for months. It's going to get worse. And all of this is going to be on display at that time, at the – by the end of the year.  CHUCK TODD:  All right. I have to end it there.

"political coup","2019-05-21","19:00:00","{""Jakarta"", ""Jakarta"", ""Indonesia""}","2023-05-22T03:58:47","TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The democracy and human rights aspects in the country has allegedly worsened as Indonesia celebrates 25 years after the fall of a dictatorship and started the reformed democratic era known as the ‘reformasi,’ the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) reported.  The human rights watchdog argues that corroding democracy is indicated by a return of a regime that tends to be authoritarian, similar to the traits shown by the New Order government prior to democracy.  ""The ideals and reform mandate for Indonesia to get out of an authoritarian era, indications [shows otherwise as such trait] has recently re-emerged and strengthened,"" said KontraS Coordinator, Fatia Maulidiyanti in a statement on May 21.  X  She argues that agendas towards a reformed era such as constitutional amendment have been enacted but still lack legal supremacy, and the eradication of acts of corruption, and the accountability of New Order criminals have yet to come to fruition.  Democracy suffered a serious setback, Fatia argues, which is marked by the curbing of the freedom of expression by the rule of law, weak oversight of power, and elections that are prone to fraud.  The KontraS coordinator said that a number of legal regulations were made precisely to restrain public freedom, which can be observed in the newly-passed Criminal Code. According to her, the regulation still contains a number of articles that can potentially threaten democracy, such as the ban against acts that slander state authorities.  Fatia argues a bad pattern of legislation has formed evidenced by the lack of meaningful participation from the public. An example is the speedy introduction of certain regulations, such as the Minerba (minerals and coal) Law, the Constitutional Court Law, and the Job Creation Law.  ""Existing regulations are no less problematic, as is the case with the ITE Law (electronic information and transactions law) which has claimed many victims,"" she said.  President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s political party consolidation attempts ahead of the 2024 general elections are also seen as an attempt by those in power to determine the results of the election. Fatia argues that a president should maintain neutrality instead of shredding democracy by actively participating in electoral negotiations.  The plan to revise the Armed Forces Law or Undang-Undang TNI is also being criticized as she argues it blatantly goes against the military reform mandated by the public during the reformasi transition.  KontraS asserted that an in-depth evaluation and self-reflection must be done during the 25th anniversary of the reformed era of democracy. She also said the struggle and bloodshed towards a more democratic nation will be of no use if actors responsible for past crimes are currently spreading their influences within the government.

"political coup","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T09:00:53","By KITSEPILE NYATHI More by this Author  Less than four months to the end of Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangawa’s first term, the date for the southern African country’s next elections is still a mystery amid calls for electoral reforms.  Constitutionally, the terms of office for elected officials, including for President Mnangagwa, end in August.  On Monday, the Constitutional Court dismissed on a technicality an application by Douglas Mwonzora, leader of the MDC-T opposition party, who wanted drawing of electoral boundaries declared unconstitutional.  Mr Mwonzora also wanted the court to postpone the elections until the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), the country’s independent polls management body, does a fresh delimitation of constituencies.  Read: Zimbabwe opposition braces for 'rough' election  The opposition leader is now expected to take his case to the High Court as directed by the Constitutional court, adding more uncertainty to the anticipated polls. Election watchdogs say the confusion over election day is complicating an electoral process that has already been marred by lack of reforms and closure of the democratic space with another disputed poll now more likely.  Advertisement  ERC speaks  The Election Resource Centre (ERC), a leading think tank and advocacy organisation on electoral and democracy issues in Zimbabwe, said the increased calls for suspension of the 2023 elections were worrying.  “Elections are central to Zimbabwe’s democracy,” ERC said.  “Through elections, the fundamental right of every citizen to political participation is realised and elections guarantee the philosophical-political principle of democracy.  “Suspending elections would be a clear violation of the rights of Zimbabweans to participate in the democratic process and would be a step away from democratic accountability and has the potential to lead to political instability.”  Veritas, a legal think tank that provides information on the work of parliament of Zimbabwe, said the country’s elections cannot be delayed beyond August 26. “President Mnangagwa was sworn in for his current term on the 26th of August 2018, Parliament’s five-year term will end five years later on the August 26, 2023,” Veritas said in a bulletin on the possible dates for the 2023 General Election.  Read: Zimbabwe opposition fears skewed poll  “Polling day in the 2023 election must not be more than 30 days before that, i.e., no earlier than the 27th of July 2023, hence polling day in this year’s General Election must be between 27th July and 28th August.”  The ERC said the push for the suspension of the polls was a threat to Zimbabwe’s constitutional democracy.  “Should the elections get suspended, this could lead Zimbabwe to a legal lacuna as there is no extension provision (in the constitution) regarding terms of office,” the think tank added.    “The constitution makes it clear that power should be acquired only through a periodic election conducted every five years, and the term of office of elected government officers is strictly five years.  There is no legal basis that will allow the current government to legitimately remain in power past August 26, 2023, therefore any proposed suspension of the 2023 harmonised elections poses a threat to Zimbabwe’s democracy.’’  Mr Mwonzora, who described the Constitutional court judgement as political, said Zimbabwe was not in a position to hold free and fair elections because the process to create new electoral boundaries was flawed.  Read: Countdown: Africa’s elections in 2023  “We want free and fair elections in Zimbabwe and there can never be free and fair elections where the delimitation report is so fundamentally flawed,” he said. “This is a recipe for disaster for our country. It makes our country a laughingstock; it makes our country’s reputation as a constitutional democracy go up in the winds.  “We do not accept that judgement. We have received legal advice and the matter is not stopping here and we are going to continue with our struggle for democracy.  “We are fortified that we are right, and we are not going to give up.”  President Mnangagwa, who rose to power after a coup against long time ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017, will once again face-off with Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVhc3RhZnJpY2FuLmNvLmtlL3RlYS9yZXN0LW9mLWFmcmljYS9jbGFtb3VyLWZvci1yZWZvcm1zLXB1dHMtemltYmFid2UtcG9sbHMtaW4tZG91YnQtNDI0MTQxNNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVhc3RhZnJpY2FuLmNvLmtlL3RlYS9yZXN0LW9mLWFmcmljYS9jbGFtb3VyLWZvci1yZWZvcm1zLXB1dHMtemltYmFid2UtcG9sbHMtaW4tZG91YnQtNDI0MTQxND92aWV3PWh0bWxhbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This includes a decline in investments in Israeli companies, a sharp decrease in the establishment of new startups, widespread layoffs, and more.  Harel Buchris emphasized the need for government support, highlighting the alarming situation. ""Foreign investors are losing confidence in our ability to deliver. 80% of investments come from abroad. While there is a global crisis, Israel's decline is disproportionately higher.  ""It's not just about numbers; there's a negative atmosphere. An entire generation of young companies is being lost. In four months, we've undone what took 20 years to construct from the ground up. The locomotive that drives Israel is derailing, and the Treasury is turning a deaf ear,"" she said.  MK David Bitan, Chairman of the Economy Committee, addressed the issue, emphasizing the significance of the high-tech sector as a driving force for the Israeli economy. He stressed the importance of preventing any negative impact on the sector to avoid detrimental consequences for the economy.  While acknowledging the gradual nature of political processes, he expressed hope that the situation would not unfold as perceived and assured that efforts would be made to avert such an outcome.

"political coup","2018-05-29","Not Discerned","{""TelAvivYafo"", ""TelAviv"", ""Israel""}","2023-05-21T17:12:00","Twenty weeks into their sustained campaign against the government’s plan to siphon off judicial power, leaders of the national protest movement have made an apparent change in strategy.  With legislation to shake up the judiciary on hold until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government passes a state budget by its May 29 deadline, the protest movement has now twice held major demonstrations against the planned allocation of billions of shekels to sectoral interests that answer the demands of Netanyahu’s far-right and ultra-Orthodox political partners.  Coalition politicians have long attacked the anti-overhaul protest movement as a left-wing attempt to topple Netanyahu’s hard-right coalition and force new elections. By expanding their focus to the budget and its largesse for ultra-Orthodox religious study and settler priorities, demonstrators were attacked across social media for ostensibly revealing their hand, implying that their opposition to the judicial overhaul was really part of a larger ploy against a government they did not want.  The protest movement, a loosely organized confederation of over 50 groups that has consistently drawn hundreds of thousands of Israelis to the streets in the past four-and-a-half months, has no political leadership, but demonstrations are frequently addressed by opposition politicians from the right to the left of the political spectrum.  To the extent that the protest movement has lay leadership, its representatives are adamant that the budget issue is part-and-parcel of the judicial overhaul plans, arguing that budget concessions to key allies are necessary to keep the coalition afloat.

The government is using the salami-slicing technique and giving money to their political cronies is part of the danger of a dictatorial regime,” said Josh Drill, a spokesman for the national protest movement.  “We saw these techniques used in Poland and Hungary and will not allow the government to succeed,” he told The Times of Israel. The protesters’ demands stand, he added. They want the judicial overhaul off the table completely and to remove any potential threat of the rise of a non-democratic regime.  Ami Dror, a prominent protest activist who previously oversaw Netanyahu’s security during the premier’s first term in the late 1990s, similarly said that “the budget connects” to the judicial fight because “it’s clear that the reason the prime minister is willing to spend NIS 13 billion in political bribes is to maintain his coalition in order to pass” legislation to redraw power lines.  Advertisement  The cabinet last week approved NIS 13.7 billion ($3.7 billion) worth of coalition funds mainly allocated to support ultra-Orthodox institutions and programs, a move that drew fierce criticism from opposition parties.  “Right now we’re not seeing any movement with the judicial coup,” Dror said. But every move the government makes leads to that end-goal, “so that they can pass the judicial coup,” he added.  Protest leaders have said they believe the Netanyahu government will turn its sights back to passing the controversial judicial overhaul plan after the budget is approved.  With this rationale, on Saturday evening, the Tel Aviv protest that has become the movement’s flagship demonstration shifted its focus from judicial independence to budgetary allocations.  The nearly 100,000 protesters gathered in the city unfurled signs that read “looters’ government,” with protest groups explaining that this “refers to the government’s attempt to give NIS 14 billion of taxpayer money to the ultra-Orthodox and ultra-nationalist settler parties.”  Last Wednesday, the message was even more explicit, as thousands of protesters converged on the central ultra-Orthodox enclave of Bnei Brak, home to Knesset Finance Committee chair MK Moshe Gafni.  Advertisement  The rally was held to protest the state budget, which Gafni’s committee approved for its final Knesset votes a day prior.  “We are marching on Bnei Brak to make it clear to the government that is destroying our home — and in particular to the ultra-Orthodox leadership, which is with one hand collaborating with the dictatorship and with the other hand looting the coffers,” organizers said before the rally.  This coming Tuesday, protesters from the high-tech sector plan to rally outside of the Knesset, to “stop the plundering,” as the budget is expected to go up for its final votes.  If the budget does not pass by the end of the day on May 29, Israel will face its sixth round of elections in four years.  ביום שלישי ב-17:00 כולנו בכנסת, עוצרים את הביזה. pic.twitter.com/l8uHQn2BwR — מחאת ההייטק (@Techrael1) May 21, 2023  Whether or not countering the budget is another line of attack against “dictatorship” or against enabling the coalition that wants to change judicial power boundaries, the strategy has made some within the anti-overhaul protest uncomfortable.  “In terms of strategy, if we focus on the budget, we will lose the momentum of the real thing,” said one of the leaders of a major protest group, who spoke to The Times of Israel on the condition of anonymity.  Advertisement  Other prominent protest figures said that there were “more directions than people,” and that the dozen or so figures that lend their voices to the national leadership are not clear on their “precise goals.”  Pressure to attack the budget has come from the high-tech protest faction, which is also deeply concerned with how a deficit-widening budget may affect Israel’s macroeconomic position, especially as increased spending may worsen already high inflation.  Other corners of the protest movement are still figuring out their position toward the new line, underscoring the challenges in presenting a unified front among a large group of parties lacking centralized decision-making.  Hebrew-language media was flooded on Sunday morning with Tel Aviv protest participants who said they came out to demonstrate against weakening the judiciary, but were “uncomfortable” with expanding into what they felt was a political or social fight against the ultra-Orthodox community or settlers and their representatives.  Organizers of Saturday’s protest in Jerusalem stressed that their rally was directed against the government’s “harmful moves” and didn’t feature “hate against any community in our Israeli home — not the Haredi, nor the secular or Arab [communities].”  With only a week until the 2023-2034 budget is expected to be finalized, after which judicial legislation is expected to return to the fore of the coalition’s work, it is not yet clear whether the budget debate is a small crack in the protest movement’s strategy, or a larger one in how protesters view themselves and their struggle.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL3JhbGx5aW5nLWFnYWluc3QtbG9vbWluZy1idWRnZXQtYW50aS1vdmVyaGF1bC1wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLW1heS1iZS1vdmVycmVhY2hpbmcv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vcmFsbHlpbmctYWdhaW5zdC1sb29taW5nLWJ1ZGdldC1hbnRpLW92ZXJoYXVsLXByb3Rlc3RlcnMtbWF5LWJlLW92ZXJyZWFjaGluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1917-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T11:03:45","The new concept of Russia’s foreign policy, unexpectedly for many, introduced the concept of a state-civilisation in official use. Its appearance may be the beginning of a change in the conceptual framework of Russian foreign policy thinking. Moreover, the changes may both be compared with post-Soviet doctrinal documents and with the basic guidelines of the Soviet period. The new conceptual framework faces serious competition with three major political theories. Here we are talking about the “big three” — liberalism, socialism and conservatism. Each such theory has its own concepts (interpretations) of international relations and foreign policy. A shift towards the notion of civilisation can be an alternative line of thought, which, however, will require careful intellectual elaboration. However, until such a study is completed, realism retains its relevance as the basis of foreign policy.  What is Political Theory?  Political theory is how we understand the system of normative views and ideas and the proper arrangement of power relations; the goals, values and means of domestic and foreign policy. What distinguishes political theory from ideology is the presence of arguments which are open to being criticised and contested. Ideology claims a single and undeniable view. Every theory requires scientific reflection and constant re-examination. An ideology can be derived from a theory, feeding on its concepts and assumptions. However, it cannot replace theory. In the case of such a substitution, the theory becomes unviable. Each political theory is a system of concepts, that is, interpretations of individual key concepts—power, authority, good, freedom, justice, interest, etc. Major political theories offer their interpretations of foreign policy and international relations. They can directly or indirectly set the paradigm of foreign policy and the contours of foreign policy thinking. Three basic political theories have developed in modern political thought: liberalism, socialism and conservatism. They have many variations and branches, which does not prevent their fundamental assumptions from being preserved.  Liberal Theory: From the Rational Individual to the Nation State  Liberal theory can be called rationalistic. It proceeds from the assumption of the power of the human mind, which is capable of taming the manifestations of the worst aspects of human nature – aggression, prejudice, ignorance, selfishness and, as a consequence, the Hobbesian “war of all against all.” By analogy with the taming of the elements of nature with the help of rational technical inventions, the elements of war, violence and other social vices can be brought under control by a rational political order. In liberal political theory, the social contract, embodied in the system of legal institutions of the state, has become a cornerstone concept (although the very concept of a social contract has deeper roots and is not ignored by other theories). Institutions, on the one hand, serve the public good, that is, the reduction of disasters and the growth of wealth. On the other hand, they act in the name of freedom from despotism. Justice is understood in terms of legal norms common to everyone. Accordingly, the source of state sovereignty is the nation as a political community of equal citizens of the state. The nation-state is in many ways a liberal concept that has gradually become the “world standard” for conceptualising the state as such. The nation, as the source of sovereignty and legitimacy of power, delegates power to elected representatives who exercise it in accordance with legal norms. The latter, in turn, are determined through rational procedures that are transparent to citizens. The rational order of the rule of law is a means of controlling internal anarchy and serves to establish a community of citizens with equal rights. Liberation from class boundaries and prejudices is the value and goal of the nation state. Historically, all these provisions had a direct connection with political practice. They became the doctrinal basis of a number of bourgeois revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to tectonic changes in the nature of states. Huge masses of the population were emancipated, and the usual monarchical and imperial orders collapsed. The liberal doctrine of the nation state retained its influence during the process of decolonisation. The overwhelming majority of new states became republics, adopted constitutions, and declared their peoples to be the source of sovereignty. Often the transition to the nation-state was bloody. It commonly failed to lead, properly, to the achievement of liberal ideals. The energy of revolutionary chaos sometimes gave rise to ugly political forms, nominally called republics, which in fact they were modernised despotisms with formal democratic attributes.  The liberal interpretation of international relations was also rationalistic. International relations are anarchic. There is a “war of all against all” going on within them, which cannot be stopped due to the lack of a monopoly on power and the use of force by one specific country or a community of such countries. This means that anarchy must also be taken under the control of a rational order in the form of international institutions. They must be supported by economic interdependence, which makes wars unprofitable. In addition, the guarantee of peace between peoples is their democratisation. From the liberal perspective, wars are the result of the arbitrariness of elites, which are not controlled by citizens. If they are brought under control by democratic institutions, then there will be fewer wars, or they will disappear altogether. By default, the liberal theory of international relations implies that individual countries can take the lead in solving the problem of anarchy and war. They must be democracies themselves, promote democratisation to others, guarantee the stability of world trade, organise the international community in the form of institutions, and, if necessary, use force against violators of the new order. Liberal political theory has become the framework of US foreign policy thinking, although it has not completely absorbed it. The period of the unipolar moment after the end of the Cold War can be considered the pinnacle of the practical implementation of this doctrine: the United States was the leader of the victorious democratic world, its former rivals, the USSR and the Soviet bloc, sought to join the “world community”, the American-centric globalisation of the economy was gaining momentum, and the United States was the key military power, intervening in conflicts and the affairs of individual states at its own will, while simultaneously playing a crucial role in international institutions, including the UN.  Socialist Theory: Reason vs. Alienation  Socialist theory, like liberal theory, also proceeds from the limitless possibilities of the human mind. However, if liberalism was forged in the struggle against obsolete imperial and monarchical forms, socialism challenged both the old order and liberalism itself. Just like liberalism, socialism postulates the idea of liberation (emancipation) of a person from class orders, religious prejudices and despotic rulers. Socialism is also based on the Enlightenment ideas of rational progress. It would seem that both theories are compatible. But socialism takes aim at an important aspect of the liberal model—the capitalist economy. The bourgeoisie is the engine of liberal revolutions. Properly, it freed the citizens from the oppression of classes and prejudices. Free labour is the basis of the capitalist economy. A citizen is limited only by laws that are adopted on his behalf and on behalf of his equal fellow citizens. Free labour is an atom of the capitalist economy, selling its own labour or buying someone else’s labour at its own discretion, while alienating part of the cost of such labour in its favour. It is either an employee or a capitalist. The difference between the two is that the worker receives stability in the form of a predictable income, but alienates part of his labour to the capitalist. The latter, on the other hand, appropriates the added value, but at the same time takes on the risks of the failure of the capitalist enterprise, because the success of the business model is far from guaranteed.  It was the problem of alienation that became the basis of the socialist critique of liberalism. Not without reason, the socialists pointed to the growth of monopoly capital and its concentration, to the alienation of the labour of huge masses of working people, to the social problems generated by such alienation, to the many crises of the capitalist economies, which left millions unemployed and living in the streets. In international relations, the socialists saw the main problem in the acceleration of imperialism. Big capital merged with state institutions. The developed industrial powers were actively expanding, using, among other things, military force. Capitalism gave a powerful impetus to colonialism. While gradually and unevenly forming democratic institutions at home, the capitalist powers at the same time pursued aggressive policies in their colonies. Like the liberals, the socialists offered a rationalist solution though revolutionary changes to put an end, on the one hand, to the old and obsolete monarchical and class order. On the other hand, they sought to crush the capitalist economy to free the broad masses from the trap of alienation. For international relations, the destruction of capitalism would also mean a solution to the problem of imperialism. The working people have no reason to fight with each other and nothing to share. The solidarity of workers is the basis of peace. The economy would be organised in the form of rational planning and distribution, and the state, amid such conditions, would change its nature to embrace true democracy, or even wither away.  It is symptomatic that among the great powers of the early twentieth century, socialism won its first major victory precisely in Russia. On the one hand, by the beginning of the 20th century, Russia retained political forms that were backward for those times. The demand for political change in favour of greater representation of the people and the rule of law was gathering momentum for most of the 19th century. The authorities understood the threat, but the reforms threatened to cost them control, leading to the complete collapse of the political system. Time after time, reforms were incomplete and episodic. Gaining momentum, capitalism exerted a growing pressure on the political system. At the same time, capitalism itself in Russia was largely peripheral in nature. Russia’s place in the international division of labour was far from optimal. The country remained backward, although the pace of its development at the beginning of the 20th century was amazing. This development, however, was extremely uneven, giving rise to new and potentially dangerous social movements. In the 19th century, the key challenge to power was the small intelligentsia, liberal or socialist in orientation. With all its activity (from the coup attempts by the Decembrists and the opposing nobility to the Narodnaya Volya terrorists), the government successfully suppressed the protests. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the urban proletariat became a revolutionary force. Moreover, its domestic version differed from the Western European one. It was more marginal and socially vulnerable. At the same time, it was more developed in comparison with the overwhelming majority of the peasant population and was receptive to revolutionary ideas. The “labour aristocracy” and the middle class were too small compared to the larger and poorer masses of the proletariat. The number of such masses was constantly growing due to unprecedented population growth, the scarcity of land suitable for efficient agriculture, and the attractiveness of a few industrial cities as a source of income. While remaining a small social group across the country, the concentration of the proletariat in the cities acquired an important political significance. The revolution of 1905 was the first harbinger of the catastrophe awaiting the old order. The revolution of February 1917 brought it down. The revolution of October 1917 put an end to liberal throwing forces by a small, but at the same time organised and motivated group that seized power in the country via a coup. At the same time, the victorious Bolsheviks managed to retain power, relying on the attractiveness and innovation of the ideas of socialism at the time. Vladimir Lenin was undoubtedly its most prominent theoretician. Without their political doctrine, the Bolsheviks would hardly have been able to retain power in the country and make it legitimate. Socialism became a powerful tool for maintaining their control and fundamentally modernising the state. The countries of the capitalist world acquired in the eyes of Russia a most dangerous rival, whose strength was based not only on the power of the resources and demographic base, but also on the advanced political theory and ideology.  Moreover, socialism promised to turn Russia into a modern, and therefore much more powerful state. The danger of Soviet Russia was of an ideological and, as it would turn out, quite material nature.  Conservative Answer  The victorious march of liberalism and socialism in the 19th and 20th centuries naturally gave rise to a conservative response. The key thought of the conservatives was that the human mind is far from being as perfect as it seemed to liberals and socialists. Rational schemes simply don’t work. The price of social experiments manifesting in a series of revolutions and subsequent wars is millions of lost human lives. Institutions must change evolutionarily, not revolutionary. It is impossible to destroy traditions mindlessly, to refuse authorities. Too much freedom is dangerous. Besides, it only exists on paper. In reality, power is seized by bureaucrats, who manipulate the masses at their discretion, on their own behalf. It is simply impossible to manage complex social systems with relying on planning methods – they are too complex. Changes must occur, but very carefully and without excesses. Justice cannot be understood as a rational clockwork.  In foreign policy thinking, conservatism manifested itself in the theoretical doctrine that is commonly called realism. The main thesis is that the anarchic nature of international relations cannot be brought under control by any rational scheme like a general international organisation. It simply will not withstand the pressure of contradictions between the great powers. Controlled anarchy is a harmful delusion. What matters is national interests, which are determined by common sense, not by rational abstraction. The optimal strategy for a state is to prepare for the worst-case scenario, be powerful enough not to be the prey of its neighbours, to negotiate and to compromise if necessary. At the same time, the political structure of states is not taken into account by realists. Both democracies and autocracies have the same predatory instincts in the international arena. To say that democracies do not fight is both duplicitous and hypocritical.  Realism emerged as an influential doctrine between the world wars and especially during the Cold War. In the US, it was bizarrely combined with liberal political theory. Liberalism manifested itself in the form of an ideological canvas, but political decisions were often dictated by the logic of realism. Behind the velvet glove of liberalism was an iron conservative hand. A similar model, albeit with its own characteristics, has developed in the USSR. The Soviet leadership quite quickly, by historical standards, cooled down on the idea of a global revolution and the abandonment of the state system. State interests in the field of security have become a significant driver of policy despite external ideologisation. The Soviet Union built a community of socialist states, but their solidarity also concealed very pragmatic interests.  During the Cold War, realism turned into an unofficial, but at the same time significant conceptual framework for Soviet foreign policy. As the resources of socialist ideology were exhausted, realism objectively became more and more in demand. The crisis of socialist theory in the Soviet Union at the late stage of its existence can be explained by many factors. Among them were the excessive ideologisation of theory, cynicism and growing corruption among the political elite, fear of reforming the political and economic system, its reasonable democratisation and emancipation, the actual replacement of the power of the Soviets by the power of an overly centralised and less effective bureaucracy, and growing frustration and cynicism within society. All this took place against the backdrop of colossal achievements in science, technology, industry, and the solution of many development problems. At the same time, the socialist challenge became a powerful stimulus for the renewal of liberalism. Western countries, including the United States, have introduced a number of elements that are commonly associated with the socialist Soviet experience. Among them are major state social programs, the planning of certain areas of economic development, and the fight against poverty. The collapse of the Soviet Union briefly made ideas of integration into the liberal community the central thought process governing Russia’s foreign policy. This was reflected in Mikhail Gorbachev’s “new thinking” and doctrinal documents of the early 1990s. During the presidency of Boris Yeltsin, Russia moved away from liberal idealism. Foreign policy thinking was based increasingly on the principles of realism, which were finally consolidated in the Munich speech of Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007.  Nationalism and the Big Three  Speaking of the “big three” political theories, the question arises about the place of nationalism. Is it an independent doctrine? Can nationalism be considered a political theory comparable to the Big Three? We should start with the fact that nationalism is a powerful ideological construction that has manifested itself in the political development of the vast majority of modern states. In some cases, it was based on political principles. In particular, it can be considered a derivative of the liberal idea of the nation as a political community. Nationalism coexisted quite well with socialism through the idea of political representation. The Soviet version of socialism added an ethnic component to the concept of a nation. The Soviet republics were a political representation of large ethnic groups united by common socialist principles. Nationalism also found common ground with conservatism. Historical and cultural traditions became an important source for constructing the identity of many modern nation states; more precisely, they constructed modern interpretations of such traditions. The key difference is that any nationalism is local, while the “big three” political theories are universal. The locality of nationalism does not prevent it from being quietly present even in those states that promote universal ideas. American liberal messianism goes well with American patriotism and a specific local identity. Modern Chinese socialism is also combined with Chinese nationalism, giving rise to socialism with Chinese characteristics. The same could be said about the Soviet Union, which combined the state-sponsored nationalisms of the republics and all-Soviet patriotism. With the Soviet Union, this approach played a cruel joke. The national identities of the new states of the post-Soviet space were carefully prepared by the Soviet leadership itself. In some cases, nationalism has degenerated into ugly forms like fascism or national socialism. The defeat of fascism and Nazism by the Soviet Union and its Western allies was the most important event of the twentieth century, but it did not completely solve the problem. Neo-Nazism makes itself known in the 21st century.  Moment of Unipolarity  After the end of the Cold War, the United States reached the height of its power. It would seem that liberal theory had no alternatives left. Russia had withdrawn from the competition, quickly shedding its liberal illusions and focusing on its pragmatic interests and a realist foreign policy paradigm. China has retained its commitment to socialism with its own national characteristics, but at the same time successfully integrated into the Western-centric global economy. The European Union, despite its economic strength, remained in the liberal paradigm and its variations. India concentrated on its development, relying on its self-sufficient national and cultural bonds. The Islamic world, one way or another, had a religious community, but was not politically consolidated. There was no political consolidation in Latin America, Africa, or Asia. The post-Cold War world seemed unshakable in its unipolarity.  However, the moment of unipolarity did not last long. In the United States itself, an understanding of a possible weakening of their role in the international arena began to take shape as early as the 1990s. There were material factors driving such a weakening. Among them was the economic growth of new centres of power, which sooner or later could be transformed into military power and qualitatively new political ambitions. The limits of US influence on internal processes in a number of states have been outlined. It was possible to turn a blind eye to “rogue states” such as the DPRK or Iran, but the obvious course towards autonomous policymaking in China and Russia could only be met with alarm. At the same time, both China and Russia remained an important part of the US-centric global economy. The big question was what would prevail – the benefits of globalisation or the desire to maintain autonomy and independence, including on fundamental issues of foreign policy? Ultimately, it was China and Russia that emerged as the most dangerous threats to American leadership. Moreover, the threats are not only material, but also ideological.  The growing economic and military power of China, independence in political decision-making, persistence in matters of principle in world politics, and the gradual exit of Chinese diplomacy outside the Asia-Pacific region are only part of the problem for the United States, and not the biggest one. After all, the US remains a major military and technological power with a large pool of allies and the ability to contain China. More importantly, China has adapted its own version of socialist theory to the new realities of international relations. Beijing has formulated a systematic and deeply developed doctrine. It is based on the idea of universal gain, the common destiny of mankind, and overcoming dividing lines and conflicts. China reinforces its ideas with a willingness to promote the development of other countries in the common interest, based on its own experience of successful and comprehensive modernisation. Whether willingly or not, China has created a powerful ideological platform based on socialist theory and its own modernisation experience, which is quite capable of becoming an alternative to the liberal vision of the modern world order.  Russia for a long time avoided formulating such ideas, relying on the principles of realism in foreign policy. However, the very fact that Russia has thrown an open challenge to the United States and its allies in the situation around Ukraine is a significant precedent. If the “Russian rebellion” is not suppressed, the blow to US prestige could be extremely painful. Such a blow would not necessarily bring down the US leadership. However, it can become a factor in its erosion. Combined with other factors, the risks for the US are growing.  At the same time, there are signs Russia is going beyond the usual realism and attempts to find new conceptual foundations of foreign policy. A significant indicator is the appearance in the new Foreign Policy Concept of a state-civilisation. It has the potential to develop further into a more systemic paradigm that is not reducible to the “big three” political theories. However, the path promises to be quite difficult.  Civilisational Approaches  The concept of civilisation has long appeared on the “radar” of political theory. For liberalism and socialism, civilisation is determined by the measure of the dominance of the human mind. The more civilised a society is, the more rationality and progress it has. Such a linear picture divides the world into developed civilised societies and undeveloped uncivilised ones, with a large grey area between them.  There was another approach, considering civilisations as large communities, united within themselves by spiritual and material culture and by no means always reduced to separate states. Civilisation can go far beyond the history of a particular state, and also spatially cover a large number of them. On the other hand, we can also talk about the existence of states-civilisations, such as China or India. But even in this case, their civilisational boundaries are wider than national ones, taking into account the large Chinese and Indian diasporas abroad. In addition, in the bosom of one civilisation there may be different ethnic groups that have similar tribal, civilisational features. This approach assumes the coexistence of several civilizsations at once. In their development, they can go through the stages of birth, flourishing, breaking, decline and death, although such a scenario is not necessarily predetermined. The concept of civilisations was developed by such prominent scientists as Nikolay Danilevsky, Oswald Spengler, Pitirim Sorokin, Arnold Toynbee and many others, and their developments went in parallel with the rapid conceptual development of the Big Three theories, forming, as it were, a parallel intellectual reality.  Civilisational Approach: Benefits  What is the advantage of this approach to international relations? First, the historical depth. Liberalism, socialism and conservatism often operate within a relatively narrow range of historical experience. At best, we are talking about several centuries, although their intellectual roots are much deeper. For civilisational studies, the depth of analysis is hundreds and even thousands of years. The system-forming cultural nodes of individual civilisations were laid long before the era of modernity and still retain their relevance. Second, this approach allows us to go beyond the usual scheme in which the players are nation-states. Obviously, cultural and civilisational motives can act as a factor in international politics, where not only interests but also identities collide. In addition, quite specific civilisational components are used in the national ideology of a number of states. A striking example is the states of the Islamic world. Third, the civilisational view covers both spiritual and material aspects of culture. The nation state is but one of the possible political forms born of the Western civilisation and, in a relatively short period of time, became ubiquitous, but not necessarily definitive.  Civilisational Approach: Disadvantages  There are also obvious disadvantages. First of all, historical depth does not always allow the real influence of distant history on modern politics to be revealed. The political identities of modern states are often artificially constructed. That is, political and intellectual elites choose certain civilisational aspects that correspond to their vision of identity, but just as successfully ignore others. In the same way, the process of constructing the image of a “significant other”, that is, an idea of key rivals or competitors on the world stage, takes place. Such constructs are also biased and do not solve practical and ideological problems. In other words, it would be incorrect to perceive civilisation only from the point of view of culture and history, while losing sight of the construction of culture and history by the elites of modern states. The modern idea of civilisation is not an idea of objectively existing civilisations, which are often politically conditioned.  Another shortcoming is that the civilisational factor plays an extremely contradictory role in explaining peace and war. So, for example, the “Anglo-Saxons” today are united by allied relations and common political interests. But at the beginning of the 20th century, Great Britain seriously considered the scenario of a naval war against the United States. Within the United States itself, in 1861, a civil war broke out between the “Anglo-Saxons”, which claimed more than half a million lives. In 1814, the British burned the White House and many other government buildings in Washington, and a few decades earlier, cultural and civilisational proximity did not help them keep 13 colonies obedient. What can we say about continental Europe, which at the beginning of the 18th century was called a single Christian community, but at the same time stood on the bones of the victims of hundreds of wars between European states, the apotheosis of which were two world wars? The powerful civilisational backlog of the Russian Empire in the form of a common cultural, political and material space did not prevent its collapse. The same is true of the Soviet Union, in which local nationalism at a critical moment in history turned out to be stronger than shared cultural, linguistic, ideological, infrastructural and many other bonds. In the current conflict in Ukraine, the opposing sides facing each other across the front lines are mentally almost the same people. They have similar habits, faith, language, and way of life. However, such proximity does not prevent the interference of nationalism, external forces and specific security interests. There are many such examples.  Another problem is determined by the complexity of combining the concepts of sovereignty and civilisation. The concept of sovereignty was developed in line with rationalist theories and was closely tied to the concept of the nation state. Its attachment to the concept of civilisation is much less obvious. It will work in those cases where the boundaries of civilisation and state more or less coincide. In such cases, albeit at a stretch, the sovereignty of a civilisation can be identified with the sovereignty of a nation. With certain reservations, we are talking about India, China, Japan (if, of course, we consider it a separate civilisation, and not part of the West, which is also undeniable). But what about less obvious cases like Africa, Latin America or the Islamic world? Each of them is home to many states. They have a certain cultural, historical or religious commonality. However, it is not enough for political consolidation. Nation states within such civilisations have different interests, material resources, and local cultures. Since their cultural closeness hardly generates a consolidated and stable political will, one can hardly speak of the sovereignty of civilisation in their relations. It will inevitably become attached to the nation state. If a civilization does not have political subjectivity, then it is very difficult to consider it as an actor in international relations.  The Concept of the State-Civilisation: the Russian Context  Let’s return to Russia. The appearance in the official document of the concept of the state-civilisation brings us back to the fundamental questions of our identity. Who are we? What is the nature of our state? What is our vision for the future for ourselves and for the rest of the world? Who are our “significant others”? To what extent are we willing to deny or accept “significant others”? Issues of identity are fundamental to foreign policy thinking. The direction of answers to the posed questions depends on our choice of the concepts we use to define ourselves. The concept of the state-civilization should hardly be underestimated as such a conceptual framework. However, it should be borne in mind that theoretical and practical work in this direction is complicated by several factors.  The first is the track of Russia’s identity over the last century and a half. At the end of the 19th century, Westernizers and Slavophiles drew a fairly clear picture of the conflict between our identities. For Westerners, Russia’s problem lies in its unfinished Westernization. From the time of Peter the Great and even before him, we adopted certain Western models (organisation of the army, bureaucracy and, to some extent, industry), but for various reasons we avoided larger-scale political, economic and social reforms. Accordingly, Westerners saw the task of Russia as completing modernisation according to the Western model and achieving the proper level of Western civilization. Slavophiles, on the contrary, saw in the reforms of Peter the Great as the beginning of the distortion of Russia’s civilizational identity, the perversion of its culture and way of life, the split of society and the elite, and the “satanisation” of the country. Accordingly, they considered the task of Russia as one of returning to its cultural and civilizational heritage. The victory of the revolution in Russia in 1917 was the unconditional triumph of Westernism. Socialism is of Western origin. The country has made a powerful leap forward. In terms of Westernism, the collapse of the Soviet Union can be seen as the result of the incompleteness of the Soviet modernisation project, the replacement of modern institutions with archaic imitations of them, coexisting with unprecedented and progressive achievements. Actually, the reforms of the late 1980s took place precisely under the slogans of modernisation, and the desire to integrate with the West also reflected the perception of the causes of the crisis of that time in an unfinished or distorted modernisation project. Throughout the 20th century, the West or parts of it were political opponents of Russia. But in terms of views on the organisation of society and its institutions, the Soviet Union developed under the influence of Western ideas. Thirty years of the history of post-Soviet Russia have also passed in accordance with the logic of Westernism. The conservative turn that began in the late 1990s fit in well with it. Another thing is that the movement did not remove specific political problems in relations with a number of Western countries, but in some places exacerbated them. The causes of such problems lay mainly in the conflict of interests, and not in the conflict of civilizational identity. Foreign policy thinking in terms of the state-civilization brings us back to the perception of Russia as a separate civilization for which the West is a “significant other.” This is a way out of the rut of at least one century. Getting out of this rut will not be easy.  The second factor is determined by the specifics of the development of Russian society. The domestic Slavophiles of the 19th century had a serious and real argument in the form of huge sections of the population retaining a system of traditional culture and values. They had not yet been affected by modernisation, had not been distorted by urbanisation, industrialisation and other attributes of modernity. A century and a half of such modernisation has greatly changed Russian society. It has become much less religious. Its traditional way of life was broken. The modern Russian is radically different from his ancestor who lived a century ago. While a number of developing states today have a purely human resource to rely on, offering cultural and civilizational bonds, then such resources, for Russia, are much more modest. The last 30 years somewhat reduced the Soviet excesses, but did not return, and could not return Russia to the past. Moreover, Russia has turned into a full-fledged capitalist state, with all the ensuing consequences for its culture and lifestyle. Of course, Russia has a colossal historical experience, which can and should be one of the foundations of its identity. A lot has been done in this respect over the past several decades. But the direct connection with tradition has narrowed along with the shrinking of the footprint of traditional society. Russia can be imagined as a state-civilization, but it is much more difficult to place it on a real-life civilizational platform. However, many others face the same challenge.  The third factor is related to the fact that other states-civilizations, and indeed a large number of other states, maintain close ties with the West and are not going to give them up, even if political relations with these countries spark on separate issues. Many are in favour of a multipolar world and constructive relations with Russia, but are in no hurry to give up certain products of Western civilization. China remains a socialist country, albeit with its own specifics. India is cultivating democratic institutions, even if they are not considered liberal by some Western observers. Numerous countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America generally distance themselves from the choice between the West and non-West, pragmatically using those elements of Western spiritual and material culture that they consider acceptable and beneficial for themselves. With the same success, elements of, for example, Chinese culture may be absorbed in the future. Civilizations that are more or less pure become abstractions. Whereas political practice still requires specifics, especially in building a dialogue on individual issues. The need to diversify world finances and move away from the dominance of the dollar is easier to justify by common security interests than in terms of civilizational differences from the West.  All things considered, the concept of a state-civilization makes it possible to construct our political identity, to complete it with new elements. But this will require a lot of theoretical work both on the concept itself and on a wider range of topics. It will not be easy to create a new, full-fledged political theory, an alternative to the Big Three. Russian reality, and international relations themselves, are permeated with the conceptual apparatus of the three “big” theories. Time will tell to what extent the concept of the state-civilization will be developed both in theory and in practice. The new Foreign Policy Concept leaves room for manoeuvre. In the meantime, the realism of foreign policy remains relevant.

But Russia claimed victory in Bakhmut, even though Ukraine says that it still holds a few blocks of the ruined city.  Even though Moscow is trumpeting a “Mission Accomplished” moment, Ukraine still sees an opening to seize the initiative from the city’s outskirts if Russian forces are no longer pressing forward inside the city’s center.  Russia’s capture of Bakhmut would be a powerful symbolic success. But controlling it would not necessarily help Russia toward its larger stated goal of conquering the eastern Donbas region. In fact, some analysts say that Russia’s ability to hold off a broader counteroffensive could be compromised if it continued to send reinforcements to defend Bakhmut.  Comparison: Zelensky acknowledged there was little left of Bakhmut. He said he saw echoes of Ukraine’s pain in images of the 1945 devastation in Hiroshima, where the summit was held.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvYnJpZWZpbmcvZzctemVsZW5za3ktYmFraG11dC1hc2lhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2022-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Beijing"", ""Beijing"", ""China""}","2023-05-22T03:41:12","For old Russian chess masters, the position is well known. It is a zugzwang: when any legal move will worsen the player’s situation, that of Moscow. Here it may be China’s luck. There are a few lessons Beijing can draw from Russia’s predicament.  Last week’s summit of the five ex-Soviet Central Asian republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) in Xi’an indicates that China wants to step into the region, sensing that Russia is losing its grip there.  Beijing apparently fears a power vacuum in Central Asia, which is crucial for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Moscow is absorbed in its war in Ukraine, and there could be a political crisis in the country.  Thirty years ago, with the fall of the Soviet Union, China saw the Central Asian republics becoming independent and increasingly unstable. Yet for fear of irking Russia, China didn’t move to try to stabilize the situation. Then other political actors stepped in, including the United States, much to the chagrin of Russia and China. Now China wants to avoid and prevent that.  China’s President Xi Jinping on May 19 unveiled an ambitious, comprehensive proposal to help landlocked Central Asia in its development—from building infrastructure networks to boosting trade—while shunning “external interference.”  It is unclear if India, Russia, Iran, or just the United States should be considered “external interference.” In January 2022, shortly before the Ukrainian invasion, Russia supported a coup in Kazakhstan, and some Kazak leaders ran to Beijing for help.  Beijing offered to create synergistic development strategies with the five Central Asian countries. “The world needs a Central Asia that is stable, prosperous, harmonious, and well-connected,” Xi said.  At the same time, the countries should jointly oppose “external interference” in the internal affairs of regional countries and attempts to instigate “color revolutions,” protests supported by the United States.  They should also maintain zero tolerance against terrorism, separatism, and extremism, Xi said. It reminded the five counties of past support for anti-Beijing activities in China’s western region of Xinjiang, inhabited by Uighurs, a Turkic minority close to the populations of four of the five republics.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and Kazakhstan leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in a file photo. Image: Facebook  “China is ready to help Central Asian countries improve their law enforcement, security, and defense capability construction,” Xi added.  It is not clear how much real traction the proposal will have. The republics are keen to hook up to China’s economic engine and link to its eastern ports. But local people are also wary of China’s pervasive economic penetration and are alarmed by the recent widespread crackdown on Uighurs in Xinjiang.  In any case, the five countries are currently going ahead with the plan, and in the future, China could smooth out many edges in its activities in the republics if it can pay close attention.  Russia out of Asia?  In any case, China’s move signals a Russian loss of power in the region and could actually hasten it. It builds on another significant concession. Beijing reported Russia is, for the first time, conceding to the Chinese use of the port of Vladivostok.  It is a breakthrough for the landlocked northwestern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang. Although details are still murky, the deal exposes Vladivostok to being de facto absorbed by China.  The Russian city has only 600,000 people, compared to some 100 million Chinese pushing over the border. Plus, China’s economic powerhouse could easily steamroll whatever business activity the Russians have in the city once the gates are open.  China’s northeast, formerly Manchuria, for some 40 years an economic laggard in the country, is in the past year booming, driven by Russian demand for cheap industrial products that are no longer available through Western exporters since the beginning of the war.  Opening Vladivostok could change the region’s economy but would de facto cause Moscow’s local political leverage to dwindle. Already many Russians from Siberia vacation in Hainan and shop in Shanghai. The trend would only speed up.  It was a scenario Russia tried to avoid for over a century. During this time, Russia apparently believed that the key to controlling Vladivostok long-term was to isolate the city from the neighboring overwhelming Chinese environment. Now Moscow is breaking its century-old vows.  Russia is doing so evidently because it needs the Chinese halting help to survive the war. For China, it also creates a precedent. Whatever happens to Russia in the future, once Vladivostok is connected with its Chinese backyard, it will be harder to slam the gates shut.  Then, in sum, Russia is slipping out of Siberia to have China’s support for the war in the West and because it is difficult to hold on to its far east while being occupied by a conflict elsewhere.  Losing East and West  Meanwhile, Russia is not winning in the West either. The three main goals of the Ukrainian war (controlling Kiev, splitting the EU and pushing the US out of Europe) have been lost.  Former iron allies are wrangling out of Russia’s bearhug. Belarus denied Russia its bases for the winter offensive; its president Alexander Lukashenko was allegedly ill and was out of the public eye for about three weeks. Moldova is withdrawing from its alliance with Russia, and another staunch pro-Russia ally, Armenia, is reaching out to Western powers, uncertain of Russia’s future heft.  Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine is not moving forward. After five months of offensive and on the eve of a Ukrainian counter-offensive, Moscow didn’t even conquer the town of Bakhmut. There are deepening fissures between the Russian army and the Wagner Group, the mercenary contractors spearheading the recent assaults. Mysterious terrorist attacks have killed two prominent pro-war “influencers” (Tatiana Dugina and Vladlen Tatarsky), plus a bizarre drone tried to hit one of the Kremlin’s domes.  A Wagner Group sleeve patch. Image: Facebook  In sum, Russia is losing to the East and West, and reasonably there is no real reversal in sight. Russian President Vladimir Putin failed in his Ukrainian gamble, but more broadly, his development mode was a failure. After the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Moscow’s elites gradually came to convince themselves Western capitalism wasn’t Russia’s cup of tea.  They couldn’t return to failed Soviet socialism, so they harked back to czarist times. Society came to be organized like then. There was a new czar, Putin, with an existential bond with the revamped Russian Orthodox Church headed by Patriarch Kirill.  There was no longer a court of land-owning old aristocrats monopolizing the economy but a court of new oligarchs monopolizing industry and resources. It was all secured by rich oil and gas exports and a mighty nuclear arsenal. It all replaced and remodeled the massive czarist grain exports and invincible army.  The pattern was well-oiled in the bones of the Russian people and more readily applicable than the mysterious ways of international capital tossing the Russian economy left and right.  The czarist pattern implied a 19th-century national pride, i.e., territorial affirmation against the Chechen uprising first, then against all other enemies, actual or imagined, at the Russian borders.  Nationalism was the cheap compensation for the Russian needy, cut off from the enormous wealth accruement of Moscow’s court. It was national pride rather than access to middle-class security, unattainable without a proper market economy.  It was a slow slide that gained speed over time and was, for a time, also secured by US attempts to appease Russia and get its support against the American strategic enemy, China. It lasted perhaps until the price for appeasement exceeded its possible upsides with the invasion of Ukraine.  Then the present Western and Eastern failures of Russia are the failures of the neo-czarist model and the failure to adapt to a full-fledged market economy. If so, it calls back to reevaluating the whole Russian experience of the 1990s. Gorbachev and Yeltsin didn’t cause the fall of the USSR; they tried to pull out and salvage whatever was possible in a country that was falling apart.  Did the US and the West do enough? Did they hurt Russian pride? Maybe yes, maybe no. Indeed, the US and the West did something for Russia. They invested, sent help to Russia and backed the moving of Ukrainian and Kazakh nuclear arsenals to Russia. The Russian invasion and perhaps the recent Xi’an summit would have been impossible without that move.  Gorbachev’s revenge  In retrospect, if after the 1998 Russian crisis Moscow had not swerved to its old habits but insisted on its market-oriented road, it would not be here. It would be somewhere else.  History is no video game where one can start over and there are set development patterns. Ifs and buts do not make history, as Croce put it. Still, after a ruinous quarter of a century, one can’t help but think that many things went wrong not with Gorbachev and Yeltsin but with Putin. Although, in all fairness, it is understandable that after the 1998 crisis Russian elites fancied the proven czarist model rather than the new, untested Western one.  Gorbachev and a young Putin. Image: Facebook  Here are two different lessons. For Russia, it’s perhaps time to check the losses. The longer the war, the more Putin’s Russia will be gone.  For Beijing, it is different. It may all come down to China’s luck, the country’s polar star in the past half a century. Thanks to the Russian crisis, not only can Beijing inch into Central Asia and envelop Vladivostok and eastern Siberia, but, most importantly, at a crucial junction of its history, it could avoid falling into what is clearly Putin’s trap.  Is it time for China to hark back to imperial structures or double down on opening up? The answer may not be the most pleasant and comfortable, but it must be the truest.

"political coup","1351-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T04:11:16","Treason has for hundreds of years been considered one of the most serious offences that a person can commit.  Whilst the criminal offence of treason dates at least as far back as Roman times, the vagaries and inconsistencies in what may amount to the offence are so vast and varied that, for the purposes of this article, we shall focus on when the legislation was enacted in England in 1351.  Vagueries and application  The ancient Roman words for treason, being ‘perduellio’ (generally high treason) and ‘maiestas’ (more common form of treason with several forms of spelling), varied confusingly in both definition and consequences over time.  However, this didn’t stop the English from reinstating Roman law when it suited them, as will later be explained.  This article will also take a look at some of the dynamics involved within the United Kingdom countries involving execution of royalty for treason in their individual quest for dominance from the late 1200s.  This includes one date when there was civil unrest not only in England but also the other UK countries involving King Charles 1 which is a story for another article which culminated in three civil wars.  The King was around for only two of them having been executed before the third one.  This will be followed by the outline of a number of other significant cases of treason which also ended in the execution of those who were convicted.  Within those dynamics we will draw attention to the colonisation of Canada where similar to other countries including Australia, the Indigenous peoples suffered in many ways. Particularly, the focus will be on the Metis Nation, one of three Indigenous peoples of Canada.  Origin and definition  The term treason is derived from Latin and Anglo-French language such as ‘Traditionem’ and ‘Treson’ or ‘Traison’ meaning to hand over or deliver by betrayal.  England in 1351 saw King Edward 111 give Royal Assent to the Treason Act which commenced about 14 years after the start of the 100 Year War against France.  Ireland got it in 1495 and next came Scotland much later in 1708. Wales had earlier been conquered in the late 1200s.  Treason is one of the rarest charges in legislation and still carries up to life imprisonment. In some countries ,the penalty is execution if convicted.  This crime includes significant offences against a country and/or its monarch by word or deed and includes spying, armed coups and incitement of wars.  Those who are involved in such actions are called traitors.  No death is a good death  Death by hanging within the British Empire was not a quick affair as it included torture by being dragged backwards by horses with the head on the ground to the gallows (place of execution).  The next process included hanging until close to death with the final indignation being the severing of genitals, removal of the heart and disembowelment.  Finally, what followed was decapitation with the body being quartered (cut into 4 parts) and the body parts put on public display in order to deter further treasonous acts by traitors to the Crown. Women were treated differently with being drawn and burned being the preferred method, apparently to protect their dignity.  Whilst the Treason Act 1814 (UK) changed the law in relation to the convicted male traitor to be hanged until dead, the heinous acts of dismemberment continued until 1870.  The women were no better off with the abolishment of being burned at the stake in the Treason Act 1790 apart from the fact beheading was the substitute and if one was really lucky, transportation was the punishment, particularly after the enactment of the Treason Felony Act of 1848.  Royal executions for treason  Sir William Wallace was a Scottish Knight who if alive today would have challenged Nicola Sturgeon for control of the Scottish National Party.  Sir William’s defeat of the English at the Battle of Stirling in 1297 paved the way for King Edward 1 to eventually add rebellion to the legislation of treason. Wallace was ultimately hung, drawn and quartered for High Treason in a place called Smithfield in London.  King Robert 1, otherwise known as Robert the Bruce was King of Scotland at one stage during the first war of Scottish independence.  His reign was from 1306 until his death in 1329. He was the victor of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 defeating King Edward 11’s English army and paving the way for Scottish independence in 1328 cemented by the Treaty of Edinburgh.  Robert the Bruce did not suffer execution for treason.  King Charles 1 ruler of England (and in essence Wales), Scotland and Ireland found himself the subject of a charge of treason against his own subjects after a decade long feud between he and his parliament from 1639 until his trial in 1649.  As legally the King could not be tried under the 1351 Treason Act as politicians have a won’t to do, they reinstated Roman Law which had a provision for a tyrant King to face a charge of treason.  The King was executed in 1649 in front of the Banqueting House in Whitehall London. One could not imagine a more squeamish setting had diners been present!  11 years later the monarchy was back in power with the son of King Charles 1 taking his father’s throne back and avenging Charles execution by gathering the regicides (those involved in the deliberate killing of a monarch in the form of a coup) and killing them all under the 1351 Treason Act.  This not only avenged his father’s death but sent a message certain to offer added protection to future monarchs. The Stuarts were back in town!  The cause of the initial feud between the king and parliament  The feud between King Charles 1 and his parliament involved money in relation to fight wars abroad and threatening his MPs that he would rule without parliament.  In addition, the King preferred the High Anglican form of worship which concerned the Puritan Protestants notwithstanding that his wife Queen Henrietta Maria of France was Catholic thus creating suspicion.  And on it went, the never-ending story of treason and executions with the 1351 Treason Act manipulated to suit those it served best. As indeed were subsequent Acts.  Most infamous acts of treasonable offences  Bonfire Night on each 5 November is celebrated by millions of people the world over and is regarded as a celebration of when the treasonable act of assassination of King James 1 was averted in 1605.  Guido (Guy) Fawkes ultimately convicted of High Treason who orchestrated the gunpowder plot to blow up the British parliament with the intention of killing the King is the reason for the celebration of Guy Fawkes night.  On this night the world skies light up in the glow of massive bonfires and a variety of colourful and sophisticated fireworks called roman candles – catherine wheels – fountains – mines – sparklers – repeaters and rockets are ignited which fly up into the sky.  The fireworks during the execution of Guy Fawkes and his co-conspirators were also enjoyed by thousands of spectators but of course not by the convicted. This was primarily because whilst alive the persons under sentence had their genitals sliced off and thrown into a fire before their very eyes, if indeed they were conscious.  Guy Fawkes though denied the King the satisfaction of this repulsive act of indignation of this part of his punishment by allegedly throwing himself from the gallows which broke his neck. It did not however stop the barbarous process from occurring.  Benedict Arnold  Despite earlier being regarded as an American hero of the American War of Independence, Benedict Arnold became a traitor who committed treason when he defected to the British Armed Forces around 1779.  Winning the war resulted in the establishment of the United States of America having achieved independence from the British Empire and forming a modern constitutional democracy.  Mr Arnold however never faced justice for his treason and indeed went on to fight against his country as a British army officer eventually retiring to England, dishonoured and disillusioned.  Canadian Indigenous peoples  The 1885 trial of a Canadian politician and leader of the Metis Nation Louis Riel who led two resistance movements against the Canadian government to preserve the Metis peoples rights – history – culture – language and lifestyle resulted in his execution for treason.  The Indigenous Metis are one of three constitutionally recognised Indigenous communities of Canada. He was hanged for High Treason but his legacy led to the Canadian government recognizing the Aboriginal peoples in the Canadian constitution where the Metis Nation was enshrined within it.  The other two Indigenous peoples are Indians and the Inuit.  In 1992, Canada passed a resolution recognizing Mr Riel as the founder of Manitoba with the Metis Nation ultimately being granted 1.25 million acres in Alberta, although they settled all over Canada and of course in many countries of the world.  Their language which is Michif and is a combination of Cree & French is currently endangered with fewer than several hundred Metis Nation citizens still fluent. However, programs are in progress to preserve their cultural language.  This is not far removed from what every colonised Indigenous First Nation Peoples could have experienced, including our own Australian Aboriginals and the potential dangers they faced with the enactment of the Treason Act, albeit several centuries later.  For history has shown that you didn’t have to lead an armed resistance movement against the government to face a charge of treason or many other criminal charges.  Lord Haw-Haw  1946 saw the prosecution of Lord Haw-Haw whose real name was William Brooke Joyce, an American born Fascist who assisted Germany during World War II by broadcasting Nazi propaganda and who was executed by hanging.  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg  American citizens and members of the Young Communists League, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of the treasonable charge of conspiracy to commit espionage (spying for the Soviet Union).  History appears to vindicate Ethel as being a traitor and only reports Julius as being a minor participant in treason, however this is countered by other historians quoting Soviet Union documentation said to have been released after the fall of communism.  This related to passing on to the Russians, US military electronic material from a radio factory associated with Julius’ employment as an electrical engineer at the Army Signal Corp engineering laboratories.  The charge however referred to providing information to the USSR in relation to the atomic bomb which Ethel’s brother was involved in and what was known as the Manhattan Project developing nuclear weapons.  Her brother David Greenglass turned informer resulting in his sister and brother-in-law being executed by the ‘electric chair’ in the notorious Sing Sing Prison in 1953.  The most infamous traitor or the most remarkable hero of human rights  Exposing to the world from 2010 heinous abuses of human rights, war crimes and corruption versus the risk to the national security of nations and individual agents of those nations.  UK Amnesty International, Le Monde, Time Media Choice and the Sydney Peace Foundation gold medal for peace with justice, were awards presented to Julian Assange which concur with President Obama’s Department of Justice comments on Wikileaks publishing of classified information which concluded with:  “such a prosecution would pose a severe threat to press freedom because there would be no way to prosecute Assange for publishing classified documents without also prosecuting the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian and others for doing exactly the same thing.  It would not and could not do so, consistent with the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment.”  This question has been and continues to be debated in many legal jurisdictions at the highest level with no clear result appearing imminent but still Australian citizen Julian Assange languishes in a British prison.  The United States, the country where Mr Assange is the ‘Most Wanted’ wasn’t always of this opinion. The Barack Obama 44th Presidency decreed that he was not America’s most wanted however President Obama’s sentiment didn’t last long.  The Donald Trump 45th Presidency decided that he was America’s most wanted as indeed does America’s current Joe Biden’s 46thPresidency.  Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard during her tenure stated that his actions were illegal, whilst the Australian Federal Police (AFP) commented that he had not broken any laws. Strong anecdotal evidence suggested by leaked National Security Agency (NSA) documents indicate that in 2010 Mr Assange was on what was called a US ‘manhunting timeline’ which was a reference to a clandestine national effort to capture or kill terrorists and others.  For the moment Julian Assange continues to languish in a British Prison awaiting his fate. For a detailed summary of Mr Assange’s predicament refer to recent SCL article titled ‘The Belmarsh Tribunal’.  Legal implications of being associated with treason  Australia, like that of many countries has Federal and State laws in relation to the offence of treason. The New South Wales perspective on this crime leaves nothing to the imagination about how serious this offence is regarded.  It is clear that any harm whatsoever to the King, his heir or any citizen representing the monarch in Australia (such as the Prime Minister and the Governor-General) in any overt or covert manner shall see such a person:  ‘guilty of an indictable offence called treason and liable to level 1 imprisonment (life); or imprisonment for such other term as is fixed by the court as the court so determines.’  Further, any person who helps someone whom to their knowledge is guilty of treason or intends to commit treason and doesn’t inform the authorities shall be guilty of an indictable offence with the penalty being:  ‘Life Imprisonment also or imprisonment for such other term as is fixed by the court as the court so determines.’  The current offence of treason in Australia  Treason is an offence under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which is an offence that applies across the nation and carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.  To establish the offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you:  Killed the sovereign, sovereign’s heir, governor-general or prime minister, or Harmed the sovereign, governor-general or prime minister leading to their death, or Harmed, imprisoned or restrained the sovereign, governor-general or prime minister, or Levied war, or undertook an act preparing for war, against the Commonwealth, or Instigated a non-citizen to invade the Commonwealth, or one of its territories.  Self-defence is a legal defence to the charge.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZG5leWNyaW1pbmFsbGF3eWVycy5jb20uYXUvYmxvZy90aGUtY3JpbWluYWwtb2ZmZW5jZS1vZi10cmVhc29uLWRlZmluaXRpb24tZXZvbHV0aW9uLWFuZC1wb2xpdGljYWwtYXBwbGljYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The development could spell further resignations from the once-ruling party PDP-Laban.  A political formation that once described itself as a socio-civic movement heeding President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s call for unity is now making a bid to be accredited as a national political party, a move that would allow it to field candidates for the 2025 senatorial race.  Behind the effort to establish the Kilusan ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP) are seasoned former and current lawmakers who are big names in their respective provinces.  The jury is still out on how Marcos himself could potentially utilize the party in 2025 if he ever wants to, but standing to immediately deal with the impact of KNP’s eventual accreditation is the once-ruling PDP-Laban, where most of KNP’s founding officers are coming from.  Commission on Elections Chairman George Garcia confirmed to Rappler on Sunday, May 21, that a Comelec hearing for KNP’s petition for registration is scheduled on Tuesday, May 23.  Its legal counsel Edward Gialogo explained an accredited party would be allowed to nominate candidates from the national to local races in the 2025 midterm polls, and even make a bid to become a dominant majority party, should it be in perfect shape by then.  News reports following the group’s launch in July 2022 described the KNP as a formation that seeks to reject a politics of division after a heated national election earlier that year. At the time, it had 200 members.  Duterte knows about it  Nine out of 12 founding officers of KNP are current lawmakers, and from that number, eight are currently part of the PDP-Laban contingent in the House of Representatives.  The officers of KNP, based on documents seen by Rappler, are as follows:  President: Bacolod City Mayor Albee Benitez  Vice president for Luzon: Pangasinan 6th District Representative Marlyn Primicias-Agabas  Vice president for Visayas: Leyte 4th District Representative Richard Gomez  Vice president for Mindanao: Zamboanga del Sur 1st District Representative Divina Grace Yu  Vice president for National Capital Region: Mandaluyong Mayor Benjamin Abalos Sr.  Secretary general: Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez  Deputy secretary general for Luzon: Nueva Ecija 3rd District Representative Ria Vergara  Deputy secretary general for NCR: Manila 1st District Representative Manuel Luis Lopez  Deputy secretary general for Visayas: Siquijor Representative Zaldy Villa  Deputy secretary general for Mindanao: Shirlyn Bañas, defeated 2022 General Santos mayoral candidate  Treasurer: San Jose Del Monte Representative Rida Robes  Auditor: Negros Occidental 3rd District Representative Kiko Benitez  Rappler asked Representative Vergara whether she would formally leave the party once the Comelec accredits KNP as a national political party.  “Should our application be approved, yes, I will be joining KNP as evidenced by our registration,” Vergara said on Sunday, May 21.  Representative Robes, who regularly represents PDP-Laban in House Speaker Martin Romualdez’s meetings with party officials, said PDP-Laban members who are set to leave the group have spoken with former president and party chairperson Rodrigo Duterte.  “When [former] president Duterte learned about the Kilusan ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino, he expressed his warm gratitude to all of us who were all present in the appreciation and farewell dinner on December 5,2022,” Robes told Rappler.  A high-ranking officer of PDP-Laban who declined to be named, however, downplayed the looming exit of a significant number of members from their party.  PDP-Laban itself has only around 40 members in the House, already down by half from the Duterte-era Congress.  “That’s the political reality, that some members would transfer to another party to seek new alliances or greener pastures,” the party source told Rappler.  Shakeup  PDP-Laban was the dominant majority party in the 2022 elections, out of 49 national parties recognized by the Comelec.  KNP’s move to join that list for the 2025 elections comes on the heels of growing tensions in the House of Representatives and Lakas-CMD, which the miniscule opposition interpreted as a sign of early political maneuverings for the midterm polls two years from now.  At the center of the House squabble is Lakas-CMD and its two officers: House Speaker Martin Romualdez (party president), and Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (chairperson emeritus).  Romualdez broke his silence on the issue on Sunday and underscored the need to nip “destabilization efforts” in the bud.  The statement was an apparent reference to rumors of an ouster plot against him, which came to light after his House majority demoted his mentor and longtime ally Arroyo from senior to regular deputy speaker.  Play Video  Arroyo previously denied engineering a coup against her mentee, and said she already let go of her speakership aspirations once it became clear that Marcos wanted cousin Romualdez to lead the chamber.  Marcos was nonchalant in public about the matter, even though Vice President Sara Duterte interestingly resigned from Lakas-CMD amid the the House squabble.  Marcos ran for president in 2022 under the banner of Partido Federal ng Pilipinas, but their alliance was a last-minute move, months before candidacy filing in 2021. A year after Marcos’ ascent to Malacañang, the PFP is all but a ruling party. It’s a non-factor in the House, where it has only two members.  If Comelec approves KNP’s petition, Marcos would have more political parties to choose from to assemble his administration ticket in 2025. The questions are: what will he do, and is it even already on his mind? – Rappler.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYXBwbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzYnJlYWsvaW5zaWRlLXRyYWNrL3BkcC1sYWJhbi1iaWd3aWdzLWZvcm0tbmV3LXBvbGl0aWNhbC1wYXJ0eS1raWx1c2FuLW5hZ2tha2Fpc2FuZy1waWxpcGluby1tYXktMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-07-15","17:00:00","{""Ankara"", ""Ankara"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-21T21:05:00","I am willing to devote my column today to the American and European handlers of the opposition in Türkiye so that they wouldn’t continue disgracing themselves in the forthcoming runoff presidential.  Ignoring your ignorance does not make it go away; that is what happened to the U.S. and the European Union regarding their ignorance of Türkiye.  As they say in the halls of justice all over the world, “ignorance of the law is no excuse,” if you are in the business of international politics you need to know about the global community well. Once again, American and European governments have fallen flat on their faces and they have been reduced to the spokesperson’s, “We will continue to work with the Turkish government” remarks, because they operate in their own echo chambers.  Needless to say, the administration of Joe Biden, bureaucrats in Brussels, and those people green as gooseberries in Bonn, London and Rome will continue to work with the winner of elections in Türkiye. They will have to work with whomever the Turkish people deem worthy of power. As a matter of fact, that is not the point. The point is, the Biden team tried to design the Turkish government in a way they wished to work with, and their puppets in some European capitals shamelessly expressed their support of the U.S. scheme.  As has been the case for the last two decades, the U.S. and EU will continue to work with the Erdoğan administration because the Turkish people are going to elect so next Sunday. It is not going to be the artificial alliance Joe Biden’s security and diplomatic team created in his infamous basement before he was even the Democratic candidate. Those people were Bush diplomats and national security people Biden resuscitated and cooped up in his basement. They were the neo-cons embracing the old and new globalist projects.  They didn’t have any original ideas to offer to Biden; so, they contented themselves to the age-old “redesign the Middle East” project with a new sugarcoat: If we help the Kurds create their own country by carving up territory from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Türkiye, we’ll have a secular shield for Israel. That would be a perfect sell point countering former U.S. President Donald Trump’s all-out pro-Israel stance, telling U.S. supporters, “Look, we are as good as Trump when it comes to protecting Israel.”  Biden's choices  As far as Türkiye is concerned, the Democratic candidate had a few choices.  “Yeah. I’ve spent a lot of time with (President Erdoğan). He is an autocrat,” Biden told New York Times in late 2019.  “What I think we should be doing is taking a very different approach to him now, making it clear that we support opposition leadership. Making it clear that we are in a position where we have a way which was working for a while to integrate the Kurdish population who wanted to participate in the process in their Parliament,” he added.  “We can support those elements of the Turkish leadership that still exist and get more from them and embolden them to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process. The last thing I would have done is to yield to him with regards to the Kurds,” Biden concluded.  There were problems with Biden’s remarks to the New York Times. Firstly, Kurds had become a better integral part of the political process thanks to Erdoğan’s social, economic and political reforms, and secondly, the opposition leadership was not in any position to defeat Erdoğan.  “Those elements of the Turkish leadership” Biden mentioned comprised of six antithetical political entities contradicting each other. The more Biden and his partners tried to “embolden them,” the more incompatible they became.  With the help of hindsight, we now have the results of the first round of the presidential elections last week, and we clearly see that the total vote count of the table of six was 5% less than the votes Erdoğan garnered all by himself; and that’s not including the votes cast in favor of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), which entered the elections under the lists of the Green Left Party (YSP) over fears of closure due to its alleged ties to the terrorist group PKK. The party entered the elections as the de facto seventh component of the coalition.  The Biden team apparently had no in-depth information about the opposition groups in Türkiye; neither had the opposition parties themselves. You cannot get to know Turkish people by simply cosplaying their master on social media channels; you have to be sincerely willing to get acquainted with them.  Kılıçdaroğlu's 'bold' attack  We can easily assume that the opposition candidate Mr. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu had been cued from overseas to volley Russia claiming that they were intervening in the Turkish elections. Even the FBI lacked any actual evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu made the audacious attack on the Russians, only to be rebuffed by Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for Russian President Vladimir Putin. His under-the-table deals with the HDP/YSP were so apparent that these parties’ demands for constitutional amendments to create a federation instead of a unitary homeland in Türkiye, bounced back to bite Kılıçdaroğlu. Perhaps Kılıçdaroğlu took his cheerleader about their participation in the political process at the White House too seriously.  In conclusion, your man in Ankara is going to lose this round of elections, again. But we, the people, are starting to find your ignorance of Türkiye a little annoying, after 70 years of a so-called alliance. You should have started getting to know the Turkish people when you had so much time. If Johnny Depp says that he has “no further need for Hollywood,” Hollywood couldn’t care less. But if the Turkish people say they reject closer ties to the U.S., NATO and EU, they all should put their thinking caps on; if they even have one in the attic because they don’t seem using it lately.  Why is that so? Because they did not do any proper analysis on the situation in Ukraine. They never did it about Hungary. They just sat idly and watched when China mediated the tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  All in all, we have to admit that the lack of leadership on the international stage, plus Biden’s deficit in charisma, are seemingly creating an insurmountable obstacle in our so-called alliance.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy93aGF0LXNvbWUtYW1lcmljYW5zLWRvbnQtdW5kZXJzdGFuZC1hYm91dC10dXJraXll0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlzYWJhaC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL3doYXQtc29tZS1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZG9udC11bmRlcnN0YW5kLWFib3V0LXR1cmtpeWUvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2021-01-20","12:00:00","{""Phoenix"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T17:43:06","It’s remarkable, in hindsight, that Donald Trump even showed up for work during the last week of his twisted 45th presidency in January 2021. After all, his fantasies that some sort of coup could overturn his stinging election defeat to now-President Joe Biden had melted in the deadly violence of Jan. 6, 2021, which prompted his unprecedented second impeachment.  But Trump had to race through some important unfinished business before the clock struck noon on Jan. 20, Biden’s inauguration day. The night before, the outgoing president issued a whopping 144 pardons and commutations as he wielded one of his few utterly unchecked powers granted in the U.S. Constitution. Indeed, looking just at pardons, Trump issued 116 of just 143 during his four years in office in his final month, January 2021.  To the very end, Trump ignored the practices of past presidents — who’d worked mostly off petitions that had been investigated by the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney — and granted clemency largely for connected folks that he tended to know, from close cronies like Roger Stone and Steve Bannon to his reality-TV pal Rod Blagojevich, the disgraced Illinois governor, to his son-in-law’s dad, Charles Kushner. Then there was an additional category: those who’d paid good money to Trump World insiders to plead their case.  On Jan. 17, 2021, the New York Times published an article headlined: “Prospect of Pardons in Final Days Fuels Market to Buy Access to Trump.” Based on more than three dozen interviews with key players, the Times confirmed that wealthy convicted felons were paying tens of thousands of dollars to insiders like a former Trump personal attorney, John Dowd, in the rush to gain clemency. To be clear, hiring a lawyer promising special access — while perhaps unseemly — is not new and probably not unlawful. But a Times passage about convicted ex-CIA leaker John Kiriakou, who paid an unnamed Trump associate $50,000 with a contingent promise of $50,000 more if a pardon was granted, included a jaw-dropping if unproven allegation:  Advertisement  “And Mr. Kiriakou was separately told that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani could help him secure a pardon for $2 million. Mr. Kiriakou rejected the offer, but an associate, fearing that Mr. Giuliani was illegally selling pardons, alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Giuliani challenged this characterization.”  Admittedly, the political world was ablaze on Jan. 17, 2021. It was four days after Trump’s second impeachment and three days before Biden took office, and in the massive forest fire of White House corruption, it seems that no one heard this tree falling. The FBI, battered victims of years of abuse from Trump and his allies in the right-wing media, seems to have taken the Kiriakou tip and placed it in a file, maybe the circular one. Over the last 28 months, that stray paragraph in a Times investigation had been completely forgotten.  Until last week.  That’s when a previously unknown aide to Giuliani named Noelle Dunphy backed up a gasoline tanker truck and unloaded it on the barely smoldering remains of the story. In a 70-page lawsuit alleging gross (literally) sexual misconduct and that the former Time Person of the Year mostly stiffed her for nearly three years of work, Dunphy also repeated the Kiriakou claim — that Giuliani bragged he could obtain a Trump pardon for that exact price of $2 million — with a new twist, that the big payday was meant to be divided with Trump. If true, Dunphy’s allegation means the money wasn’t an outrageous legal fee, but a bribe.  Look, I’m not going to go crazy — as I might have back in 2017 — and declare this is finally THE THING THAT WILL TAKE DOWN TRUMP. We know too much now about the neo-fascist indestructibility of the bond between Trump and his supporters, as we enter the “shoot-someone-in-the-middle-of-Fifth-Avenue” phase of what’s become a cult. The ex-president greatly expanded his lead in the 2024 GOP primaries even as he was indicted in Manhattan, a jury found that he sexually abused and defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll, and as other prosecutors close in from Georgia to the District of Columbia. Is this allegation any different?  Yes, and no. It’s true the 78-year-old Giuliani is a highly problematic figure. His drinking problem is well documented and, as the Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted in an analysis, his sexual desires toward Dunphy could have been a motivation to exaggerate his political clout and influence. But there’s also a lot of good reasons for the FBI to yank this out of the cold-case cabinet where it never should have been filed in the first place.  For one thing, bribery of a U.S. president is a highly serious offense; along with treason, it’s one of just two specific “high crimes and misdemeanors” spelled out in the Constitution. And in this case, I’m struck by the details that Dunphy and Kiriakou each provided — and by how their stories are consistent with each other. In her lawsuit, Dunphy said Giuliani not only told her to be on the lookout for millionaire pardon clients but said they must avoid the formal application with the Justice Department — which would create a paper trail.  Pennsylvania-born Kiriakou served prison time for what he disclosed about CIA operations in blowing the whistle on torture of post-9/11 terror suspects. He is, in other words, a truth teller. After Dunphy’s lawsuit last week, he was interviewed by Democracy Now’s Amy Goodman and revealed that he met personally with Giuliani, and others, at what was then the Trump Hotel in D.C. in the first week of January 2021.  “Interestingly, [a Giuliani associate] said we had to meet at noon because the mayor had a drink ... or two, or five earlier in the day,” Kiriakou said. He went with his lawyer to meet Giuliani, his assistant and another associate. After some chitchat, Kiriakou recalls “finally I said, ‘So Mr. Mayor, there’s this issue of a pardon,’ and Giuliani immediately said he needed to use the men’s room and stood up and walked away.” The associate then told Kiriakou he was not to mention the pardon directly to Giuliani and that “Rudy’s going to want two million bucks.” The ex-CIA agent said he laughed at both the figure and the audacity and soon walked out of the meeting.  Kiriakou never received a pardon from Trump.  So who did, and more importantly, why isn’t the FBI out there interviewing each and every one of them, in addition to scouring every line of Giuliani’s bank records? The long list of millionaire business executives, sports bettors, hip-hop artists and the like to whom Trump issued executive clemency in his final hours in the Oval Office would be a target-rich environment. But a full-blown criminal investigation should just be the starting point. It’s past time for pardon reform.  A defining feature of the Constitution is the web of checks and balances that arose from the Founders’ fear of autocracy, and yet the president’s authority to issue pardons or commutations has no check whatsoever. And abuse of a system intended to reward citizens who’d redeemed themselves after a criminal past was rising before Trump came on the scene. Actions that were unethical but not illegal — like George H.W. Bush pardoning actors in the Iran-contra scandal he himself might have been involved in, or Bill Clinton pardoning political donors like Marc Rich — set the stage for the arrival of a president with no moral compass whatsoever.  » READ MORE: Absolute pardon power for a corrupt narcissist like Trump was a giant goof. How can we fix it? | Will Bunch  Trump tested the waters early in his presidency by granting a pardon to a major political supporter, former Phoenix-area sheriff Joe Arpaio, before Arpaio could even be sentenced for his conviction related to unconstitutional traffic stops of Latinos. When there were no consequences, Trump soon relished in this one power that was truly dictatorial in nature. His most outrageous moves involved clemency that kept close political associates like Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and Roger Stone out of prison. Both Stone and Flynn used their presidential get-out-of-jail-free card to rile up Trump supporters ahead of the Jan. 6 insurrection.  Since Trump left office, the Justice Department has won guilty pleas or convictions of close to 600 of those insurrectionists. In seeking to retake the White House, Trump has made a stunning promise — to pardon perhaps most of those convicted — the centerpiece of his campaign. In a moment of legitimate fear over the future of U.S. democracy, this leading candidate is blatantly telling us he would rule as a king, and not a benevolent one. This would come on top of his documented first-term pardon abuses — and now the allegation of attempted bribery as well.  Enough already! The relative calm of the Biden presidency seems to have slowed one good idea for pardon reform, which would be to remove the pardon review office from the more politicized Justice Department and establish a bipartisan review commission, with a goal of clearing the backlog of more-deserving cases that was totally ignored by Trump.  But maybe a full-blown pardon scandal, as alleged last week, could be an impetus for the all-but-impossible reform that’s truly needed: a constitutional amendment. Let’s spell out the things that the framers were too naïve to include: that the president can’t pardon himself or his family members, and that they can’t issue pardons as a “lame duck” when they don’t worry about the political consequences — or impeachment. It might be necessary to design checks and balances involving Congress or the judiciary. James Madison and Alexander Hamilton hoped there would never be a Donald Trump. But he’s here — and we need to deal with this.  » READ MORE: SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvcnVkeS1naXVsaWFuaS1zZWxsaW5nLXRydW1wLXBhcmRvbnMtMjAyMzA1MjEuaHRtbNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvcnVkeS1naXVsaWFuaS1zZWxsaW5nLXRydW1wLXBhcmRvbnMtMjAyMzA1MjEuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The violence came despite a 7-day ceasefire agreed by the warring groups. (Anadolu)  KHARTOUM, Sudan – At least 18 civilians were killed in clashes between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group in the South Darfur region of western Sudan on Sunday, according to local medics.  In a statement, the Sudan Doctors Syndicate said two people were also injured in the violence that first broke out on Saturday in the provincial capital Nyala.  The NGO said the death toll could be higher amid heavy shelling across the city.  According to witnesses, several families have fled their homes to take refuge outside the city.  The violence came despite an agreement between the two military rivals for a seven-day ceasefire on Saturday following talks in Saudi Arabia.  At least 850 civilians have been killed and more than 3,300 injured in fighting between the army and the RSF since April 15, according to local medics.  After the first face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia, the army and the RSF signed a declaration of commitment to protect civilians in Sudan on May 11. Despite the agreement, clashes continued between the two conflicting parties, particularly in the capital Khartoum.  A disagreement had been fomenting in recent months between the army and the RSF over the paramilitary group’s integration into the armed forces, a key condition of Sudan's transition agreement with political groups.

"political coup","2019-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:11:06","In last week’s general election, the Move Forward and Pheu Thai parties – the main liberal opposition to the conservative and military-backed United Thai Nation and Palang Pracharath (UNTP) Party – won 152 and 141 seats respectively in Thailand’s House of Representatives. But while the opposition parties have won a majority of the House’s 500 seats, the prime minister must win the majority of the combined 750 seats in both the House and Senate to be elected. All 250 senators were appointed by the conservative military after the 2014 coup that put current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha in place, and, in elections since then, have unanimously re-elected him on behalf of the UTNP. In the next 60 days, these senators will have to approve the election results and vote for prime minister.  The opposition’s resounding victory in the House speaks to Thailand’s frustration with the lackluster COVID response, infighting amongst the conservative parties, and general economic stagnation which have characterized Prayuth’s term, as well as his ties to the monarchy and military.  Pita Limjaroenrat is the current candidate for the Move Forward Party (M.F.P.), but the Election Commission (which is heavily influenced by Prayuth’s government) has already filed complaints against him. The situation is uncertain; the M.F.P.’s predecessor, the Future Forward party, was disqualified and disbanded over a similar minor complaint, contributing to 2020’s massive protests for democracy and free speech. If Pita is removed from candidacy and the M.F.P. follows its predecessor’s example, the nation is likely to face a resurgence of protests and disquietude.  Democracy’s Past in Thailand  Since the monarchy was officially overthrown and a civilian-elected government was installed in 1932, Thailand has seen 20 different constitutions and about half as many coups. Forms of government under these constitutions ranged from dictatorships to full democracy, with some embracing more freedoms than others. The current government is democratic in name, but its unfair election process for the prime minister’s office is a telling sign.  Much of Thailand, especially the nation’s youth, has criticized Prayuth’s government for its refusal to uphold democratic freedoms. Apart from the dissolvement of the Future Forward party after the 2019 election, the lese majeste laws punishing any criticism of the monarchy with 3-15 years of prison have drawn vocal outcry for their rejection of free speech. The police used these lese majesty laws to arrest participants in the massive nationwide protests of 2020 and 2021. The process was highly flawed – the court did not even review the defence’s evidence, and many prisoners were denied bail, all for the crime of peacefully protesting against a government that has blatantly denied election results in order to increase the king’s wealth and maintain the powerful’s grip on the country. The Guardian reports that human rights experts have called the constitutional court’s decision to keep protest leaders imprisoned a “judicial coup” and a violation of human rights.  These measures, which the Guardian reports that human rights experts have called a “judicial coup” and a violation of human rights, were effective at suppressing the protests, but they have also eroded Thai citizens’ trust in their state institutions. This recent election saw an overwhelming 75% of registered voters vote against the established government in favor of reform promised by opposition parties. Evidently people have not been stopped from using their voice. It is now in Prayuth and the rest of his government’s hands to decide whether they will honor the people’s choice and affirm democracy and freedom.  Opposition Responding to Conservative Democratic Failures  How the next two months unfold will be critical. The M.F.P. and Pheu Thai Party might be able to gather enough support from other, smaller parties to elect Pita via coalition. If the coalition can convince the third-place Bhumjaithai party to join, for example, that party’s 70 seats in parliament would lend enough support to get Pita across the necessary voting threshold. This is the best chance for progressing the country because, based on the conservative track record, another four years of UTNP rule would only further suppress freedoms and democracy.  However, according to Reuters, the Bhumjaithai party announced Wednesday that it would not support any coalition which “supports amending or abolishing a law against insulting the powerful monarchy.” Probably in response, the coalition declared that potential partners do not need to support changing lese majesty laws to join, but caving to this condition goes back on one of the M.F.P.’s key campaign points. The party’s promise to change the lese majesty laws was a major draw to all the youth voters who protested that exact law a few years ago. Undermining progressive faith in the M.F.P.’s ability to create change would not bode well for the future of the party if they do take control.  That being said, compromising with Bhumjaithai, though very much less than ideal, is the best decision possible at this time: the alternative is to likely lose to the conservative military establishment. Voters should understand that this would be a worst-case scenario. When asked about what would happen if the current government stays in power, Titipol Phakdeewanich, professor of political science at the Ubon Ratchathani University in Thailand told Al-Jazeera that “I think the people of Thailand would not allow that to happen.” Progressive parties secured a clear margin in the election when they won at least 25 million out of the 39 million votes cast. The people clearly do not want a UNTP government; if shady tactics result in another conservative term as Prime Minister, it would trigger another massive round of protests.  In this event, Thailand’s citizens would, and should, come out to the streets to demonstrate and make their voices heard. But the military has already shown that it is not concerned with protestors’ safety. It is easy to imagine a larger, more intense round of protests being met with violence.  The best course forward, then, is to attract Bhumjaithai to the coalition, through whatever compromise is necessary to get Pita elected. Once Pita is prime minister, then progressive parties will be in a better place to create change over the next four years. With their position secured, the M.F.P. should call on citizens to pressure their P.M.s to vote in alignment with the progressive policies that citizens have shown they want in this election.  The progressive supporters have already shown their adeptness at using social media and the internet to rally behind the cause. The opposition’s ability to mobilize and communicate over the internet is a large reason why it was able to do so well in this election. They should further utilize this tool to pressure their representatives to vote for the policies that constituents want. In addition, the value of maintaining clear lines of communication from the M.F.P.’s leaders to their supporters should not be overlooked. Hopefully being open about why they have chosen to compromise with Bhumjaithai will sustain morale and preserve voters’ hope for the future should leaders decide to go this route.  Additionally, as global citizens, we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to support democratic efforts for freedom wherever they occur. This can take many forms, such as commenting on government officials’ social media posts or contacting them through whatever contact information is out there. Individuals and governments around the world should pressure Thailand’s government to do the right thing and listen to the constituents it swore to serve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlb3dwLm9yZy9yZXBvcnRzL3RoYWktb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi1wYXJ0aWVzLXdpbi1iaWctaW4tZWxlY3Rpb24tYnV0LXRoZXJlcy1zdGlsbC1tb3JlLXRvLWdvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-02-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T13:46:18","To be able to objectively actualise its core mandate and serve as an independent and unbiased electoral Commission, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the February 25 presidential election, Barr Adewole Adebayo, has counselled the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the urgent need to discontinue receiving subventions from foreign agencies to be truly independent.  Adebayo while speaking with Nigerian Tribune identified the receipt of funds from foreign agencies such as the European Union (EU) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by INEC as one of the factors hindering the conduct of free, free and credible elections in the country, stressing that its allows for undue interference in the country’s electoral processes.  He stated that such grants undermine the integrity of the electoral Commission and the electoral process, noting that both government institutions and Civil Societies Organisations receive the funds, which he termed as a “Father’s Christmas gift.”  He however queried INEC’s receipt of such subvention when INEC has collected the sum of N305b from Nigerians through the Federal Government.  He said, “Nigeria is a collection of foreign agents and that is why the international community will come to supervise our elections. When I addressed a gathering at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, (NIIA), I wanted to know why INEC, after collecting N305b from Nigerians through the FG, would still collect money from such foreign bodies as the European Union (EU) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) among others.  Almost 90 per cent of the Civil Societies we interacted with collected foreign funds, including the Peace Committee of Bishop Matthew Kukah and retired General Abdulsalami Abubakar. Many political parties too, including the ones calling for revolution and change, collected grants from foreign agents. This is not good for our electoral process.”  Assessing INEC’s conduct of the 2023 general elections, Barr Adebayo said INEC is a tool in the hands of politicians which they used for political succession.  He argued that in a situation whereby it is only the president that has the power to appoint the INEC chairman subject to the confirmation of the Senate, such an arrangement cannot conduct free, fair and credible elections and produce credible leaders.  He therefore urged Nigerians to support an alliance of young political structures to wrestle power from the old brigades that have dominated the political landscape of the country since 1999.  He stated that such an alliance with the support of the masses would ensure that the old political parties and their candidates are consigned to the dustbin of history for good.  The presidential candidate stated, “We must be interested in the electoral process all the time. As it is right now, it is Bola Ahmed Tinubu that will choose the next INEC chairman. I can guarantee that the person that would be appointed will make you conclude that the current INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu is an angel.      They might decide to appoint a full-time ex-convict. By our law, if Tinubu goes to Kuje prison to bring someone, and the Senate says the person is good, then the person automatically becomes the INEC chairman.”  He continued, “Those accusing INEC of being compromised should keep their cool as the electoral body is not different from every sphere of Nigerian life that is deep-neck in cheating.  “We have the tendency to cheat. What we are accusing the INEC of doing is the same thing you find with people writing the Unified Tertiary Institutions admission examinations conducted by the Joint Admission and Matriculation (JAMB), the examinations conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), and professional examinations as well as what we do when recruiting people into service.  It’s everywhere; that culture of people not wanting to do what is right. We only complain about cheating that doesn’t favour us. We must be interested in the process all the time.”  He stressed that a new Nigeria would only be possible if Nigerians could rise to support a coalition or an alliance of young political structures to wrestle power from the old brigades that have dominated the political landscape for a long time.  He lamented that the majority of the new political parties and their candidates were, during the campaign and subsequently the election, lone rangers, a development he said reduced the collective strength of the young and new entrants.  Commenting on the spate of insecurity as it discouraged influx of foreign investors into the country, Adebayo reacted thus, “Foreign investors will come to Nigeria, irrespective of the insecurity, depending on what they are coming to get because Nigerians are easy to cheat.  Some of the oil companies will come because our environmental standards are low, so they make a lot of profit. It is not all your admirers that genuinely come to your house to see you. Some came to admire your stupidity. Investors are not coming to do you a favour; they came to take advantage of you.”  Speaking on ethnic and tribal sentiment, he said, “This is not a problem in Nigeria. It is an instrument the elites use to deceive Nigerians to achieve their selfish ends.  The ordinary people do not think about that but the elite think differently. Give the same elite the opportunity to serve their own people, they will rob them blind and harass them. They will finish the people up, but when they go to the centre, they will be talking about religion and tribe.  If you go to Borno State, the contractors there are from Anambra and Abia States. If you go to Rivers State, Gov. Nyesome Wike is giving Rivers money in dollars to the traditional rulers in the North. He sponsored people for Hajj. You heard Dino Melaye saying that the last time he contested for election; it was Wike’s money and jet that he used. Are they from the same ethnicity?  When these politicians, businessmen and civil servants come back from an unhappy outcome, they will say Nigeria doesn’t love them. I don’t know of any country where citizens love one another like Nigeria. Nigerians love one another in the dark corners of the night.  Somebody from Borno State for the first time in his life goes to Mbaise in Imo State and they give him their first daughter. If you are my enemy, why would I give you my first daughter?  My family is from the United Nations of Nigeria. If you want to know that Nigerians love one another, go to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), you will discover Alhaji Danjuma, Mazi Okonkwo and Otunba Adedipe, are all doing business together.  Check when the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is charging criminals to court for say N52b fraud, you will see Mazi, Otunba and Mallam there. We are not just united in doing good things. We are not united to launch satellites into space but we are united in rigging the elections.”  Allaying fears that Nigeria might be heading for a military coup, the prince of Osemawe Kingdom said that would not happen because according to him, the military don’t plan coup except the political class ask them to do so.  “The soldiers are not interested in power. They are just like any other tool used by politicians. If the political class wants to plan a coup, they can use them to do it. But, from what I can see and the feelers I am getting, the political class is happy about what happened in the last election because the power still went back to them. It didn’t go to Sowore; it didn’t come to me, so they are happy,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS9kaXNjb250aW51ZS1yZWNlaXB0LW9mLXN1YnZlbnRpb25zLWZyb20tZXUtdXNhaWQtc2RwLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1jYW5kaWRhdGUtdGVsbHMtaW5lYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2014-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","2023-05-21T18:00:00","IT IS always a fascinating social phenomenon and intriguing political novelty when a younger generation of voters constitutes the critical mass that would solely determine the outcome of an election. This exact feature was seen in the Thai elections that took place recently. There were anticipations of the young voters rejecting the military-backed regime in power since 2014 after a coup.  However, the extent of reluctance of the Gen Z and Millenial voters to see the military regime in power was definitely surprising. The two opposition parties secured significantly greater vote shares with about 290 of the 500 seat in the lower house compared to only about 36 seats won by the party of prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who renewed his mandate through a controversial election in 2019.  The progressive Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old Ivy League-educated business executive Pita Limjaroenrat, came in first; and the second was Pheu Thai, the main opposition party, led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 36-year-old daughter of the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Both sent out a blunt message to the army that has interrupted the country’s democracy for about a decade. These two parties along with some smaller parties could constitute about 60 per cent of the Thai lower house.  Despite that, they may not be able to oust Prayuth and his allies. Under the rules established by the military-backed government, the job of prime minister is determined by a calculation combining both the 500 seats of the lower house and the 250 members of the unelected senate. The senate is full of patrons and/or beneficiaries of the military-backed regime. Thailand’s military leaders appoint all the 250 senators. Achieving the overall majority of 376 members to select a prime minister candidate may prove complex.  Pita Limcharoenrat has declared victory in the polls and has begun speaking to the media in the country and abroad. Among his several statements about restoring democracy, adherence to international rules-based order and respect for human rights, the most significant statement was about Thailand’s attitude towards Myanmar.  Thailand is one of the few countries to have shown open support for Myanmar’s coup leaders. It articulated a bilateral policy towards Myanmar that is incoherent with that of ASEAN. In November 2021, Thai deputy prime minister and foreign minister Don Pramudwinai visited Myanmar and met coup leader Min Aung Hlaing. On December 22, 2022, Thailand held a meeting with representatives from mainland Southeast Asia — Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam — including Myanmar, followed by another meeting with Myanmar stakeholders from Thailand and Myanmar in February 2023. These meetings and Thailand’s relations with Myanmar in the last eight years contravened ASEAN’s five-point consensus agreed on in April 2021.  Pita has affirmed in his interviews that during Prayuth’s government, Thailand’s overall policy and approach towards Myanmar will be overhauled. Pita committed to rework the Thai-Myanmar policy to make the Thai foreign policy and human rights dignified and respectable globally.  Pita underscored that Thailand’s policy towards Myanmar would be pivoted on ASEAN’s five-point consensus. Pita believes that Thailand should play a leading role in the process of promoting peace in Myanmar and create a ‘humanitarian corridor’ to accommodate refugees affected by the fighting in Myanmar.  The most significant political commitment regarding Myanmar that Pita underlined was the adoption of the US Burma Act that addresses the US government’s stance towards Myanmar. The Burma Act authorises funds and technical assistance for anti-junta forces in Myanmar, including ethnic armed organisations. The United States has pledged to continue to support Myanmar opposition forces inside and outside Myanmar.  Fearing that the US Burma Act may cause further frictions within Myanmar, jeopardising Myanmar junta’s grasp on the country, China’s new special envoy Deng Xijun met seven of Myanmar’s ethnic armed organisations in China’s Yunnan Province in the last week of December. It was followed by reports that China would provide assistance in health and education for the organisations as well as displaced civilians, indicating a new level of relationship between China and the organisations at the border. Deng stressed that his urging of the organisations came at the request of Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing. These bustle by Deng after the US passage of the Burma Act indicates that China does not want to see US aid and influence reaching such organisations based along the China border.  A discussion on the passage of the Burma Act and how it may impact Bangladesh was held in SIPG of NSU in Dhaka. Some experts in the event said that using a liberal interpretation of the non-lethal assistance clause may allow the United States to provide military support for the various ethnic armed organisations in Myanmar, which may undermine Bangladesh’s security as these groups have some ties to the same separatist factions operating in Bangladesh’s southeastern region.  While Myanmar’s NUG officially recognises the Rohingyas as an ethnic group of Myanmar and is in favor of peaceful and full repatriation of the Rohingyas from Bangladesh to Myanmar, the emergence of the Arakan Army as a key player in the conflict emphasises how reaching a resolution on the Rohingya issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar cannot be achieved without taking the Arakan Army’s interests into account. Not only the Arakan Army, there are other numerous ethnic minorities in Myanmar that are also involved in armed conflict with the military junta, their common enemy for the time being. If the situation changes, there is no telling how their ambitions change for self-determination, role in Myanmar’s governance, and/or what their approach towards each other would be.  The US Burma Act’s implementation can be effective through support of Bangladesh, India, and/or Thailand — the countries that share border with Myanmar. There is undeniable geopolitical and strategic importance of the Rakhine State to regional powers such as India and China. Rakhine’s vast reserves of hydrocarbon as well as its location as a key area for connectivity projects that links India to its northeast region and reinforces China’s Belt and Road Initiative respectively.  Thus, getting India’s support for the Burma Act is challenging, if not impossible. The only two options left are Bangladesh and Thailand. Bangladesh had seen its fair share of discourse identifying and underlining the concerns that the Burma Act may cause to Bangladesh’s southeastern peace and stability. And up until now, Thailand was also reluctant to allow any facilitation of the Burma Act; but things have taken a reverse course now, causing certain changes in the regional geopolitical dynamics to a great extent.  The strategic significance of Bangladesh for the implementation of the US Burma Act has now declined extensively, given that Thailand has expressed clear political will for facilitating it. How effective it would be for the ethnic armed organisations and the NUG, only time will tell. Whether the military-backed government loses its political grasp on Thailand to the extent that it would not be able to maintain the close relations with Myanmar or the military would ploy something new to maintain its strong grasp on Thailand’s governance are yet to be resolved before we can truly assess how Thailand’s political future will affect Myanmar’s struggle for democracy.  Thailand’s elections are important not only for many Thais but also for the more than 1.5 million Myanmar refugees and migrants who live in Myanmar and hope a new government can put an end to Bangkok’s support for the military regime in Naypyidaw. However, for the time being, Thailand’s new political outlook is poised to create a number of changes for the region. Interestingly or unfortunately, Bangladesh would be directly affected by these changes.

The cease-fire deal was reached between the two military rivals on Saturday during their face-to-face talks in the Saudi city of Jeddah.  The army said that the cease-fire will come into force on May 22.  “The Armed Forces announce its commitment to the agreement and hope that the rebel militia will abide by it,” the army added in a statement.  According to the statement, the agreement is limited to “a temporary military cease-fire, freedom of movement for civilians, and protecting them from violence and violations.”  There was no comment from the RSF on the army’s statement.  At least 850 civilians have been killed and more than 3,300 injured in fighting between the army and the RSF since April 15, according to local medics.  After the first face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia, the army and the RSF signed a declaration of commitment to protect civilians in Sudan on May 11. Despite the agreement, clashes continued between the two military rivals, particularly in the capital of Khartoum.  A disagreement had been fomenting in recent months between the army and the RSF over the paramilitary group’s integration into the armed forces, a key condition of Sudan's transition agreement with political groups.  Sudan has been without a functioning government since October 2021, when the military dismissed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's transitional government and declared a state of emergency in a move decried by political forces as a ""coup.""  Sudan's transitional period, which started in August 2019 after the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir, had been scheduled to end with elections in early 2024.  ---  Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L3JlZ2lvbi8yMTAwOTQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T09:04:20","Country overview  With an area of over 1.24 million square kilometers, Mali is the eighth-largest country in Africa, and home to various ethnic groups.  The country is a semi-presidential republic with a multi-party system. However, the country has faced political instability and military coups in recent history. A rebellion in 2012 led to a military coup, and the occupation of several regions in northern Mali by armed groups. Various French and regional forces intervened to regain control over the occupied territories. However, challenges surrounding security and political instability persisted. A second coup occurred in August 2020. Both coups were led by Colonel Assimi Goita, who was declared head of state in May 2021.    As of May 2023, the military government aims to hold a constitutional referendum, and promised to hold the first elections since the coup in February.    Mali signed and ratified the Arms Trade Treaty in 2013.  How many licenses for the sale of arms to Mali did the UK government issue between 2012 and 2022?  Between 2012 and 2022, Mali was granted 88 limited value standard licenses and 29 unlimited-value open licenses by the UK government.  What is the total value of those exports in GBP?  From 2012 to 2022, the UK approved £6.9 m worth of military export licenses to Mali with numbers peaking in 2016 when £2.2m worth of military equipment were exported.  Source: Campaign Against Arms Trade, 2023  What are the top 10 types of arms export licenses Britain is selling to Mali?  Top 10 military items exported from the UK to Mali between 2012-2022 Total number of licenses military helmets 42 components for body armour 34 body armour 27 military equipment for initiating explosives 12 military improvised explosive device decoying/detection/disposal/jamming equipment 10 components for military improvised explosive device decoying/detection/disposal/jamming equipment 10 bomb suits 9 components for munitions/ordnance detection/disposal equipment 8 components for military support aircraft 7 all-wheel drive vehicles with ballistic protection 5  Top 3 military export items from the UK to Mali between 2012-2022 by value Value in GBP ML10 ‒ Aircraft, helicopters, drones £2.2m ML4 ‒ Grenades, bombs, missiles, countermeasures £1.6m ML13 ‒ Armoured plate, body armour, helmets £1.3m  Source: Campaign Against Arms Trade, 2023  Why should British citizens be concerned about arms sales?  1) Regionally-based armed groups: The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) emerged in northern Mali in 2012, challenging the authority of the state. The lack of local administrative and security authorities exposes the population to all forms of violence.  2) State security forces were responsible for human rights abuses, especially during their counter-terrorism operations.  What has the British government said about these concerns?  Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey said: “Removing the weapons and disrupting the terrorist operation will make a real difference to the local community and importantly the intelligence collected will help develop our understanding and help to prevent the threat from armed groups in the future”. The Armed Forces of the United Kingdom are attempting to make a significant contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping effort. Particularly regarding the protection of civilians by hindering the advances of terrorist groups in West Africa.  What evidence is there of human rights abuses that the Mali government has committed since 2012?  In January 2012, separatist fighters affiliated with the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) launched military operations against government forces in northern Mali.  The Human Rights Division of MINUSMA recorded a significant increase in arrests. In seven months there were approximately 308 arrests. This was the result of multiple attacks on villages by armed or terrorist groups. 43 out of 149 detainees reported that they were subjected to acts of ill-treatment and torture by the Malian security forces.  According to a report by the Independent Expert on the Situation of Human Rights in Mali, there were at least 439 security incidents between January and August 2017, with the main threats being attacks on Malian defense and security forces and MINUSMA using improvised explosive devices. A 2019 report by the same research group, noted that the main threats to civilians are acts of violence carried out with automatic weapons against a backdrop of inter-communal tension.  Overall, Mali’s human rights situation deteriorated in 2020. In addition to this, I would also add a few additional points relating to the information found in the article.  In 2021 HRW reported that overall the human right situation in the country deteriorated with ongoing atrocities by all armed groups. According to the report, over 40 unlawful killings of suspects and civilians were conducted by Malian security forces, and at least 20 enforced disappearances.  Despite this catalog of harm, the UK still deems it acceptable to sell weapons and arms to Mali.  Human rights abuses continue.  Did you find this story interesting?

Felipe Hirsch will write and direct and Adriana Tavares of Café Royal will produce alongside Paula Linhares of Cenya Productions and Marcos Tellechea and Guilherme Somlo of Reagent Media.  Angicos begins in the town of the same name in Rio Grande do Norte in 1963, with the mission of educator Freire (Moura) to fight against illiteracy by teaching the entire village of blue-collar, domestic, and cotton farm workers how to read and write in only 40 hours – a seemingly impossible feat.  Funded by President John F. Kennedy to solidify the South American nation as an ally in the Cold War amidst worldwide social and economic tensions, the success of the endeavor resulted in the planned implementation of Freire’s literary system on a nationwide level. However, before long, political uprisings, a military coup and authoritarian local politicians resisted Freire’s education initiative, destroying texts, deeming the curriculum “subversive,” and eventually sending Freire into exile. These events demonstrated the power of literacy and education against autocratic rule – a testament to the significance of Freire’s methods.  “The enchantment amongst the people of Angicos by the battery-powered slide projectors Freire used in his classes is undeniable, especially as they associated the projections with cinema – something rare in their city at this time, as home television sets had not yet arrived,” said Hirsch. “To that end, Angicos doubles as a film about the power of cinema and the power of knowledge.”  Casting is underway for the film’s ensemble, with principal photography beginning in November of this year.  Hirsch is a Brazilian film and theater director and one of the founders of Ultralíricos, a company where he develops award-winning and critically-acclaimed experiential art. He has been elected by O Globo newspaper as one of the most influential thinkers in the country. In 2008, he won the Grammy for his work as the director of the show Homage to Tom Jobim.  In 2009, he directed his first feature film, Sunstroke, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. In 2016, he directed Severina, his second feature film, which made its world premiere at the Locarno Film Festival. Most recently, Hirsch developed the stage project Língua Brasileira with singer/songwriter Tom Zé, and also directed the concert special 2022 for HBO Max, featuring Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, and many other Brazilian musicians.  Moura is represented by FR Produções Artísticas and WME, Black Rabbit Media, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

"political coup","2016-11-08","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T10:21:18","It is now beyond argument that the greatest scandal in American political history was the Russian collusion hoax, a Hillary Clinton-financed insurrection against a duly-elected president by the FBI, Democrats, Russia and state-run media (but I repeat myself).  Compared to this vast left-wing conspiracy, Watergate doesn’t even rate a footnote.  The centerpiece of the monstrous hoax was the Democrats’ “Steele dossier.” And at the heart of that dirty trick was the so-called pee tape.  That was the allegation that future president Donald J. Trump paid Russian prostitutes to urinate on a hotel bed in Moscow that the Obamas had slept on, and that a videotape of the foul deed existed.  Very fake news. And everyone of Putin’s puppets with press passes knew it, from Day One.  The official DOJ report on the hoax was released last week. The local angle is that Special Counsel John Durham has identified the Democrat operative who most likely made up the pee-tape story that was used in the attempted coup:  Charles Dolan, age 72, a proud member of the Class of ’74 at ZooMass who is in fact a member of the advisory board of the school’s political-science department.  Comrade Dolan is an insurrectionist’s insurrectionist. How Red is he? He has long been on the payroll of both the Kremlin and the Clintons.  I’ve been inquiring for more than a year whether this tomato-nosed reprobate is still lurking on the UMass “advisory board.”  Finally, after the scathing 316-page DOJ report was issued Monday, ZooMass grudgingly responded to my question Thursday:  “The political science advisory board at UMass Amherst has been inactive since the pandemic. Current plans call for department-level advisory boards within the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences (including political science) to be phased out and superseded by subject-focused task forces attached to the Dean’s Advisory Board.”  In other words, instead of firing this lifelong hack after his service to The Party, UMass just “phases out” the board to spare Comrade Dolan’s feelings.  Professional courtesy…. how ZooMass is it?  Dolan was lugged for OUI in Essex County back in 2013 after getting legless at a hack hangout in Newburyport. He lost his driver’s license for 45 days and got a CWOF — continued without a finding. Again, professional courtesy…  According to the Durham report, Dolan conspired with a sinister foreign national named Igor Danchenko to create Hillary’s hoax “dossier.” Among other things, Danchenko was an illegal alien, a suspected Russian spy and, wait for it, a drunk driver.  Considering Dolan’s squalid career as a puppet of Putin, it makes perfect sense that the DOJ report concludes that in Dolan’s dossier “a significant majority of the information was, in whole or part, Russian disinformation.”  To repeat: the DOJ has concluded that Dolan’s dossier was “Russian disinformation.” When are all those Pulitzer Prizes going to be returned, or confiscated?  In 2016, dodgy Democrat Dolan had been in Moscow, doing the bidding of his Kremlin-Clinton paymasters. In fact, he visited the hotel where the dossier would soon claim Trump had hired the hookers.  “So,” Durham notes, if it comes down to a question of whether Danchenko or Dolan made up the story, “between the two, Dolan appears the more likely source of the allegations.”  Under oath during the hoax probe, Dolan came down with the customary Democrat amnesia. Asked whether he’d made up the pee-tape story, Dolan “vacillated” and was “inconsistent.”  Putin’s puppet had no “specific recollection” of fabricating the fantastic lie designed to overthrow the Republic.  Dolan admitted making up other whoppers in the “dossier,” but the pee tape was the biggest one, obviously.  And ZooMass couldn’t be any prouder of Dolan! For one of their organs, the hackademics slobbered over him and allowed the Kremlin aparatchik to brag that UMass “is part of my DNA.”  Given his driving record, surely Dolan meant to say UMass was part of his BAC — blood alcohol content.  The hack writer added, “Being involved in politics in so many different ways has honed Dolan’s ability to understand political framing …”  Political framing indeed! Could there be a bigger political framing than trying to railroad the president of the United States out of office for something he didn’t do?  Once Trump became president, the Democrats were desperate to cover up their diabolical fraud. So they began an “investigation” run by a senile, shady, deep-state operative, Robert Mueller, one of Rachael Rollins’ predecessors as U.S. attorney in Boston.  Corrupt Mueller’s bent Democrat prosecutors quickly realized that Dolan was at the bottom of the hoax. So they ordered the on-the-level FBI agents to lay off Dolan, lest he flip to stay out of prison.  (The FBI also paid Danchenko $220,000 to keep his mouth shut about their hoax. Those hush-money payoffs ended in October 2020 — when it was too late for the alleged Kremlin operative to bust the Biden Crime Family before the election.)  All this came out at the trial of Danchenko for lying to the feds. He was acquitted. Once again, professional courtesy.  An FBI agent testified that she was ordered by her Democrat bosses to leave Comrade Dolan alone, that any criminal evidence she turned up on him “was not going to be used … I was very concerned about a national security threat.”  Even the Clintons had the good sense to cut their loyal minion loose after all his decades in their tawdry service. They issued a Mission Impossible-like statement:  “A longtime aide to both Bill and Hillary Clinton said she has no recollection of Dolan.”  But ZooMass steadfastly stood behind the dodgy drunkard.  Is it worth noting here that the $658,574-a-year president of ZooMass used to be a Democrat congressman, that his $364,689-a-year legal counsel is a former Democrat district attorney, or that one of the $480,569-a-year coat holders is a second-generation Democrat payroll patriot who used to run errands at the State House for the Bulgers?  Dolan seems to be gone (sort of). But my prediction is that he will soon be back in Amherst, as his fellow travelers unveil a plaque commemorating his remarkable service to The Party.  A perfect spot for Dolan’s pee-tape plaque would be in the lobby — or maybe the men’s room — of the school’s W.E.B. Du Bois Library.  After all, W.E.B. Du Bois was a Communist, a card-carrying Red who adored Joe Stalin and wrote that the USSR was “the most hopeful country on earth.”  A plaque in a Red library at his own fourth-rate woke state college would be an appropriate tribute for Putin’s pampered puppet.

"political coup","2023-04-25","Not Discerned","{""NewDelhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T03:56:14","The recent surreptitious coup by the Taliban to insert its member in the Afghan Mission in New Delhi on April 25, 2023, raised the fundamental issue of the so-called Taliban government’s latent dysfunctional strategies that violates the norms of diplomacy, code of conduct and security. This incident has been widely condemned in the past two weeks.  The statement made by Suhail Shaheen, head of Taliban’s Political Office in Doha, who called it a “rational move’ by nominating Qadir Shah as the new chargé d’affaires (CDA) who initially served at the Afghan mission as a ‘Local Staff’ not accredited as a Diplomat by the republic government of Afghanistan in 2021 till Taliban claimed his candidature as the head of the mission on April 25 last month.  Is India Softening its Stand for Taliban?  The so-called Taliban government’s main spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid communicated through a video message stating that “The Islamic Emirate has sent diplomats to at least 14 countries and efforts are underway to take charge of other diplomatic missions abroad”. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan has so far taken control of 14 diplomatic missions abroad which include; Iran, Pakistan, China, Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Russia other Arab and African countries, which it can be seen are mostly SCO member countries. It appears that a conscientious decision has been arrived at by the SCO countries to induct Taliban elements into the Afghan Embassies in their respective countries. Taliban could not have inserted its representative into the Afghan Embassies in China, Russia or Iran without the knowledge of the respective countries.  The induced propaganda is viewed as the Taliban’s mechanization to gain legitimacy. Perhaps in preparation, India has conducted training for the Taliban officials in India in March this year virtually for four days crash course called “Immersing with Indian Thoughts”. The unfortunate part of it is, that the so-called Taliban government is neither legitimate nor has it earned international recognition by any of the countries in the world. The Taliban had usurped power from the legitimately elected Government of Afghanistan led by President Ghani in August 2021.  The self-appointed CDA by the de facto Taliban authorities, Qadir Shah has written an official letter to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stating that he has been appointed by the Taliban Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) on April 25, 2023, as the new CDA to take care of its interests in New Delhi and interestingly, chose an opportune time to sabotage the mission, when Ambassador Farid Mamundzay was travelling abroad.  Afghan Embassy’s Stand  Taliban-appointed Qadir Shah’s letter is not yet felicitated by MEA and at the same time, the Journalists are of the view that the government of India had declined to comment on the Taliban’s decision; with officials suggesting that this was an “internal” matter for the embassy to resolve and need to be settled amongst themselves.  However, the Afghanistan Embassy has chosen to dismiss the pro-Taliban diplomat from his services and has forbidden him from entering the Embassy premises.  The Embassy issued a statement stating that it ‘categorically rejects the claims from an individual claiming to have taken charge of the mission in New Delhi at the behest of the Taliban’. “We expect the relevant Indian authorities to take reasonable and appropriate steps in line with diplomatic norms while considering the great historic Indo-Afghan friendship. It’s an issue of great significance to the Afghan mission and moral and diplomatic principles,” said Ambassador Farid Mamundzay.  Qadir Shah has levelled corruption charges against the Embassy and its officials. The corruption charges were primarily aimed at evicting Ambassador Farid Mamundzay from his position to enable him to occupy his place. If he had concerns about the corruption and malpractices in the Embassy, the matter ought to have been brought up earlier not while writing to the MEA staking a claim to the post of Ambassador as appointed by the de facto Taliban authority. This is an afterthought adopted by him to oust Ambassador Farid Mamundzay who was appointed by the former elected Republic of Afghanistan and accredited by the President of India in 2021.  Afghanistan’s Ambassador to India said, “I represent a republic or a government which no longer exists, but I was appointed by a legitimately elected government. I do have that legitimacy serving in this mission”.  The Afghan Embassy in New Delhi has been functioning normally in an extraordinary situation since August 15, 2021, and it has been working as a bridge between the Government of India and Afghan refugees in India and the people of Afghanistan.  For over one year and a half, the Afghan mission in New Delhi has been working tirelessly and has continued to provide tailored assistance in difficult circumstances to respond to a humanitarian response plan to fulfill the needs of Afghan people conducting relief operations through wheat shipment, Covid vaccines, and evacuation operations, handling a scale of consular issues, trade and the Afghan Diaspora issues in India are some of the areas of the mission’s outreach to achieve it.  “It is an issue of principles and morality. My colleagues stood beside me in difficult times and they continued with their selfless service. There have been instances where they had to work on little incentives. They accepted many hardships for the larger interests of the Afghans both in India and in Afghanistan. Continuity under such circumstances becomes quite difficult. We don’t know for how long but as long as we can, we would (continue at the mission),” Ambassador Mamundzay said, adding that the diplomats working at the mission have barely managed to earn their salaries but still did not take the support of the Taliban government, which continues to send letters and directives to them, said Ambassador Farid Mamundzay.  Qadir Shah is a representative of the Taliban which is a terror organization, as declared by the UN and the regime took to power in Afghanistan surreptitiously by use of force. How can the matter of the Taliban’s surreptitious entry into the Afghan Embassy in New Delhi be an internal matter between the Afghanistan Embassy and the pro-Taliban diplomat? Allowing the Taliban sympathizer in the Afghan Embassy in an official capacity with diplomatic immunity has implications which need to be taken into account by the host country.  Taliban is a terror organization and it concluded the Doha Peace Agreement in 2020 with the US in the absence of any representative of the elected legitimate Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani.  The agreement, according to reports, is said to include assurances and guarantees of an inclusive government, equal rights to women and dismantling terror outfits on Afghan soil and that the Taliban will confine itself to the Afghan territory and it will not carry forward jihad or offensive actions across the boundary of Afghanistan. However, the presence and killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman-al-Zawahiri raises questions about the Taliban’s intentions and the validity of its promises.  Secondly, there has been no inclusive government as it guarantee in the Doha deal.  Third, women in Afghanistan have not been given any freedom even to attend schools and colleges. On the contrary, education has been banned and they have not been allowed to work or even go to restaurants.  It is evident from the fact that the Al-Qaeda leader, Ayman-al-Zawahiri was present in Kabul living in a house owned by the Haqqani Network Chief Sirajuddin Haqqani who was killed in a US drone attack in July 2022. In addition, China has always been concerned and threatened by the presence of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) on Afghan soil. ETIM is a terrorist organization designated by the UN Security Council and listed by the Chinese government law. Thus there is a permanent state of threat from Afghanistan which is capable of spiralling out of control in the region.  There are also reports about the presence of IMU, ISIS, TTP, ISKP, Jaish-e-Mohammad and other terror groups in Afghanistan. Their growth and effectiveness are directly linked to the rise of these terrorist elements in Afghanistan. No concrete actions have been taken by the so-called Taliban government on these groups yet.  There have been several instances where the militants from the northern borders of Afghanistan have targeted countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has emphasized that concerns about regional security have increased in Central Asia while Tajikistan announced on April 26 that two terrorists who had entered Tajikistan from Afghanistan have been killed. Tajik officials said that these two terrorists had planned terrorist attacks inside Tajikistan. The point is, Afghan-based militants, seem to be intending to take jihad into Central Asia.  These incidents indicate that the Taliban’s intention is not merely to confine itself to Afghanistan’s borders but to expand its reach to Central Asia. Why Central Asia? Central Asia is the gateway to China and Russia and the intention may be to expand jihad into these countries. It is therefore obvious that the terror threat from the Taliban has not been reduced and the terror outfit is unable to give up its linkages with other terror organizations.  Severe Security Breach  To top it, the so-called Taliban has appointed Sirajuddin Haqqani, a dreaded terrorist and the Amir of the Haqqani Network as the country’s home minister. The newly appointed PM and the head of the cabinet Mawlawi Abdul Kabir blacklisted by the United Nations in 2001, when he served as the acting prime minister of the then Taliban regime(1996-2001). He has his own trail of terror history of killings and terror activities according to the UN’s consolidated list of sanctioned terrorism-related individuals. He led the Peshawar Regional Shaura, Northwest Frontier Province, has authority over eastern and north-eastern Afghanistan.  With this background, how does the world countries expect the Taliban to reform in peaceful ways? Taliban attempting to insert its representative in Afghan Embassies is a grave security threat to the countries concerned, providing a foothold for the Taliban to expand its activities  Taliban is unlikely to change its ideology of ’Global Jihad’ in conjunction with the other terror groups. Though the Taliban may not be directly acting in this Jihad battle they would be encouraging and providing base facilities for terror outfits in Afghanistan. So to believe the Taliban will change or improve with the induction of their representatives in the embassy is completely absurd. In all probabilities, the Taliban elements which are there in official capacities in these embassies will form the base for the further construction of the terror infrastructure within the countries where they are located and for siphoning money to facilitate the Taliban’s ‘Global Jihad’.  The ‘Global Jihad’ as per the vision of Al Qaeda’s former leader Ayman Al Zawahiri’s ideology to establish the Islamic Emirates in the world, wherever it is, like in Syria, Africa, and Iraq. That being the case, in their own calculations they would like to use Afghanistan because of Afghanistan’s strategic location and to use the country to carry forward Jihad in various places which include; Central Asia, China, Russia Iran and all over the world.  Therefore, to expect that Afghanistan will be terror-free and Taliban to break linkages with these militant organizations is not possible, nevertheless, an elected legitimate government coming to power which is not linked to the Taliban is a ‘ray of hope’ to fight terrorism which requires resources, strength and external support from the international community.  The blowback of the repressive Taliban regime meted out to the Afghan people has caused acute poverty. As per the United Nations report, roughly 90 per cent of the population in Afghanistan is on the brink of poverty. To ward off the deteriorating humanitarian crisis, the so-called Taliban government has yet to demonstrate its capability rather than turning out to be an epicentre of the global terrorism hub.  “The 40 million Afghan people, held hostage by 100,000 Taliban, require solidarity, support and ongoing assistance. We appreciate the consistent position of India to consider the interest of all Afghan citizens post-August 2021. However, more work and efforts are required to change the status quo,” said Ambassador Mamundzay.  In this recent context, there is no alternative but to get the visa of the pro-Taliban diplomat cancelled and deport him back to Afghanistan unless these countries want this terror to spread in their countries and they want Islamic Jihad to be progressed.  The United Nations must continue its efforts along with the countries of the world to secure an elected legitimate government in Afghanistan and save Afghan people from the tyranny of the Taliban rule.  The world community must not endorse the unscrupulous move of the Taliban to surreptitiously induct its representatives into Afghan Embassies in the world, which could be a serious security threat to the region and to the larger world. Providing legitimacy to a terror group will encourage terror groups working to take control of countries from legitimate governments by use of force and violence.  The international community led by UN has the moral responsibility to resolve the Afghan crisis, manage economic uncertainty, rescue the sovereign democratic goals, and address the challenges to the global norms against the repressive Taliban regime. The people of Afghanistan cannot be abandoned in the midst of big power rivalry and a terror organisation’s repressions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWFuZGVmZW5jZXJldmlldy5jb20vc3BvdGxpZ2h0cy90YWxpYmFucy1mYWlsZWQtY291cC10by1lc3RhYmxpc2gtYS1mb290aG9sZC1pbi1hZmdoYW4tZW1iYXNzeS1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","2023-05-21T17:42:05","Raga Makawi  The situation is very dire. Fighting is widespread through the city and concentrated within neighborhoods where the RSF have set up its bases over the past four years. Moreover, as the two armed groups continue to battle in the middle of residential areas, people sheltering in place are cut off from either leaving or accessing lifesaving food and health items. There is no safe passage, and all attempts at brokering a short-term ceasefire have not held. There isn’t enough information on where the fighting areas are or how the street warfare is developing and in which direction; all we know is that it is widespread and has developed to engulf the entire city, flaring in some areas and dying in others before picking up again. On day two of the fighting, the military deployed its air force and since then it has been bombing the city indiscriminately. This act of hostility was met on the side of the RSF with rocket launchers, all in the middle of densely populated residential areas.  As the fighting moves from one part of the city to the other, both groups capture and lose areas at great loss of human life. Areas captured are being cordoned off and manned with heavily armed checkpoints, making it difficult for people to venture toward safety or leave the city. Furthermore, the dynamics of fighting are in themselves fluid. As both the RSF and SAF continue to redeploy their troops from the country’s peripheries and resupply their weapons stock, areas that were once relatively calm or captured are the focus of renewed fighting.  Omdurman and South Khartoum, relatively safer and quieter earlier in the week, are now experiencing more militarized presence and fighting as opposing troops regroup and re-strategize to attack each other. Lack of information and the failure of both generals to consider international laws of engagement have spelled catastrophe for the population of Khartoum. At the time of writing these words, the war strategies employed by both parties mean that the general public is being used as a human shield while being held hostage. Safe passages out of Khartoum available earlier in the week are closing up.  Lack of information and the failure of both generals to consider international laws of engagement have spelled catastrophe for the population of Khartoum.  The fighting in the city has also damaged Sudan’s already-skeleton infrastructure. Decades of state-directed austerity and the unrest it produced helped refuel conflict, redirecting much-needed funding from development to paying political favors to bolster the government’s longevity.  Just a few days after the fighting broke out, a Doctors Union spokesperson reported that fifty-five of seventy-eight hospitals in Sudan are now out of service. This spells catastrophe not just for the already high and increasing number of casualties, but also for the communities in adjacent satellite cities that are recipients of Khartoum residents pushing south to seek refuge.  Access to cash is another problem. Historically, sanctions meant that Sudanese people had limited access to global financial networks and had to rely instead on parallel monetary systems, further entrenching the hold of the black market on pricing and access. Today this problem is compounded: as local banking systems go off the grid, people cannot access their money locally, nor do they have avenues to receive financial aid from family and friends abroad. The rudimentary electronic banking system that was created in the past decade and expanded during the short tenure of the civilian transitional government, unreliable as it is, has locked most people out of their traditional financial support system. All this has managed to strengthen and expand the space for black-market trading, with fuel, food items, and bus tickets tripling in cost.  In the midst of this crisis, the civic groups that emerged from the revolution after 2018 are activating their communal networks of humanitarian response. The resistance committees have, through their coordination bodies, published a joint political statement, reiterating their antiwar stance, refusing to legitimize either party. They have also created platforms and apps to help the public coordinate access to services from medicine to food rations all the way to the dissemination of accurate information on safe passages and lifesaving referral pathways.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9zdWRhbi12aW9sZW5jZS1yc2Ytc2FmLW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZC1yZXNpc3RhbmNlLWNvbW1pdHRlZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-17","11:00:00","{""Manila"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-21T16:15:00","Read this in The Manila Times digital edition.  FROM out of the blue, two major developments have punched deep holes into President Ferdinand Marcos' (BBM's) 11-month-old ruling ""UniTeam,"" showing for the first time deeply troubled ties among his leading party mates.  On May 17, former president and Pampanga congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was unceremoniously removed as senior deputy speaker of the House of Representatives on the charge of organizing a legislative ""coup"" to replace House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez. This prompted Vice President Sara Duterte, Arroyo's close ally, to resign irrevocably from the Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (CMD) ruling party, lamenting ""execrable power play"" and ""toxic politics.""  It is too early to say how these incidents would affect BBM's political leadership, but he cannot afford to trivialize it. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA to many) and Sara Duterte are two of the nation's most powerful personalities. He has tried to downplay both incidents by saying Arroyo's removal was one of the ""run of the mill"" things that normally happen in Congress — ""you cannot read too much into it"" — and that Sara Duterte probably had too much work to do as Secretary of Education and co-vice chairman of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac) and needed to lighten her load.  Everyone else, however, notably members of the marginal opposition in Congress, felt the positioning for the 2028 presidential contest had begun, and the UniTeam leadership had begun to fall apart. Up to this point, the political infighting has been kept very much under the radar, if not the rug, limited to the issues of appointments, budgets, contracts, etc. This is the first time that top insiders have come out in the open trying to position themselves for the next presidential election in 2028. For this is what it is.  GMA was accused of organizing a ""coup"" not so much to replace a sitting speaker of the House who happens to be a very close first cousin of the President, as to torpedo his chances of becoming president after BBM. That election is still five years away. But people close to the speaker have made no secret of his reported plan to run for the Senate in the midterm elections and hopefully become Senate president in preparation for his 2028 presidential run. GMA denied the accusation but said some of her activities might have been misconstrued by some observers. These included her leading a group of congressmen to a meeting in South Korea, which she admitted without mentioning any details. She was never confronted about her alleged ""preparations"" for a coup but was simply booted out by her colleagues in a meeting where she was not even present. She was replaced by Rep. Aurelio ""Dong"" Gonzales Jr. from the third district of Pampanga and demoted to the position of deputy speaker.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  GMA has been a speaker during the 17th Congress (2018-19). After the last elections, where she won her fourth nonconsecutive term as a member of Congress, she showed renewed interest in the position but supported Romualdez when she saw the odds were in his favor. She settled for the position of senior deputy speaker. In that position, she lent her full expertise to BBM, especially during important meetings with various groups and foreign dignitaries where she and the speaker unfailingly joined the President. As a former president, she enjoyed precedence over the speaker, the Senate president and Cabinet members. BBM once referred to her as ""our secret weapon.""  She has not fought back, but we cannot say she won't. She's one of the most seasoned political fighters around. The daughter of the late former president Diosdado Macapagal, whom Marcos the elder defeated in 1965, GMA first became vice president to Joseph Ejercito Estrada in 1998. In 2001, she worked for Estrada's extra-constitutional ouster to become the president herself. In 2004, she won in a highly controversial presidential election to become the longest-serving president (10 years) after Marcos, who served for 21 years from 1965 to 1986. At the end of her extended term, she ran for a seat in Congress — the first former president ever to do so — becoming a representative of Pampanga, and eventually speaker of the 17th Congress.  Some critics have suggested that if GMA could depose a popular president like Estrada at the height of his popularity, nothing should be able to prevent her from acquiring a much lesser target. The speakership is such a target, but the real endgame is the presidency in 2028. Some political pundits see 2028 as a fight between Romualdez with the biggest war chest imaginable and Sara Duterte with her historic 32.2 million votes as vice president. But Romualdez's adversaries seem to believe that if they could end his speakership now, they could cut short his ambition to become president by 2028.  The reported plot has apparently failed, and we are in for a long fight, featuring on one side two of the most powerful women in Philippine politics.

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s statement, saying that her actions may have been misinterpreted and it is not her goal to be elected as House speaker.  “There is still much work to do, so occasional moves to destabilize the House should be nipped in the bud,” Romualdez said in a statement.  “Rather than engaging in politicking, I would rather that we, in the House of Representatives, remain focused on more urgent matters. The Uniteam, which the House leadership has always been a part of, must continue to focus on finding immediate solutions to problems of ordinary Filipinos,” he added.  On May 18, former president Arroyo refuted the allegation that she was staging a coup, clarifying that her political objectives are to represent the 2nd district of Pampanga, support Romualdez and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and use her knowledge as the country’s previous chief executive to help the current administration when needed.  Romualdez, on the other hand, stressed that the House of Representatives is in order, adding that this “same level of order is what allowed them to approve on third and final reading at least 29 of the 42 bills that comprise the legislative agenda of Marcos.”  “These include measures condoning the debts of our agrarian reform beneficiaries, creation of specialty centers in the provinces similar to the Lung and Heart Centers in Metro Manila, and the Magna Carta bills that seek to protect the rights and promote the welfare of our Barangay Health Workers and Seafarers,” Romualdez enumerated.  He said that the government should prioritize the welfare of locals nationwide.  “Isantabi na po ang pamumulitika na wala sa tamang panahon.

Two more people were injured,” Kyrylenko wrote. Yesterday, Russian troops launched six rocket attacks and 62 air raids on Ukraine, and carried out 65 attacks with multiple launch rocket systems.  8:40 New US military package for Ukraine US President Joe Biden to announce new military aid package for Ukraine worth $375 million after scheduled meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky at the G7 summit in Japan: Politico writes, quoting three unnamed US and Ukrainian officials . The package, according to the sources, will include artillery shells, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons, all of which the United States and allies have supplied to Kiev in the past, but which will be needed in the fierce fighting expected in the spring and summer.  8:58 Gb: “Bakhmut remains the most important goal for Moscow” Russian leaders are likely to continue to view Bakhmut’s capture as the most important immediate war objective, which would allow them to claim some degree of success in the conflict, the British Defense Ministry wrote in its daily intelligence update. Over the past four days, Russia has most likely deployed several battalions to reinforce the sector of the disputed city, the report posted on Twitter reads.  9:17 Zelensky at the G7: “Today peace will become closer” “Japan. G7. Important meetings with partners and friends of Ukraine. Strengthened security and cooperation for our victory. Today peace will become closer”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram, who has just landed in Japan to participate in the G7.  9:45 G7 to China: “Pressure on Moscow for troop withdrawal” “We call on China to pressure Russia to stop its military aggression” and on Moscow to “unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to advocate for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine”. This is what can be read in a communiqué from the G7 leaders.  10:08 Biden in Hiroshima: “We will free the world from nuclear weapons” “May the stories in this museum remind us all of our commitment to building a future in peace. Let us continue to work together towards the day when we can finally and forever rid the world of nuclear weapons.” This is what US President Joe Biden wrote in the guest book of the Hiroshima Peace Museum. This was announced by the Japanese government.  10:50 Zelensky-Meloni, meeting in progress According to what is learned from Italian sources, a meeting is underway between the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has recently arrived in Hiroshima to participate in the work of the G7.  11:30 The 007 Ukrainians: “Moscow has been preparing an invasion since 2007” See also Fertility treatment: Family form decides on support “Russia has been actively preparing for aggression against Ukraine since 2007” and then “seized the opportunity in 2014”. This was claimed by the head of military intelligence in Kiev, Kyrylo Budanov, in an interview with journalist Dmytro Komarov broadcast on the YouTube channel ‘World Inside Out’ and quoted by the Telegram channel of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s online media.  11:50 Kiev: “Putin fears coup in winter” Russian President Vladimir Putin “doesn’t trust the environment around him” and “fears an internal coup”. This was supported by the head of military intelligence in Kiev, Kyrylo Budanov.  12:30 Moscow: “Colossal risks from sending F-16s to Ukraine” Western countries run “colossal risks” if they supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said, quoted by the Tass news agency. Grushko’s speech follows US President Joe Biden’s statement yesterday to G7 leaders that Washington will support a joint effort with allies and partners to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth-generation aircraft, including F-16s.  13:00 Zelensky sees Meloni: “Improving our air defense” “It is important to continue the dialogue between Ukraine and Italy on bilateral relations. The parties discussed Italy’s political and defense support for Ukraine and the first results of the visit to Italy on 13 May. We need to improve our air defense capabilities, including the training of our pilots.” The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky wrote it on Telegram, posting a video of his visit to Japan, on the occasion of the G7 in Hiroshima, where the meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is shown.  13:19 Zelensky meets India’s prime minister Zelensky had a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She reports the Twitter profile of the Indian government. Details of the meeting were not disclosed. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, this is the first face-to-face between the Ukrainian leader and the head of government of India, a country that abstained from the UN vote condemning the Russian invasion and strongly increased purchases of oil from Moscow at low prices following the stop of supplies of Russian hydrocarbons to Europe.  13:52 Michel: “EU support for Kiev in the long term” The President of the European Council Charles Michel in his meeting with the Ukrainian President Zelensky “underlined his strong support for the preparation of a new multiannual macro-financial economic package for the period after 2023, which would testify to the EU’s long-term commitment to Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal war. Military support is also ramping up with ammunition deliveries and the creation of a fighter jet coalition.” This is what Michel’s spokesman learned after the meeting at the G7.  14:24 G7: “Iran stop supporting Russia’s aggression” Iran “must stop supporting Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.” This is the warning that comes from the joint declaration of the G7 countries, which also ask Tehran “to stop transferring armed UAVs (drones ed), which have been used to attack critical infrastructure in Ukraine and kill Ukrainian civilians”. The G7 expresses “grave concern about Iran’s continued destabilizing activities, including the transfer of missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and technologies to state and non-state actors in violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2231 and 2216”.  15:14 Wagner: “We took Bakhmut” Russian forces have taken control of the city of Bakhmut. This was claimed by the founder of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, quoted by Interfax. “Today, (…) Bakhmut was completely taken,” Prigozhin’s press service said in a statement.  15:25 Wagner will abandon Bakhmut on May 25th The Wagner mercenaries will leave Bakhmut on May 25 “to rest”, Prigozhin anticipated, specifying that then the city, of which he announced complete control today after more than seven months of fighting, will be transferred under the control of the Russian Defense Ministry .  15:47 Ukrainian military spokesman: “Fighting is still going on in Bakhmut” The Ukrainian military has denied the takeover of Bakhmut by Russian forces, as claimed on Telegram by the leader of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Contacted by British broadcaster Sky News, military spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said: “That’s not true. There is still fighting in the city.”  16:05 Kiev: “We control areas of Bakhmut, but the situation is critical” “Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical. At the same time, our troops hold the defense in the Litak (district) area. As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in this area and the private sector.” Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Hanna Malyar writes on Telegram.  17:55 Washington: “F-16 to Kiev only if it does not attack Russian territory” OK from Washington to supply F-16s to Kiev, but on condition that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not use them for attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation. This was stated by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  18:25 Tomorrow Biden sees Zelensky US President Joe Biden will hold bilaterals tomorrow with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at 2.15pm local time, and will then hold a press conference at the Hiroshima Hilton at 6.15pm local time. The White House made it known.  19:04 Vatican confirms mission entrusted to Cardinal Zuppi As anticipated by Qn in recent days, the Vatican confirmed the peace mission: “I can confirm that Pope Francis has entrusted Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, Archbishop of Bologna and President of the Italian Episcopal Conference, with the task of leading a mission, in agreement with the Secretariat of State, which contributes to easing tensions in the conflict in Ukraine, in the hope, never resigned by the Holy Father, that this can start peace paths. The timing of this mission, and its modalities, are currently being study”.  23:40 Ministero difesa russo: “Liberata Bakhmut” The Russian Defense Ministry has announced the “liberation” of Bakhmut, Tass reports. This morning the head of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prighozin, announced that he had taken “full control of the city”.  23:46 Representative Xi in Moscow next week Chinese Special Representative Li Hui is expected to be in Moscow next week. This is learned from an informed Russian source. “We look forward to a visit next week.” Earlier this week, Li visited Kiev. From Warsaw he will travel to France, Germany and Russia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbGF0ZXN0Lm5ld3MvaGVhbHRoL29rLXRvLXRoZS1mLTE2cy1idXQtZG9udC1oaXQtcnVzc2lhLWc3LXplbGVuc2t5LWFuZC10aGUtaHVnLXdpdGgtbWVsb25pL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2018-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T15:36:40","The precise May 9 attack on key military installations in Pakistan by mobs angered by Imran Khan’s inexplicable arrest at the Islamabad High Court has been a pivotal moment that may have sealed the former prime minister’s fate after his long crusade against Pakistan . Army. For the first time in Pakistan’s turbulent history, angry insurgents targeted several military institutions, symbols of ultimate power in the South Asian nation. In doing so, Khan and his supporters would have broken all established red lines. The prospect of a full-scale coup by the military aimed at removing him as a contender for power appears to be growing stronger and faster.  Reckless attacks on military symbols shown on television screens have shocked viewers around the world. Major targets included: Jinnah House, Lahore Corps Commander’s Residence Lahore  , General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi  , Pakistan Air Force Martyr’s Memorial Sargodha  , Inter-Services Intelligence Sector Headquarters in Faisalabad  , Rangers Post, Karachi  , Frontier Corps Base, Chikara  , Frontier Corps Barracks, Mardan  , Frontier Corps School, Director  , Pakistan Air Force Base in Mainsel  , Sewa Hospital, Lahore.  Other important institutions that were broken were:  , Election Commission, Regional Office, Peshawar and Lahore  , Shahbaz Sharif’s private residence in Lahore  , Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) office in Lahore.  After these events and with the reputation, even the existence of the army in its present form, at risk, Army chief Asim Munir seems to be slowly gaining the upper hand in the bitter power struggle with Khan.  There are two major reasons which suggest that the balance of power is swinging in the direction of the military.  First, the process of intimidation of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership seems to be working. In an attempt to eliminate the leadership of PTI, most of the top leaders of the party have been arrested except Imran Khan, who is now out of prison after the intervention of Pakistan Supreme Court. His key aides including former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry and many others are behind bars. Former human rights minister Shirin Mazari was dramatically arrested, released and arrested again.  The army and government alike have vowed to prosecute miscreants who attack military installations under the Pakistan Army Act, Official Secrets Act and other draconian laws.  To sow fear in the rank and file, Pak security forces have now started hunting for insurgents, using CCTV footage but announcing cash rewards for those who identify miscreants.  Army chief Asim Munir has also thrown his weight behind it to prevent a repeat of the May 9 incidents. On Wednesday, he warned that the armed forces would not allow incidents like May 9 to recur at any cost.  The pressure is starting to tell. President Arif Alvi, a known supporter of Khan, has started distancing himself from the former prime minister. President Arif Alvi said on Thursday that Imran Khan should openly condemn the events of May 9. In a TV interview, he also advocated action against miscreants involved in the incidents.  PTI rank is also seeing its first desertions. On Wednesday, PTI’s founding member Aamir Mahmood Kayani not only quit the party but also turned politics over the incidents of arson and sabotage on May 9.  Two PTI MPs from the Sindh Assembly – Sanjay Gangwani and Karim Bux Gabol – also announced their resignation from the party.  Second, despite his mastery of social media and television to deliver his message, Khan has found little support abroad. Most importantly, both China and the United States have remained silent except for superficial comments, while the military has started cracking down on the former PM.  Having identified Pakistan as the gateway to the Indian Ocean through Gwadar – a strategy to reduce dependence on the US-dominated Malacca Straits for its trade, it is natural that the Chinese, given their huge strategic stakes, No love will be lost for Huye Khan, who was once seen as his favourite. Hence the logic of national interest will determine their readiness to deal with anyone in power in Pakistan who can fulfill their agenda.  It is interesting that Chinese interactions with Pak Army have seen a spurt in recent times. Last month, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs of China, met General Munir in Beijing. According to an official Chinese readout, ‘Wang Yi said that the Pakistan Army is a staunch defender of Pakistan’s national security and stability, and also a staunch defender of the China-Pakistan ‘Ironcloud’ friendship.’  Americans will be most comfortable watching the political exit of Khan, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, given his tussle with the Chinese in Pakistan. For the Americans, dealing with a victorious army would be a blessing in disguise to protect their core interests, which include maintaining tight control over the Pakistani nuclear arsenal.  Moreover, with the military in real power, Washington has a better chance of wresting its influence in Afpak after its exit from Kabul in August 2021. Given the country’s location in South Asia, Pakistan’s geography will always fascinate Americans. At the doorstep of Central Asia and the Middle East.  Finally, if there is any hope for Imran, it is in the perceived division within the army. There have been reports of divisions within the army, led by longtime Khan favorite and now-retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, who was once the ISI chief. But it’s highly unlikely that a critical mass is achieved that would allow an army to be entrenched, triggering civil war-like situations.  While it appears to have been painted over, Khan’s ability to amass road power, which is likely to decline in the event of a full-scale confrontation with the army, cannot be taken away. It is not far-fetched to impose a state of emergency in Pakistan in anticipation of such an event. Responding to a question from a television channel after the May 9 vandalism, Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said: ‘If the situation continues like this, Emergency is a constitutional option, there is no possibility of martial law in the country’ ‘  (The content is being moved under an arrangement with indiannarrative.com)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZW5nLmJoYXJhdHRpbWVzLmNvLmluL3Bha2lzdGFuLXBvd2VyLXR1c3NsZS1jYW4taW1yYW4ta2hhbi13aW4tcG93ZXItYmF0dGxlLWFnYWluc3QtYXJteS1jaGllZi1hc2ltLW11bmlyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1953-11-24","Not Discerned","{""Athens"", ""Attiki"", ""Greece""}","2023-05-20T16:16:38","My husband and I watch “Jeopardy!” together frequently. I’ve noticed that the strongest players are almost always men.  Last week, the show hosted its Masters Tournament, and, consistent with my observation, four of the six “masters” are male. Interestingly, even the “winningest woman” on “Jeopardy!”, one of the masters, is Amy Schneider, who identifies as transgender. The sixth master contestant is a woman, Mattea Roach, of Canada.  Working at Independent Women’s Voice, I’ve spent the better part of this spring working in state legislatures to promote and advance bills that preserve women as a legal category and keep women’s sports female-only. In the world of sports, women only have equal opportunity to compete fairly and safely if they are competing against other women only, because men have an athletic advantage.  This got me thinking about “Jeopardy!” and other trivia competitions: do men have an advantage in these competitions as well (albeit less obvious to the eye of the observer)? I admit, I am loath to even explore the idea that men are “smarter” than women… especially since my main opponent for armchair “Jeopardy!” is… my husband. And there’s no way he’s smarter than me!  ‘JEOPARDY!’ HOST KEN JENNINGS SLAMMED BY ‘BIG BANG THEORY’ STAR FOR CROSSING THE PICKET LINE  But I had to find out why men are more successful on “Jeopardy!”.  Of course, there’s always the chance that the game itself is rigged. Some critics say that the way the questions are written favors men, or at least focuses on men. Sometimes I think my husband has an advantage when there’s a sports category on the board, and there often is. Some viewers alternatively speculate that the game is rigged to help female contestants or at least to prolong champions’ runs.  So, biased question-writing aside, what else could be behind men’s dominance (compared to women) as contestants on the show?  Several academic studies have shown that men wager more aggressively on the Daily Double questions, particularly against other male contestants. When wagering is involved, men may have an advantage due to their higher tolerance for risk. This also has implications for other areas of life, like financial investment.  ‘JEOPARDY!’ FANS LIVID AFTER LATEST GAME SHOW MISTAKE  Some argue that men’s higher risk tolerance isn’t innate; it’s socialized. For example, some evidence suggests that parents are more cautious with their little girls, telling them more often to “be careful” on the fireman’s pole, monkey bars, or elsewhere. (I haven’t found this to be true in my personal experience: my son more often puts himself into risky situations where I must tell him to be careful, so I think of all my children, I urge caution to him the most.)  It’s possible that (relative) risk aversion in women is not something that’s simply learned, but that biology may contribute as well. Scientists have studied how brain waves may work differently in male and female brains to affect their attitudes toward risk. And hormones such as testosterone (which men have at seven-eight times higher levels than women) may also play a role in men’s tolerance – or even appetite for – greater risk.  But I have yet another hypothesis about “Jeopardy!” that applies to other areas where there’s gender disparity: if you take maybe half of women aged 20-40 and deprive them of regular sleep, and require them to carry a new mental load related to feeding schedules, potty training, and child care for a few years, those women have a disadvantage when it comes to cognitive ability (specifically gray matter and verbal recall), at least for a time. Verbal recall is especially important for “Jeopardy!”. But critically, motherhood changes the brain in other ways that are beneficial for both mothers and children, and for the future of humankind. It’s not all bad!  As we’ve witnessed with the gender wage gap, the major driver isn’t sexism, but motherhood. One reason we see fewer women excelling on “Jeopardy!”, is, I believe, the same reason we see fewer women, on average, in many fields, from the halls of Congress to STEM jobs and more.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  What’s the “solution” then, for “Jeopardy!”? A female-only league (as in sports)? A mentorship program? Affirmative action for female contestants? No. We simply need to get comfortable with a lack of gender parity in some areas, not always reflexively labeling it as a “bad thing” and certainly not assuming that it suggests anything about the merits of one sex over another.  I’m pretty comfortable with sex differences, and pretty comfortable yelling answers – in the form of a question, of course – from my couch next to my husband. But who knows, maybe one day I’ll audition for the show. You know, when the kids are a little bit older.

"political coup","2023-02-12","22:00:00","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-21T04:00:19","The helicopters purchased from Russia  My Dear People.  The dispensation of darkness, poverty and confusion led by the clueless Ngwena has continued to show that its governance is not fit for purpose. The crackdown on retailers accused for the skyrocketing prices of basic goods is outright crazy.  Instead of recognising the folly of introducing the Zimbabwe dollar at a time the benchmarks for its stability were not in place, they instead accuse business of sabotage.  It seems beyond the scope of Ngwena’s regime to realise that businesses are only increasing prices to cushion themselves from the vagaries of a useless local currency that is not only rapidly losing value daily on the parallel market, but also on John Panonetsa’s rigged auction system.  As usual the septuagenarian leader and his coup gangsters are looking for someone to blame for their own failures.  This shows that Ngwena, who was catapulted into power on the back of guns and tanks , grabbed the leadership from the telescopic foresighted Gushungo for the sake of just being in leadership with no idea whatsoever of how to lead.  This is what Gushungo meant when he said he had no one in the party with the nous to succeed him.  What kind of leader boasts of a currency that has become a national embarrassment and which is becoming increasingly irrelevant with more than 75% of the country’s transactions being in hard currency?  It is considered disrespectful in our African culture to call our leaders idiots, but Ngwena and his regime are making it very difficult for us to refrain from calling them just that.  It reminds me of Tsvangison’s famous statement to Gushungo that “you can rig an election, but you cannot rig an economy.” Kikikiki.  The Lacoste cabal is certainly learning it the hard way.  The recent outburst by Justice minister Ziyambi warning the ruling party against impeaching Ngwena raised more than a few eyebrows.  Addressing a Zanu PF inter-district meeting at Banket Sports Club recently, Ziyambi warned prospective ruling party legislators against joining any impeachment bid against the Lacoste ring leader.  “There is no one who can remove the president without Zanu PF coughing,” thundered Ziyambi who is still nursing wounds from being trounced not once, but twice in the party’s primary elections.  “If you go to Parliament and think you will join others and try to do what they call impeachment, we will simply write a recall letter and force a by-election.”  Just one year after grabbing power Ngwena also warned against those looking to impeach him.  We have been told ad nauseum that Ngwena is the most loved leader in the country, so where on earth are these fears of impeachment coming from?  Are Ngwena’s party members finally beginning to realise just how useless he is as a leader, who is devoid of probity?  It is one thing to fear losing to Nero in the elections in August this year as evidenced by the conviction and jailing of members of the opposition, but it takes a certain type of ineptitude to get to the point of being afraid of being rejected by your own party.  This is the consequence of grabbing power without corresponding popularity kikikiki.  Munopengaaaaa!  The African Development Bank president Akinwumi Adesina and former Mozambican head of state Joaquim Chissano were in the country this week for the impossible task of getting Ngwena and his regime to implement reforms.  Adesina and Chissano indicated that the debt clearance plan would only be viable if Zimbabwe deals with concerns over a series of factors, including political and electoral reforms. Munopengaaa!!  Asking for such reforms from this mob is akin to expecting snow to fall in Zimbabwe kkkkk.  The word reform to Ngwena and his cabal is and will always be a stranger.  I don’t even need to be a doctor to tell Chissano and Adesina that they are wasting their precious time trying to wring reforms from a regime that is in power through the undemocratic means of a coup.  As Ngwena laughably promised reforms, opposition members are languishing in jail for exercising their constitutional right to protest against the leadership. The sooner these gentlemen realise what a monumental waste of time this exercise is, the better.  The deal for the purchase of helicopters for, among other things, air rescue missions has demonstrated yet again the misplaced priorities of this incompetent regime.  It boggles the mind how, at a time when public hospitals have become death traps and deserted by at least 4 000 health workers due to pathetic working conditions and lack of basic resources, Ngwena and his regime could decide to purchase helicopters.  Indeed, buying helicopters when hospitals do not have crucial radiotherapy cancer machines is indicative of the bankrupt leadership this country is burdened with.  Without a hint of irony Ngwena’s loudspeaker, Joji said the purchase of helicopters shows that Ngwena works.  Unopenga!!!  Buying helicopters at the expense of adequately equipping public hospitals which is abandoned by even Generari who superintends over it when he falls ill, speaks of criminal neglect.

To those around him, it seemed clear he was trying to divert his attention away from events in the world outside the walls of his home in central Najaf’s Hanana.  It has been almost a year since the influential Shia cleric announced his withdrawal from politics. Over the past few months, as a new Iraqi government was formed without his participation, he resolutely refused to enter into any political dialogue or receive visitors trying to speak to him about developments or issues the country was facing.  Sadr’s entourage could see how difficult it was for Sadr to remain calm as he made his arrangements for the three-day Kufa mosque retreat. It was plainly difficult for him to stay away from the daily drama of Iraqi politics.  Sadr had just a few days before he was due to head to Kufa. He asked who would join him in itikaf, and what food they would be given for their days of reflection, one of Sadr’s close aides told Middle East Eye.  Everyone told him everything was as he wanted it and that there was nothing to worry about. But that wasn’t quite true.  On 13 April, immediately after the evening prayer, a short video began circulating on social media. In it, a bearded young man appears wearing black religious garb, his face hidden behind a black mask. The figure called on everyone to pledge their allegiance to Sadr, identifying him as the Mahdi, the awaited twelfth imam of the Shia who, it is believed, will appear as a saviour to bring justice to all.  The masked man said that the Kufa mosque would witness the launch of a “big campaign” to declare allegiance to Sadr during his stay there.  “We will pledge allegiance to him and announce that he is the awaited imam, and we will be under his banner and support him,” the man said.  “Do not let down the imam of your time. Give your allegiance to him and support him.”  Hours later, dozens of Sadr’s supporters, who call themselves “owners of the cause”, gathered in Hanana in front of his house to declare their allegiance.  To their surprise, Sadr’s guards did not greet them, instead assaulting the rapturous Sadrists and handing them over to the police, local sources told MEE.  Sadr already knew that there were some among the most devoted in the Sadrist movement that believe he is the Mahdi, and footage like the video of the masked man was not particularly unusual. But for some reason, the developments “provoked him a lot, and raised his fears”, Sadr’s aide said.  Rather than being a show of support, the video was seen as an attempt to destabilise Sadr.  “That was an explicit threat to Sadr’s life and a threat of chaos,” the aide told MEE.  According to the aide, whoever was behind the video wanted to provoke Sadrists into massing at the Kufa mosque and then confronting Shia clergy in Najaf, who would not accept the claim Sadr is their long-awaited saviour.  “These people are very dangerous and can carry out crimes in the name of Sadr,” he said.  If this analysis is correct, Sadr’s response showed he understood well what was at play and decided to distance himself from it as soon as possible.  He cancelled his itikaf, ordered most of his offices closed, and suspended his movement’s religious and social work for at least a year.  At least three prominent Shia leaders told MEE that “a malicious plan was behind that movement”, and that Sadr was indeed a target.  “It was an ideological game aimed at manipulating Sadr and inflating his ego. If he remained silent or responded to the game positively, then killing him became legitimate,” one of the leaders said.  “Whoever was behind this scheme, he was seeking to implicate Sadr and to force him in one way or another to take a stand.”  Since that day, Sadr has only been dealt further painful blows, both by his political opponents and people closer to home. It seems more than one player is trying to drag him out of his seclusion.  The fatwa loophole  In Shia jurisprudence, adult Muslims must choose a senior cleric to be their religious reference – or marjaa – and follow his fatwas and instructions in all matters of life.  Traditionally, that marjaa must be alive and known for his religious scholarship. But the two founders of the Sadrist movement, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr and Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, stressed that a marjaa should be the most knowledgeable cleric available – alive or dead.  Grand Ayatollah Kadhim al-Haeri, who was a student of the first Sadr and guardian of the second, did not deviate from this line. In fact, he issued a fatwa allowing people to follow a dead marjaa, as long as they have the permission of a living one, like himself.  When Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr was assassinated by Saddam Hussein’s agents in 1999, the Sadrists began to follow Haeri spiritually and the slain Sadr’s son, Muqtada, politically.  Haeri also gave Muqtada al-Sadr permission to manage his father’s office and religious schools, as well as the funds raised through khums (obligatory religious charity) and donations.  This arrangement benefitted Sadr considerably and helped keep the Sadrist movement together under his leadership – particularly keeping the loyalty of youth born following his father’s death.  This situation changed completely at the end of August last year, when Haeri, who is based in the Iranian city of Qom, announced his “sudden and unprecedented” retirement “due to illness and advanced age”.  In his announcement, Haeri rescinded his permission for Sadr to manage the movement’s funds and activities.  “Sayyid Haeri’s sudden retirement confused Sadr and greatly embarrassed him,” Khalid al-Hamdani, professor at Najaf’s scientific seminary, told MEE.  “Retirement is not customary among Najaf clergymen … so everyone was surprised by it, including the offices of Sadr and Haeri himself. That retirement has impacted all the arrangements between Sadr’s and Hairi’s offices dating back to 2003.”  Haeri’s retirement prompted Sadr to suspend the work of the Sadrist religious schools and institutions, and he stopped receiving the khums.  Not only did he lose access to the hundreds of millions of dollars they brought in, he haemorrhaged followers as well.  Only adding to the “shocking” and “strange” nature of Haeri’s announcement, as a number of Shia scholars in Najaf described it, was the order for the marjaa’s followers to “obey” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei instead.  “Herein lies the danger,” said a prominent Sadrist leader. Previously, Sadrists would be embarrassed following Khamenei spiritually, and therefore working with the Iraqi armed factions associated with the Iranian supreme leader.  But not only had Haeri embarrassed Sadr by associating him with Khamenei, who he had long kept a distance from, he had opened the door for Sadrists to consider other clerics as their marjaa rather than Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr.  “Can you imagine what happened? The semi-closed circle, which Sadr was keen to keep the Sadrists inside, has broken, and this is what Sadr never expected to happen,” Sadr’s aide said.  Today, Sadr’s status is a hot topic of discussion, with Haeri’s announcement opening the door for the cleric’s Shia rivals to question his legitimacy at every opportunity.  Dozens of Telegram channels, WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, some of them linked to Shia armed factions and others of unknown affiliation, have been heavily promoting the debate for weeks.  It seems clear that the real threat facing Sadr is political, not ideological, especially after his opponents, the Shia rivals in particular, have realised that his main source of strength is the same as his main source of weakness: Haeri’s fatwa.  In response, Sadr has tried to shore up his support.  On 29 April, he asked his followers to submit a written pledge signed in blood where they promised not to follow any religious scholar who has not been a longstanding Sadrist. They also had to vow not to join any “suspicious groups that want to undermine Iraq, the sect and the Sadrist movement”.  Sadr was keen to stress to his followers that his enemies had “malicious plans” aimed at dispersing the Sadrist movement and encouraging them to question their marjaa or leader – Sadr himself.  “Frankly, the issue is far from jurisprudence, religion and faith. It is a struggle over the Sadrist grassroots,” said a former Sadr aide, who a few years ago defected to an Iranian-backed armed faction.  “Questioning Sadr’s religious and ideological authority, and raising questions about the nature of the relationship between him and his followers, is one of the weapons used in the battle and we all know this.”  The former aide acknowledged the cleric relies heavily on the movement’s youngest generation but also said these youth remain committed to him spiritually and politically.  “Fortifying these people and keeping them under control, away from the influence of opponents, is Sadr’s chief goal right now,” he said.  Fraternal competition  Sadr’s fiercest opponents are his former companions: followers of his father and uncle, people he has gone into battle with.  Most prominent are Shia armed factions Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kataeb Hezbollah, who have ideological, demographic and territorial overlap with the Sadrist movement.  The three factions emerged from the same school of jurisprudence that was founded by the first Sadr leader, Muhammad Baqir, Sadr’s uncle and father-in-law.  This demographic and ideological crossover complicates the competition between the factions, making their fight even more cruel.  And the fraternal nature of their competition means the Sadrists, Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kataeb Hezbollah know exactly how to undermine each other and tempt their fighters away.  This dynamic dramatically and publicly revealed itself earlier this month.  On 6 May, Sadr instructed his supporters to mark the annual anniversary of the assassination of his father later in the month.  Only those who had signed the pledges in blood were allowed to participate in the Najaf ceremony, provided they walk on foot from the outskirts of the holy city to the place where Sadr senior was killed.  Sadr’s stipulations and planned march were a message to his opponents, one of the cleric’s aides told MEE. He was showing his rivals that only he could move such vast crowds of devotees.  “The plan was for everyone to see the number of those willing to die for Sadr. We do not deny that the goal was to display our strength and our men,” the aide said.  Just days before the parade was due to take place, it was cancelled.  Sadr’s office distributed an audio recording of the cleric, in which he ordered everyone to stop preparations and close Sadr’s shrine in Najaf throughout the last week of May, when the anniversary was due to fall.  This was “the best punishment for this hypocritical group and those who support them among the corrupt and shameless militias”, Sadr is heard saying, using a common nickname he has for Asaib Ahl al-Haq.  No other reason was given. But developments in the southern governorates of Basra and Nasiriyah in recent weeks offer some clues.  Internal Sadrist correspondence seen by Middle East Eye shows in late April the central security branch of Saraya al-Salam, the Sadrists’ armed wing, ordered the expulsion of 18 fighters from the 304th Basra Brigade, without mentioning why.  A senior Saraya al-Salam commander in Basra told MEE that the fighters were believed to be defecting to Asaib.  Two weeks later, the same branch ordered the expulsion of Abu Hassan al-Daradji, a senior commander in Basra, on charges of “treason”, the correspondence shows.  Twenty-four hours later, websites linked to Asaib published pictures of Darraji accompanied by a number of the armed faction’s leaders, announcing his defection.  “Our information says that they paid him at least 2bn dinars [$1.5m] to defect from us, along with his unit,” the Saraya al-Salam commander told MEE.  It is not clear what material damage Darraji’s defection caused Sadr’s Basra units, but by the reactions of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, we can see it was a blow to morale.  Local Sadrist leaders in Basra told MEE that Daradji had been made commander of Asaib’s special missions team.  “They wanted to tell us that this was his reward,” the Saraya al-Salam commander told MEE.  Wanting Sadr back  The Sadrist retreat began in June last year, when, frustrated by his inability to form a government, Sadr ordered his MPs to resign from parliament.  That allowed Sadr’s Shia rivals in the Coordination Framework alliance to form the government of their choice. It seemed like an incredible coup for them. Months later, it appears more like a trap.  Iraq has witnessed a period of relative calm in recent months. Leaders of the Coordination Framework, which includes most Iranian-backed political forces and armed factions, have gone about their business without obvious concerns.  Yet Shia political leaders told MEE that fears are beginning to surface.  Some of the biggest concerns expressed by Framework leaders is that some of their partners in the Shia alliance are “encroaching” on their territory and have control over key institutions.  Essentially, the organs of state are a lucrative business for whoever controls them.  While Sadrists had powerful positions in government, anyone pursuing illegal and corrupt activities could accuse them of being responsible instead, giving them plausible deniability.  With that no longer possible, Sadr’s friends and enemies alike find they miss him and wish for his return to political life, “to relieve them of embarrassment and to provide them with the required cover for their illegal business”, as a Framework leader put it.  “Many international and local parties believe that Sadr’s presence outside the political process is more costly than his presence inside it, and it is time for him to return,” the Framework leader said.  According to the leader, Asaib Ahl al-Haq has begun taking more shares of the spoils of government than its partners are happy with.  “If it stays like this, this faction will turn on the rest and swallow them up,” he said.  “Others have become exposed and cannot proceed with their illegal activities without the presence of someone that they can use as a cover to throw the charge at.”  Sadr, the Framework leader said, is a “tool of deterrence” and provides a kind of protection for several parties.  “It cannot be said that only one player is behind everything that is happening with Sadr now, but it is certain that several international and local parties are seeking to bring him back to the scene,” he said.  “How and when will he return? This mainly depends on his ability to hold on.”  Source: Middle East Eye","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvY2ZtLmNvLnphL2hvdy1zYWRycy1mb2VzLWFyZS10cnlpbmctdG8tc3Vjay1oaW0tYmFjay1pbnRvLWlyYXFpLXB1YmxpYy1saWZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2021-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T01:56:38","This article was originally published by Radio Free Asia and is reprinted with permission.  To mark the 30th anniversary of the UN General Assembly’s proclamation of World Press Freedom Day on May 3, 1993, Radio Free Asia is highlighting the plight of its journalists and bloggers who have been jailed or detained in several of the Asia-Pacific region’s authoritarian states.  This year’s theme, “Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights,” highlights the relationship between threats to media freedom, journalist safety, and increasing attacks on other key human rights.  The concerns are valid, as the jailing of RFA reporters and bloggers, and their BBC and Voice of America colleagues, occurred in countries and territories that have experienced a decline in broader freedoms–if they had such liberties to begin with.  Edmund Wan  Edmund Wan Yiu-sing, known by his DJ name “Giggs,” was sentenced by a court in Hong Kong in October 2022 to two years and eight months in prison for sedition and money laundering, charges he confessed to in a plea deal.  Prior to his February 2021 arrest, he hosted programs that reported and commented on Hong Kong and Chinese politics for D100, an independent online radio station. Wan also hosted a program for Radio Free Asia’s Cantonese Service from 2017 to 2020.  Authorities charged that Wan hosted programs that “incited others to resist or overthrow the Chinese Communist Party” and “promoted Hong Kong independence,” the Hong Kong Free Press independent news outlet reported.  Wan had pleaded guilty to one charge of seditious intent for on-air comments he made in 2020, and three charges of money laundering related to crowd funding transactions. In exchange, six other charges were left on file, which means they cannot be pursued without the court’s permission.  The charges come under a law, created when Hong Kong was under British rule, that defines sedition as “intent to arouse hatred or contempt of the Hong Kong [government] or to incite rebellion, and cause dissatisfaction with it.”  The sedition law was revived by the Hong Kong government during the 2019 protest movement and has been used to arrest pro-democracy activists.  In addition to the time in prison, the court also ordered Wan to hand over HK$4.87 million (about U.S. $620,000) in assets.  Yeang Sothearin  Former Radio Free Asia Khmer news anchor Yeang Sothearin was taken into custody in November 2017, along with Uon Chhin, an RFA photographer and videographer.  They were charged with “illegally collecting information for a foreign source” after RFA closed its bureau in the capital of Phnom Penh in September of that year amid a government crackdown on independent media.  They were slapped with additional charges for illegally produced pornography in March 2018. If convicted of the first charge, they could face a jail term of between seven and 15 years.  Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin are out on bail, but they remain in legal limbo after several courts have rejected a series of appeals.  In October 2022, Cambodia’s Supreme Court returned Yeang Sothearin’s passport, allowing him to visit his ailing father and sister in Vietnam.  Cambodia ranks 140 out of 180 in the 2022 Reporters without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index, between Equatorial Guinea and Libya.  After Cambodia’s emergence from decades of warfare in the 1990s, the country’s press had “flourished until the long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen launched a ruthless war against independent journalism before the 2018 elections,” RSF said.  Uon Chhin  Former Radio Free Asia Khmer photographer and videographer Uon Chhin and RFA news anchor Yeang Sothearin were taken into custody in November 2017, amid a gathering crackdown on independent media by long-ruling Prime Minister Hun Sen.  The pair were charged with “illegally collecting information for a foreign source” after RFA closed its bureau in the capital of Phnom Penh in September of that year.  They were slapped with additional charges for illegally produced pornography in March 2018. If convicted of the first charge, they could face a jail term of between seven and 15 years.  Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin are out on bail, but they remain in legal limbo and their media careers frozen after several courts have rejected a series of appeals.  Cambodia ranks 140 out of 180 in the 2022 Reporters without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index, between Equatorial Guinea and Libya.  “Hun Sen went after the press mercilessly ahead of parliamentary elections in July 2018. Radio stations and newspapers were silenced, newsrooms purged, journalists prosecuted – leaving the independent media sector devastated,” said RSF. “Since then, the few attempts to bring independent journalism back to life have drawn the wrath of ruling circles.”  Htet Htet Khine  Htet Htet Khine, a former BBC television presenter, was sentenced in September 2022 to three years in prison with hard labor for “incitement” and “illegal association” for her reporting work.  The face of BBC Media Action’s national television peace program Khan Sar Kyi (Feel It) from 2016 to 2020, which documented the impact of war on Myanmar society, the freelance journalist and video producer had been in detention in Yangon’s notorious Insein Prison awaiting trial since Aug. 15, 2021, when she was arrested with fellow reporter Sithu Aung Myint.  Htet Htet Khine was arrested six months after the Feb. 1, 2021 military coup by junta security forces, one of some 150 journalists detained by junta authorities.  Family members expressed concern over Htet Htet Khine’s well-being in prison amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospect of physical abuse by jailers.  Veteran journalists told Radio Free Asia that her case underscored the fact that reporters face serious personal risk to carry out their work under military rule in Myanmar.  Sithu Aung Myint  A special court in Yangon’s Insein Prison in December 2022 sentenced veteran journalist Sithu Aung Myint to seven years in prison, which came on top of two earlier sentences totaling five years for allegedly inciting sedition in the army, meaning he will have to spend 12 years in prison.  The sentence by a court set up by the junta that took power in a Feb. 1, 2021, military coup was for attempting to incite hatred or contempt against military personnel or civil servants, a crime which carries a maximum 20-year term.  Sithu Aung Myint had written critically of the current junta – as he had since the 1988 People Uprising, a series of nationwide protests against military rule in a country that has been run by the army for most of the 76 years since independence from Britain.  Sithu Aung Myint was arrested in August 2021 at an apartment in Yangon, where he was in hiding along with former BBC television presenter and freelance journalist Htet Htet Khine, who is serving a six-year prison term.  He wrote and presented reports for the Democratic Voice of Burma in the late 2000s and later worked as editor-in-chief of Skynet Up to Date news, and was writing and presenting reviews as a columnist for Voice of America’s Burmese Service up to the time of his arrest.  After the coup, global media watchdog Reporters without Borders dropped Myanmar to 175th out of 180 countries in its 2022 World Press Freedom Index from 140th a year earlier. The NGO said Myanmar had become “one of the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, second only to China.”  Nguyen Lan Thang  Nguyen Lan Thang, a long-time contributor of blog posts on politics and society to Radio Free Asia’s Vietnamese service, was sentenced in April to six years in prison and two years of probation.  He was arrested in July 2022 on allegations that he posted videos on Facebook and YouTube that were said to “oppose” the Vietnamese Communist Party.  He is one of four jailed Radio Free Asia contributors in Vietnam, and his conviction is the latest of a string of judgments against dissidents under Article 117 of Vietnam’s Penal Code, frequently used by authorities to restrict freedom of expression and opinions deemed critical of the regime.  “Although we disagree (if not oppose) with the trial and the verdict, our hearts feel warm because humanity is still alive,” wrote Thang’s wife Le Thi Bich Vuong, who added that her family still believes that Thang is “a patriot who has never done anything wrong with the country and his conscience.”  Thang’s arrest and conviction was widely condemned by human rights and media freedom advocates, who said his case was riddled with flaws and a miscarriage of justice.  Nguyen Van Hoa  Nguyen Van Hoa, who has blogged and produced videos for Radio Free Asia, was arrested in January 2017 for “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state” after filming protests outside a Taiwan-owned steel plant, whose spill of toxic waste the year before had left fishermen and tourism workers jobless in four coastal provinces.  Hoa is an environmentalist, blogger and digital security trainer from Ha Tinh province who expressed sympathy for the fishermen hurt by the massive disaster. He received a seven-year jail term in November 2017 on charges that also included “conducting propaganda against the state.”  Amnesty International has said that Hoa was tortured by the authorities to confess to his alleged crime and in May 2019 was being held in solitary confinement as punishment for his refusal to cooperate.  Hoa wrote in letters smuggled to his family from prison that police had “hung him upside down from the ceiling and then beaten him,” London-based human rights activist Son Tran told RFA in early 2020.  Nguyen Tuong Thuy  Nguyen Tuong Thuy — a regular blogger for Radio Free Asia on democracy, human rights, and social issues — is serving 11 years in prison for “propaganda against the state.”  Thuy, 72, co-founded the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam in 2014. He served as vice president of the organization until his arrest in May 2020.  In November 2020, Thuy and two other IJAVN members were indicted for “making, storing, and disseminating documents and materials for anti-state purposes” under Article 117 of Vietnam’s Penal Code, frequently used by authorities in the Communist country to silence critics.  In 2021, Thuy’s wife, Pham Thi Lan, told RFA that Thuy was in failing health with limited access to medical treatment for ailments including back pain, high blood pressure, scabies and inflammatory bowel disease, after visiting him on May 14.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a media freedom watchdog group, Vietnam had detained 21 journalists for their professional activities as of Dec. 1, 2022.  Truong Duy Nhat  Truong Duy Nhat, who had been a weekly contributor to Radio Free Asia before his abduction by police in Thailand in January 2019, was convicted in March 2020 of “abusing his position and authority” in a decade-old land fraud case and jailed for 10 years.  Nhat, who described his case as politically motivated, said at his trial that after seeking political asylum in Thailand at the beginning of 2019, he was arrested by Thai Royal Police and handed over to Vietnamese police, who took him across the border into Laos, and from there back to Vietnam.  After a December 2020 visit to Nhat in prison, a friend said he was being forced to work eight hours a day making paper money for sale as temple offerings, and that working long hours in a seated position had aggravated the pain he was suffering from herniated discs.  Nhat was jailed before in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015 for his writings criticizing the one-party government.  Vietnam has been consistently rated “not free” in the areas of internet and press freedom by Freedom House, a U.S.-based watchdog group, while another press freedom group said journalists jailed in the country are often subject to mistreatment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGFyYWRpc2UubmcvcmVwb3J0aW5nLWNhcnJpZXMtaGlnaC1jb3N0cy1mb3ItcmZhLXZvYS1qb3VybmFsaXN0cy1pbi1hdXRob3JpdGFyaWFuLWFzaWFuLXN0YXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2003-12-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T08:01:23","Grasberg mine — the largest gold mine and third-largest copper mine in the world — is central to the story of West Papua’s colonisation. The mine, in West Papua’s Waa Valley on traditional lands (tanah adat) belonging to the Amungme and Kamora people, is a site of extraction, violence and profit.  Understanding Grasberg’s existence involves understanding United States mining company Freeport’s entangled history with former Indonesian President Suharto’s military regime.  In their article, “Development, Power, and the Mining Industry in Papua: A Study of Freeport Indonesia”, PA Rifai-Hasan notes that by 1962, the US believed the only permanent solution to avoid Jakarta being “driven into the arms” of the communist bloc was Indonesian control of West Papua.  See also West Papua: How should Indonesian govt, international community, UN respond to OPM hostage demands? Weapons company Thales under fire for human rights violations in West Papua Australia gives award to Indonesian general, despite unlawful killings in West Papua  This set in motion two key events.  First, the US provided support under the New York Agreement of 1962 for the Act of Free Choice (Penentuan Pendapat Rakyat), also known as the “Act of No Choice” — a 1969 plebiscite ceding West Papuan sovereignty to Indonesia following a vote, held under duress, of just 1025 West Papuans.  Second, a US-supported coup brought Suharto’s self-described “New Order” regime (Orde Baru) to power in 1967.  Having politically secured the “open veins” of West Papua, Suharto’s Orde Baru saw Grasberg as what Macarena Gómez-Barris describes as an “extractive zone” in her book of the same title — a site where the existing life forms exist under the gaze of economically rationalised state and corporate mega-projects.  Freeport and Suharto’s regime agreed to a 30-year contract in 1967 (talks had begun in 1965), which included no obligations to traditional landowners and no environmental regulations. Freeport’s mining operations moved three kilometres in 1988, from the depleted Ertsberg to the current site at Grasberg mountain (then-valued at US$40 billion).  The inflow of foreign capital helped stabilise Suharto’s regime in the early years and maintain the dictatorship for three decades.  Profit or livelihoods?  In the cosmology of the Amungme people, Grasberg mountain is the sacred head of their mother and its rivers her milk; to them, Freeport is digging out her heart. By contrast, at an annual meeting in 1997, Freeport CEO James Moffett told shareholders that Freeport’s operations were like taking “a volcano that’s been decapitated by nature, and we’re mining the oesophagus”.  The colonial extraction at Grasberg has created huge short-term profits for Freeport, while leaving local communities to deal with the long-term social and ecological effects. As a result, the mine is a centrepiece in the bloody struggle for West Papuan independence; a site of resistance to Freeport and Jakarta’s exploitation.  The Free Papua Movement (OPM) has attacked the mine multiple times, fuelled by outrage over the dispossession, environmental degradation and lack of political participation that underpin Grasberg’s operations. The OPM blew up the main slurry pipe in 1977, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage. In response, the Indonesian military massacred at least 800 people, although other estimates are much higher.  The West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), the armed wing of the OPM, recently took New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens hostage to draw international attention to the ongoing colonisation of West Papua.  Freeport relies on the Indonesian military to protect its operations — it has spent more than US$20 million every year since 2010 on military and police. This is documented in the company’s euphemistically named “Working Toward Sustainable Development” reports.  International attention has slowly increased following successive human rights reports exposing the military’s intimidation, brutality and torture. The reports and investigations have given locals a platform to voice the impacts of their dispossession, which otherwise goes unheard.  Amungme community organiser Yosepha Alomang described the abuse she suffered to the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights in the US House of Representatives in 1999. “I myself have experienced torture at the hands of Indonesia and the giant mining company Freeport,” Alomang said.  “I have been kidnapped by security forces ... and carried in a Freeport automobile, and held for one month in a ‘bathroom’ which was full of human faeces.”  Mining waste  Mining at Grasberg runs day and night, and requires satellite tracking of the mining trucks that operate shrouded in cloud. This has generated millions of tonnes of mine waste, or tailings, over its lifetime, which are toxic to people and ecosystems.  By 1990, Freeport’s tailings had polluted 84,158 hectares of offshore river systems and 35,820 hectares of onshore systems. About 700,000 tonnes of earth are sifted through every day, with more than 230,000 tonnes of tailings dumped into the local Otomina and Aikwa river systems.  A 2016 study published in Nature found that tailings had smothered and destroyed 13,800 hectares of forest in the adjacent world heritage-listed Lorentz National Park. Rifai-Husan writes that, apart from toxicity and destruction of the river and forest systems, the dumping of tailings has “consumed local population gardening, fishing, and hunting areas and wildlife, and separated people from their resources and livelihood”.  Social scientist Kjell Anderson labelled the violence and displacement a “slow motion genocide”, in which West Papuans have had their “identity, autonomy, and physical security substantially undermined through the neo-colonial policies of the Indonesian state”.  Freeport’s exploitation and extraction is an extended arm of the Indonesian state, linking Suharto’s Orde Baru with their new development plans. For example, the Indonesian government often claims that traditional land is not being “effectively used”, and seizes it to supposedly provide for “the greatest welfare for the people”.  As Amungme tribal leader Tom Beanel asks: “Could it be that the Indonesian government is drawn to Irian Jaya (West Papua) not by its people, but by its natural resources?”  Indonesia’s colonialism has sidelined First Nations’ perspectives and follows the same logic applied in settler colonies, from Australia to Palestine. West Papuans have been forced to abandon the living-with-land practices that have existed for thousands of years.  With communities no longer able to survive off polluted rivers and soil, Papuans migrate to the downstream flows of the Aikwa delta to scrape a living. They use handmade sifters to search for scraps of gold, exposing themselves to pollution with often-unknown effects.  By mapping long-term harm, Freeport can be held accountable for the dispossession and environmental damage they seek to hide. At the Grasberg mine, a US company is working to stabilise and benefit a military regime through extraction and exploitation.  Since “The Act of No Choice”, Indonesian governments have profited from exploiting the natural wealth of West Papua, and this extraction is closely tied to foreign capital and aided by military control. Since Suharto, Freeport’s operations have morphed; where once they could escape questioning of killings and land degradation, they now use development discourse as cover.  While we can only hope for the safe return of Mehrtens as soon as possible, this is an opportunity to raise awareness around the continuing colonisation of West Papua.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVubGVmdC5vcmcuYXUvY29udGVudC9taW5lLWNlbnRyZS13ZXN0LXBhcHVhcy1jb2xvbmlzYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-07-29","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T16:52:18","In the ensemble of political actors in the contemporary politics of the Fourth Republic, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, easily stands out within the mix, and clearly far above others.  This is in terms of his unalloyed puritanism as the most detribalised and extremely excellent bridge builder, whose cosmopolitan worldview, humanistic creed of the universal brotherhood of men, and magnanimous large-heartedness, rebuff, and with unguarded effortlessness too, illusive segregationist trifles of race, tribe, ethnicity, religion, sex or distortively jaundiced vision of any sort.  This indeed is an aspect which even his sworn enemies will concede, and all so readily too, in conscionable sincerity, if they really would.  To be sure, during his memorable gubernatorial epoch in Lagos State, Tinubu ran an all-inclusive government, in which Ibos were regaled with key appointments in government, ranging from commissionership, local government chairmanship, supervisory councillorship, councillorship and even membership of the Federal House of Reps, and Lagos State House of Assembly.  You will agree with me, that in the medley of the heterogeneous diversities of tribes domiciled in Lagos State, Ibos constitute about the greatest numbers of tribal bloc. Empirical evidence availing illustrates in poignant clarity, that a good number of Igbo immigrants had decided to relocate to Lagos, in order to enjoy the health and educational amenities, which are not only excellent, but considerably liberal and devoid of discriminatory cleavages on tribal ground, or prejudicial conditionalities of any sort, to access.  And for the Igbos engaged in big-time businesses, one could well succinctly attest to the fact that successive governments in Lagos State, have often accorded them the optimum hospitality, as could ever be imagined.  However, under Tinubu, especially during his memorable gubernatorial epoch, our Igbo brothers have never had it so good, in terms of the conducive ambience they have continued to enjoy in Lagos State, surpassing in quantum measures, the milieu as extant in regimes prior to Asiwaju’s tenure as governor of Lagos State.  We needn’t overly elaborate on this feature, which is crystally self-evident, in terms of his spiritedly sustained, and of course intensified efforts, expended in integrating the Igbos into the mainstream of affairs, both in the sphere of political administration and governance and socially too, in the bid to instil a reciprocal sense of belonging which comfortably settles them to feel at home, as members of the same family, with the vast mass of natives of their home states, especially Lagos and Yorubas as a whole  This is why developments unfolding over the years, had signally expressed no cause for cheers, in terms of the inability of our Igbo brothers to reciprocate his markedly affectionate passion, through their patently unfriendly attitude, bordering on outright hostility, indubitably reckoned in the general mind, in their ever sustained and intensified consistency, ever before Asiwaju’s gubernatorial ascension, as a genetic staple of common behavior  Remember that it was no other personality than Oba Rilwan Akiolu, who sometime in 2015, summoned a meeting of Igbo leaders, during which he gave them a bitter piece of his mind, with regards to their broiling belligerence, notoriously stuck over the years, as a distinctively unique epaulette, perennially unleashed against their ever hospitable Yoruba hosts, and worse still, Tinubu, who presided as the political leader of the ruling party in the state, and who by that token, appertain to their chief host.  On this, could it be recalled, how a highly disturbed Asiwaju, quickly rallied the Ibos together, with a spiritedly passionate appeal, to assuage their aggrieved mind.  To be sure, Tinubu’s passion and manifest sense of kinship for the Ibos, going by the manner in which he had ostensibly gone beyond himself to accord them a filial sense of oneness, as an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, is simply amazing.  Indeed some of those privileged to be quite close to Tinubu, could divulge with competent authority, that quite on a good number of times, not a few of intensely concerned ones, had perennially essayed to awaken the renowned APC leader to the mortal danger, posed by the Ibos, particularly in Lagos State, citing their purulent pus of bad blood, bordering on intensely unbridled hate-mongering, despite all spirited attempts by Asiwaju to encourage and re-assure them from time to time, that not only are they an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, but an esteemed and privileged one for that matter. However Tinubu in his characteristic quixotry and magnanimous large-heartedness had often dismissed such insinuations as mere figments of the imagination.  But today, Tinubu will need no one sounding the reveille for an intelligible cognizance of the message, visibly unfurled in it’s ominous augury.  This lamentable show of bad blood, which had quite lingered over the years, sadly attained a climax, the moment Asiwaju emerged at the recently concluded primaries as the APC flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election.  Right from that moment, hell was immediately let loose, with an orchestrated campaign of hatred and calumny, emanating from our Igbo brothers, becoming increasingly vicious, worrisome, and extremely alarming, bordering on something else.  Ordinarily and of course sincerely, one perceives nothing bad or odious with criticisms constructively offered, just as giving your mind, a free rein of expression in the public space, in as much as the laws of the land entrenches the inalienable right to free speech; however, the critical moment of departure, that it begins to negotiate an alarming descent to inflammatory hate words and a flurry of conflagratory verbiage, as our Igbo brothers have indulgently elevated to trivial pleasurable razzmatazz, then every right thinking Nigerian, and lover of peace, should be so verily concerned as to raising an eye brow, for the premium sake of peace, growth and unity of this potentially great nation.  No wonder, popular spectacles of fierce and bitter verbal exchanges between the shamelessly ungrateful Igbos on one hand and their highly considerate and hospitable Yoruba hosts, continue to greet the public space with disturbing ubiquity, just as the social media is ever awash with vitriols of all sorts, unleashed with unmitigated fury, by these overzealous dacoits of pan Igbo irredentism, giving a clear and undoubted impression that these are clearly the handiwork of hired hatchet men, at the behest of their “invisible” task masters, dictating the shot.  As we could all recall, it soon attained a most infuriating point that FolashadeTinubu Ojo, the Iyaloja-General, who also happened to be Asiwaju’s daughter, could not but chip in a piece of her mind, on the need for these ungrateful stock, to temper their vitriolic vituperations, daily being orchestrated, against the eminent Nigerian statesman, with unfettered restraint.  Indeed, it couldn’t have been anything but shock, an exceedingly severe one for that matter, when a group of Igbos, in an unwarranted rage of defiance, stirred tremors of warning that she was fanning the embers of wild belligerence; hawling, in a rave of uncontrolled lunacy, that they were ready, and indeed more than capable to respond squarely to any drum-beat of battle, as their hospitable Yoruba hosts might bring to bear in contest. Haba!  A curious aspect of the charade in progress, was that as Asiwaju was all this while, at the receiving end of the untramelled aspersions, perennially hurled by the Igbos, in their possessive fury of hate words, Atiku had all along remained virtually off their scurrilous purview, except for occasional scratchers, which in no way compared in severity, with the lethal verbal assault and sabre-rattling incendiaries increasingly being orchestrated against Asiwaju, with sustained and intensified angst.  Yet, this is a man, who as governor, presided over the affairs of Lagos, at a time, when the nagging question of high-frequency migration of the Igbos to Lagos State, attained a peak, continually stretching the existing infrastructure almost beyond the limit of endurance, thus keeping successive administrations sleeplessly on their toes in the herculean toilsomeness that grappled to cope with the increasingly alarming population explosion, daily being witnessed as a result of the accelerating incursion of people in quest of greener pastures, on account of it’s conducive ambience to flourishing endeavors.  Of course, it cannot be too often emphasized that Igbos constitute the most considerable chunk of this category. This is why their pestiferous and patently uncouth outpourings against Tinubu indeed heralds such a huge surprise, so to say.  Why is it, that Igbos incubate such pathologically inscrutable loathsomeness for their Yoruba brothers, perennially let loose, with frenetic ruthlessness and the most unimaginable vitriol on Asiwaju, who ironically happens ,in exceedingly befitting terms, to be their foremost benefactor and ardent lover of their progress?  During Asiwaju’s heroic reign as governor of Lagos State, he succeeded in lifting Lagos to hitherto unprecedented heights, while in the process, making the state, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose dynamic policies, spreading like an amazing contagion, were emulated with religious fervor, by other states, far and wide.  Why is it therefore, that our Igbo brothers would always with fervent impulsiveness be ready to throw reason to the dogs, ever haunting and hounding this unusually detribalized statesman, at their capriciously whimsical will, and woolly sentimentality, while literally looking less at the individual governors presiding in their own primordial states of the South-East?  Why is it that you come to Lagos; make huge fortune and big money, and yet, reserve nothing but sheer bilious angst and hate, for your accommodating hosts and their leaders, who hitherto have accorded you such a bossomly familial embrace devoid of any shred of discrimination?  If the governors in your respective native states of the South-East had done even a fraction of Tinubu’s accomplishments in Lagos, with the transformative impetus that has elevated it to one of the leading cities in Africa, would you dare have descended on them with such whorish pang of depredation, so terrifying to imagine. Pray. Why are Igbos so envious, panicky and intensely jittery even of the slightest shadows of the Yorubas?  Imagine again, the umbrage devoid of the traditional African deference for old age, quite in tune with the Igbo behavioral stereo-type, beffitingly evocative of the landmark “ranting of an ant” of Chuba Okadigbo, in his message to the Great Zik, with which they swooped on Wole Soyinka just for his reasoned elderly admonishment on the nutsy band of off-hook scoundrels, parading as pyrate fraters; consigning the cultivated virtue of home training to the dogs, in their reprobative burlesquing of the revered patriot and statesman?  Could you imagine their effusive gibberish rant answering quite in character with the monocultural racial herd in their wanton abrasiveness against the Yoruba-born globally acclaimed genius of all times, who dominates the global literary fraternity like a colossus, for no imaginable reason whatsoever? Imagine again, the latest in their primitive savage streak, displayed with untamed recklessness, in their churlish and petulant pepper-market jabbles unleashed in their brusquely uncouth mannerisms, against the global literary giant, just because of his latest post-election commentaries, in which he made very apt and cogent points.  In the same vein of bilious ingratitude, one recalls that Victor Adebunkola Banjo, a lieutenant colonel of Yoruba extraction, in a sacrificial fit of immolation, discountenanced the implicatory tag of a traitor, expectedly coming from his Yoruba kinsmen, to fight on the side of Biafra; but as it were to turn out, Ojukwu’s reciprocal code of appreciation, was an outright summary execution by firing squad, of that brilliant, charismatic and courageous soldier and intellectual.  Same with Adekunle Fajuyi, the then Governor of the old western region, who in an exemplary fit of chivalry, unprecedented in the annals of human existence, staked his life, by choosing to die with his guest and the then military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi ironsi. Yet our lgbo brothers will far from appreciate.  On this patrimonial inheritance of genetic anti-yoruba obsession, Chinua Achebe, fore-most exemplar of anti-Yoruba racial hatred, could poignantly be seen as taking the lead, as of course signally evident in the retrospective play-back, thirty seven years ago, when in the wake of the frabjous ambience heralding the exhilarating announcement of the Yoruba-born literary giant, he (Achebe)ascended the roof-top, with an unwarranted gaffe, that the global literary diadem, was by no implicit assumption, a caveat for the Asiwaju title of African literature.  Indeed, looking back decades ago; that moment of destiny that Soyinka bagged the Nobel literary diadem; unarguably a staggering all-time feat in the annals of black achievements, he had, even if unknown to him, unwittingly stepped on the wounded toes of the collective mass of envious and inferiority-ridden Ndigbos, who in turn, will never forgive him, just for that singular feat, which they had cherished with passionate fervor, that it should have belonged to one of them or a non-Yoruba rather than a Yoruba.  Indeed, Soyinka himself could not help but describe the banal effusion of the arch Igbo tribalist as “uncalled for and disappointing”. “I was a little bit disappointed, and didn’t see the necessity…that particular subject under contention didn’t relate to literature”, stressed the world renowned writer.  Even Soyinka himself, in an article personally written years ago, in an edition of this Day Newspaper, could again, not help but lament a conspiratorial wave of propaganda, insurgently saturating the public space; then championed by an Igbo-born professor; who animated by a weirdly hunch of diabolism, had mischievously sought to forge an interpretatively suspicious link between Achebe’s fatal accident, that rendered him mortally crippled, shortly after a particular edition of his birthday anniversary; to the gift of a live cow, presented to him on that particular occasion by Soyinka; ostensibly as an innocent well-intentioned goodwill gesture, to a comrade in the literary fraternity; but which the arch Igbo tribalist, and a supposedly enlightened professor, had in an unguarded magisterial whims effectively poisoned the vulnerable willing herd of fellow arch tribalists who in their bizarre flight of fancy, had came to construe in the grotesque coloration of occultic wickedness.  Yet, this was the same Soyinka, whose sacrificial immolation for the Biafran cause, in the thick of the civil war, earned him a harrowing 22-month ordeal in the gulag, during the Gowon era.  Again, Achebe would not allow any moment to slip by, without a paludal inveighing of Awo, as the ominous harbinger, paving the fenestra for the demonising incursion of the tribal monster, into the political firmament.  In the inexponible quibble of revisionism, we would all recall the ever unrepentantly chronic tribal bigot, who was so quick to the post, harassing Awo as the primordial agent of dispersal of tribal infiltration, advancing a rather meretricious make-belief that the reverred statesman of the Yoruba stock, it was, that engineered the parliamentary cross-carpeting that put paid to Zik, in oppiliating his visionary misadventure for the Leviathan premiership of the Old West.  Lamentably, his curious quirk for selective amnesia, would least avail to advert in reference to the doctorinaire chauvinism of the great Zik, as of course unfolded in his reprobative heresy, way back in 1949,that “….the god of Africa, has created the Igbo nation to lead the children of Africa from the bondage of ages.”  It is of course a popular staple of common knowledge, how Zik as the incumbent vice-gerent, in the NCNC, following the glorious demise of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay, would without qualms of conscience, cannibalise the NCNC as an exclusive inheritance, of which the Igbos were the sole legatees; a signally disturbing trend, which in turn elicited the vexatious discountenance of people like Adegoke Adelabu, who were verily uncomfortable with the unstatesmanly descent to base pertavinity.  At this juncture, I shall proceed to expound three signally illustrative instances, in which the defective strabism of Igbo leaders, Zik and Ojukwu in particular, in terms of their myopic preferences of political alliances, had not only draggled the larger mass of their collective filial kins into the excruciating marginalization conundrum, celebrated over the years, in inconsolable crocodilean canticles, but also in the process, dragooned the collective Nigerian nationhood into its contemporary tumult.  However, let me affirm, right before the narrative just about coming on the heels, that this does not in any way, vitiate a jot, the credible moral force, latent in Asiwaju’s fraternizing parley with a vastly enlightened North, as currently extant – contrasting in its progressive paradigm with the feudal fascism of the era of old; for which Awo desperately needed fellow progressive fraters in collaborative synergy; to square up to; for ultimate libertarian triumph, of the Northern Talakawas in an avowed visionary pursuit which unfortunately footled to failure for lack of a willing mate in response to the clarion call, for a united solidarous front, particularly from the strategic North.  Going down the memory lane,1959 to be precise, one recalls that Awolowo advanced an alliance overture towards Zik, premised on the logic that a combination of the Action Group, led by him, and the Zik-led NCNC, will overwhelm the Hausa-Fulani NPC,whose narrow feudal bent was clearly ill at variance with the vision of a united and virile Nigeria, and the liberation of the down-trodden, especially the highly pauperized Talakawas of the north.  Zik was crystally enamoured of Awo’s unassailable logic, or so it seemed. But dramatically, all of a sudden, Nigerians woke up one day, only to discover that the great Zik had indeed gone with the Hausa-Fulanis! Thus did the Hausa-Fulani NPC seize power, and promptly grabbed it as a much-awaited opportunity to annihilate Awo.  Of course, those who knew at that time, would easily recall Akintola’s machiaevillian deployment, being a willing myrmidon of the north, for a head-on collision against Awo, his erstwhile leader – as inspired and engineered by the Hausa-Fulani oligarchs, animated by a subterranean cant for a greater Lebensraum and hegemonic continuity – and the violent conundrum in the West; eventually culminating in the January 15,1966 military coup, master-minded by a cross-section of Igbo-born army officers, and the assumption of power by Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, as the first military Head of State, after the gruesome assassination of the then Prime-Minister of the federation, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and the then premier of Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, a direct great grandson of Shehu Usman Dan Fodio.  The January coup, was to inspire the July 29 coup, spear-headed by the Hausa-Fulani elements in the army, in unconsolable revanche to the killing of Balewa and Ahmadu Bello.  Of course, the then ruling military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, among sundry top army officers of Igbo extraction, also lost their lives in the retributive backlash of the same tribal-motivated coup, which in disastrously fatal turn, catalysed a massive wave of inter-tribal killings between the Igbos and Hausas;triggering the declaration of Biafra, by Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, and the inevitable consecution of a civil war; a gory celebration of blood bath, in which an estimated two million souls perished.  In yet another ominous turn, 1979 would again witness an unfortunate rehash of the same charade, as Awo again made an alliance overture to Zik, ostensibly premised on a mutual synergy between the Awo-led Unity Party of Nigeria ,on one hand, and the Zik-led Nigerian People’s Party, aimed at counteracting the Hausa-Fulani-led NPN,a feudal ideological resurgence of the Northern People’s Congress of the First Republic. Again, the entire nation woke up one day, only to discover that the Zik-led NPP had unabashedly flocked along, in parley with the Hausa-Fulani NPN, a feudal re-incarnation of the First Republic Northern People’s Congress.  Of course, we could all well attest to how the alliance fortified the NPN, which having ripped off on their fortune-hunting partners, the NPP, to install their men into principal offices in the legislature, now embarked on pleasurable binge of massive tyranny, as unfolded in the politically motivated mass killings of the Bakolori farmers in Sokoto, the deportation of the Majority Leader of GNPP,Alhaji Abdul-rahmam Shugaba, the terrifying tomfoolery of the 1983 elections,and the devastating quake and tumult,coupled with the demonic prodigality in public spending;a saturnalian frenzy of high-wire corruption, which again was to culminate in the Buhari-Idiagbon coup of December 31,1983.  Of course, as an intensely agitated Zik cried out, following the massive electoral chicanery, we would all recall the horrifying reckless rant of the notorious rantipole, ChubaOkadigbo, who unsurprisingly typical of his coprolitic gutter-rant style, which would go down as a locus classicus in intellectual hooliganism, dismissed the rightful democratic remonstrance of the great Zik as” the ranting of an ant”  Looking back, one could well affirm without any shred of doubt, that Zik’s preferential cohabitation with the then Northern People’s Congress at the time in question,was motivated by a pathologically embedded narcissism that he could use the benefit of an alliance with the then feudal Northern People’s Congress,to acquire greater leverage for his fellow Igbo brethren against the Yorubas,then renowned for their elevated notch of superior education.Unfortunately,as it would turn out on each occasion,none else,but the Igbos,came out the greatest losers as patently expressed in an unremitting pathos of mournful dirge,in their lachrymal canticles on marginalisation.  This unimaginable faux pas of history would also derive an unfortunate replication in the inexplicable choice that saw the Ikemba of Nnewi, Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu who on his return from exilic sojourn in Ivory Coast, now Cote D’ivoire, had sought for a political party to enlist in, and found none, except the Hausa-Fulani NPN, thus betraying an arrant lack of grasp of the causative dynamics of history.  On what note does one therefore reckon with such big goof in cognitive dissonance, emanating from a supposedly learned Oxford-educated historian of an elevated Master’s degree cadre, as the Ikemba of blessed memory, one may ask?  Not until the devastating defeat he suffered in the Senatorial duel from Dr. Onwudiwe of the NPP, just as his party, the NPN, barely did reckon with him,did it eventually dawn on him that he was already demystified and his terror-value which hitherto had stared the Northern feudal oligarchs inwardly scared stiff, effectively defused.  Still on the Biafran warlord of blessed memory, it would well be apt and relevant at this point, to ask:”In taking recourse to the Hausa-Fulani NPN, as it were, at that time, whose interest was he serving? The collective interest of the Igbos or his own personal interest? If the interest of the Igbos, he should tell that to the marines.  Similarly, in a back-track reminder as might well be deemed for strategic emphasis, we would all witness the manner in which Zik had jettisoned two crucial and strategic overtures for progressive synergy, as advanced by Awo, firstly in 1959,and secondly in 1979, exactly twenty years after; and the catastrophic aftermath for the corporate national existence.  No wonder, Sir James Robertson, the last British governor-general of Nigeria, during the colonial era, daubed him in his memoirs, as mercurial, unpredictable and unreliable, while the Late Professor Ayodele Awojobi, the engineering genius of blessed memory described him categorically as ‘consistently inconsistent’.  Now pray: in taking recourse to the feudal Hausa-Fulani NPC, and NPN in 1959 and 1979 respectively, exactly 20years after, whose interest was Zik, indeed the Great Zik of Africa serving? National interest or the interest of his Igbo kith and kin? As for national interest, he could well tell that to the marines!  Ironically, going down the lane of history, one recalls with definitive clarity, that Zik actually rode to dominantly prosilient fame and eminence,on the political war-chest of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay – the then leader of the NCNC,at a time that Zik held forte as the Secretary-General ¬¬– who at various public fora, openly expressed his passionate love for Zik, as his beloved son, in whom he was well pleased.  This in effect is to say that the wider national appeal which the Zik-led NCNC enjoyed after the demisé of Macaulay, erstwhile leader of the party, was largely due to the immense populist clout and towering larger-than-life imagery of the legendary Macaulay, who at the zenith of his fame and glory, bestrode the Nigerian political hemisphere like a colossus.  It was a tribute to these grave political miscalculations of the great Zik, that no less a personality than former Premier of the Eastern region, Dr. M.l. Okpara of blessed memory, recanted in agonizing lament, that he will regret till his dying day, his failure to advise Zik, to rather go with the Awo-led Action Group, as against the parochial expedience of the Hausa-Fulani feudal NPC.  Unfortunately, by the time the Zik-led NPP would negotiate a corrective ideological repentance for the progressive configuration, of “The Twelve Progressive Governors”, Awolowo’s brain-child in progressive synergy, which Zik had twice rejected, initially in 1959 and again in 1979,it was already too late in the day, as the looming surge of anarchy, had irrepressibly waxed beyond redemption, and could thus not avail as a viable counter-force to rebuff the incursion of the Buhari-Idiagbon duo, who on December 31st 1983, sprung forth to upstage the apple-cart of the corrupt and purulently decadent Shagari-led civilian administration of the second republic.  And in the case of Ojukwu, we would all recall, how having been politically demystified and deflated sequel to his attendant fiasco at the Senatorial election, he in angered repudiation of his erstwhile Hausa-Fulani allies, recanted in the fashion of a new convert to a doctrinaire proselytism of an East-West understanding fanatically propounded and propagated as a counter-force to the monolithic geo-political behemoth of the north.  Unfortunately, and on a tragic note of paradox, the average Igbo man would see nothing wrong in the political leaders of their own genitive breed, let alone the discerning cognitive intellect that essentially exposes these two key leaders of the Igbo tribe, in the context of the endemic faux pas in their choices and preferences borne of narrow personal and at best, tribal promptings, in terms of their dialectical linkage to the conundrum prevalently etched for decades, with increasing virulence on the polity; of which the Igbos were to come out the worse, arising from the seminal outpourings of the blighted vision of their own leaders.  On this, the Ghanaian statesman of blessed memory, Joe Appiah remarked in his autobiography, in which he exposed Zik as the veritable fugleman providing the primeval irritant for the irruption of the anti-yoruba racial hate, uncontrollably festering the general Igbo psyche.  Going down the lane of history, Appiah recalled the historic moment of the formation of Egbe Omo Oduduwa in London, and the conflagratory rhetorics immediately following on the heels, as Zik in the September 8 edition of the West African Pilot, thus issued the provocative cassus belli: “Henceforth, the cry must be one of battle against Egbe Omo Oduduwa, its leaders at home and abroad, uphill and down dale, in the streets of Nigeria and in the streets of London and the residence of its advocates’.  According to Chinweizu, a notable Igbo intellectual, “the testimony from a Ghanaian, who for many years, was a member and president of W.A.S.U in London, should give Igbos pause about the version of the Igbo-Yoruba cold war they had accepted. The key point is that the Ibo Union had been in existence before the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was founded. Yet Zik declared war on Egbe Omo Oduduwa. Why? If it was because the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was not pan Nigerian, then what of the pre-existing Ibo Union?”  “In other words, it wasn’t the Yorubas who introduced tribal unions and tribal politics into Nigeria but the Igbos. But whatever his reason, Zik was the one who declared war on the Yorubas; he was the aggressor”.  “With that aggression as background, the carpet-crossing becomes an understandable response to Zik’s declaration of war. If somebody who declared war on your people arrives to govern your homeland, what should your leaders do? Welcome him and let him govern or drive him out by any means necessary? The carpet crossing accomplished just that, and Igbos following Zik, the instigator of the response, I commend the Yorubas for defending themselves against aggression”.  “Zik’s conduct is an example of how Igbos can act without thinking of how their actions might look to those their proposed action might adversely affect. That is a weakness Igbos should be on guard against and should work to eliminate by extra self-awareness and constant self-criticism.”  “For seven decades we have paid for Zik’s aggression against the Yorubas. The cold war, which Zik started, made it possible for the British to install the NPC in power in 1959 when Zik refused to join with Awo to form the federal government. He explained it away by alluding to his distrust of Awo that stemmed from the carpet crossing affair. In other words, Zik is ultimately responsible for our disasters and oppression under the caliphate. But the pertinent issue at this time is that we, not the Yorubas, are responsible for the Yoruba-Igbo feud. We are not the innocent victims of Yoruba tribalism and hatred. That fact should inform our attitude in seeking reproachment with the Yorubas, especially now that we need a Yoruba – Igbo alliance to help create conditions.”  Unlike Achebe, whose world-view horrifyingly begins and ends with a segregationist chauvinism of pan Igboism, to the extent that he would see nothing bad in Zik, Ojukwu, and the primitively untamed Onyeama, but rather a blanket sweep sentiment of everything good, while in the obverse, he will faint blink an eye, before taking Awolowo, the foremost heroic symbol, to the cleaners on sheer sentimental illogic, which exposes his grossly deficient intellect – Soyinka on the other hand, had more than a sufficiently ample space to literally take the three-some to the hangers by virtue of their incredibly horrifying fumblings, sacrilegious deportments and heretic rantings and vituperations; but he would rather not plough that path, borne of his magnanimous large-heartedness and unifying propensity.  Similarly, he had the discretion to take on Achebe and his demented, warped, infantile and mediocre intellect, yet he would rather choose to lie low, actuated by sheer pacifist impulse and of course a macro-dimensional, all-encompassing vision of a united and indivisible Nigeria.  To be sure, as could not be too often repeated, Tinubu succeeded in lifting Lagos State to hitherto unprecedented eminence, thereby making it, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose progressive, dynamic and pragmatic policies were emulated all over the federation.  In the libertarian struggle for democracy, he was prosiliently sui-generis as the hero of the struggle, as of course attested to, by the likes of Wole Soyinka, Colonel Nyiam, Dele Momodu, Kayode Fayemi, and even the Ayo Adebanjos, Abraham Adesanyas, Olanihun Ajayis among several others.  Besides, Asiwajus vast expanse of network built over the years, coupled with his personal charms, mobilisational and organisational acumen, his peculiar gift of the sixth sense, which his competitors could verily not match, are such rare but highly cherished treasures that money cannot buy.  But apart from the fact of his personal talent and endowment, is the law of Divine compensation, which is to say that Asiwaju is a man who had paid his dues.  As an arrow head of NADECO’s struggle for democracy under the totalitarian fascism of General Sanni Abacha, Asiwaju’s heroic role in this regard, will as much, demand an entire voluminous book to do justice to.  Of course, it’s a generally acknowledged fact of history that unlike the reactionary elements who would not give a damn in parleying with Abacha, Asiwaju refused to sell his conscience, but would rather negotiate a tedious journey to exile, despite the assurance by the management of Mobil, where he held forte as the Chief Treasurer, that he should not hesitate to retrace his step back to his plum job, if his romance with politics appeared bleak.  Evidence abound from the very horse mouth of people like Dele Momodu, Colonel Tony Nyiam, Kayode Fayemi, Bayo Onanuga and co, as to the immense sacrifice which Asiwaju made in assisting financially disadvantaged exiles whom he quartered in his houses both in the U.K .and the U.S., and even assisted financially, with regards to their daily upkeep.  At least, Bayo Onanuga did not mince words in divulging Asiwaju’s benevolent gestures in permitting him to draw a regular allowance of hundreds of dollars weekly, from proceeds issuing from Asiwaju’s Gas Station in Chicago.  Femi Ojudu, Osibajo’s Chief Campaign Man, similarly did reveal, how Asiwaju from his base in the U.S. was regularly remitting money for the payment of staff salary, and also for the daily running cost of PM NEWS and THE NEWS, at the harrowing moment when Abacha’s killer squad were let loose against the newspaper organization and it’s editorial staff.  Asiwaju did all these, despite the fact that he was not a shareholder of the organization. Rather, as a progressive politician and democrat to the core, he was solely fired by the zeal to boost the morale of the rank and file staff of the newspaper, in the struggle for democracy. The same thing Asiwaju did for TELL Magazine when things were direly so rough.  Similarly, Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, also narrated how at a point in time, as an exile in the U.S., Asiwaju embarked on the sale of Rice which involved a shuttle between Thailand and some African countries, while dedicating the proceeds from the business to the collective cause of the NADECO struggle.  Kayode Fayemi in his writings, also attested to this, in his remarks on how Asiwaju stretched his financial resources to the limit in the collective struggle for democracy.  The same incumbent governor of Ekiti State, also narrated the crucial role which Asiwaju as a member of the Board of Trustees of NALICON, founded by Wole Soyinka, at that era in exile, played in encouraging and convincing the Olof Palme Foundation, based in Sweden, to assist NALICON with the urgently needed fund for the establishment of the Radio Station which subsequently contributed in no mean measure, to a formidable propaganda armada which attracted international condemnation that increasingly debilitated and devastated the defences of the Abacha regime, making its eventual exit a matter of time, before the dramatic demise of the notorious military dictator.  At this juncture, the crucial point to be noted is that Asiwaju had barely spent two years as a senator, before Abacha took over. In this circumstance, a lesser mind would have wallowed in regret, cursing the day he went into politics; and would surely not hesitate in retracing his step back to his plum job, or fall headlong in romance with Abacha, just like a huge lots of members of his political class actually kowtowed at that time, while throwing honor and principles to the dogs. To be sure, it was apparent that Asiwaju was not looking forward to any gains. Rather, his main point of satisfaction consists in the fact that it was a worthy struggle.  In a nutshell, this is the democracy we all enjoy today. How many people ever bordered to imagine, the valley of the shadow of death, Asiwaju passed through in his struggle for civilian governance which we are all enjoying today, and how many of us who knew, do indeed appreciate?  All the political eaglets, neophytes and nonstarters, including state governors who had hardly spent 100 days in office, to whom an Angel had appeared and handed them the divine mandate to be president overnight, including those of them that Asiwaju made, where were they at that harrowing moment when Asiwaju was leading the battle from the trenches, far away in exile? How many members of the political class, who would not like to see even Asiwaju’s shadow, ever knew or appreciate or remember, as the case may be, what Asiwaju went through in those days; the dastardly vandalisation of his residence in Lagos and eight of his cars destroyed beyond repairs, the accusation that he wanted to plant a bomb at Ejigbo NNPC Depot, just because of his frontline involvement in the June 12 struggle, and how he escaped death by the whiskers by wangling through the borders of Benin Republic, for a harrowing life in exile?  Yet, Asiwaju never allowed his distinguished achievements in the struggle, to get into his head, through an overnight fancy for presidency.  Reliable authority even had it that on arrival from exile, Asiwaju in his characteristic selflessness, had actually intended to go for a Senatorial seat, but Afenifere top-notchers at that time, prevailed upon him to head on for governorship.  For close to thirty years, after he had been in politics, Asiwaju had refrained from announcing any ambition for presidency, rather, he had over the years, provided a platform for others like Falae, Atiku, Ribadu, Buhari and Co; to run for presidency, while in the process, risking his life, and everything dear to him, to accord them maximum support.  Imagine for instance, the immense role he played in the formation of APC, which eventually provided the platform for the fructification of Buhari’s passionate presidential ambition after three previously failed attempt which on a particular occasion, publicly drew tearful pathos of lament from him. For this, Asiwaju was bugged by some morally suspect media which obviously had kowtowed for the bargain of settlement; yet he refused to budge, until his unflagging support, inspired Buhari to a roller-coaster ride to presidential victory.  As an eminent political figure, an accomplished veteran of the battle for political liberty, a courageous leader of opposition, and arrowhead of the progressive forces, coupled with the fact that Asiwaju commanded more States in his own regional constituency more than any other politician could claim to command in their own respective regions, Asiwaju nevertheless conceded to Buhari.  Indeed in a more civilized clime, Asiwaju would have had no need to embark on any campaign spree or consultation. Rather, he would have been literally co-opted, without the slightest opposition, and with strong plea and persuasion too.  To be sure, people in Asiwaju’s class are rare. Not only is he an enigma, but an enigma within an enigma, the category that the Yorubas would describe as “Akanda Eeyan”. You can only toy with him at your own peril.  In all the geo-political Igbo-speaking states of the South-East, how many of Asiwaju’s contemporaries as state governors, command any conspicuity on the political radar, in astonishingly wide-berth comparison with Tinubu, who has continued to rise and rise like a meteor, to the enviable height which has deservedly earned him the treasurable eulogium of the ” Main Issue In Nigerian Politics”.  Imagine Igbos boasting that Lagos is no man’s land. Imagine the falsidical bunkum that they contributed the most in building Lagos. Why then do they not take recourse to their primordial native home and bring it to par with Lagos, after all charity they say, begins from home.  Familiar popular domiciles like Kaduna, Kano, Abuja, are notable spots with beehive ubiquity of Igbos. In other words, Igbos are virtually etched on the minutest space in these places; yet they would only tread cautiously, and would never stretch their luck too far, contrary to their licentious spoilt sport brag in Lagos, cashing in on the traditional hospitality of Yorubas and Lagosians in particular, stretched more than ever before, during the Tinubu era – in embrace of our Igbo brothers whom the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello would daub in the awry imagery of pathologicaly ungrateful usurpers.  All the excesses Igbos perpetrate in their host states, how many non-Igbos dare try an inch of that, in their own land, knowing Igbos for their characteristic hostile intolerance of non-Igbos in their own land.  When will Igbos rise above their genetically ingrained anti-yoruba hate and phobia, truculently unleashed this time around, on Soyinka and Tinubu, simply borne of their Leviathan stature and glowing distinction, waxing so discomfitting, dizzifying and unbearably unsettling in bewildering wide-breadth gap to their liluputian frame.  The magnitude of hate-words and outright rage of curses daily being unleashed on these great leaders of African continental and global renown by these over-zealous hordes of incurable anti-Yoruba Igbo haters, is not only amazing, but simply unimaginable, in this civilised epoch of modernity. It is amazing that Tinubu’s innocent biological offsprings are not even spared on this celebrative savage haul of unremitting outright curses.  The same treat of searing hate words, they also unleashed on Sam Omatseye. In one of the finest piece, ever written, the cerebral chairman, editorial board of the NATION newspapers marshalled a forensic psychosis of primeval savage deportment of the Igbo mass behavior in the dotting voyage to electoral destiny, come 2023; as a ready revanche; ever latent in the Igbo mass sub-conscious driven by a carthatic vent of the Biafran frustration.  No, sooner had the publication greeted the public space, than all hell, literally let loose on the highly endowed writer, courtesy of the unabashed herd of bigots, putting his precious life on the hanger with all manner of threats; which in turn elicited an outcry, from the larger mass of the Omatseye clan, pleading that nothing must touch their son.  But here are the same herd of over-zealous pleasure bullies making so much fetish of their miniature political god-head, who like Napoleon, can never be wrong and therefore above any reproof, or else Amadiora the mythical god of thunder, will descend in terrimotive wrath on the accuser  It is amazing that over fifty years after the civil war, Igbos would simply refuse to let go, as they continuously let loose the subdued pang of their latent Biafran frustration and segregationist chauvinism of anti Tinubu-Soyinka-cum-Yoruba hatred expressed through their primitively effusive farrago of empty balderdash  Just because they saw Tinubu as their main obstacle to the garrison conquest of Lagos State and the totalitarian circumambience of the larger Nigerian frame. Dear Ndigbo, why embroiled in a battle you know you cannot win, with all your soaring din of loud, but ineffectual pleasure stunt of empty grandstanding. Come may 29,2023, The great leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will surely keep faith with history.  *Kola Johnson is a writer and journalist","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlZWRvbW9ubGluZS5jb20ubmcvbmRpZ2JvLXNveWlua2EtdGludWJ1LWFzLW1ldGFwaG9ycy1vZi1hbnRpLXlvcnViYS1vYnNlc3Npb24tYnkta29sYS1qb2huc29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2017-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T05:10:22","Internal Memo Exposes Zanu PF Plot To Use Army, CIO To Rig Polls  Spread the love  Zanu PF’s elaborate plan to deploy state security services such as the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and the military as part of its strategy to win the harmonised elections at all costs has been laid bare in internal communication.  Since the 2017 coup that toppled long time ruler Robert Mugabe, his successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been increasingly involving the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and the military in Zanu PF internal politics.  According to the constitution, the intelligence services and the military are supposed to be apolitical.  Last month, the CIO running under the shadowy Friends Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ) ran the ruling party’s primary elections.  FAZ, led by CIO deputy director general Walter Tapfumaneyi, had the major say in the primaries.  The group was assisted by an army-linked group Heritage Trust, to conduct the elections.  This publication has obtained a Zanu PF internal memo addressed to provincial chairpersons by political commissar Mike Bimha, dated May 19 informing them that FAZ and Heritage will play a huge role in the upcoming voter registration inspection exercise  .The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has not announced when it will open the national voters’ roll for inspection.  However, Bimha said the exercise will be done soon, raising questions about Zanu PF’s relationship with the elections management body.  According to Bimha, Zanu PF will set up national, constituency and polling centre command centres to monitor the voter inspection exercise.  These shall be manned by provincial commissars from the main wing, women’s, youth and war veteran’s league, provincial FAZ and Heritage Trust liaison officers.  “For this programme to be a success, cell chairpersons and a team comprising cell main wing provincial chairperson, cell women’s league chairwoman, cell youth league chairperson and a war veteran at each polling station should be responsible and account for each member in the cell register,” Bimha wrote.  “This team led by the cell chairperson shall physically lead their cell members to the polling station, and retain an auditable record confirming each member’s inspection status.  “It is very critical that data capture is done diligently for this programme.“Constituency experts, (FAZ) and Heritage Trust constituency coordinators will monitor and capture data at each polling station as well as submit daily reports to the command centres.”  The memo was copied to Zanu PF second secretary Kembo Mohadi, secretary general Obert Mpofu, national chairperson Oppah Muchinguri and spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa.  “Central committee members, national constitutional assembly (NCA) Members of Parliament (MPs)-elect, sitting MPS and district coordinating committee (DCC) members, constituency experts from FAZ and Heritage liason officers will assist with supervision of the programmes throughout the constituency as well as motivating and directing lower party structures to go and inspect their names,” Bimha said.  Bimha said the ruling party will use the exercise to audit and update its cell registers.  “Undertake an audit of party members registered with Zec who are eligible to vote on the election day,” he said.  “Test the capability of party structures to mobilise members to inspect the voters roll and reflect the party’s capabilities to mobilise on the election day.  “Identify gaps in mobilisation capacity and implement appropriate remedies ahead of the harmonised elections and update cell registers and recruit new members.”  He added: “Ensure that party members identify and familiarise with new boundaries and polling stations following the just-ended delimitation.”  Mnangagwa has said he will proclaim election dates before the end of the month.  -The Standard  Share this: Tweet      Like this: Like Loading...","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnppbWV5ZS5uZXQvMjAyMy8wNS8yMS9pbnRlcm5hbC1tZW1vLWV4cG9zZXMtemFudS1wZi1wbG90LXRvLXVzZS1hcm15LWNpby10by1yaWctcG9sbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2023-07-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T23:59:19","by Rajan Philips  There have been three different elections in as many countries over the last two weeks: Karnataka State Assembly elections in India, presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey, and parliamentary elections in Thailand. In Karnataka, the nationally triumphant BJP suffered a significant state defeat, and the nationally struggling Congress Party registered an outright state victory. Expectations were frustrated in Turkey, but were spectacularly exceeded in Thailand. In Turkey, there were predictions that Kemal Kilicdaroglu of the Republican Peoples Party (CHP founded by Kemal Ataturk), who became the unifying opposition candidate, would win the presidential race in the first round and end the two decade long authoritarian rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But the results were a virtual tie, forcing a runoff election between the two men. In the parliamentary elections, Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won a comfortable majority, which will ensure the AKP’s continuing presence in the echelons of power even if Erdogan were to lose the runoff election on May 28.  The parliamentary election results in Thailand are a stunning boost for democratic parties in Asian countries fighting authoritarian rulers, and for energized Young Turks seeking to get rid of the old political turkeys. Exceeding all expectations, the young and upstart Move Forward Party (MFP) has won 151 of the 500 lower house seats, pushing the well established Pheu Thai Party (PTP) of the exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra into second place with 141 seats. In the biggest surprise, described by many as “a political earthquake,” the incumbent military-backed government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was utterly defeated and relegated to 36 seats. However, under Thailand’s bizarre rule for electing a Prime Minister after a general election that Chan-ocha put in place after capturing power in the 2014 military coup, he could again become Prime Minister.  The bizarre rule is based on Thailand’s bicameral system comprising a lower house of 500 elected members (representing the people) and an upper house of 250 appointed members (mainly representing the army, the monarchy and related vested interests). After an election, the Prime Minister is elected from among candidates nominated by political parties by a joint session of all 750 members the two houses. A party could even nominate a total outsider to be elected as Prime Minister if she/he could cobble together 376 votes from the two houses.  To pre-empt the Prayuth Chan-ocha from canvassing to be PM again, the two leading parties from the polls (MFP and PTP) have formed an alliance of six parties commanding 309 members to nominate MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat as their candidate for Prime Minister. Their total is short of the 376 tally required for majority. However, many members of the upper house have indicated that they will not thwart the will of the people and elect a different nominee as Prime Minister. Nothing is going to be finalized until the Election Commission finalizes the official results within two months, and the two houses are convened for their joint session likely in July.  Demonstration Effects  Turkey is a member of NATO and is an aspirant to join the European Union. Who gets to be its next president will have broader implications for the Middle East, EU and the ongoing standoff between the West and Russia including the war over Ukraine. The Thai elections have no comparable geopolitical implications, but can have what political scientists call the ‘demonstration effect’ in Asian countries where elections are being delayed, denied, or otherwise manipulated. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are two (South) Asian countries where unelected governments are shy of calling elections. In Pakistan, the government went a step further and tried to imprison its principal opponent, Imran Khan. The move, as I wrote last week, backfired spectacularly.  In Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe has delayed local government elections by withholding funds in spite of a Supreme Court directive to make funds available. He has been floating balloons of national reconciliation, inspiring rumours about staggered provincial elections, and firing and hiring provincial governors at presidential pleasure. Even the usually pliant Tamil political parties have gotten sick of his games and have given their twin ultimatums: Either a new constitution Or new elections. The first will go nowhere, and the second will add to the common chorus. The President has two other election cards to play, not to advance democracy or people’s participation but to cement his power pedestal that he has had delivered to him quite fortuitously, but under dire and trying circumstances for the country.  The President is not interested in calling a parliamentary election even though he is empowered to do it anytime now, but he wants an early presidential election which he is not permitted to do as an unelected interim president. Hence, the impetus for yet another self-serving constitutional amendment to enable himself to call an early presidential election at the time of his convenient choosing, and fulfill at long last his lifelong ambition to become an elected president. And this from a man who for a whole decade has been promising the abolishing of the executive presidency. Even the national emergency of an economic bankruptcy is not enough to make a Sri Lankan politician do something other than going back on his word.  The two main opposition parties, the SJB and the JVP-led NPP, are either stuck like rabbits caught in the headlights of the presidential limousine, or are playing catchup after the President’s every dodgy move. Neither Party can take the fight to the President the way Imran Khan is doing it to his government in Pakistan. The Sri Lankan President is shrewd enough not to give the opposition any opening. Unlike in Pakistan or Thailand, the Sri Lankan government is not a military-backed government. Rather, Sri Lanka has a military that is backed by the government. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa tried to make the government an employment exchange for the army providing all manner of work to the soldiers – from street beautification after the war to healthcare monitoring after the pandemic. President Wickremesinghe is putting the army in its place – not to clean streets, but to protect him from protesters.  Anura and Harini  The JVP/NPP put all its eggs in the local elections basket, and they are left to freeze after the President took them out of the incubator and put them in cold storage. Now the JVP/NPP is waiting for the president to drop the election shoe, not knowing which shoe will come down first – provincial, parliamentary or presidential. Even so, the JVP and its NPP alliance could draw inspiration from the Thai election results and prepare themselves in the specific circumstances in Sri Lanka to face whichever election that may come first.  In Thailand, the leader of the Move Forward Party, Pita Limjaroenrat, is a 42 year old technocrat and businessman with significant business and political family connections. Paetongtarn Shinawatra who leads the Pheu Thai Party is the 36 year daughter and niece of two former Prime Ministers – Thaksin Shinawatra (now in exile) and his brother Yingluck Shinawatra. Marching separately and now striking together, they have galvanized a nation to call out and send home a military government and are promising to implement significant institutional reforms that will not spare even the sacred cow of the monarchy.  Political pedigrees are not always necessary and, more often than not, may not be helpful and can even be a political millstone. Just look at Sajith Premadasa and the Rajapaksa boys. For that matter at Rahul Gandhi in India. The JVP’s pedigree that still puts off many people, and one that its media detractors will never stop dragging to the front, is totally political and not at all biological. While Anura Kumara Dissanayake has proved himself to be a worthy leader of the organization and is today the only frontline leader for the progressive forces, he does not seem to have been able to fully exorcise the violent legacies of 1971 and 1988. And even though the JVP/NPP has expanded its social base to include urban middle classes, it is still found to be wanting in its economic capabilities despite its well-rehearsed forays into business forums.  It is not that the UNP or the SLFP, never mind the SLPP, had sound economic platforms when they were launched as political parties, but they had buy-in from representative sections of the business classes. Conversely and equally, Sri Lanka’s business classes showed their economic ignorance when they flocked behind Gotabaya Rajapaksa as their business saviour.  It would be impossible for a Left political party to win the fulsome support of the business community now or ever. However, from the standpoint of political electability the JVP cannot afford to scare away voters by appearing to be dogmatically stubborn. And from a popularity standpoint, the delaying of the local elections may have contributed to a plateauing of the people’s support for JVP/NPP and their platforms. Put another way, Anura Kumara Dissanayake himself may have peaked to his full potential even before any election has been called. That is coincidental benefit for Ranil Wickremesinghe.  So, here is my wild card prospecting. What if the JVP/NPP, instead of waiting for President Wickremesinghe to drop his preferred election shoe, or writ, take its own initiative and campaign vigorously and continuously for any and all elections? In addition, why cannot the JVP/NPP boldly present new political leadership faces to a country that has been tired sick of seeing the same Ranil-Rajapaksa faces for over 25 years? It can present its leaders for provincial councils from among young professionals and dedicated activists who live in the provinces and are not party hacks in Colombo. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has proven himself to be an accomplished parliamentarian, not to the same lofty heights as NM Perera, but very high indeed by today’s parliamentary standards. He is the obvious choice and should be the JVP/NPP’s candidate for Prime Minister in a parliamentary election.  As for the presidential candidate to square off against Ranil Wickremesinghe, who seems to be all convinced in his own calculations that he can finally pull off victory in a presidential election, why not shock him by presenting Harini Amarasuriya as the JVP/NPP presidential candidate? One would hope that she would be agreeable to undertaking the challenge. There can be no doubt whatsoever that her candidacy will pleasantly surprise the country and that it will be well received.  Dr. Amarasuriya is obviously more qualified than most of her predecessors, and most of all she would bring to the job what none of her predecessors would or could have brought: honesty, sincerity, commitment and trustworthiness. Given the JVP/NPP’s commitment to abolish the elected executive presidency, Dr. Amarasuriya would be the most disinterested and electable candidate who could be trusted to deliver on the promise of abolishment. That would set up an illuminating contrast to the opaque untrustworthiness of Ranil Wickremesinghe. It will be an electoral battle worth having. The country deserves it and needs it. And there is inspiration from Thailand to make it happen.  Sajith and Rahul  If the JVP/NPP could look to the Young Turks in Thailand for electoral inspiration, Sajith Premadasa could turn to Rahul Gandhi to build hopes about political revival. Rahul Gandhi had failed to make a mark as a rising Congress leader even before Narendra Modi became India’s Prime Minister. After becoming Prime Minister, Modi set about erasing Rahul Gandhi as a political marker of any kind. He even got his attack dogs to use the devise the defamation to get the courts to find Rahul Gandhi liable for a stupid joke at the Modi name and then used the legal verdict to remove Mr. Gandhi from parliament.  The dynamic between Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) are not at all comparable to the antagonism between Modi and Gandhi. The Ranil-Sajith tussle has always been an internal party matter, with each side trying to score same-side goals, until Sajith broke loose and set up the SJB. The young Premadasa’s failure to establish himself as the undisputed leader of the UNP formation is more due to his own limitations than can be attributed to RW’s machinations. Not that the latter has not been up to them in more ways than one, but an abler politician than Sajith Premadasa would have turned the tables on Ranil Wickremesinghe a long time ago. It is the same sense of limitations that one has about Rahul Gandhi in India.  In the Sri Lankan context, it is objectively possible to see a path forward and to power for the JVP/NPP. Whether they will actually achieve something worthwhile is a different question. My point is that, at least for this writer, it is not possible to see a path forward for Sajith Premadasa. That does not mean there is no path for him or that he will never find one. My charitable suggestion is that Mr. Premadasa could build up hopes for his future in Sri Lanka from the Karnataka state elections and the outright victory for the Congress which has also been a great moral booster for Rahul Gandhi. A final word on the Karnataka results – the BJP’s significant defeat and the Congress’s even more significant victory.  The Congress won 135 of the 224 Assembly seats, a gain of 55 seats from the 80 seats it won in 2018. The BJP was hoping to be the first incumbent government in Karnataka to win reelection, but ended with 66 seats, losing 38 seats from the 104 it won last time. The size of the loss looms larger because of the size of the effort that the BJP expended in this election – fully utilizing its double-engine (central and state) government resources, exploiting Hindutva sentiments and inter-caste competitiveness, and steamrolling the State with the well-oiled Modi campaign juggernaut. The setback in Karnataka reinforces the BJP’s failure to establish a political stronghold in the southern states. West Bengal in the east has been equally unwelcome to the BJP as the south.  The Congress’s impressive show, within five months of winning the State election in Himachal Pradesh, is not only a great booster for the Congress in the electoral battles ahead, but also a warning to the BJP of its increasing vulnerabilities in even the northern and western states of India. While the Lok Sabha elections are due in 2024, there will be more state elections this year in three other states – Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. The Congress won in all three of them in 2018, and will be looking for repeats this year. The Karnataka success will feed into even greater optimism for the fortunes of the Congress Party and the political future of Rahul Gandhi.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHA6Ly9pc2xhbmQubGsva2FybmF0YWthLXRoYWlsYW5kLWFuZC10dXJrZXktZWxlY3Rpb24tbGVzc29ucy1hbmQtcHJlc2lkZW50aWFsLXByb3NwZWN0aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-07-24","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T05:00:00","Big Read  As Labour gears up for its biggest fundraising effort in a decade, i can reveal the wealthy businessman who the party believes can help them win over more rich financial backers to help them build up a pre-election war chest.  Gary Lubner, the outgoing boss of Autoglass owner Belron, has already put his money where his mouth as a Labour donor.  Last year the South African gifted £142,000 to the party and he is expected to become an even more significant player in the Labour’s finances in the run up to the next year’s general election.  According to those close to Lubner, there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of further donations.  One of his first two donations to Labour is already being put to good use, with £42,000 paying for a member of staff in the office of shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.  But his most valuable contribution to the cause may not be financial at all, but his ability to help persuade other significant players to follow his lead and back Sir Keir Starmer’s bid for power.  “Gary is one person to keep an eye on,” said a Labour source. “He’s going to be playing a significant role in the near future.”  Sources close to Lubner, stress that this role will not amount to a formal fundraising position within the party. But they are clear about his future commitment.  The fact that Lubner is Jewish is also a coup for Labour, which is still dealing with the fall-out from its anti-Semitism problem during the Jeremy Corbyn years.  “I’m not going to pretend the Jewish business community has opened its arms to us and that’s understandable,” said a Labour insider. “It has been a sensitive and difficult long road to even get back on, but we are at least back on that road and making some progress. It’s understandably hard, but we are seeing some positive signs.”  Other high-profile Jewish businesspeople are also showing an interest in Labour again, including City lawyer Ian Rosenblatt, who previously said that Corbyn had “toxified the Labour Party and wasn’t interested in people like me”.  Rosenblatt returned to the party with three donations totalling to £9,700 last year.  But perhaps the biggest sign that Labour may have a hope of winning back support from the Jewish community is the return to the fold of Jonathan Goldstein.  The former Jewish Leadership Council chairman and property investor, who was one of the main speakers at the Enough Is Enough demonstration against anti-Semitism in the party, now believes that the backers of the Blair and Brown governments are returning to Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.  Goldstein, who also is a co-owner of Chelsea FC, provided a public display of support for Starmer after inviting the Labour leader into the directors’ box at Stamford Bridge.  This comes against a wider backdrop of success in the battle to get business behind Labour. As the Conservative Party money machine continues to bank piles of cash for CCHQ, Labour believes it has finally convinced people that the Corbyn days are behind it, and it is a business-friendly option for the big donors once again.  Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow business minister, told i: “It’s fair to say we have as much interest from big business in the Labour Party as we had in 1997 and 2001.”  However, Reynolds believes that in some ways Starmer’s party is better placed that Blair’s New Labour at this point in the electoral cycle.  “The difference is, in 1997 the party had to persuade business that Labour could be trusted,” Reynolds said. “This time businesses are coming to us saying they share our philosophy on workers’ rights, the environment as well as the business landscape.  “After the chaos of the last 13 years business is excited about the opportunity and stability a Labour government will provide.”  Other senior Labour insiders are also displaying a confidence on winning over big business not seen since those New Labour days, and there is evidence that this is not just wishful thinking.  A concrete success is the return to Labour of one of the UK’s largest political donors, Lord Sainsbury. Having backed the Liberal Democrats anti-Brexit stance in 2019 with a record £8m donation, the former supermarket magnate gave Labour £2m in February, his first multi-million gift to the party since 2016.  And there was further evidence of Labour success at last autumn’s party conference, when it sold out its ‘Business Day’ for the first time since 2010, and ministers like Reynolds now have a diary crammed full of breakfast meeting with multi-national bosses.  The Labour insider told i: “There’s a genuine desire on behalf of senior shadow cabinet members to engage with business leaders, not just because they know it’s politically sensible but because they recognise the scale of the task they will be up against if Labour win.  “The solutions to the challenges the country faces can only be solved by a genuine partnership between business and the next government.  “Leading figures want a dialogue with the private sector to road test policies that will work. There is also a recognition that public services cannot be repaired and revitalised without the taxes that are generated by wealth creation.”  With the return of big private backers, Labour’s reliance on the unions is also being reduced, and, therefore, the influence they can exert over the party.  But there is always the danger that more donations from the super-rich will also bring more controversy. One area with potential to raise eyebrows is Labour’s efforts to get brewing giant Greene King on board the Starmer election train. i understands the party has been courting the company for some months, and with some success.  But such a move may leave the party vulnerable to claims that Starmer is cosying up to China, given that Greene King’s owner is Chinese conglomerate CK Asset Holdings, a company founded by multi-billionaire Li Ka Shing.  Li retired from the day-to-day management of the company in 2018, passing responsibility for his $100bn empire to his son Victor Li.  In February Reeves said that she believed the UK remained “too over-reliant on China” and that national security “has always got to come first — whether on telecommunications or energy.”  Labour’s schmoozing of Greene King might suggest some double standards on Reeves’ part, especially given that its ultimate Chinese owner has global telecommunication interests.  The group is also a major buyer of London property, which could cause some awkward issues around Starmer’s policy to prevent overseas buyers from dominating investment in the UK residential market.  With the return of the likes of Sainsbury, Labour believes it is on course to return to the funding levels it enjoyed under Blair.  In the run-up to the 1997, when Labour return to power for the first time in 18 years with a landslide, Labour clawed in £7.3m in donations, or the equivalent of £13.4m today. That was enough to eject John Major from Downing Street, despite the Conservative attracting £13.1m in funding, or £24m today.  Both parties suffered big hits in the run-up to Boris Johnson’s “get Brexit done” general election campaign in December 2019, largely due to it coming just two years after the 2017 poll.  Under Corbyn, Labour banked just £5.4m (£6.4m today) compared to the Tory’s £19.4m (£23.2m today).  As we head towards the next general election, which is widely expected at some point in the second half of next year, Labour believes it is set to close that gap on the Conservative Party significantly.  If the latest available figures are anything to go by, then Labour’s claim is not a wild one. During 2022 Starmer pulled in £7.2m of donations compared to £4.9m for the Conservatives. The Lib Dems were some way behind on £1.4m, while the Scottish National Party attracted just £538,339.  In all, political parties across the UK attracted £51.5m in donations last year, with Labour benefitting in the final three months of 2022 particular as donors turned away from the chaos of the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss premierships.  The Tories, however, are confident the figures will show a shift back in their direction when the Electoral Commission publishes the latest numbers for the first quarter of this year next month.  The Conservatives are poised to post more than £10m in donations during the three months to the end of March, which party officials believe is evidence that their latest Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has calmed nerves both within the party and among former donors.  As for the Lib Dems, a return to the Lord Sainsbury levels of donation is behind them and the party is focusing its funding efforts on its Blue Wall, where it believes it has the best chance of overturning narrow Tory majorities.  From £16m in the run up to the 2019 general election, the party is more likely to attract between £8m and £10m between now and next year’s election, according to one Lib Dem activist.  A Lib Dem source said: “”Donors are recognising the scale of the opportunity for the Lib Dems at the next election and coming forward with significant funding.  “New donors include both disaffected former Conservatives and a large community of new donors from the business community.”  As the scramble for every penny from every potential political donor heats up, Labour may be boosting its fortunes, but with that will come extra scrutiny on where that cash is coming from.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9leC1hdXRvZ2xhc3MtdHljb29uLWhlbHBpbmcta2Vpci1zdGFybWVyLXdvby1yaWNoLWZ1bmQtMjM1MjEzMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-10-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T04:32:32","Introduction  In last week’s episode, we wondered whether Interim governments are coups in disguise; discussed the Nigeria experience with interim governments; asked ‘What is an interim government? and examined ‘Factors that necessitate interim governments’. In today’s edition, we conclude our discussion of ‘Factors that necessitate interim governments; then look at types of interim governments and conclude with an assessment of how well interim governments have worked in our climes such as Afghanistan, Chad and Syria.  Factors that may necessitate interim governments  Interim governments do not just spring forth from the blues in normal circumstances. No. The factors and causes would have been there for long – even if dormant and latent. But it is only the ant that hears the whispers of the sand; just as it is only the worm that knows what is buried in the earth. Vigilant Nigerians had seen these signs long ago. Aare Babalola is one of them. I am one of them. My daily write-ups and frequent television appearances wholly at- test to this. The factors which foster the emergence of interim governments include regime collapse, negotiated agreement, special election or international intervention.  They may arise at a national or sub national level; and can have a myriad of compositions: national, international or mixed; one party or power- sharing, civilian, military or hybrid. Their mandates range from providing or restoring basic state services, to special tasks such as the preparation of a new Constitution or the introduction of economic reforms. It is in the preparation of a new autochthonous and People-driven Constitution that Babalola’s dissertation is situate. Examples of such circumstances, as identified by the Institute for Integrated Transitions include an existing regime dealing with crises – such as severe economic problems, a fracture within the ruling elite, or an invigorated opposition which may transform itself into an Interim government to stave off its demise or provide more political space to work towards longer-term recovery or resolution (e.g Spain 1975- 1976; Indonesia 1998-1998).  Additionally, an international intervention may produce an Interim International Government as a practical means to restart governance af- ter war or dictatorship or a stalled political process (e.g UN Transitional Administration in East Timor 1999-2002). Furthermore, an existing regime and the opposition may reach a peace deal or political settlement, establishing an Interim Government for a specified period (e.g El Salvador 1992-1994; and Nepal 2006-2008).  Types of interim governments  There is the type of Interim Government where an organised power or force over- throws a sitting government and takes over the leadership of the state. This is different from a coup d’etat strictu sensu, because in this case, the regime taking over is only doing so to manage power temporarily, prom- ising to hand over power, properly and as the law of the land recognizes. Wikipedia. org referred to this kind of interim government as “revolutionary provisional government”.  An instance of such interim government would be the case in Chad where when the Head of State died, his son took over government, as against the provisions of the law of the land where the power to lead the state was supposed to devolve on the Speaker of the National Assembly. However, Mahamat Idriss Deby in a bid to take over power had to, through the Army, dissolve the government and the National Assembly to ensure that the speaker did not become the Head of State.  He however promised to hand over power according to provisions of the law after 18 months, thus making his government an interim/provisional government. There is the second type of interim government, where there is set up, a new regime of leadership. However, the previous regime still retains the true power. This was the case with Nigeria when General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, said that he will “step aside”, not even resign. He did appoint an Interim National Government to usher in a proper government in accordance with the Constitution of Nigeria.  General Babangida however retained the Secretary of his government to be the Secretary of the Interim government and the actions of the Interim Government were generally seen to be largely dependent on and not against the interest of General Babangida. Wikipedia. org named this type of Interim government, “Incumbent Provisional Government”. There is the third type of interim government, where obedience and legitimacy in the state are shared between the incumbent interim regime and a regime trying to take over power.  This is the case in Syria where the Interim Government is sharing power with external forces from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Qatar. Wikipedia.org referred to this type of Interim government as “Power Sharing Provisional Government”. Finally, there is the type of Interim government where the power belongs to and is solely managed by an international body, the international community or an external state. Such was the case with the United States in 1776 during the American Revolutionary War when the Continental Congress, a convention of delegates from 13 British colonies on the east coast of North America served as its interim government until it was replaced in 1789 by the United States Congress. (See https: //en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Provisional _ government). Wikipedia.org named this type of interim government as “International Provisional Government”.  How well has interim governments worked in other climates?  As at date, South Sudan, Libya, Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Chad in Africa; Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, and Yemen in Asia; and Belarus in Europe, are the countries currently under an interim government regime. Taking the samples of Afghanistan, Chad and Syria, let us analyse how interim governments have performed.  Afghanistan  Matthew Saul in an article, “International Law and the Legitimacy of Interim Governments”, (see page 14; International Law and the Legitimacy of Interim Governments by Matthew Saul, https://papers.ssrn.com/ sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2715703) – pointed out the issues with the interim government of Afghanistan. He stated thus, “…certainly, the lack of security in Afghanistan has been a major hindrance in the development of a productive public sphere and the government has been keen to justify some of its constraining activity on the security situation. Consider, for instance, the decree that all news agencies ‘refrain from covering incidents of “terrorist activities or movements” between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day,’ a ban enforced by National Directorate of Security (NDS) officials. …  This suggests that it might have been a measure that has been motivated by the government trying to sustain its own authority, by reducing knowledge of events that bring into question the credibility of the election process.” Matthew makes the very disturbing insinuation that interim governments are in an unending struggle to assert and justify their legitimacy. Yes, indeed. After all, the fall of a dried leaf is a warning to the green one.  Chad  As published by Al Jazeera on 20th April, 2021. (See https://www.aljazeera.com/ news/2021/4/20/chads-military-announces-new-interim-government-after- deby-death); and on 13th October, 2022; and (https: //www. africanews. Com /2022 /10/13/chad-new-interimprime-minister- vows-freedoms rights/), in Chad, even as it is today, the government which came into force in the guise of an interim regime to hand over to a Republican government after 18 months, counting from April 2021, is still in force till date. Now the question is, who now has the right, authority, and requisite power at this material time to bring this government to book? Should Chadians not regret ever having this interim regime in the first place? Which rat will now bell the cat? That is the question.  Syria  Middleeasteye.net.(Seehttps://www. middleeasteye.net/features/syria-interim- government-waiting) has painted a gloomy picture of the state of Syria under an interim government; just as has Al-monitor.com, they both show a country in serious crisis. Though the situation in Syria (being a warring country and one with different power blocks exercising real power across divided parts of the country), is to be expected, it is still the case that its Interim Government has not only suffered major oppositions that bring to jeopardy its control of the state, but is also in search of its own legitimacy the very foundation of a government. A cockroach has never been adjudged innocent in the presence of fowls.  Conclusion  The above scenarios have shown that IG is no longer in vogue. But, a final warning for those “politricians” messing up our hard- earned democracy: they must now move swiftly, deliberately, to save this pseudo democracy we are operating and turn it into full-blown democracy. This is because, if a snake chooses to crawl sluggishly like a snail, it will only succeed in making itself food for the hawk.  Now this  It will however be unrealistic in the present circumstances to expect “politricians” (the greatest beneficiaries of the last farcical polls) to commit collective class suicide by acquiescing to that idea. The IG idea will garner little or no traction among this most critical base of those who will lose out. It is not only the political class that will lose out, but also the electorate. As the End- SARS riots of 2020 clearly showed, Nigeria’s youths have become increasingly restive, enlightened, and audacious in the fight for their rights. Their righteous indignation is palpable. This once-upon-a-time supposed structureless and amorphous segment of the society has become the rejected stone that has ironically formed the cornerstone of our democracy.  The days of taking the youths for granted by corrupt and unpopular governments are clearly over. An IG which they perceive as antithetical to their interests and aspirations might be the needed signal to spark off another round of mass protests, in a way and manner that may dovetail into ponderous chaos and anarchy. Who knows where that might lead us to? The way forward is to overhaul our abused electoral jurisprudence and change the warped mind-set of our desperate “politricians”. The stubborn fly that refuses to hear the voice of its mother usually accompanies the casket into the grave. The lessons are quite clear to us all. Our elders tell us that if you tell a man a proverb and proceed to interpret it to him, then the dowry paid on his mother’s head becomes a waste. A word is enough for the wise. A stitch in time saves nine. The end.  And this Crack your ribs  Landlord: Akpos, is your father at home? Akpos: No, baba landlord. He said I should tell you he is not at home. Landlord: When will he return? Akpos: He did not tell me, wait, let go and ask him”  Thought for week  “The government is us; we are the government, you and I”. Theodore Roosevelt.

"political coup","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Nairobi"", ""Nairobi"", ""Kenya""}","2023-05-21T05:58:08","Jubilee Party vice- chairman David Murathe (centre), Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni (sec right) among other leaders addressing the media on the upcoming National Delegates Conference ON mAY 11, 2023. [Jenipher Wachie, Standard]  The struggle for the shell that is the Jubilee Party promises to go several notches higher tomorrow, as a faction led by former President Uhuru Kenyatta convenes a national delegates conference (NDC) to kick out rebel party members.  The former president yesterday announced a change of venue for the NDC, moving it to the Ngong’ Racecourse after he was locked out of the Bomas of Kenya, even as the party’s Internal Dispute Resolution Committee (IDRC) suspended the convention.  “Notice is hereby given that the venue of the Jubilee NDC has been moved to Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi. All other details remain as in the notice issued on April 29, 2023,” Uhuru said in a notice published in local dailies yesterday.  In a separate notice, the IDRC suspended the convention pending the determination of a dispute between Uhuru and a faction led by East Africa Legislative Assembly lawmaker Kanini Kega. Kega and others accused the former head of state of violating the party’s constitution in convening the NDC.  The two notices came a day after the Kega-led group expelled vice chairperson David Murathe and secretary-general Jeremiah Kioni.  “The committee found that Kioni is guilty of gross misconduct. Article 14.3.1 states the lack of respect for the organs of the party is indiscipline. No organ of the party was spared by the member in his disregard,” Kega said on Friday as he communicated the expulsion, an action Murathe and Kioni dismissed.  “We don’t pay attention to Kangaroo sittings. The gazetted legal organs of the party are the only ones with the mandate to do certain things as provided for by law,” Kioni responded.  Uhuru plans to use tomorrow’s NDC to stem the coup against his leadership by expelling Kega and Nominated MP Sabina Chege, the rival camp’s party leader, among other rebels who have since aligned themselves with President William Ruto.  Both sides are embroiled in a battle of wits and chances, eyeing the Sh135 million allocation by the National Treasury in the current financial year and the Sh675 million they are entitled to over the next five years.  The scales alternate in favour of both camps at various points. Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu ratified an initial suspension of Murathe and Kioni but the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal quashed the decision.  Nderitu is this week set to render a decision on Uhuru’s suspension as party leader by Kega’s Jubilee, which could only prolong the wrangles within the battered party.  “The manner in which the party leader conducted himself in issuing notices for the NEC and NDC meetings was improper and constituted misconduct on his part,” Kega said in a letter to the RPP dated May 4. Uhuru’s wing also wrote to Nderitu seeking that Kega and Sabina, among others, be deregistered as Jubilee members.  The rebel group have opposed Uhuru’s role, citing the Presidential Retirement Benefits Act that obligates a retired president not to hold office in a political party six months after their last day as president.  Kega also scored when Uhuru’s request for Bomas as their NDC venue was rejected.  On his part, Uhuru has struck hard at those seen as driving his ouster, sacking chairperson Nelson Dzuya and executive director Wambui Gichuru through undated resignation letters they reportedly signed as they were appointed.  He also blocked the rival camp from accessing the party’s new headquarters, forcing them to seek a separate office.  Waves of defections  Besides banking on tomorrow’s NDC, Uhuru is also counting on the success of the bipartisan deliberations between allies of Ruto and Azimio leader Raila Odinga. Among the issues for discussion include preventing interference in political parties, coming amid waves of defections by opposition MPs.  Kega and Sabina and other rebels could lose their seats if their removal is ratified, but the several appeals mechanisms in place could spare them that fate. In 2021, the high court reinstated Isaac Mwaura, a chief administrative secretary in the office of the prime cabinet secretary, as a senator after Jubilee stripped him of membership.  Jubilee is a member of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition party courtesy of an NDC held in March last year, but rebel MPs have lamented poor treatment by their counterparts.  They, for instance, decry their exclusion from the Parliamentary Service Commission and the bipartisan talks. And hence the majority of its elected 29 MPs have crossed the floor to support Ruto.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW5kYXJkbWVkaWEuY28ua2UvcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDAxNDczMzg2L2hpZ2gtc3Rha2VzLWluLWp1YmlsZWUtYXMtdWh1cnVzLWNhbXAtc2V0LWZvci1uZGMtYW1pZC1yZXNpc3RhbmNl0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW5kYXJkbWVkaWEuY28ua2UvYW1wL3BvbGl0aWNzL2FydGljbGUvMjAwMTQ3MzM4Ni9oaWdoLXN0YWtlcy1pbi1qdWJpbGVlLWFzLXVodXJ1cy1jYW1wLXNldC1mb3ItbmRjLWFtaWQtcmVzaXN0YW5jZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When she started coming to the library, she was being dropped and picked up by her father on a scooter daily. Now she is on her own.“I specially learnt how to ride a Scooty just to come here.

"political coup","2019-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","2023-05-20T21:01:06","Gunmen open fire on churchgoers in series of attacks in Sudan  In a series of attacks on places of worship in Sudan, gunmen opened fire on churchgoers before looting a Coptic church and ousting all clergy from another church last weekend, the U.K.-based group Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported.  Six assailants arrived by car and opened fire on four churchgoers, including Priest Arsenius and his son, at Al-Masalma Coptic Church in Omdurman last Saturday, CSW said in a statement, adding that the church’s guard was stabbed during the two-hour looting spree.  The wounded victims, however, have reportedly recuperated following treatment at a private medical facility. Access to the area’s largest hospital remained blocked due to its current occupation by the Rapid Support Forces (formerly known as the Janjaweed militia).  In a separate incident, the RSF ousted all clergy from Mary’s Coptic Orthodox Church, including Bishop Elia of Khartoum and South Sudan, last Sunday.  This forceful eviction was reportedly to convert the church premises into a military base, CSW said, adding that the RSF had allegedly subjected the church to a week-long intimidation campaign before enforcing the eviction.  Earlier, on May 3, a similar incident occurred at the Coptic Church in Khartoum North.  Meanwhile, mosques have not been spared the surging violence, with the Al Zareeba mosque in El Geneina, West Darfur, suffering a bombing on Sunday.  The area, witnessing particularly severe fighting, has seen 280 fatalities and over 160 injuries between May 12-13, according to the Preliminary Committee of the Sudan Doctor’s Trade Union.  Reports also note bombings at mosques in Alazhari and Burri Al Daraisa in Khartoum, leading to a fatality in the latter.  Rival sections of Sudan’s military government — the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces — have been involved in an armed conflict since April 15, leading to skirmishes in several cities. The strife around the capital, Khartoum, and the volatile Darfur region has been most intense.  As the hostilities persist, the casualty count has been alarming. The conflict has claimed the lives of up to 1,000 individuals and caused injuries to thousands of others.  About 200,000 people have fled Sudan, and another 700,000 have been internally displaced by the conflict, according to The Guardian.  In response to the escalating crisis, the United Nations Human Rights Council expanded the mandate of the designated Expert of the High Commissioner on human rights in Sudan last week. The enhanced directive includes a comprehensive assessment and documentation of all purported human rights violations since the military coup of Oct. 25, 2021.  On the same day, SAF and RSF representatives pledged to protect Sudanese civilians, signing a Declaration of Commitment in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The agreement includes provisions for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid, restoring essential services, evacuating military forces from hospitals and ensuring respectful burials for the deceased.  CSW’s Founding President Mervyn Thomas strongly denounced the attacks on religious sites, stating, “The intentional attacks on clergy, the bombing of houses of worship, and seizures of religious buildings for use as military bases violate international human rights and humanitarian law, and are among a litany of violations which may amount to war crimes.”  Thomas commended the signing of the Jeddah commitment but insisted that its adherence was critical. He called for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire and stressed that achieving a peaceful democratic transition was the only effective political solution for Sudan. This, he added, could be accomplished through the promotion and protection of human rights, along with the meaningful involvement of civil society in transition negotiations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvZ3VubWVuLW9wZW4tZmlyZS1vbi1jaHVyY2hnb2Vycy1pbi1zZXJpZXMtb2YtYXR0YWNrcy1pbi1zdWRhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T01:36:12","This post is also available in: Spanish  Nearly two weeks after the election of the Convention of Conventions, with an overwhelming victory for the Chilean ultra-right, I share six reflections with the aim of contributing to the analysis of the political scenario that is opening up for the progressive forces and the left.  1.- The Social Outburst and the Left’s mistake  There is no doubt that the social outburst of October 2019 marks and will continue to mark Chilean politics for a long time to come. This outburst had unusual social energy and the street mobilisations that followed were extraordinarily massive, sweeping away the leadership of the political parties, but also that of the social movements existing to date. No political or social organisation was able to guide or lead this outburst only the pandemic was able to stop. We on the left thought we saw in the outburst a phenomenon of strong questioning of the neoliberal model, in circumstances that, in the light of what has happened subsequently, it seems to have been only the expression of catharsis, tremendous and massive collective anger, but limited to questioning the abuses of the model and not necessarily against its foundations. In other words, the outpouring of October 2019 did not have or did not manage to generate a structural questioning of the neoliberal model, massively and culturally, because it is unquestionable that the parties of the left, the social leadership and many citizens who accompanied the process did have it.  2.- An electoral defeat of the right is not enough to defeat it.  During the pandemic and as a consequence of the October overflow, different electoral processes took place within the constituent process. In all these elections, the left won by a wide margin, achieving the most resounding victory for the election of convention members in 2021, when the new social movements and left-wing parties achieved total control of the Convention, leaving the right in the worst electoral defeat in its history, without any possibility of, influencing or even vetoing. These successive electoral victories generated in us an excessive triumphalism, forgetting that the defeat of the right wing was only electoral, but that it still maintained intact its economic power, a large part of its political power, the totality of its communicational power and, what we have already mentioned, that culturally the neoliberal model was still validated in the great majority of Chileans. This regrettable mistake led some elected Convention members to begin to act irresponsibly, committing several errors and many other horrors, overshadowing the great work of the Convention, which was producing an extraordinary draft Constitution.  3.- Boric’s triumph and the oblivion of the first warning signal  When, on the night of 21 November last year, the votes of the presidential election were finally counted, a shudder ran through all the militants and supporters of the left: José Antonio Kast, the candidate of the ultra-right, had won the first national majority! The nightmare of the return of ‘Pinochettism’ was so great that it overshadowed other equally important data: the three right-wing presidential candidates accounted for 53.49% and in the parliamentary election, the right had elected practically half of the senators and deputies, including an important group of 15 deputies from the ultra-right. A month after, for the second round of elections, Gabriel Boric would win a landslide victory becoming the most-voted President in the history of Chile and then, the feeling of relief of having stopped the far-right, the hope that a new generation of young people in their thirties would govern leaving behind the bad practices of the old politics, spread throughout the country,  forgetting that in the first round, the right had recovered from its electoral defeats, far exceeding its historic vote and, worse still, we overlooked the fact that 45% of voters did not mobilise to vote, despite it being the most polarised election since the return of democracy.  4.- The perfect storm and the triumph of rejectionism  The election of President Boric opened a climate of great hope, but we found a country in a state of total abandonment after the Piñera government. And so, with inflation as high as it had not been seen in decades, with major government mistakes accompanied by several inexcusable blunders by some ministers, with a migration crisis and an escalation of drug trafficking, all very real but cunningly amplified by the media, the plebiscite to approve the excellent draft of the new constitution was transformed by the right into a real plebiscite against the government. To all of the above, we must add the already mentioned irresponsible actions of some Convention members who gave credibility to the virulent smear campaign against the Convention by the media. So, with several Convention members disguised or voting while showering, making incense, or deceiving a whole country with fake cancer, the lies of the right wing and its perverse Fake News spread quickly.  But something else was missing: all the previous elections had been held with a voluntary vote, with an increasing turnout, reaching its peak with a 55% turnout in the second presidential round, which we consider a great success, but which hid a very relevant fact: 45% of voters had not turned out to vote despite the danger of the far right coming to power. On the other hand, for this new election and due to the compulsory vote, this gigantic pocket of depoliticised citizens, surely very angry with an institutionality that does not give them a response to their daily existence, turned out to vote and everything indicates that they did so with a lot of anger, punishing the government. The result of this real perfect storm was resoundingly clear: 62% rejected the proposal for a new constitution, which constituted a serious defeat for the government, for the left with parliamentary expression, but also – it must be said – for the new social and territorial movements that had emerged in the heat of the social outburst of October, that is, a defeat of a strategic, and not circumstantial, nature of the process of transformations, both in its institutional expression and in its social and territorial dimensions.  5.- The new election of convention members and the mistaken response of moderation  After this resounding rejection of the first draft of the new constitution, a second constituent process began, very rigged, insipid and restricted, that is to say, in the opposite sense to the failed previous process. At the same time, the government summoned important public figures from the former Concertación parties to the cabinet, in an attempt to “soften” its image before a citizenry that supposedly sought moderation. And here there is a new mistake: the victory of the “Rejection” of the first draft of the Constitution cannot be read in terms of moderation. As already pointed out, the outburst was the expression of a great collective anger against abuses, which the pandemic had only slowed down in its street expression, but without managing to overcome it. This is aggravated when the hope for change embodied by Boric crashes in the face of all the crises inherited from the Piñera government, the imperfection of his new administration and, worse still, ends up sharing a political address with emblematic figures of the so-called “30 years of abuses”. All of the above added a new ingredient of anger and the mantram “they are all the same”, expressed with rage, spread rapidly and, legitimate or not, the truth is that it became a decisive factor in this new process of electing convention members. So, this new pool of depoliticised voters, who turn out to vote out of obligation, do so with great anger, punishing a whole political class that does not resolve the anguish of daily life, finding in the ultra-right disguised as anti-system, with its discourse of an iron fist, order and anti-immigration, a refuge for their accumulated rage. But the disillusionment and frustration with Boric’s government also generated a significant drain on the left, among those more politicised voters who watched with great astonishment as a transformative government approved the TPP11, the Los Bronces mining project or forgot its campaign promise to resolve the CAE. These voters obviously did not vote for the ultra-right, but expressed their anger through the null or blank vote, which reached an unprecedented 21% of the votes cast.  The final result was again convincing but with some surprises: the political centre, which wanted to represent moderation, failed miserably, achieving a meagre 9%, without electing any of the candidates of the former Concertación, symbols of the 30 years; while the left-wing list achieved an insufficient 28%, electing only 17 councillors. The traditional right, for its part, achieved a meagre 21%, electing only 11 councillors, a real defeat compared to the 35% obtained by the ultra-right and its election of 23 councillors!!!. This result is a real disaster for the left, because the right will have total control of the new convention and the left did not even have the quorum to veto the initiatives imposed by the right. In synthesis: the new constitution will be drafted by the right, with the hegemony of the ultra-right.  6.- A Left without a people is doomed to defeat.  In short, the new election of constitutional councillors showed that the issue is not moderation or the conquest of the centre, because anger does not seek moderation or good intentions, but demands responses for the “HERE and NOW”. There is a need for “fixes”, for protection against the defencelessness of abuses. Hence the failure and the near disappearance of the political centre, because people expect certainty and clarity, not lukewarmness or ambiguity in the face of abusers.  The triumph of the ultra-right represents the failure of the constituent process generated in October 2019 and must be assumed as the failure of the left-wing parties with institutional or parliamentary expression, but also of the expressions coming from the social or territorial world that emerged with the outbreak and that for the first Convention had the certain possibility of becoming a new political-social force protagonist of the process of change, but unfortunately could not do it either. So, the failure belongs to all of us and must be assumed in its profound depth, but without the guilty expression so typical of the Christian substratum; nor in the sterile, childish and endless exercise of passing the buck to each other; nor with the naivety that it is a simple stumble that will quickly be overcome.  The failure is extensive and profound, as it is great the fear that in three more years, we will be governed by a hate-filled, xenophobic, misogynist and coup-mongering ultra-right. But our greatest failure was revealed by the compulsory vote, which mobilised 45% of new voters, a gigantic number of citizens coming mainly from the middle and popular sectors, as all studies of the so-called “class bias” have shown for the voluntary vote. In other words, a huge segment of voters who make up an important part of the people that all lefts, both institutional and social and territorial, invoke and aspire to represent. But to say that we lost the last two elections as a result of compulsory voting is an absurdity only comparable to the joke of “Don Otto’s armchair”. Compulsory voting simply revealed that we on the left have abandoned our roots and territories, in a process that began in the 1990s. If in the 1980s, in every village or town, trade union, factory, faculty or university, we found several cells, bases or nuclei of left-wing parties, together with the worker priest, doing political pedagogy in the social base; 40 years after, in the popular sectors we find only evangelical pastors linked to the right and drug lords offering help for the sick and funerals, and an absent left, preoccupied with the journalistic wedge and not with the humble work in the social base.  A left-wing government without a popular base to support it is condemned to move to the rhythm of the media agendas of the right, to the blackmail of the correlation of forces in parliament and to the extortion of the economic groups. If in the eighties we sang “defeat is always brief”, as compensation for the long night of the dictatorship, today we must understand that we still have time to avoid another defeat, which, if it happens, will unfortunately not be brief, and that to avoid it we must accept the failure of all of us, understand that nobody is a leftover, neither the institutional parties nor the social or territorial leadership and that our imperative mission is to reconquer the social base, because a left without people is doomed to fail.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZW56YS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9jaGlsZS1hLWxlZnQtd2l0aG91dC10aGUtcGVvcGxlLWlzLWRvb21lZC10by1mYWlsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The veteran actor won an Oscar for his role as real-life despot Idi Amin in the 2006 film The Last King of Scotland, which co-starred Glasgow-born James McAvoy.  Amin, who served as president of Uganda for eight years after leading a military coup in 1971, bizarrely claimed at the height of his notoriety to be the uncrowned monarch of Scotland.  Speaking yesterday, Whitaker said: ‘I didn’t do anything with Idi Amin that was in Scotland [in the film].  ‘It was just a shot, I think at the beginning, where James jumps into the river.  Actor Forest Whitaker, 61, was in Edinburgh to receive a £500,000 cheque for his charity, the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative (WPDI)  He won an Oscar for his role in the 2006 film The Last King of Scotland but this was his first visit to the country  ‘So for me it’s exciting to be here, you know. It’s a touch of magic, I guess.’  The 61-year-old was in Edinburgh to pick up a £500,000 cheque for his charity, the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative (WPDI), after being named Postcode Hero by the People’s Postcode Lottery at its 13th annual gala.  The WPDI, which was founded in 2012, runs courses on conflict resolution across Africa and other global locations.  Describing how he studied Amin’s paranoia for the film role, Whitaker said: ‘Once you understand all those things, all of a sudden the character’s not dark - he’s not all evil.  ‘He has his own fears and problems and you try to uncover them.  ‘It doesn’t mean that the deeds he did weren’t horrific because they were.’  Amin, who died in 2003, was rumoured to be a cannibal and reportedly boasted of keeping the heads of murdered political rivals in a freezer.  Part of his self-bestowed title declared he was ‘Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular’.  Whitaker was awarded the cheque after he had been named Postcode Hero by the People’s Postcode Lottery at its 13th annual gala  He spoke to broadcaster Clive Myrie on stage at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre during the People's Postcode Lottery Charity Gala  His charity, the WPDI, which was founded in 2012, runs courses on conflict resolution across Africa and other global locations  The award-winning actor, pictured in Edinburgh, said his first trip to Scotland was 'a touch of magic'  Texas-born Whitaker made his debut in the comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High and later screen credits include Platoon, The Crying Game and Good Morning, Vietnam.  He has also appeared as Saw Gerrera in the Star Wars series of films.  Last year, Forest Whitaker was the proud recipient of one of the most prestigious awards in the film industry - the honorary Palme d'Or.  The award pays tribute to a sparkling artistic journey, a rare personality as well as a discreet but strong humanitarian commitment to key topical issues, according to the Festival de Cannes.  The Academy Award-winning actor received the accolade from French journalist Pierre Lescure during the opening ceremony for the 75th Annual Cannes Film Festival, held at Palais des Festivals.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIxMDYyMjkvQWN0b3ItRm9yZXN0LVdoaXRha2VyLXNldHMtZm9vdC1TY290bGFuZC1uZWFybHktMjAteWVhcnMtcG9ydHJheWluZy1LaW5nLmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMTA2MjI5L2FtcC9BY3Rvci1Gb3Jlc3QtV2hpdGFrZXItc2V0cy1mb290LVNjb3RsYW5kLW5lYXJseS0yMC15ZWFycy1wb3J0cmF5aW5nLUtpbmcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2017-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Shurugwi"", ""Midlands"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-21T03:31:49","Temba Mliswa in conversation with Trevor Ncube recently  Independent legislator Temba Mliswa says President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government has failed to live up to expectations following the coup that toppled long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017.  Mliswa (TM), who is the MP for Norton and a vocal supporter of the military putsch, told Alpha Media Holdings chairman Trevor Ncube (TN) on the platform In Conversation with Trevor that Mnangagwa’s regime has “betrayed the people of this country” by failing to fulfil promises made during the coup.  Below are excerpts from the interview.  TN: Temba Mliswa, welcome to In Conversation With Trevor.  TM: Yes. And before I proceed, on a point of order Mr Speaker Sir, my name is Temba Peter Mliswa.  Temba meaning trust. I am the first boy in the family, and Peter the Rock in the Bible.  Muyera Shumba, Soko-Ncube on paternal side of my grandmother, and on the maternal side Moyo ndiSekuru, Nyathi is where my mother came from.  TN: You are my muzukuru hey?  TM: Yes indeed.  TN: Peter I discovered is your Dad, and was an ex-combatant? Talk to me about your Dad Peter?  TM: My father left this country; born in Shurugwi, my grandfather was a village head and went to the same school with Tongogara, Gamwa area, and worked a lot with Zapu.  In fact, from what most of the ex-combatants tell me, especially the late S.K. Moyo, and the current ambassador Mutinhiri, was that he (my Dad) was well-liked and favoured by the late Joshua Nkomo, and after the struggle he decided not to be involved in politics.  He then worked at Zimoco, which was owned by Tiny Rollins' Lonhro in those days, so he preferred to do that.  He was very active in terms of supporting a lot, not only that but funny enough he also used to accommodate Robson Manyika, because Robson Manyika’s eldest brother, the late James Manyika who's the father to James was married to my father's sister...  TN: All right.  TM: Yeah. Tete Margaret.  So he did accommodate them as well.  So, it was a family which was exposed to a number of liberators of this country, and Zambia was very kind to Zpra as you know it, was up with a strong relationship and as a result we were all born there, we only came back to this country after in the independence.  TN: The place that you occupy Temba is an interesting one.  Independent, not a member of Zanu PF, you were kicked out of Zanu PF and so forth.  Talk to me about that space before we discuss your leaving Zanu PF?  What is it like being in that space? Not belonging to the opposition per se? Not belonging to Zanu PF? Talk to me about that space?  TM: My major agenda for going into politics was for our generation to be represented.  I sat down with my friends whom I grew up with, and said I would like to go into politics and they were against it.  They said you cannot, it is dirty, there is fighting, there is violence, and I said it is not about that.  It is about us as a generation taking a position, being in the corridors of power, and that is the only way we can build the country.  They said good luck if you are going to make it, and I did get into politics myself, because from a generational point of view I saw a gap.  What also prompted me to make that decision was that your generation and many others did not want to be involved in politics. I must be very clear.  TN: Yeah.  TM: You actually let us down, your generation let us down, because you were supposed to pass the baton to us, but we never saw it coming.  We were busy waiting for it but it did not come, and I said no, we need to go and grab it ourselves, we need to be part of this, and pass it to another generation, which I believe is critical for any nation to grow, because a certain generation has a certain understanding of things as they evolve, as things change. You know there is the digitalisation happening, the ICT world.  So how do you fit into the global village when you have a generation, which was never exposed to that.  So it was about also speaking to the truth, being honest and being able to represent people.  Zanu PF ideology remains critical for any Zimbabwean, but at the same time you know you cannot also go against your ideology. I was involved in sport as you know, and I was well supported by the government in making sure that the white- dominated sports like cricket and rugby would go back to the whites and that government was very supportive...  TN: Go back to the black people rather?  TM: Yes. It was pro-black, because the whole idea is that how then do we get the blacks to be part of this minority sport?  So, in a way I took a decision to have knowledge so that I could impart it on to the people in the high-density areas.  I did not see a white man being able to go there, it would have been difficult, they would be misunderstood, they would have difficulties even pronouncing the names of the people, which ultimately does not make somebody feel well.  So, I decided to cover that and from a sporting perspective we went on to do that.  Sport in a way drove me to the person I am, in that it builds your character at the end of the day.  Rugby is one-character building sport, after tackling each other so hard which is the only sport where you see true gentlemen who drink together, eat together and there is no bitterness.  I always say soccer players have a lot to learn from these rugby players.  I see them trying to fight, but rugby players who have the muscle, who have everything do not fight, they respect each other.  TN: How is that sport translated into politics into where you are right now because I see you throwing stones, not stones per se, I see you arguing, debating with the people in Nelson Chamisa’s party.  I see you debating with people in Zanu PF. How is that space politically? How do you survive in that space when you do not belong to the big two homes?  TM: You know I was expelled from Zanu PF, and regrettably for misinformation to the president then, when we were called the Gamatox, we were supposedly a cabal which was being led by Cde Joice Mujuru and many other senior members.  I remember nine chairpersons were expelled out of 10 through lies.  I remember going to my uncle Didymus Mutasa saying were you part of the meeting, you were expelled?  He said yes. I said but why did you allow it to happen because you know it is not true, could you not all sit down.  TN: Was he not expelled?  TM: Before he was expelled yes.  I said but could you not sit down and talk about it?  And how did you allow Rugare Gumbo to really be expelled and to leave the party and you are comrades, you are together?  Could you not stand up and defend?  He told me he was shocked, it was the first time he was in shock, he did not see it happening, and as a result he kept quiet, he only remembers Rugare Gumbo walking past him leaving the politburo meeting shaking his hand and saying “Ndaenda Nyathi” on his way out from the politburo.  But I said why could you not?  I then realised we did not have people who were prepared to serve this country by being honest. I was expelled.  I stood in Hurungwe West which was a violent election, I did not want to campaign because people were being beaten up, and there was violence which the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission reported on and said that they had never seen such violence.  There are recommendations which they came up with, then I was chairman of Mashonaland West Province myself.  Then I stood (for Parliament) in Norton. In Norton itself the war veterans themselves were supportive of me.  TN: Because you were an independent?  TM: Yes, I was an independent. I got in, and won the constituency in Norton as an independent, and I actually said it was a blessing in disguise because I could then really be who I am and say the truth and put national interest first, and that's where I think it is the most advanced way of dealing with issues; is to talk about what is happening, to inform people and to stand for what is good for the country.  You now totally separate yourself from party politics, which people believe is more important than national politics.  I have always said to my colleagues the country is first, the political party is not first, the country is first then...  TN: Do you think people get that…the country first then the political party second?  Do you think Zimbabweans get that bit? In the opposition….in the ruling party?  TM: No they do not sadly. 43 years after independence we have an electorate which does not understand politics, which wants to stay away from politics.  Business wants to stay away from politics, but decisions that politicians make have a bearing on you.  I have always said to my colleagues in the private sector, if it is agriculture, if it is in engineering, how many candidates have you sponsored who will do what you do?  Who will advance you from an intellectual point of view…from an understanding of issues?  TN: What response do they give you? I mean that is an important question to businesses.  TM: They are still, you know, in this era of being intimidated, they are scared, and they do not want to talk about it.  TN: Zimbabwean business is scared about politics?  TM: And not only that, they are so dishonest that’s why they do not want to be open about it they still give money to the political parties quietly.  You do not have to give money to the political parties quietly.  TN: Both the ruling party and the opposition?  TM: Yes. They know that the government of the day will give them business, and if they are seen to be talking to the opposition there is a problem, which is something which I think is sad.  TN: What do you think is the effect of that on our governance system?  The timidity of the private sector to stand up to principles and values?  I mean I will take you to South Africa; South Africa changed because Anglo-American decided that they would talk to the ANC even during apartheid.  So the business community has a big role to play in the governance and in our democracy. But what you are saying is that that is not what is happening?  TM: Business in Zimbabwe is full of hypocrites. They have not helped move this country forward economically.  You cannot ignore politics, you have got to be able to be talking to politicians.  Like you said, I know in South Africa the big companies who have the position of a vice president, but that vice president's job is to interact with government, with the politicians, because it is critical.  They actually have that office of a vice president who is responsible for that, but we do not have that.  But the decisions that are made by politicians, the laws which are passed in Parliament affect them.  So the question is that how did you contribute to this? And why then stay away and have a situation where your company closes down to the effect of the ordinary person who suffers?  TN: What if they push back and say no but if we support, rather we are scared that we will lose government business, government contracts?  TM: For me if it is about principles, morals and values, so be it.  Why should you be in a country and be in business at the mercy of a government?  You must be in business because the government sees your role in building it.  The corporates themselves must be able to be very clear with government that if there are certain laws that you are passing and are not conducive for a business to thrive we will certainly close.  I think during the Mugabe time business had got to that stage.  In the second republic I expect the second republic to be more accommodating, but it seems the second republic is on a cold war, which is even more dangerous.  TN: With the private sector?  TM: Ultimately human rights, private sector, and all that. Yet they must be embracing and saying this is the second republic, this is what will happen, do what you have to do promote your business.  TN: Why do you think Mnangagwa’s Government is on this cold war as you say?  TM: Because they came up with the mantra of Zimbabwe's open for business...  They came up with a mantra that would be inclusive, and they have not been able to do that and they have betrayed the people of this country.  17 November 2017 everyone world over supported the change which would see Zimbabwe being a better nation and in anticipation.  Is the anticipation what it is now? No. You have got people who have been persecuted for no reason.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvLnp3L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDAwMTE4NTMvaW4tY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLXdpdGgtdHJldm9yLW1saXN3YS10aGV5LWhhdmUtYmV0cmF5ZWQtdGhlLXBlb3BsZdIBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzZGF5LmNvLnp3L3RoZXN0YW5kYXJkL2FtcC9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvMjAwMDExODUzL2luLWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi13aXRoLXRyZXZvci1tbGlzd2EtdGhleS1oYXZlLWJldHJheWVkLXRoZS1wZW9wbGU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite being on a peacemaking trip in Hanoi, Vietnam, regarding the Vietnam War, Dr. Nkrumah's government was overthrown by the National Liberation Council in a coup d'état known as ""Operation Cold Chop.""    Reacting to his overthrow in a passionate speech published years later by Freedom Fighters on Facebook. Dr. Nkrumah vehemently rejected the claims made by those who had overthrown his government.    He called their assertions that Ghana was bankrupt and drowning in debt to the tune of 240 million pounds ""stupid lies"" and criticized their ignorance in assuming that the people would believe such falsehoods.    Dr. Nkrumah urged the people to open their eyes and witness the tangible progress achieved under the leadership of the Convention People's Party and its government.    He invited them to see the magnificent Tema Harbour, the mighty Volta Dam, the well-built roads, the schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, and the emerging factories. To him, these were not burdensome debts but rather investments in Ghana's future as an independent nation.    With conviction and determination, Dr. Nkrumah emphasized that these physical achievements were the guarantees of the bright, new future he had promised and worked for.    He called for unity and self-reliance, encouraging Ghanaians to create what they needed rather than relying on charity handouts from foreign powers who sought to exploit them and make them vassals to their interests.    Acknowledging the hardships and struggles faced by the people, Dr. Nkrumah assured them that he had never promised an easy road to independence. He respected their intelligence, their capacity for hard work, their pride, and their sense of national dignity.    The traitors and conspirators, whom he branded as liars and cheaters, were attempting to undermine Ghana's political and economic independence.    Dr. Nkrumah also highlighted the irony of their actions, as just a month before the coup, Ghana had been on the brink of a new victory with the signing of an agreement to irrigate the Accra Drains.    Dr. Nkrumah further drew attention to Ghana's historical role as a haven for the oppressed in Africa, emphasizing that it was a source of pride rather than shame. He spoke of the country's support for freedom fighters and its staunch opposition to colonialism, which had earned Ghana the reverence of oppressed individuals across the African continent.    Despite his overthrow, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah's unwavering commitment to Ghana's progress and his belief in the potential of the Ghanaian people were evident in his speech. He rallied his fellow countrymen to stand strong in the face of adversity and work towards securing both political and economic independence.    The legacy of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as a visionary leader and advocate for African liberation continues to inspire generations. While the coup marked a setback in Ghana's history, his words serve as a reminder of the importance of unity, self-reliance, and unwavering determination in the pursuit of a prosperous and independent nation.

Pablo Iglesias spoke thus in an act of support for United We Can’s candidates for the presidency of the Balearic Government, Mallorca Council and Palma City Council, Antonia Jover, Iván Sevillano and Lucia Muñoz, where he explained how “right in Madrid found that crushing Podemos was the key to restoring and maintaining its power.”  In this sense, he cautions that “the reason why they have ETA in their mouths all day is not because they are insane, but rather it responds to a very precise strategy that they have established in recent years in their work laboratory”. Madrid, because that is precisely where it has its main assets, not only political, but also media, judicial and economic, to strengthen the maintenance of an ultra-reactionary power”.  And, Iglesias has continued, “they have a very similar approach with respect to the rest of the state.” That is why, as he has said, “Bildu and the Catalan libertarians care a lot”, because they are “an excuse” to show that they have found that Podemos is “a double whammy, a mush of alternative state institutional power”. ” which existed in the political system of 78″. “The rise of Podemos is a permanent reminder that Spain is not Madrid,” he insisted.  For this reason, he said, “the elections on May 28 are much more than municipal and regional elections. On the contrary, they are an important stage in the reconstruction of political power in the state as a whole.”  “Is Spain just Madrid?” Pablo Iglesias asked the attendees. “What does Feiju look like? Maybe he knows that Spain is not Madrid, but certainly he has verified that Spain has nothing to do with Galicia. This gentleman has discovered that if Pablo Casado is stabbed may be handed his head on a silver platter, Madrid’s media, economic and mafioso powers will do exactly that to him”.  Madrid, he denounced, “is the enclave where no journalist dares to put a face or ask questions to a businessman who has received bribes of more than half a million euros as mask commissioner, while hundreds of elderly people are dying in a In the midst of the epidemic. It was the brother of President Ayuso and with the Mafia, in Madrid, no one dared”.  “Regarding the political murder of Pablo Casado, what did it mean that the right wing handed over his head from a window in Genoa? They said: who dares to question the right wing mafia here in Madrid,” he said.  “What is the other problem they have with Podemos?”, he pointed out, “that it is ideological and anti-class. The businessman, even if he is an exploiter, you have to suck it up”.  Finally, Iglesias quoted Ioan Belarra, the current general secretary of Podemos, who said that “Podemos is not here just to say very left-wing things, it is to do them.”  “Not only do we respond to our PSOE comrades who say that housing is a market good, as Abalos said, we are here to push forward a housing law that centers the main class struggle of our time , because housing keeps those who only have a mortgage or salary to pay rent compared to a privileged minority who are basically banks or investment funds who only have it unproductively at the expense of the country To prosper is his property, and that, in Spain, with co-governmental responsibilities, only Podemos says so”, he has had influence.  For all this, according to Iglesias, “the right is obsessed with crushing Podemos, and that is why the vote for this formation on 28 May is a clear message to the Madrid right: you are not going to impose the whole of the state on you.” What are you”, he sentenced.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3dvcmxkbmF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vaWdsZXNpYXMtY3JpdGljaXplcy10aGUtbWFkcmlkaXphdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtcmlnaHQtd2luZy1hbmQtd2FybnMtdGhhdC1mcm9tLW1hZHJpZC10aGV5LWFyZS1wcmVwYXJpbmctYS1jb3VwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Pattaya"", ""ChonBuri"", ""Thailand""}","2023-05-21T02:20:07","Nine and a half million foreign visitors have arrived in Thailand so far this year, according to Thai government spokesman Traisuree Taisaranakul, with three million heading direct to Pattaya. The national economy has benefitted to the tune of US$11 billion with Pattaya contributing around one third of that. The Bank of Thailand says it is confident that there will be 28 million arrivals in the entire calendar year, which compares with 40 million in pre-pandemic 2019.        Thai authorities have developed a number of strategies to maximize the influx. Chinese arrivals nationally have been sluggish, because of a shortage of aircraft and delays in issuing new passports by Beijing authorities, but are expected to increase to multiple flights hourly by the end of the summer. Thai immigration is also simplifying the 15-days visa on arrival for Chinese citizens by permitting paperwork to be completed pre-flight. Meanwhile, the nationals of 60 countries, including the UK, the US, most of mainland Europe and Australia, can extend their 30 days visa exempt permission for a further month without having to leave the country.      A spokesperson for the Pattaya Entertainment Collective said night life was more or less back to normal after the pandemic and added there was the additional bonus of cannabis with an obviously blurred distinction between medical and leisure use. The weekends in particular reveal a packed resort with lengthy traffic queues in and around the city center. The main problem for Pattaya employers in the hospitality industry has been finding enough staff, especially in hotels according to the eastern Thailand hoteliers association. Attempts are being made to fill the gap by recruiting more workers from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos with whom the Thai government has Memoranda of Understanding.        “Tourism will be the key pillar supporting our growth this year,” said Thitima Chucherd, an economist at the Siam Commercial Bank. But the threat comes from the May 14 Thai general election. Pro-democracy parties secured the most number of seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, but the votes of the 250 unelected Senators, appointed by the military, will also play a pivotal role on who becomes prime minister.      Although most commentators downplay the prospect of yet another military intervention – it would need to be a strange self-coup as army leaders currently run the country as caretakers – the prospect of a prolonged and bitter parliamentary conflict or an unstable minority government is already worrying investors. “If political tensions spill over into the streets, arrivals growth will slump as in the past two decades,” said Krystal Tan from the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group. Still, if all goes well, a new government will be in office by August.

"political coup","2014-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T00:57:50","    O  ver the past 76 years, Pakistan has oscillated between military authoritarianism and ‘defective’ democracy. Due to the changing nature of many regimes in Asia and Latin America, some political scientists have revisited the conventional conceptual categories and come up with descriptions such as ‘electoral authoritarianism.’ However, issues related to, for example, the conceptualisation of transition from authoritarian rule to democracy continue to puzzle scholars of comparative politics. In the early 2000s, Wolfgang Merkel, a German political scientist, investigated a wide range of experiments with democracy in Europe, Asia and other regions. While disagreeing with categories like ‘electoral democracy,’ Merkel postulated that elections, held even fairly and regularly, do not qualify as a necessary condition for the development and consolidation of democracy cross-culturally because socioeconomic and institutional factors that exist before the conduct of elections are generally overlooked, on the one hand, by political and military elite of the developing countries and, on the other, by election observers and experts. Put differently, the question is: is the degree and scale of democracy the same in India and the US since both have a sustained trajectory of elections? Are democracies in Germany and Turkey comparable? Can one compare Indian and Pakistani varieties of democracy? In view of the foregoing empirical puzzles, Merkel introduced an altogether innovative concept of ‘embedded democracy.’  The embeddedness of democracy is dependent on both internal and external variables. Internally, a constitutional democracy consists of five partial regimes/ categories: electoral regime, political liberties, civil rights, horizontal accountability and effective power to govern. Externally, these partial regimes are embedded in the prevailing socioeconomic context, civil society and international and regional integrative environment. Measured against these criteria, a democracy becomes stable, consolidated and ultimately liberal if the five partial regimes are mutually connected and resourceful to each other in a democracy-enabling regional and international environment. Inversely, if there is a singular or composite disconnect in the five partial regimes or if the regional and global environment is not democracy-friendly, the embedded democracy turns into a ‘defective democracy.’ According to Merkel these are “democracies in which the partial regimes are no longer mutually embedded, [thus] the logic of a constitutional democracy is disrupted.” In other words, poorly balanced civil-military relations, Executive-Judiciary relations, compromised political liberties and civil rights characterise a defective democracy. So do lack of accountability of the ruling elite and ineffective governance on the part of the civil government.  Political scientist Aurel Croissant, a fellow scholar at Heidelberg University, applied Merkel’s matrix to various countries in Asia – including Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand – which are assumed to be defective democracies. I believe that Pakistan, too, can be studied in a similar way.  The defects in such democracies are caused by factors ranging from colonial history to cultural heterogeneity and institutional imbalance. In a given context, transition from a defective democracy to, for example, electoral democracy is possible though it is not a common and consolidated trend. For example, about Thailand, Croissant argued in 2004, “The new constitution [of 1997] improved the institutional framework for an effective rule of law and for the guarantee of civil liberties. Most successful was the institutionalisation of civilian control over the armed forces. Since the 1930s, the Thai military had exerted a decisive influence upon politics in Thailand… soldiers are still influential in domestic politics; but they cannot control the political process as they used to do. At the same time, however, new defects emerged, for example, the restriction of suffrage concerning the provisions to become a candidate for the parliament.”  The stated defects were institutionalised in Thailand over a decade. Unsurprisingly, the semblance of democracy was reversed through the 2014 coup staged by Gen Prayuth Chanocha. Post-coup, he became prime minster of the country in an arbitrary manner. However, the military rule was ultimately challenged by the masses in what are known as Thai protests of 2020-21. Importantly, in recent elections, the opposition parties, particularly the Move Forward Party (MFP), posed an electoral challenge to the junta by winning a greater number of seats. Given the strong nexus among the military, monarchy and entrepreneurial interests in Thailand, transition from defective to embedded democracy seems a herculean task.  Pakistan qualifies as a defective democracy in terms of electoral regime, political liberties, civil rights, horizontal accountability and effective power to govern. Empirically, the country witnessed initial defects in the ‘democratic’ setup during 1947-58 followed by the Ayub-led military rule. The so-called civilianisation of the Ayub regime also falls under defective democracy. Post-breakup in 1971, civil-military relations and democracy remained defective during 1971-77. The little progress made in terms of constitutional development, i.e., adoption of a parliamentary system, was eroded through the 1977 coup. From 1985 till 1999, Pakistan remained a defective democracy with poorly balanced civil-military relations, confrontational Executive-Judiciary relations, curbs on political and civil liberties, lack of public accountability and ineffective governance. These indicators perpetuated under the Musharraf-led military rule. The so-called civilianisation of the regime was, at best, an effort to internationally project Pakistan as an electoral democracy.  Post-Musharraf, the defective democracy perpetuated in the country. This was the case with PML-N in office (2013-2018) as well as with the Imran-led PTI dispensation (2018-2022). The Shahbaz-led PDM setup is no different institutionally or structurally. Post-ouster, Imran Khan’s agitation politics has not been aimed at correcting these defects but to pressure the powerful establishment to re-accept him in the system. The PDM/ PPP, the Judiciary, the media and other societal and entrepreneurial interests are also pro-system. The reported tussle within the Judiciary and the establishment, as well as the media, is not about upgrading the democratic profile of the country. It is about ensuring their survival within the defective democracy, aka ‘the system.’  Should Thailand, Pakistan or similar nations wish to realise their embedded democracies, the ruling elite (civil, military and judicial) along with the media, societal and entrepreneurial stakeholders have to correct the perpetuated defects in their democracies. This requires collective will and agency. If Pakistan’s elites prefer the larger interest of the society and the state, they have to agree on a democratic roadmap to make a transition from defective to, at least, a consolidated democracy. The time to act is now. Any delay will risk regression to either personalistic or military authoritarianism.

"political coup","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T20:28:03","The surprise election result has raised the stakes in Thai politics as the public has voted for a party that wants to see political accountability and real democracy. This week, Mr Jatuporn predicted that Pheu Thai may turn if, as he thinks likely, Mr Pita’s efforts at forming a government fail in parliament with embedded opposition from the unelected Thai Senate which was appointed after the 2019 General Election with 194 members hand-picked by the outgoing junta in its last days.  Despite rapid moves this week from the victorious Move Forward Party to put together a new coalition government, there are strong and mounting fears that Thailand may be heading towards a political impasse leading up to an August vote to elect a new prime minister and government. In court again this week facing charges, a veteran of the country’s ruinous street protests and the colour-coded struggle over the last eighteen years, former United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) Chairman Jatuporn Prompan told reporters that he thought the chances of Mr Pita getting the support he needed from the Thai Senate were very marginal and warned that the Pheu Thai Party may turn away from the current efforts, something that would be a step backwards for democracy in the country. Mr Jatuporn appeared to suggest, instead, that the pro-democracy coalition should wait it out until June 2024 when the Thai Senate’s voting rights will expire by law under Section 272 of the Thai Constitution.  It is not even a week since the result of the May 14th election which stunned Thailand with an emphatic win for the Move Forward Party but there are clear signs that the kingdom is moving towards a political impasse or stalemate which could turn out to be even more serious than past political disturbances if cooler and more strategic heads do not prevail.  On Wednesday, the Move Forward Party leader Mr Pita Limjaroenrat announced a plan to publish a roadmap on May 22nd which should give some idea of what the programme for a new coalition government, now with eight parties controlling 313 seats, will pursue if it comes to power.  Indications conservative parties plan to block the Move Forward Party over its position on Article 112 or the lèse-majesté law and turn Pheu Thai  However, despite the tight-lipped stance from the military-aligned parties led by the 2014 coup leaders, General Prayut Chan ocha, the current Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, there are indications that the establishment parties and their allies are planning to block the new government by using the power of the Senate.  The pretext for this is the party’s position on the draconian lèse-majesté law which is being used by conservatives to question its publicly stated commitment to the Monarchy.  Many foreign observers outside Thailand find it difficult to understand what is happening in the kingdom due to the complex and byzantine nature of the 2017 Constitution which was explicitly designed by a junta-appointed drafting committee to create a political structure in Thailand which weakened the power of elected politicians under the pretext of preventing corruption or undue influence by any one person or business interest in the affairs of the nation.  The Move Forward Party’s resounding win and ambitions were referred to by the veteran street protester and former leader of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) this week Mr Jatuporn Prompan while speaking to reporters in court and still facing charges over unrest as far back as 2007 and 2008.  Jatuporn says he’s very doubtful about Pita’s chances of bringing his new coalition government with over 60% of the lower house seats, to power as PM  He said that he thinks the chances of Mr Pita being allowed to form his government are nil. This comes despite the proposed coalition already controlling over 62% of the House of Representatives.  He suggested, as the pro-junta parties are anticipating, that the populist Pheu Thai Party which came in second place will ultimately, over the next few months before August, turn away from its alliance with the Move Forward Party to avoid the rising prospect of serious political conflict or instability.  ‘When the social trend chooses a far-reaching party, in the first round, every party must play a protagonist role, that is, support the progressive party to elect Mr Pita as prime minister. But later on, he will definitely not be able to deliver on his promise to form a government. There will then be a turn-away party. And that party has already prepared a turn. Just wait until the end of the two-month time frame,’ Mr Jatuporn said.  Thaksin this week appeared to give his wholehearted support to the Move Forward Party although he also underlined his family’s support for the Monarchy  This was not how Mr Thaksin Shinawatra saw it earlier in the week just after the election when he welcomed the Move Forward Party win while the Pheu Thai Party leader Mr Cholnan Srikaew has promised that his party is presently committed to a new government of ‘hope and dreams’ and even argued the controversial proposals by Move Forward to alter Article 112 of the Criminal Code on lèse-majesté should not be a problem.  ‘Article 112 isn’t an issue that will prevent us from working together, because there are common agreements that everyone sees as a solution,’ he said after this week’s press conference in central Bangkok on Wednesday.  However political analysts are a bit more cynical.  ‘Due to the number of seats that Pheu Thai holds, any viable coalition must include it in the political equation,’ explained Napon Jatusripitak, of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore this week. ‘The same cannot be said for the Move Forward Party.’  Rising danger as the stakes have got higher. This is no longer about populism and cash giveaways, the battleground now is political accountability  The danger of the current situation is that this election victory did not come about as a result of populist policies as we had seen before from Pheu Thai-led efforts to win elections which followed a pattern over the last two decades where the rural poor elected the party to disperse some of the country’s wealth and largesse, something that was opposed by the urban elite.  This election result has thrown up a far more informed Thai electorate who are reacting indirectly to the claustrophobic provisions and political environment created by the restrictive 2017 Constitution.  They are demanding reform both economically in terms of a welfare state and politically by suggesting that ultimately, power in the country resides with the people.  This is vigorously opposed by the conservative elite in the kingdom who see Thai cultural traditions, its religion and the monarchy as the ultimate unifier and glue that hold the kingdom together and that extra powers, aside from the ballot box, are required to preserve this order.  All eyes on the Thai Senate who until 2024 have the power, if they choose to use it, to mould the election result and democratic will of the people  During the week a revolving door of senators came out to make pronouncements, some saying that they would oppose Mr Pita and the Move Forward Party while others suggested that the will of the people expressed by the lower house or House of Representatives had to be respected.  The new proposed coalition needs at least 50 senate votes if it is to progress even if the Move Forward Party manages to come to an accommodating formula to neutralise its position on Article 112 and this allows it to obtain the support of the Democrat Party with its 25 seats.  Some analysts point to a vote by the Senate in recent times to axe its say in electing the Prime Minister which expires anyhow in June 2024, when 64 senators voted in favour of such a move.  194 members of the Senate were appointed by the outgoing junta in 2019 in its last days while the other members are senior officials and key representatives of society.  One former political advisor, this week, Mr Paisarn Phuechmongkol, said he thought that up to 75 senators may ultimately support Mr Pita if he decided to compromise on his party’s manifesto regarding Article 112, something that already firebrands within Move Forward are warning about.  One estimate is that only 20 senators will support Pita even with the lèse-majesté reform plan sidelined  However, another analyst, at the same time, suggested that only 20 senators may ultimately support Mr Pita even if he sidelines his party’s policy on the lèse-majesté provision with reports that Prime Minister Prayut Chan ocha controls over 120 senators with Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan directly influencing 80 upper house members.  In addition, the Election Commission may well use the complaint filed against Mr Pita Limjaroenrat on Tuesday over shares in a defunct media firm to move against him as it did in 2019 in respect of Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.  The power given to this body under the 2017 Constitution is extraordinary and supported by the country’s political law and a raft of supporting legislation which creates a minefield for political representatives which can be used to undermine or trip up political usurpers by the establishment which everyone knows exists in Thailand and which was referred to before the onset of the General Election campaign by Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan who during the campaign repeatedly pushed himself as peacemaker between the two factions in Thailand.  Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan has talked about bridging a divide in Thailand and even raised the question of the country’s history of coups  He warned that those who considered coup d’états beneficial still existed within the country’s power structure.  The problem for them, however, may be that decades of thwarting the political will of the masses have now produced a more informed and politically aware electorate who changed the rules of the game last Sunday.  The new political divide in Thailand will not be a cultural struggle between those wanting cash or populist policies but an increasingly organised and educated electorate who want to see structural change and reform in Thailand in both the economic and political spheres.  A key factor in this equation ultimately is Section 272 of the 2017 Constitution which says that the power of the predominantly junta-appointed Senate expires after June 2024.  Earlier in the week, while in court, Mr Jatuporn suggested that the pro-democracy parties should just wait it out until then before voting on a democratic government reflecting the will of the people in the election.

"political coup","2016-11-08","Not Discerned","{""NoviSad"", ""Vojvodina"", ""Serbia""}","2023-05-20T21:00:00","To Donald Trump’s MAGA minions, I ask a tripartite question: Do you know, and do you care, and do you care to know?  In other words, do you really know, care, and care to know Donald Trump’s actual character: that he only cares about himself and his self-interests while caring little about the concerns and needs of the people of the country he once was elected to serve and protect?  Do you know, care, and care to know of his incompetence in business and in politics, and that he is a scam artist who hasn’t any glimmer of understanding anything even approaching the art of any deal?  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  Do you know, care, and care to know of his severe personality flaws and narcissism rendering him literally incapable of functioning as an effective President of the United States? Rather, this man (dis)functions as an exceedingly dangerous force in undermining our standing around the world and bringing us to the point of rupture in our constitutional form of government.  And if you know this, those of you who are apparently so concerned with maintaining and expanding your “personal freedom” and “liberty,” why would you even consider supporting and voting for Trump? By doing so, you have essentially relinquished your personal freedom and your liberty as the cost of admission to his personality cult and some intangible promised security.  As someone who has studied World War II and the Holocaust virtually all of my life, I have struggled to comprehend how authoritarian leaders gain ascendancy in presumably liberal democracies built on guiding principles of freedom and the rule of law.  Authoritarianism as a form of government is characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. These regimes may be either autocratic (concentrated in the hands of one person) or oligarchic (small number of powerful, often rich people) and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military.  Influential political scientist Juan José Linz defined authoritarianism as composed of four qualities:  Limited political pluralism with severe constraints on the legislature, political parties, and interest groups. Political legitimacy based on appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat “easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.” Minimal political mobilization and suppression of anti-regime activities. Ill-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting, which extend the power of the executive.  During the late 1940s, researchers led by Theodor W. Adorno studied the historical conditions that paved the way for the rise of fascist regimes in the 1930s, World War II, and the Holocaust. They theorized about individuals who supported the growth of these regimes.  They suggested that people of a certain personality type, which they labeled the “authoritarian personality,” were most ripe for extremism, referring in this case to those most susceptible to anti-Jewish prejudice and anti-democratic political beliefs.  These individuals suspended their autonomy and critical thinking facilities. They pledged obedience, allegiance, and freedom to a powerful leader or social institution for the promise of going back to a future reminiscent of a (mythic) idealistic past, one of economic, political, social, cultural, and personal security where their “ingroup” won and led, and “outgroups” served obediently and acquiesced to “ingroup” needs and demands.  In other words, they surrender their freedom for the promise of social and personal security, which usually includes suppressing and even oppressing those outside the circle, the “others.”  Now enters the would-be mighty authoritarian strongman, Donald John Trump, who has painted a gruesome image of a post-apocalyptic America, replete with vicious marauding gangs, gunshots whizzing throughout inner cities, decrepit crumbling structures and highways, rampant poverty, declining health care systems, imminent terrorist attacks, and ruthless criminal-drug-dealing-rapist invaders from our southern border.  After inciting violence at his rallies – leading to the deadly insurrection by his fascist militia at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and his second impeachment – and after stereotyping and scapegoating all Muslims and so-called “illegal aliens,” after promising to punish women who had abortions and their doctors who performed them, after asserting that he will re-establish the Supreme Court to an ultra-conservative majority, and after promising to reverse both Roe v. Wade and marriage equality, and most importantly, after promising to “Make America Great Again,” Heir Donald non-so-solemnly proclaimed during his meandering diatribe in 2016 at the Republican National Convention:  “I am your voice! I alone can fix it. I will restore law and order.”  Trump never asked anything of his supporters other than their total loyalty and complete faith in him. And the authoritarian personalities followed in lockstep.  Trump had his followers wax nostalgic to the television shows from many of their youths: Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, Ozzy and Harriet, Leave it to Beaver, The Brady Bunch, Happy Days, and Full House, all reflecting the mainstream popular image of the American family as white, middle class, with a nice home in the suburbs, and with all family members accepting their assigned raced and gendered scripts.  Democracy, though, demands an educated electorate. Democracy demands responsibility on the part of the electorate to critically examine their politicians and the issues of the day so they can make truly informed decisions. Democracy demands us never to relinquish our freedom and authority for some promise of a comfortable security by returning to a fairytale past.  Those peaceful bygone days where lovely children played in beautifully landscaped yards within lily-white neighborhoods surrounded by rainbows above and unicorns strolling down the freshly cleansed sidewalks never existed, except in the mind of the cult believers.  Round Three  “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.” -Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Reich Minister of Propaganda  “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” -Voltaire  Now Trump wishes to invade the Oval Office again.  He shot his latest salvo of democracy-killing lies and deceptions at CNN’s supposed “townhall” on May 10, hosted by reporter Katlin Collins. But this was no regular town hall since the audience members came directly from central casting of the MAGA world to bow to their cult leader.  Though Collins tried to constrain the twice impeached failed former president by calling out his continual stream of lies and dehumanizing characterizations of Trump’s critics and attacks upon herself, Collins was simply no match for the would-be dictator and his minions.  Though Trump has been convicted of sexual harassment and is under investigation for conspiring to lead a coup to remain in power, to abscond with classified documents, to change the outcome of the electoral vote in Georgia, and to submit false tax forms in New York State and to the Internal Revenue Service, his minions kept cheering on their deranged leader.  Even though he would not address whether he wished Ukraine or Russia to win the deadly incursion by Russia against its neighbor; stated that if reelected he would continue to separate children from their migrant parents; said he would support a national ban on abortion; and doubled down on his contention that it is both normal and natural for men to grab women’s genitals; his minions kept cheering on their deranged leader.  We have long known that Donald Trump is a liar and a racist neo-nationalist. Republican leaders and their supporters who don’t speak out are enablers and are themselves co-conspirators.  “Enabler” is the term given to those who fail to act to help abusers. “Passive bystander” or “bad Samaritan” is the name for people who are conscious of bad actions developing around them but fail to intervene.  I often wonder how Trump enablers can sleep at night and get back up in the morning, still willing to degrade and prostrate themselves by attacking our democratic institutions and seriously dismantling our country’s standing in the world.  Each time anyone enables an abusive action, they keep perpetrators and themselves further from the truth and from help, and they diminish themselves and their integrity more than just a bit.  I have been stuck time and time again by Trump’s lies and deceptions throughout the past post-factual seven years –since he first announced his campaign for the presidency, through the transition following his election, his four years in the White House, and his constant promotion of the Big Lie that led to an attempted coup, and now in his newest campaign.  He continues to spread his lies – his verifiable lies – big and small.  So questions remain:  How long will it take for Trump’s supporters to finally realize they have been duped by this con artist who sold them his snake oil of a campaign and presidency of little value, which can have disastrous consequences?  How much longer can Trump’s enablers and passive and active supporters understand that they are hurting the country and sacrificing their own integrity and sense of dignity for the mere promise of a few shiny coins of glittering gold and the hot glow of fleeting power?  When voters relinquish their freedom for some sort of promised security, we are left with nothing at all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3doeS1jYW50LXRydW1wLXN1cHBvcnRlcnMtc2VlLXdoby1oZS1yZWFsbHktaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-05-14","15:00:00","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-21T00:59:03","    O  n May 14, elections were held in Turkey. Leading the People’s Alliance, President Recep Tayyip Erdo an, won a majority of seats in the parliament. However, he failed to get 50 percent of the votes, triggering a runoff election that will be held on May 28. His main rival Kemal K l çdaro lu received 44.8 percent of the vote.  Turkey’s Ottoman empire was one of the longest-lasting. Osman I, a leader of the Turkish tribes concentrated in Anatolia, laid the foundation of the empire in 1299. At its peak, the empire included today’s Middle East, Eastern Europe and North Africa. It survived for more than six centuries. The Ottoman Turks established a formal government structure where the sultan exercised absolute political authority over his subjects. The empire expanded territorially under Osman I, Orhan, Murad I and Bayezid I. In 1453, under the leadership of Mehmed II, the Ottoman Turks seizes Constantinople, then the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. Under Suleiman the Magnificent, the empire reached its zenith in the Sixteenth Century. The era was marked with political stability, territorial consolidation, socioeconomic prosperity and knowledge production.  Post-Suleiman, however, internal power struggles coupled with military conservatism affected domestic and defence policy of the empire. Contextually, Europe incrementally started witnessing political stability, courtesy the Westphalian peace (1648), economic development owing largely to industrialisation and intellectual and scientific dynamism grounded in Renaissance. The Ottoman Turks were defeated at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and the empire lost some key regions over the following century. In the 19th Century, Greece revolted against the empire and became independent in 1830. After almost half a century, the Congress of Berlin declared the independence of Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria in 1878. In the early 20th Century, the Ottoman empire lost nearly all of its territories in Europe during the Balkan wars (1912-13). Moreover, it bore the brunt of World War I after siding with the Axis Powers, which were defeated by the Allied Powers. Following the Armistice made at Mudros, most Ottoman territories were divided among Britain, France, Greece and Russia. The empire officially ended in 1922 when the title of Ottoman sultan was eliminated. 36 sultans had ruled the Ottoman Empire between 1299 and 1922.  After the disintegration of the Ottoman empire, the Republic of Turkey was established in October 1923. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a military man, played a pivotal role in the making of modern Turkish state and society based on the principles of secularism, humanism and representative democracy. He served as Turkey’s first president from 1923 until his death in 1938. Being a bi-continental country, Turkey pursued cordial relations with key European countries. It tried to maintain ‘neutrality’ in World War II, its tilt towards the allied powers was reflected in its action such as attending the inaugural session of the Unites Nations. Later, it opted to side with the US-led Western/ capitalist bloc against the USSR-led soviet/ communist bloc. In 1952, it joined the NATO.  Externally, Tukey has projected itself as a modern country, allied with the West. Internally, however, various ideas and ideologies have shaped popular perceptions on politics, economy and religion. A growing middle class in the 1950s started pressing for religious freedoms such as prayer calls in Arabic. Adnan Menderes, who won elections in the 1950s and was prime minster for 10 years, appeased sections of the populace in socio-religious terms. The Turkish military, claiming to defend the Kemalist ideology, staged its first coup in 1960, toppling Menderes who was later executed on an island. The civil-military tussle, the clash of ideologies (Kemalism versus Islamic conservatism) and disagreement on the implementation of capitalism were the hallmark of Turkish politics, state and society during remainder of the Cold War period in which the Turkish military staged two more coups (1971 and 1980) ostensibly in defence of Kemalist values.  Like other interventionist militaries such as Egypt over the same period, Turkish military had developed political and economic stakes. In 1997, the Turkish military staged its fourth coup. Anti-military politicians and political parties were banned. This included the deposed prime minister, Necmettin Erbakan, and his Welfare party.      Recep Tayyip Erdogan was an important member of the Welfare party. On parting ways with Erbakan, he founded his Justice and Development party on August 14, 2001. The following year, the party, won a parliamentary majority in general elections although Erdogan was barred from running owing to his conviction for reading a poem allegedly critical of Kemalism.  Recep Tayyip Erdogan had been an important member of the Welfare party. After parting ways with Erbakan, he founded his Justice and Development party on August 14, 2001. The following year, the party, won a parliamentary majority in general elections although Erdogan was barred from running owing to his conviction over a poem allegedly critical of Kemalism. When the ban was lifted in 2003, he won a ‘special’ election and became the prime minister. In 2007, Erdogan won 46.6 percent of the votes in general elections and another term as premier. In 2010, he won “a referendum on constitutional changes that allowed the government to appoint high court judges, curb the powers of the military and provide for presidents to be elected by a national vote rather than by parliament.” Retaining his popularity, he again won general elections in 2011, securing 49.8 percent of the vote. In 2014, Erdogan won Turkey’s first direct presidential election. In the preceding years, he emerged as a strong leader with significant electoral clout especially in the conservative sections of the population that had felt alienated during the Kemalist years and the military-dominated political and constitutional setup.  The military tried to oust Erdogan through a coup in 2016 but failed. Due to his personal appeal in certain sections of the military (I gathered this from my conversations with Turkish scholars in a conference held at Istanbul Zaim University in 2019) and his general popularity, he not only survived the attempted coup but also could took stringent measures against the coup plotters. In 2017, following a referendum, the political system of the country was changed from parliamentary to presidential. The following year, Erdogan’s coalition, consisting of AKP and Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), secured 53 percent of the vote against Muharrem Ince’s 31 percent. Resultantly, Erdogan became Turkey’s first president with executive powers.  After the end of his five-year presidential tenure this year, Turkey went to presidential and parliamentary (elections for members of Turkish parliament) polls on May 14. Recep Tayyip Erdogan-led People’s alliance of AKP, MHP, YRP, BBP ran against Kemal Kilicdaroglu-led Nation alliance comprising main opposition CHP and the right-wing Iyi Party, liberal-right Democracy and Progress (DEVA) Party and the centre-right Gelecek Party. The alliance also included the smaller ultra-conservative Saadet Party and the right-wing Democrat Party. A third group called the ATA alliance comprising Zafer Party, Adalet Party, Ulkem Party and Türkiye ttifak Party also took part in the elections. The ATA, a nationalist coalition, is led by Sinan Ogan, an academic with Azerbaijani Turkish roots.  More than 64 million people were eligible to vote in the elections; nearly five million of those were first-time voters. The number of overseas voters stood at 3.4 million by May 9. Turkey’s electoral system is a hybrid one: to be elected president, a candidate must get 50 percent of the vote; otherwise, a runoff (second round) vote is called. Proportional representation is followed in the parliamentary election.  Each alliance leader had made multiple appeals to electorate through (social) media. Erdogan cited his 20-year service to the nation. However, his record was seen as mixed as his government had failed to control inflation in recent years. Kilicdaroglu, a former bureaucrat-tuned politician, offered progressive values, public welfare and cultural diversity. Sinan invoked nationalist rhetoric. Some surveys and media reports had projected Kilicdaroglu marginally ahead of Erdogan. On May 14, more than 56 million voters registered their electoral agency. The voter turnout, thus, stood at 86.98 percent. Erdogan received 49.52 percent, Kilicdaroglu 44.88 percent and Sinan 5.17 percent of the vote. A withdrawn candidate polled 0.43 percent.  The result may have been a disappointment for both Erdogan, who fell short by 0.48 percent and Kilicdaroglu who had hoped to win. The results showed that there were serious issues with the survey design. The media hype had apparently focused too much on ‘identity’ as a dominant variable. It seems that pre-poll bargaining with Sinan-led ATA alliance might hae served Erdogan well. Nonetheless, the Erdogan-led People’s Alliance has won more seats in the parliament.  Turkey is now headed for the runoff on May 28. Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu are both appealing to the nation to vote for their respective alliance. A major voter shift does not appear likely. This allows Sinan to be the kingmaker.  The writer has a PhD in political science from Heidelberg University and a post-doc from UC-Berkeley.

"political coup","2014-03-15","Not Discerned","{""Soledar"", ""Donetsk"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-20T11:11:50","As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on, speculation regarding a potential coup d’état to oust President Vladimir Putin has ramped up.  After so many long months of grueling warfare, many Russian citizens and conscripted troops have tired of Putin’s unpopular war.  More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been verified as killed, thousands of military weapons and equipment have been destroyed or captured, and internationally imposed sanctions have crippled the country’s economy.  For these reasons, some experts suggest that a coordinated plan to sabotage Putin is not as far-fetched as previously believed.  Earlier this year, former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov told CNN that a coup in Russia was possible.  In the interview, Gallyamov noted that, “The Russian economy is deteriorating, the war is lost. There are more and more dead bodies returning to Russia, so Russians will be coming across more difficulties and they’ll be trying to find explanation why this is happening, looking around to the political process and they’ll be answering themselves: ‘Well, this is because our country is governed by an old tyrant, an old dictator.’”  For these reasons, the former speechwriter predicted that, “In one year, when the political situation changes and there’s a really hated, unpopular president at the head of the country and the war is really unpopular, and they need to shed blood for this, at this moment, a coup becomes a real possibility.” For many, the end of the authoritarian leader’s reign in Russia would be welcomed. However, the probability of such a coup, and of a related end to Russia’s invasion, is not all that high.  The Main Rumors  When Jack Teixiera, the former member of the U.S. Air National Guard, was arrested in March after being accused of leaking classified Pentagon documents, coup rumors once again swirled. In addition to listing locations of Ukrainian troops and casualty numbers in the ongoing war, the leaked papers alleged that a plan to oust the Russian president was underway.  The New York Times reported that an effort to sabotage Putin was described in the leaked documents.  According to an unidentifiable Russian source reportedly with access to Kremlin officials, there was a secretive plan to forcibly remove Putin from power in early March while the president underwent a scheduled round of chemotherapy. Obviously, it is in Ukraine’s best interest to fuel rumors of Kremlin instability, which is why these narratives should be taken less than seriously.  A secondary coup rumor circulated before the leaked Pentagon papers. The leader of Russia’s paramilitary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has criticized Russian troops on social media, claiming that his own soldiers were responsible for some of the gains made in the town of Soledar, in the Donetsk region, earlier this year.  Prigozhin took to Telegram to channel his anger, purporting that, “They are constantly trying to steal victory from the Wagner PMC [private military company] and talk about the presence of the unknown, only to belittle their merits.”  While many would be pleased with Putin’s removal from power in Russia, there is no guarantee that the president’s successor would be any less brutal.

"political coup","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T13:26:25","How two pro-Israel analysts responded to YouGov’s poll of Palestinians for Arab News  CHICAGO: Two pro-Israel thought leaders, on the political left and right, have offered their takes on the results of a recent YouGov poll for Arab News, which explored Palestinian attitudes on a range of subjects, from the Abraham Accords to who could be an “honest broker,” referring to the US, Russia or China.  Speaking to “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” on May 17, Jason Greenblatt, the architect of the Abraham Accords and former Middle East envoy for President Donald Trump, and Yossi Mekelberg, associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, expressed their views on the poll, which surveyed 953 Palestinians between April 28 and May 11.  The poll found a large proportion of respondents (25 percent) would prefer Russia to act as mediator in the decades-old conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, while some 18 percent would welcome a Chinese-led initiative to help broker peace, indicating a distinct loss of faith in US-led efforts.  Although Greenblatt said the US is committed to what is in its own best interests, he raised questions about Russia as a potential peace broker and asserted that China’s potential as a mediator has yet to be determined.  “I think the Palestinians are very smart,” said Greenblatt. “They realize their leadership has failed them. The leadership in Gaza, who I view as terrorists, just subjugates the Palestinians — the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live there who suffer because of that leadership.  “I think they recognized they have been failed. They have a terrible economy. Their lives just continue to get worse and worse. There is no road to peace. There is no road to a better future.”  On the role of alternative external mediators to help drive forward the peace process, however, Greenblatt said he believes there is no such thing as an “honest broker.”  FAST FACTS 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the mass displacement of Palestinians known as the Nakba. At the same time, the State of Israel marks the 75th anniversary of its creation.  He added: “The US is biased for US interests. Whether those US interests mean that they are biased towards Israel, yes, I would argue that. Although we’ve given, as a country, billions and billions of dollars to Palestinians.  “And depending on the president, and in this case I will speak about the (President Joe) Biden administration, there are many policies that President Biden has effectuated and President Barack Obama before President Trump have effectuated toward the Palestinians where I would say we were biased toward the Palestinians.  “But there are very few countries in the world, at least these countries that play on the big stage, who are not biased toward one side or the other.  “But again, looking through the lens of that country’s side, I noticed in this YouGov poll that there was an interesting finding — that many Palestinians feel that Russia can play an outsized role in this, a good role.  “Let’s think about that. Russia, with the war in Ukraine — and most people are against what Russia is doing in Ukraine, the attacks, the invasion, the death and the destruction — if that is the country that they are relying on for peace, I don’t think we have a prayer or a shot at all of achieving peace.”  Mekelberg, associate fellow at the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, and visiting professor at the University of Roehampton, argued that the conflict is in desperate need of an “honest broker,” although he is unsure about Russia’s or China’s role.  “There is a need for an honest broker because this is a non-symmetric conflict. You are talking about a state with military might, with economic might, with support around the world. And a semi-state, Palestine, which itself is divided between Gaza and the West Bank, and Fatah and Hamas.  China does not come with the baggage of some other countries in the EU or the US. What seems a success is bringing a push for Iran and Saudi Arabia. Maybe it’s a new dawn Yossi Mekelberg, Associate fellow at UK’s Royal Institute of International Affairs  “It is obvious that the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority in this sense will look for support from the outside. But I think also in this case, I am always surprised that the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization are not more proactive.  “They need to come with a plan. How do you want us to help you in the international community? It is not enough to throw the ball in the court of the international community. It is your responsibility.”  Mekelberg says he is “fascinated” by the Palestinian faith in Russia.  “The frustration I think with the US is, on the one hand, that this YouGov survey demonstrates, is that everyone believes the US has the ability to influence Israel but it doesn’t want to do that for its own political reasons,” he said.  “What are the chances either Republicans or Democrats, especially a year and a half before presidential elections, are going to make any move to try to influence Israel?”  He added: “It is interesting that more and more see China as a potential. I don’t think it (China) comes with the baggage of some other countries in the EU or the US … what seems a success is bringing a push for Iran and Saudi Arabia … maybe it’s a new dawn.”    With regard to the credibility of the YouGov-Arab News online survey, Tarek Ali Ahmad, head of the Research and Studies Unit at Arab News, which oversaw the poll, told “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” that the UK-based polling agency drew upon a broad sample of respondents, 55 percent of them male and 45 percent of them female.  “Within the sample we have a broad range of people — Palestinians from both the West Bank and Gaza,” he said. “We have a broad range from people who are 18 years old to above 45. We have people who are employed, unemployed. Even within it we have the bracket of how much they earn as well as where their education level is.  “So it’s more about the quality of the sample of people that are involved in the surveying to get a real, justified voice of the people and of the Palestinian street. I believe 953 is a good sample.”  Asked about Palestinians blaming Israel’s government for avoiding a final peace agreement, Greenblatt defended Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, but stressed he disagreed sharply with the views of some Israeli ministers.  If the Palestinians can sit down at the table in a meaningful, good faith manner, a right-wing Israeli government is actually the kind of government that can achieve peace. Jason Greenblatt, President Trump’s Middle East envoy  “I don’t agree that the poll suggested that a right-wing government in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would not be capable of achieving peace,” he said.  “Netanyahu and I think alike in terms of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. But I would tell you that under the right circumstances with all of the right positions being discussed and negotiated, he is a man who could achieve peace. But it is not going to be the peace that the Palestinian leadership and so many others around the world have promised the Palestinians for over 70 years.  “If the Palestinians can understand that and sit down at the table in a meaningful, good faith manner, I think a right-wing government is actually the kind of government that can achieve peace.  “I do think the government is more right wing. There are certainly some ministers in the government who say things that shouldn’t be countenanced. I think that they say hateful things and I don’t agree with them.  “I think as a whole, the government is trying very hard under challenging circumstances even having nothing to do with the Palestinians. You have the judicial reform protests. You have all sorts of things going on in Israel. It is a challenging time.  “I think the view is that this right-wing government is very bad for the Palestinians. I think a certain portion of this right-wing government is (bad), two ministers in particular, and I am against those statements that some of those ministers have made.  “And I don’t think that people should be focusing on it because I don’t think that is what the Netanyahu government as a whole thinks.”  Mekelberg, by contrast, does not believe Netanyahu’s government can be trusted.  “We are at the point actually where Israelis don’t trust Netanyahu and they are protesting out there in the streets,” he said. “Why should the Palestinians have any trust in the Netanyahu government? He formed the most far-right government in the country’s history.  “Some he put in a position of power, whether they are National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, or the finance minister for some strange reasons; also a minister in the Defense Ministry, Bezalel Smotrich.  “They believe in the annexation of the West Bank. They will never agree for a two-state solution. And Netanyahu is basically held hostage, not that he is exonerated by that, but by the far right because of this corruption trial.”  Netanyahu has been indicted on three charges of corruption by Israel’s judiciary.  On the issue of the Abraham Accords, Greenblatt defended the diplomatic effort, arguing that people often expect too much from the agreement. “The Abraham Accords wasn’t designed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” he said.  “It wasn’t designed to resolve what is the terrible tragic civil war in Syria. It wasn’t designed to resolve the terrible situation in Lebanon. Lebanon is essentially occupied by the Iranian regime and the beautiful country of Lebanon is left with almost nothing. It wasn’t designed to resolve Yemen. I think people put more weight and responsibility on the Abraham Accords than is appropriate.  “It did bring down some tension. It can bring (down) more tension. But at the end of the day, there are lots of conflicts in the Middle East having nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that remain challenging and will be very difficult to resolve.”  Referring to the Arab Peace Initiative, Mekelberg said that the best peace proposal was unveiled in 2002 by the government of Saudi Arabia. But he added that the Palestinian leadership is challenged by its failure to be “proactive.”  He said: “The other option, which is sadly what happened, is they all became complacent and arrogant about it.”  “Why do we (Israelis) need to actually make any progress on the Palestinian issue? There is no rush. That is what we see today ... I think the Palestinians need to be proactive. They can’t wait for the world to solve it because the world is moving in the other direction.”  Indeed, in Mekelberg’s view, the “constitutional crisis” in Israel has pushed the Palestinian issue “to the sidelines.”  Broadcast live in Detroit and Washington D.C. on the US Arab Radio Network, “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” is sponsored by Arab News.

The visit by Itamar Ben-Gvir — his second since becoming a member of Israel’s government — was denounced as a flagrant challenge to the feelings of Muslims and Palestinians and Islamic and Arab sovereignty over the Al-Haram Al-Sharif.  Key institutions and Palestinian, Islamic and Arab officials denounced the move, as well as the holding of an Israeli Cabinet meeting inside the tunnel beneath the Western Wall.  Ben-Gvir entered the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque and performed his prayers in the eastern region and the Bab Al-Rahma area for 30 minutes on Sunday, accompanied by the head of the “Temple Mount” organization manager.  The minister stated: “Hamas threats will not prevent us from being here. We are the owners of the house on the Temple Mount, and this belongs to us, and no one else, and it is important for everyone.”  The Israeli Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, held its weekly session at the Western Wall.  Netanyahu said: “Our meeting here today is a message to Abu Mazen (Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas), who said at the United Nations that the Jewish people have no connection with Jerusalem and that the east of the city is part of the areas of the (Palestinian) Authority ... 3,000 years ago.  “Jerusalem was our capital before London and Washington (existed).”  The Saudi Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Bin-Gvir’s visit as a flagrant violation of all international norms and covenants and a provocation to the feelings of Muslims around the world.  It held the Israeli forces fully responsible for the repercussions of the continuation of such abuses.  Jordan criticized Ben-Gvir’s actions as “provocative” and a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation” that represented “a flagrant and unacceptable violation of international law, and of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its holy sites.”  The Islamic Waqf echoed both government’s comments, adding that it was delusional to think such action would achieve his dreams and goals of Judaizing Al-Aqsa Mosque.  It said that the Cabinet meeting was equally a clear and systematic provocation against the city's Arab-Islamic history and heritage, he said.  The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, the preacher of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Mohammed Hussein, told Arab News that the incursions by ministers and Knesset members would not change the landmark’s existing legal, religious and historical status as an Islamic mosque for Muslims alone.  Nabil Abu Rudeineh, official spokesman for the PA presidency, said the minister’s tour was a dangerous act, and called on the US, to take immediate action to restrain Israel.  The Israeli government has allocated a budget of $1 million to encourage entry into Al-Aqsa Mosque by extremists and $4.6 million to support excavations underneath and for the maintenance of existing tunnels.  Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said that the Israeli government’s weekly meeting was an escalation of the state’s religious war.  The Israeli army meanwhile has decided to officially allow settlers to return to the ""Homesh"" settlement in the northern West Bank, which the army evacuated in 2005.  On March 21, Israeli Knesset approved the Separation Law, allowing settlers to return to four settlements in the West Bank that were evacuated in 2005, reinforcing the legitimacy of random outposts in the northern West Bank.  Also on Sunday, Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian shepherds in the Al-Hamma area in the northern Jordan Valley while grazing their livestock by spraying them with pepper gas.  The mayor of Sebastia, Mohammed Azem, said that the Israeli authorities intend to implement the largest Judaization project for the archaeological site in the historic town of Sebastia, located north of the city of Nablus in the West Bank, at a value of $10 million.  “The occupation will eliminate the tourism sector in the town, and it will be limited to settlement tourism,” said the mayor. “It will also affect the economic situation because dozens of families in Sebastia live on tourism.”  Sebastia was the capital of the Romans in Palestine.  It is distinguished by its geographical location, which connects three governorates in the northern West Bank: Nablus, Tulkarem, and Jenin.  It is also on the Christian pilgrimage route from Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jacob's Well, and Nazareth.  The town is full of dozens of archaeological sites, including the Roman cemetery, the tomb of the Prophet Yahya and his mosque, the Cathedral of John the Baptist, the Al-Kayed Palace, as well as the Basilica Square, the Royal Palace, the Hellenistic Tower, the Temple of Augustus, the theater, Column Street and the stadium.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDcxMzHSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3MTMxL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2013-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Shreveport"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T16:24:16","Several years back, I had three vertebrae fused in my lower back, the “solution” to nagging sciatica that, when the surgeon reported to me, post-op, was caused by my S1 vertebrae cracking and slowly splitting.  “I bet you didn’t know you’ve been walking around with a broken back,” he said, noting the crack and split hadn’t shown up in the pre-surgery imaging. “Probably for a few years.”  No. I had no idea. But I did know that I was in constant pain. Sometimes mild, sometimes crippling. But always constant. It would start in my lower back, pulse through my left butt cheek (sometimes the right one, too), and burn down through my leg to my foot, where, on particularly bad days, I could watch my big toe twitch.  I thought about what the doctor said. Broken backs don’t just happen – there had to have been some trauma. Thinking back, I pinpointed the most likely culprit: a mid-stream rock the size of a Smartcar in Virginia’s Hughes River. It was a total slip-and-fall event – the product of an overconfident boulder hopper in his mid-30s thinking that invincibility is, A) real; and B) that it applied to him.  I hopped up onto the rock – it was to be the ideal casting platform from which to cast upstream to the Hughes’ eager brook trout – and my feet immediately slipped on the slimy surface. Down I went. Hard. Like… so hard that I just kind of lay there a moment, sprawled out on the rock as the river moved around it as it had for eons. Stunned, I slowly made my way to a sitting position, but I was hurt.  I gimped my way off the rock, and waded through a hip-deep section of the river to the bank, where I climbed up to the trail and started an arduous three-mile hike back to the rental car. Uphill, of course. I was miserable.  It bugged me for a few weeks – a dull ache that I assumed was a significant bone bruise. But I was in my 30s. I could stand in front of the mirror and slice my skin open with a rusty hacksaw and watch as the wounds started to close.  Of course, over time, the ache became permanent. The sciatic nerve got and stayed angry. And some 15 years after I took the fall, I went under the knife.  Now, four years removed from surgery, I can report that I don’t have the constant pain I once did. I can also report that I have lost significant core strength and that my balance is pretty jacked up. And, as predicted by a friend of mine before I had the surgery, the correction could very well result in vertebrae farther up the spine misbehaving. I haven’t resorted to another round of imaging – ignorance is kind of blissful. But, as they say, “something ain’t right.”  Mostly, I think, it has to do with the weather. The colder it gets, the more I feel it. And where I live, in eastern Idaho, I find myself feeling like a hammered owl turd more often than not. So, following the advice of a certain Caribbean troubadour, I set out a few years ago to change my latitude. I wasn’t picky. I just needed decent fishing and dependably warm weather.  I combed the condo markets on Zillow for hours at a time, ruling out the far-too-expensive places like the Florida Keys or the hurricane-prone coast of Grand Isle. For a while there, I was pretty certain I’d end up somewhere Port Isabel, Texas – great inshore fishing for redfish, trout and sheepshead, perfectly breezy weather all year along and an easy two-day drive from eastern Idaho. But just as I was about to dig into a condo purchase, two things happened. First, I was informed that the property I identified couldn’t be listed on the short-term rental market when I wasn’t using it. Second, the real estate boom erupted, and I was quickly priced out of the market.  I’m a journalist. I’ve never been wealthy. This venture to ease the pain in my back was going to have to walk a financial tightrope. Getting away from winter a few months of the year was going to have come with some balance – wherever I ended up, the house or condo (at one point, I was convinced I could just “work from the road” in a trailer towed behind my truck while I chased winter sunshine across the South) was going to have pitch in a bit and help pay for itself.  So I kept looking.  As a kid, I spent my formative years in East Texas, about 60 miles west of Shreveport, La., and while it was a great place to be a kid, I also remember a few brutal winter weeks where it would literally rain ice and sleet. I also remembered that 45 degrees in East Texas, with its abundant humidity, was bone-chilling cold at times.  So I drew a line across the South. I didn’t want to invest in property that was any farther north than, say, the Houston suburbs. And, after recalling a couple of prodigious hurricane seasons (including 2017 when Harvey blew through southeast Texas), I realized I really wasn’t up to storm watching from afar. So… a bit inland would be best.  The search slowly migrated east and I thought maybe Lake Charles would be a solid landing spot – lots to do, great fishing, amazing local food … but then Laura and Delta struck the region within six weeks of each other during the 2020 pandemic. So farther east I went.  Biloxi? No. Too coastal. Gulf Shores? Beautiful, but crazy busy and right on the beach. A sitting duck. Then I started looking at Lake Seminole. A lake house. Now we’re talking. But just as I got serious, my employer eliminated my job after 16 years (too old, too expensive, too… well, you get the idea).  Then, as I followed the Zillow map across the Southeast, I came across a place that, despite possessing all of the attributes I was after (good fishing, good weather, a bit of protection from named storms, etc.), remained a bit undiscovered. The Suwannee River country of north Florida and southern Georgia has remained perfectly rural, largely undeveloped and, dare I say, pristine.  Certainly, there are issues. It’s been plowed over and logged, regrown and relogged a number of times since it was first polluted with European explorers when they landed on its shores 500 years ago – Spain’s Juan Ponce de Leon first wrote about Florida in 1513, and St. Augustine is the country’s oldest permanently inhabited city. Today, threats come from mining companies digging in the sand for titanium dioxide and other precious minerals, and there are typical water and air-quality issues that seem to pop up if nobody pays attention.  But the fishing … I was reminded of the stealthy and prehistoric bowfin of the Okefenokee, swamp and the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers. Most of the lakes and ponds in the area have some public access, and Florida, despite its seemingly unending desire to cut off its nose to spite its face (you listening, Gov. DeSantis?), maintains one of the best state park systems in the country.  And, of course, anywhere in Florida is close to the beach – and the snook and pompano and redfish of the state’s inshore waters.  So, years later, I found the latitude I was after. I built a little house in the woods and bought a pair of knock-off camo Crocs (when in Rome, right?), moved a modest quiver of fly rods south and here I sit, nestled perfectly into the beautiful white sand on the banks of the black-water Suwannee River enjoying the heat.  I’ll be back in Idaho in a couple of weeks for summer. If you’re looking for a place to stay while you’re fishing north Florida or south Georgia, I can hook you up.  But for now … my back feels great.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdGNobWFnLmNvbS9ibG9nL2Zsb3JpZGEtbWFuLzc3MTU3MTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political coup","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T09:29:52","How two pro-Israel analysts responded to YouGov’s poll of Palestinians for Arab News  CHICAGO: Two pro-Israel thought leaders, on the political left and right, have offered their takes on the results of a recent YouGov poll for Arab News, which explored Palestinian attitudes on a range of subjects, from the Abraham Accords to who could be an “honest broker,” referring to the US, Russia or China.  Speaking to “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” on May 17, Jason Greenblatt, the architect of the Abraham Accords and former Middle East envoy for President Donald Trump, and Yossi Mekelberg, associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, expressed their views on the poll, which surveyed 953 Palestinians between April 28 and May 11.  The poll found a large proportion of respondents (25 percent) would prefer Russia to act as mediator in the decades-old conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, while some 18 percent would welcome a Chinese-led initiative to help broker peace, indicating a distinct loss of faith in US-led efforts.  Although Greenblatt said the US is committed to what is in its own best interests, he raised questions about Russia as a potential peace broker and asserted that China’s potential as a mediator has yet to be determined.  “I think the Palestinians are very smart,” said Greenblatt. “They realize their leadership has failed them. The leadership in Gaza, who I view as terrorists, just subjugates the Palestinians — the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live there who suffer because of that leadership.  “I think they recognized they have been failed. They have a terrible economy. Their lives just continue to get worse and worse. There is no road to peace. There is no road to a better future.”  On the role of alternative external mediators to help drive forward the peace process, however, Greenblatt said he believes there is no such thing as an “honest broker.”  FAST FACTS 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the mass displacement of Palestinians known as the Nakba. At the same time, the State of Israel marks the 75th anniversary of its creation.  He added: “The US is biased for US interests. Whether those US interests mean that they are biased towards Israel, yes, I would argue that. Although we’ve given, as a country, billions and billions of dollars to Palestinians.  “And depending on the president, and in this case I will speak about the (President Joe) Biden administration, there are many policies that President Biden has effectuated and President Barack Obama before President Trump have effectuated toward the Palestinians where I would say we were biased toward the Palestinians.  “But there are very few countries in the world, at least these countries that play on the big stage, who are not biased toward one side or the other.  “But again, looking through the lens of that country’s side, I noticed in this YouGov poll that there was an interesting finding — that many Palestinians feel that Russia can play an outsized role in this, a good role.  “Let’s think about that. Russia, with the war in Ukraine — and most people are against what Russia is doing in Ukraine, the attacks, the invasion, the death and the destruction — if that is the country that they are relying on for peace, I don’t think we have a prayer or a shot at all of achieving peace.”  Mekelberg, associate fellow at the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, and visiting professor at the University of Roehampton, argued that the conflict is in desperate need of an “honest broker,” although he is unsure about Russia’s or China’s role.  “There is a need for an honest broker because this is a non-symmetric conflict. You are talking about a state with military might, with economic might, with support around the world. And a semi-state, Palestine, which itself is divided between Gaza and the West Bank, and Fatah and Hamas.  China does not come with the baggage of some other countries in the EU or the US. What seems a success is bringing a push for Iran and Saudi Arabia. Maybe it’s a new dawn Yossi Mekelberg, Associate fellow at UK’s Royal Institute of International Affairs  “It is obvious that the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority in this sense will look for support from the outside. But I think also in this case, I am always surprised that the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization are not more proactive.  “They need to come with a plan. How do you want us to help you in the international community? It is not enough to throw the ball in the court of the international community. It is your responsibility.”  Mekelberg says he is “fascinated” by the Palestinian faith in Russia.  “The frustration I think with the US is, on the one hand, that this YouGov survey demonstrates, is that everyone believes the US has the ability to influence Israel but it doesn’t want to do that for its own political reasons,” he said.  “What are the chances either Republicans or Democrats, especially a year and a half before presidential elections, are going to make any move to try to influence Israel?”  He added: “It is interesting that more and more see China as a potential. I don’t think it (China) comes with the baggage of some other countries in the EU or the US … what seems a success is bringing a push for Iran and Saudi Arabia … maybe it’s a new dawn.”    With regard to the credibility of the YouGov-Arab News online survey, Tarek Ali Ahmad, head of the Research and Studies Unit at Arab News, which oversaw the poll, told “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” that the UK-based polling agency drew upon a broad sample of respondents, 55 percent of them male and 45 percent of them female.  “Within the sample we have a broad range of people — Palestinians from both the West Bank and Gaza,” he said. “We have a broad range from people who are 18 years old to above 45. We have people who are employed, unemployed. Even within it we have the bracket of how much they earn as well as where their education level is.  “So it’s more about the quality of the sample of people that are involved in the surveying to get a real, justified voice of the people and of the Palestinian street. I believe 953 is a good sample.”  Asked about Palestinians blaming Israel’s government for avoiding a final peace agreement, Greenblatt defended Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, but stressed he disagreed sharply with the views of some Israeli ministers.  If the Palestinians can sit down at the table in a meaningful, good faith manner, a right-wing Israeli government is actually the kind of government that can achieve peace. Jason Greenblatt, President Trump’s Middle East envoy  “I don’t agree that the poll suggested that a right-wing government in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would not be capable of achieving peace,” he said.  “Netanyahu and I think alike in terms of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. But I would tell you that under the right circumstances with all of the right positions being discussed and negotiated, he is a man who could achieve peace. But it is not going to be the peace that the Palestinian leadership and so many others around the world have promised the Palestinians for over 70 years.  “If the Palestinians can understand that and sit down at the table in a meaningful, good faith manner, I think a right-wing government is actually the kind of government that can achieve peace.  “I do think the government is more right wing. There are certainly some ministers in the government who say things that shouldn’t be countenanced. I think that they say hateful things and I don’t agree with them.  “I think as a whole, the government is trying very hard under challenging circumstances even having nothing to do with the Palestinians. You have the judicial reform protests. You have all sorts of things going on in Israel. It is a challenging time.  “I think the view is that this right-wing government is very bad for the Palestinians. I think a certain portion of this right-wing government is (bad), two ministers in particular, and I am against those statements that some of those ministers have made.  “And I don’t think that people should be focusing on it because I don’t think that is what the Netanyahu government as a whole thinks.”  Mekelberg, by contrast, does not believe Netanyahu’s government can be trusted.  “We are at the point actually where Israelis don’t trust Netanyahu and they are protesting out there in the streets,” he said. “Why should the Palestinians have any trust in the Netanyahu government? He formed the most far-right government in the country’s history.  “Some he put in a position of power, whether they are National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, or the finance minister for some strange reasons; also a minister in the Defense Ministry, Bezalel Smotrich.  “They believe in the annexation of the West Bank. They will never agree for a two-state solution. And Netanyahu is basically held hostage, not that he is exonerated by that, but by the far right because of this corruption trial.”  Netanyahu has been indicted on three charges of corruption by Israel’s judiciary.  On the issue of the Abraham Accords, Greenblatt defended the diplomatic effort, arguing that people often expect too much from the agreement. “The Abraham Accords wasn’t designed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” he said.  “It wasn’t designed to resolve what is the terrible tragic civil war in Syria. It wasn’t designed to resolve the terrible situation in Lebanon. Lebanon is essentially occupied by the Iranian regime and the beautiful country of Lebanon is left with almost nothing. It wasn’t designed to resolve Yemen. I think people put more weight and responsibility on the Abraham Accords than is appropriate.  “It did bring down some tension. It can bring (down) more tension. But at the end of the day, there are lots of conflicts in the Middle East having nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that remain challenging and will be very difficult to resolve.”  Referring to the Arab Peace Initiative, Mekelberg said that the best peace proposal was unveiled in 2002 by the government of Saudi Arabia. But he added that the Palestinian leadership is challenged by its failure to be “proactive.”  He said: “The other option, which is sadly what happened, is they all became complacent and arrogant about it.”  “Why do we (Israelis) need to actually make any progress on the Palestinian issue? There is no rush. That is what we see today ... I think the Palestinians need to be proactive. They can’t wait for the world to solve it because the world is moving in the other direction.”  Indeed, in Mekelberg’s view, the “constitutional crisis” in Israel has pushed the Palestinian issue “to the sidelines.”  Broadcast live in Detroit and Washington D.C. on the US Arab Radio Network, “The Ray Hanania Radio Show” is sponsored by Arab News.

"political coup","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Jiddah"", ""Mecca"", ""SaudiArabia""}","2023-05-20T18:38:19","AL-MUKALLA: Yemen’s currency hit a new low against the US dollar on Saturday, a day after the Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council’s head appealed to Arab leaders in Jeddah to support his government’s reforms to stabilize the faltering economy.  Money traders in government-controlled areas said that the Yemeni riyal fell to 1,320 to the dollar for the first time since the beginning of this year, after more than a year of stability.  The riyal hovered around 1,200 against the dollar since the formation of the presidential council in April last year and the return of government duties to Aden, the country’s interim capital.        Rashad Al-Alimi, Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council’s head, urged Arab leaders at the Arab League summit in Jeddah to support the internationally recognized body in ending the Houthi coup, implementing economic reform, and ending interventions in Yemen’s affairs. (SPA)    The riyal, however, began to decline last week as international efforts to achieve peace in Yemen reached a deadlock, reaching 1,300 per dollar before dropping further to 1,320 per dollar. In early 2015, the Yemeni riyal sold at 250 against the dollar.  The Yemeni government’s efforts to stem the devaluation of the riyal, which included shutting down unlicensed exchange firms, providing oil and goods importers with dollars, suspending the internal transfer system between exchange shops known as hawala, and restricting the smuggling of foreign currencies out of the country, have largely failed.  The riyal reached a record low of 1,400 to the dollar in October 2019 despite the central bank closing 60 non-compliant exchange shops and businesses.  The Yemeni central bank cautioned Yemenis last week against retaining their money in local exchange firms’ accounts, stating that these firms’ activities are buying and selling currency, not opening accounts.  “The central bank confirms to the public that the activity of exchange companies and facilities is limited by law to buying and selling foreign currency and money transfers, and punitive measures will be taken against infringing organizations,” the central bank said.  Yemenis say that they are encouraged to keep their money with exchange banks because they have adequate cash, offer better services such as utility payments, and are open most of the day. In contrast, private and state banks in Yemen are suffering from acute liquidity shortages and offer less appealing services.  A $1 billion cash injection into the central bank by Saudi Arabia earlier this year supported the Yemeni riyal for months, allowing the Yemeni government to pay for food and fuel imports while also covering a significant drop in revenue to the public treasury as a result of Houthi drone and missile attacks on oil facilities in the southern provinces of Shabwa and Hadramout.  The depreciation of the Yemeni riyal occurred as the head of the presidential council, Rashad Al-Alimi, urged Arab leaders meeting in Jeddah on Friday to support the internationally recognized council in ending the Iran-backed Houthis’ coup, implementing economic reform, and ending Iran’s intervention in the country’s affairs.  He expressed hope that current Saudi and Omani efforts would lead to the renewal of the UN-brokered truce and reaching peace.  “We hope for a collective Arab movement, working alongside our brothers in the coalition, to put an end to the egregious (Houthi) violations of international law, to support the Yemeni government’s efforts to revive the economy and improve basic services, to support life-saving humanitarian interventions, and to support the initiatives of brothers and friends to restart the political process,” Al-Alimi told the summit.  Similarly, a Yemeni government official told Arab News on Saturday that the Yemeni government was seeking financial assistance for the central bank, the public budget, and the purchase of fuel for public power plants.  “We want support for the central bank, the state’s general budget in view of the halt in oil exports, and an improvement in services, particularly the energy sector, which drains more than $3 million per day from government coffers,” the official, who requested anonymity, said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDcxMTYvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzA3MTE2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Independent journalist Udey Che said, the issues raised by people's journalists, many of whom operate on social media, don’t have any stable source of income. He regretted Facebook and YouTube are seeking to regulate them.  Speaking at an event, Journalism at Risk: Discussion About Attack on Freedom of Speech and Expression, held at the HKS Surjeet Bhavan, Delhi, several speakers highlighted the need to develop real alternative media amidst “on-going attacks by the Indian state against journalists and independent media.”Senior journalist Anil Chamadia, pointing towards how a people's journalist stands alone in journey, elaborated on how today legitimacy of a journalist is attached to how big the media house is, which is ironically owned by big corporations. Currently, he noted, media houses create journalistic pieces “which are essentially packages meant for mass consumption”, and which “actively hide the issues of Dalits, Adivasis, etc.”Regretted Chamadia, this packaged media is “not countered by supposed alternative media, like The Wire or NewsClick , which only react to issues. Instead, a real alternative, which is creative, not reactive should be created. Such media, he argued, should inspire “discourse among masses on pertinent issues...”Mandeep Punia, a freelance journalist, spoke about the apathy and partisan nature of media, stating, what is dubbed the godi media raises issues which are subservient to a corporate-state nexus. Insisting on the need to promote alternative media, he said, people's journalists should be activist in their approach.Organised by advocacy group Campaign Against State Repression (CASR), moderator Prof N Sachin, who is with the Delhi University, paid homage to deceased journalist Shashikant Warishe who was murdered recently for reporting against a refinery project in Ratnagiri. He said, journalism is at risk, expressing concern over disappearance of reports on people's issues.Bhasha Singh, who is with “Newsclick”, highlighted how the Hindutva fascist nature of the state subtly hides the corporate loot of resources and the role of capital. She said, the dominant godi media has crafted narratives that centre around Hindu-Muslim conflicts, ignoring the plight of workers, peasants and the ongoing rampant corporate loot. She highlighted how the conflict in Manipur was similarly crafted to serve the Hindutva project.Prashant Tandon, a broadcast journalist and media expert, spoke of the need to differentiate between what he called ""corporate democracy"" and ""cosmetic democracy,"" especially in India, where Article 19 has so-called reasonable restrictions existing in jurisprudence along with acts like UAPA which actively make way for legal curtailment of journalists.He stated, there is not much difference between rule of BJP and Congress in terms of press freedom, giving the example of how under the Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh hundreds of journalists face charges. He demanded that if people's media has to survive, it must be backed by people. Such media must be established in each city.Writer, speaker, anchor, interviewer, teacher and commentator Paranjoy Guha Thakurta elaborated on the nature of social media as a weapon of big corporates like Meta and Alphabet behind Facebook and Google which have captured narratives in society. He urged the youth to reduce the entrapments of social media and engage in a critical fight against the new state of emergency in India which has become all pervasive.Sandeep Rauzi, speaking about the rapid fall of India in Press Freedom Index under the current regime, said, attack on press freedom has become symptom of general curtailment of democratic rights all over India. He narrated how journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh was incarcerated after having a vast body of work dedicated to working class issues.He wondered why the alternative media has been reduced to a call for defeating BJP. This takes away the introspection of Congress rule which does nothing to curtail capitalism's role in Indian society.He urged, people's media as well as workers' organisations should set up labour beats to directly report the issues of working classes, on which there is no media discourse. He added, all such journalists should come together and collectively combat the state repression.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJ2aWV3Lm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1L3N1cHBvc2VkLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLW1lZGlhLW5ld3NjbGljay5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2023-07-12","15:00:00","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T13:26:05","With its no shortage of whackadoodle speeches interrupted by protestors shouting claims of fascism, and the Home Secretary making a blatant bid for party leadership, if NatCon UK proved anything, it is that Tory internal discipline is collapsing.  Imagine if you were still in a job, and had no intention of quitting your job, but the rumour mill was spinning about who might be your replacement. While Rishi Sunak’s job might be secure in the short-term – even warring Tories don’t want to see a leadership battle this side of the General Election – following their disastrous result in the locals, talk is mounting about a 2024-5 Conservative leadership race in the aftermath of GE defeat.  “It looks like they are ‘soft positioning’ themselves, in the expectation that Rishi Sunak won’t be around forever,” said one former minister. “I think people want to set their stalls early, although there’s obviously a long way to go.”  Stephen Bush writes for FT that the easiest path to Tory leadership contest victory is as a candidate of the party’s right-wing because you either prevail as the choice of the party’s power brokers or of its backwoodsmen.  And what did we see this week? A self-assured, power-dressed Suella Braverman stride onto the stage of the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference, in what looked like a barefaced bid for the future leadership of the party.  NatCon was one of two right-wing Conservative gatherings in the same week. Around 300 Tory supporters gathered in Bournemouth last weekend for the formal launch of the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO), a group founded by Boris Johnson loyalists. Attendees weren’t shy is sharing their motivations for attending the conference and gala dinner. Belief that Sunak’s administration is out of sink with the Tory members and the country at large, was a common motivator. One attendee, a joiner from Portsmouth, said the “party has gone too left,” while calling for cuts to the “bloated” state, the Whitehall “blob” and taxes.  But out of the two right-wing conferences, it was NatCon UK which grabbed the headlines. And it’s not surprising really.  The conference that wanted to plan Britain’s new political direction and map out the future of conservatism, was beset with controversy and downright nuttiness. From ‘Deep State’ conspiracy theories, to admissions of gerrymandering, and pleads not to send your children to ‘woke’ schools, angry but like-minded Tories, dressed in blazers, tweeds, waistcoats, and Union Jack bow ties, were certainly speaking freely.  Our old friend Douglas Murray didn’t disappoint in the controversy stakes. The Daily Mail columnist was accused of downplaying the Holocaust by telling the audience that people shouldn’t be stopped from loving their country ‘because the Germans mucked up twice.’ The comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum.  Then there was the controversial historian David Starkey, who, even by his standards, made some utterly bizarre comments. “The reason that the Left has such ire for the Jews is jealousy.”  “They want to replace the Holocaust with slavery in order to wield its legacy as a weapon against Western culture.”  He also criticised the Black Lives Matter movement and ‘critical race theory,’ claiming: “They are attempts at destroying the entire legitimacy of the Western political and cultural tradition.”  “The idea that they are there to defend black lives is a preposterous notion. They do not care about black lives, they only care about the symbolic destruction of white culture.”  But it was the Home Secretary that drew the most attention.  In a highly partisan speech, which rallied against ‘self-appointed gurus, experts and elites,’ Braverman delivered a personal blueprint to take on the ‘radical left.’ She set out “what conservatism means to me,” highlighting the importance of “opposing political correctness” and identity politics.  Away from the cosy confines of the NatCon conference hall, where the Home Secretary predictably received a rapturous applause, Tory party colleagues, presumably of the more moderate rather than hard-right persuasion, condemned the speech as ‘outrageous.’  Despairing Tory MPs accused Braverman of undermining Rishi Sunak’s authority and making a bid for future party leadership. One minister said:  “She’s not waiting for the election, but is pitching for prime minister now. And she’s not the only one. Being in the cabinet is no longer a collective endeavour but a position to pitch for the next job. It would be better if she and others focused on the jobs they actually had. You would think being home secretary was some side hustle.”  Another alluded to the incredibility of Braverman’s highlighting of the problems with the country’s immigration system when she has been in charge of it for the past nine months. “It was all about her ambitions, not about improving things,” they said.  The speech, in which Braverman criticised the ‘drive towards multiculturalism’ and urged the UK to train its own lorry drivers and fruit pickers to cut immigration, while being interrupted twice by Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists storming the stage, wasn’t short of media attention.  No prizes for guessing the press outlets which lapped it up and were quick to paddle in the backlash…  ‘Tory right turns on Rishi Sunak over immigration as Home Secretary Suella Braverman attacks foreign worker policy and a senior backbencher demands ‘big changes’ while refusing to say PM should lead party into the next election,” gushed the Mail.  The article offered a quick reminder of ‘fears’ that net migration into the UK could hit a million people this year, when figures are released next week. The report quotes Sir John Redwood, who served under John Major’s cabinet, and has been described as a ‘standard-bearer’ for those right-wing MPs who wanted the government to reduce both taxes and public spending and to adopt more-critical policies toward the EU. In response to the discussion about rising levels of immigration fuelled by Braverman’s speech, Redwood said ‘big changes’ were needed to the migration policy.  With migration topping the political agenda at home, and Sunak seeking to reassert authority over the restless right of his party, as the populist right-wing gathering got underway in London, the PM embarked on a trip around Europe, in the hope to win backing for the UK’s controversial Rwanda policy. In a summit of the Council of Europe in Reykjavik on May 16, Sunak pleaded with other world leaders and the ECHR, for cooperation to tackle illegal immigration. In a meeting with the president of the ECHR, the PM sought to win backing for UK attempts to overcome rules that blocked the first scheduled deportation flight to Rwanda. Sunak’s push for the Europe-wide approach followed France’s rejection of Britain’s calls for a bilateral returns agreement for migrants crossing the English Channel, insisting that there was a need for a wider EU agreement.  Despite the PM’s efforts, the negative headlines kept rolling in this week. ‘Rishi Sunak faces ire of Brexiters after ditching ‘trivial’ EU-era laws,’ splashed the FT.  The headline was in reference to Nigel Farage’s extraordinary declaration that Brexit has “failed.” Speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight, the former UKIP leader blamed the Conservative government for botching the delivery of Brexit, including controlling migration. Farage, who was of course a driving force behind the UK’s exit from the EU, is one of a number of Eurosceptics rallying against the government’s failure to carry out a big cull of EU law or cut migration.  The decision to scale back on the government’s pledge to review or revoke all EU regulations in force in Britain, was announced by the business secretary Kemi Badenoch last week. In taking ownership of the scaling back of the revoking of EU laws, and thereby framing herself as occupying the “pragmatic middle ground,” speculation was sparked about Badenoch’s ambitions as a potential centre-right leadership candidate. Lucy Fisher and Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe note in the FT, some moderate Tories, who argue that parties only win elections from the centre ground in Britain, are looking at interest at Badenoch.  When quizzed about her future leadership ambitions, Badenoch told TalkTV that she did not want to express interest in case she decided against running.  But the announcement that fewer than 600 laws will be revoked under the Retained EU Law (REUL) Bill instead of the 4,000 or so pledged, sparked contempt among Eurosceptics, with much of the ire directed at the Prime Minister.  During his leadership campaign last summer, Rishi Sunak had promised to repeal or review EU laws in his first 100 days in office. A campaign video put out by Sunak during his leadership bid, resurfaced on social media this week. The promotional clip, which saw bundles of EU laws being shredded, was subjected to ridicule.  “Tories who fell for @RishiSunak lies must feel really stupid now. The hardline Tory Brexiteers should defect to Reform,’ wrote one Twitter user.  “Rishi Sunak has shredded his own promise – but not EU laws…” wrote another.  One senior Brexiteer accused Sunak of throwing only ‘trivial’ or obsolete laws on to the Brexiteers’ long promised ‘bonfire of Brussels red tape.’ Sir Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stone, said the list of laws to be shredded included quota rules relating to wheat bran imports into the French department of Réunion and the setting of fishing opportunities for anchovies in the Bay of Biscay for the 2012 fishing season. Another measure related to “limits to working hours for drivers during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak”, Cash noted.  Brexit heavyweight Jacob Rees-Mogg, who championed the deadline when he was business secretary last year, claiming it would help make the UK’s economy more competitive and reduce inflation, took aim at Sunak, accusing the PM of breaking his word over the promise to ditch thousands of EU laws by the end of 2023.  Unsurprisingly, the outspoken Brexiteer was a speaker at the NatCon conference and the CDO event. In Bournemouth, Rees-Mogg, who is an arch-critic of the Prime Minister, warned attendees about gunning for Sunak’s job this side of the general election. He told the conference hall that yet another change of leader — after two in 2022 — would make the party look “ridiculous”, adding that “we’ll be toast” if it happens.  Though it was his speech at NatCon that gained more media attention. Like Braverman’s, Rees-Mogg’s speech was interrupted by an XR protestor. To make matters worse for the former Brexit opportunities minister, the protestor attempted to detail a ‘few characteristics of fascism,’ before being forced off stage by security. But perhaps more extraordinary, was Rees-Mogg’s description of mandatory voter ID, a policy which he endorsed as a cabinet minister, as an attempt to gerrymander elections in favour of the Tories.  As I wrote last week for Right-Wing Watch, the only ‘non-converted’ among an otherwise righter than right panel of speakers at the NatCon conference, was Michael Gove. Addressing delegates, the levelling up minister warned that the party will not win the general election with culture wars. In what was seen as a rebuke to Suella Braverman’s highly partisan speech, Gove said the Tories need to recognise that elections are won on economics and public services than culture wars.  With its no shortage of whackadoodle speeches interrupted by protestors shouting claims of fascism, and the Home Secretary making a blatant bid for party leadership, if NatCon UK proved anything, it is that Tory internal discipline is collapsing. With Gove actively warning against an over-reliance on populism as an election tool, while backbencher Miriam Cates, who is becoming something of a rising Tory star on the right, describing low birth rates as an existential crisis for the west, an argument that echoes those made by European populist leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the conference was also proof of the pudding at how utterly divided the Tories are.  With discussions being centred on ‘globalists’ causing the world’s political problems and left-wingers wanting to end democracy to impose their opinions, as the Heritage Foundation’s Kevin Roberts told delegates, and the castigation of the ‘woke left’, sometime referred to as Cultural Marxists, a repeated trope from the stage, where was the talk of the cost-of-living crisis, the things that ordinary people want to hear about?  If we thought the Conservatives were out of touch and a bit deranged before NatCon UK, we can categorically think it now. As a friend said to me after watching some of the speeches: “I’m more confused about the Tories than ever.”  Couple the NatCon spectacle with the continued Brexit fallout, and it seems the odds are stacking up against the latest Tory Prime Minister.  Right Wing Media Watch – Tory press in meltdown over Starmer’s vague voting rights’ expansion proposal  The Conservative press was sent into meltdown again this week, with the news that Keir Starmer is ‘looking at’ giving EU citizens and 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. You’d have thought it had been etched into law for eternity, rather than just an indefinite, informal idea.  A report in the Telegraph suggested that Labour would expand the voting franchise to around 3.4 million EU nationals, as well as to 16 and 17-year-olds. “The move,” the newspaper wrote, “could force the Conservatives out of London altogether and unseat Boris Johnson if he stands again for Parliament in 2029.” It continued that Labour has been accused of trying to “rig the outcome” of a future election and “laying the groundwork for a referendum to re-join the EU.”  Following the Telegraph’s report, Starmer confirmed that his party is considering the idea.  “There’s no settled policy here — we’re looking at, and this is what the papers are reflecting on, this idea of whether or not EU nationals should be able to vote in our national elections,” he told an LBC phone-in programme.  However, Starmer denied that offering the vote to EU nationals amounted to an attempt to ‘reverse Brexit,’ which Labour has repeatedly said it has accepted.  “There is no plan to reverse Brexit,” Starmer said. “I don’t know how many times I’ve said there’s no case for going back in — we’re going to make Brexit work.”  But the Brexit ultras were having none of it, determined to turn a mere idea into a full-blown, out of proportion anti-Labour meltdown.  Leading the charge was Daniel Johnson. The Mail columnist and founding editor of the right-wing magazine, Standpoint, went a step further than the ‘rigging’ claims, saying Starmer was planning to introduce a one-party state.  “Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour’s favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power,” Johnson writes, adding that Labour’s plan would also be a “giant step towards a one-party state.”  Meanwhile Richard Littlejohn, another opinionated Brexit-backing Daily Mail columnist, who, incidentally, said Irish people should have no vote in the EU referendum, made the same claim as his fellow right-wing columnist Daniel Johnson.  “Once Starmer has handed non-citizens the vote, the idea of Britain as a sovereign nation will be as dead a as dodo,” read Littlejohn’s headline.  The language used in the article is absolutely appalling, with the author describing migrants as the ‘cash-in-hand car wash crowd, the Russian hookers, the Romanian beggars, the Albanian gangsters, the Iranian-sponsored jihadis, the rip-up-your-passports people-smuggling brigade.’  Of course the hypocrisy being peddled by these right-wing political pundits shone through once more, with there being no mention of the Tories’ introduction of voter ID and how, in disenfranchising people on lower incomes, younger generations and ethnic minorities, the new legislation faced a barrage of criticism as being the latest Tory ruse to drain the Labour vote.  Under the new voter ID rules, an older person’s bus pass can be used, but, confusingly, a young person’s rail card cannot. Where’s the fairness in that?  Woke bashing of the week – ‘Hold the line…. feline students… and avoid private schools like the plague …’ all in one utterly bizarre NatCon speech!  In yet another crazy speech at this week’s NatCon – or shouldn’t it be NutCon conference – Katharine Birbalsingh took to the stage – aka the ‘UK’s strictest headteacher.’  Birbalsingh, who is head of Michaela Community School in Wembley, told delegates at the right-wing conference, that Tory-supporting parents should take their children out of schools that are ‘’too woke.”  “Well, I’m asking, how much do you love your country?  “How much do you love the values that you claim to defend?  “Do you love them enough to tweet under your own name? Do you love them enough to change your child’s school to one that’s less woke and ignore the impact on your social status?  In the incredibly bizarre rant at a conference that was full of strange outbursts by outspoken right-wingers, the headteacher quoted Russel Crowe’s character in Gladiator, urging the audience to ‘hold the line.’  “For heaven’s sake man, stand up and be counted. As Russell Crowe says in the film Gladiator – a clip I regularly play to my staff: ‘Hold the line, stay with me, what we do in life echoes in eternity.”  She also spoke of youngsters being allowed to wear ears and tails because they ‘identify as cats.’ One can only assume that she was referring to reports that children in a school in Aberdeen were allegedly identifying as cats and defecating on the floor after school officials refused to provide a litterbox, something which the school in question has categorically denied.  Why can’t these people make references to facts instead of speculative hearsay? Oh, I know, because facts and the truth are unlikely to gain as much reaction.  Indeed, this particular rumour appears to have come from the US, where a culture war surrounding LGBT+ and education in schools is rampant. In 2022, former QAnon supporter and Republican politician Marjorie Taylor Greene made false allegations during a rally in Pennsylvania that schools in the state were lowering tables and putting out litter boxes for students who identified as “furries” or cats.  Not content with the children dressing as cats reference, Birbalsingh then vented her fury towards private schools. The headteacher believes it is not enough for conservatives to turn to private schools to instil their values.  “If you don’t like the woke agenda, then you had better avoid private schools like the plague.  “As sure as night follows day, the more privileged the space, the more woke it is,” she continued.  It really makes you wonder who was entrusted to select the list of speakers at the NatCon conference. In January, Birbalsingh, who came to prominence around ten years ago as a critic of Britain’s ‘broken’ schools’ system, even admitted that her outspoken views meant she was ‘doing more harm than good.’ The headteacher quit as the UK government’s social mobility chair, saying she realised her presence undermined its impartiality.  Not that there was anything remotely impartial, or even tried to be, about the NatCon conference. Even the left-leaning media were barred and only the right-wingers allowed in.  But back to Birbalsingh. I’ll have to remember to tell my two teenage sons about her, and they might think that their headteacher, with her constant ‘tuck that shirt in’ orders, isn’t so bad after all.

During the councillors bye-elections of Saturday, 19th July, 1992, state force literally over-ran the LGA beating, intimidating indigenes of the area, and destroying properties. Naturally, people reached for the recesses of their houses to hide. Voters had to face the concern of escaping with life, a fortiori standing on the queue to vote. Of course, this sounds so much like fiction. It is almost incredible. But we can list even the numbers of vehicles employed in the operation, namely: RV 8119 DA, RV 8075 DA (both belonging to the Rivers State Transport Corporation). And to clear any stubborn doubts about the source of the vehicles, there was also a Toyota Jeep with registration number 25 RSVG 9. The vehicles, loaded with uniformed policemen and thugs, fired with the zeal of men on a State mission and armed to the teeth to do havoc to persons and property.  As you may have guessed, many indigenes, including those standing in the election on the platform of the opposition party, were bundled to far-away Port Harcourt, the seat of power, to be locked away and (to be)thoroughly tortured. The private house of Dr. Kingdom Ogbangba, Deputy Minority Leader in the State House of Assembly, was verily vandalised and damaged. Let us leave out things too obscene to be published in a respectable medium like this! Of course, you may already have guessed this: At the end of the day, “election results” were announced and landslide victories were recorded. It may be reasonable to ask: What did the police in the area do when all this was being perpetrated? But what does a conscientious and upright police DPO and his men do in the face of “superior onslaught”, knowing the command structure of our police system? Indeed, as if to add salt to injury, shortly after an earlier DPO was transferred out of the area, probably for being uncooperative, his successor faces the same fate already. A local paper has, in fact, reported that the DPO has been threatened by kulaks with the right party connections with “immediate transfer” from the LGA. Of course, much of all this only goes to corroborate and confirm reports of intention to destabilise; annihilate the local government controlled by the “opposition party” and impeach its Chairman by “all means possible”. Part of the strategy has been to spread all manner of calumny against the local government and its Chairman to cause disaffection in the local community, hoping to garner a major unrest within the area and then nullify the government and appoint a sole administrator. Given the grassroots support of the government, however, and the grace of Almighty God, none of their wishes have materialised.  But the fight is being intensified through all means as promised. Already police have reported that at least three of their most influential agents… have made very desperate efforts to use our councillors by offering them huge sums of money to sign a document containing cooked-up allegations against my person (the LG chairman). The reports have, in fact, pleaded with the police to “commence thorough investigations to find out their financiers. I will not relent until their allegations against the Deputy Governor are proved” The outcome of the investigation has not reached my office but what is evident is that four formally loyal councillors have resigned. Many believe they fell for the huge financial inducements offered them. The whole game-plan is to weaken the numerical strength of the loyal councillors, inject their own men and, finally, impeach or turn me into a stooge taking instructions from Government House. Whether this works or not remains to be seen.  For good measure, let me add that given the devilish desperation with which they are purchasing their fancy “by all means”, whatever happens to me should be traced to them. To be sure, this tendency to deal with the LGA governments of the opposite parties all over the State is the same. But the import of all this comes once one extrapolates what is happening in Rivers State to all the states in the federation. Viewed from that perspective, it comes out clearly that the gravitation is towards annihilating the opposite parties even at the Local government level. Gradually, this tendency may infect the entire nation and two consequences are possible: That all should acquiesce and join one party or resist and fight back. Whichever way the reaction comes, it spells the end of democracy once again.  This is why I had thought that, maybe, IBB should not see this because given the investment in time, men and resources that have gone into erecting the democratic edifice this time; these trends may break his heart. But one thing is very certain, the security forces must do something fast to arrest the “hoodlums against democracy” in whatever guise they may appear, be they deputy (or despotic) governors!”  How did events eventually play out? That was during the unending transition to civil rue rigmarole of IBB beginning in the 1980s, which eventually climaxed in the June 12, 1993 elections which MKO Abiola won fair and square but which was annulled by the IBB junta, throwing the country into a political logjam or impasse that was not resolved until after five despotic years of the vilest dictator of them all, Gen. Sani Abacha, and the benevolent dictatorship of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, stained, however, with the death in detention of Abiola. With the benefit of hindsight today, can we not say that the confidence reposed by Eresia-Ike in IBB as the defender of democracy was misplaced, given that the self-same IBB annulled the freest and fairest election in the land, thereby wasting the huge resources expended on the process and truncating democracy? The shenanigans that caused Eresia-Ike to run from pillar to post took place some four decades ago: Can we say we have made appreciable progress or are we still trapped in the woods? Do opposition parties fare better today? I leave everyone to judge!  If he looks back today at his illustrious but chequered career, I think I can guess a few things that must have broken IBB’s heart. One is the parcel bomb that killed the celebrated journalist, Dele Giwa, on 19 October, 1986 during IBB’s watch. The unresolved nature of the dastardly murder must be giving the former military president sleepless nights. More so if the reported last words of Giwa: “This must be from Mr. President” continues to ring in IBB’s ears. The Major Gideon Gwaza Orkar coup of 22 April, 1990 is another incident that may give IBB heartbreak. IBB escaped by the whiskers but not before the coupists had taken him and his government to the cleaners. The terrible things said about IBB, if they continue to ring in his ears, may trouble his heart. The outgoing government of Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue State must have opened old wounds and pointedly directed an arrow at IBB’s heart when, last week, he announced a decision to honour Orkar by not only naming a street after him but by also justifying some of his allegations against IBB and his administration.  The “SAP with a human face” letter written by former President Olusegun Obasanjo to IBB was said to have unsettled and rattled the gap-toothed self-styled military president. Not given to pulling punches, Obasanjo pummeled IBB and his government hard, accusing both of putting Nigerians through unthinkable suffering and unmitigated misery. Whenever IBB thinks of a man who hits you hard but you dare not hit him back, his heart may break. Next is the IMF debate during which Nigerians rejected the IMF loan and its conditions but IBB and Chief Olu Falae, at first IBB’s Secretary to the Federal Government and later Minister of Finance; went ahead against popular opinion to accept the loan. That decision laid the foundation for the decimation of the Naira. If the national currency has lost a huge percentage of its old value today, the blame rests with IBB and Falae, aka Mr. SAP. Which conscionable leader will remember that and not suffer heartbreak?      I can go on and on! The execution, on 5 March, 1986, of Gen. Mamman Jiya Vasta, said to be a childhood and bosom friend of IBB, by the same IBB, cannot but give anyone a heartbreak, especially when, years later, Gen. Domkat Bali, who had announced to a bewildered nation the execution of the alleged coupists “about an hour ago” was quoted as saying he was not sure they were right in the decision they took! Who will hear that and his heart will not break, especially each time the media decides to conduct interviews with Vatsa’s widow and children that opened old wounds? IBB’s decision to step aside on 27 August, 1993 was not an easy one. Reports had it that his wife and glamorous First Lady, Maryam, never brooked that. As editor of The PUNCH, we published a daily “Countdown to Democracy… so and so days to go” which impeccable sources said enraged Maryam. “Who told them we are going!” she was quoted as saying! But go, they did and could that not have broken IBB’s heart? IBB stepped aside and has not been able to step back in ever since. Seeing Obasanjo and, next, Muhammadu Buhari achieve the feat of military Head of State and, later, civilian President, is that not enough to break IBB’s heart?  TO BE CONTINUED.

"political coup","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T14:42:08","On April 15, conflict broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by Gen. Abdul-Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is known as “Hemedti.”  The conflict has so far killed close to 1,000 people, injured more than 5,000 and forced nearly 1 million to flee. This is happening in a country that was already hosting 1.3 million refugees and more than 4 million internally displaced people, and which now faces further imminent humanitarian disasters.  President Joe Biden has since signed an executive order authorizing the government to sanction Sudanese individuals and entities involved in the conflict. It contains expansive power to target perpetrators of the war by blocking their assets and business dealings.  But it will remain an empty gesture unless the administration starts listing the perpetrators behind the escalating violence in Sudan.  If targeted effectively, these sanctions can increase the costs of the war and hasten its resolution. U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland testified before the Senate this month that Biden’s executive order is specifically designed to hold those responsible for stealing Sudan’s future to account — making Burhan and Hemedti prime candidates. But the administration’s failure to list a single Sudanese official under the order is a continuation of its longstanding failed approach towards Sudan, which seeks accommodation over action.  Executive orders on sanctions are critical foreign policy tools to respond to ongoing conflicts, imminent threats and humanitarian disasters in real time. But they will remain empty frameworks if not implemented. In the time since Sudan’s 2021 military coup, the U.S. has sanctioned only one entity, the Central Reserve Police. This contrasts sharply with the more than 3,000 sanctioned Russian individuals or entities. Worse, a failure to implement the Biden executive order undermines U.S. credibility.  A program of targeted sanctions would also work toward reversing the harms inflicted by past blanket economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. upon Sudan, as well as its state-sponsor of terror designation between 1993 and 2020. By sanctioning the generals, the U.S. would send a clear message to the people of Sudan as to whose side it’s on, recognizing the true bearers of democracy as the civilian-led movement.  The U.S. has yet to act on this executive order, apparently in hopes of giving the generals space to work out a ceasefire and political settlement. But to quote Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) in the Sudan Senate hearing, “Hope is not a foreign policy strategy.” For two decades, the generals have openly rejected diplomacy in favor of a long record of violence and mass atrocities, going back to the genocide in Darfur. The current situation clearly demands a shift in U.S. policy toward accountability.  More than half the population of Sudan, comprising 25 million people, is in need of humanitarian aid and protection. This is the highest number ever recorded by the UN in the country, resulting in an appeal for $2.6 billion in funding. This does not account for the further untold destruction being wrought on civilian infrastructure, which will require massive reconstruction.  The logical policy response is to make the principal perpetrators pay for the widespread damage and destruction inflicted.  The effectiveness of targeted sanctions is well understood by Sudan’s de facto ruler, Gen. Burhan. He himself recently issued a decree freezing the bank accounts of the rival Rapid Support Forces and all its affiliates. The move was intended to cut off the RSF from its funding sources, thereby limiting its ability to continue the war.  The U.S. can do the same to pressure both sides to lay down their arms.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced countries around the world to turn to more effective, common-sense sanctions mechanisms. These include targeting key perpetrators and beneficiaries driving war and repurposing their sanctioned assets for reconstruction and compensation. There is now ample precedent to do so. Canada has passed a law allowing for confiscation of sanctioned assets for these purposes, while the U.S. has begun to transfer assets seized from Russian oligarchs to Ukraine through its KleptoCapture task force.  In Sudan, the U.S. response must include putting pressure on Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Libya, the main regional players funding the two clashing armies. To stop the ongoing conflict, the U.S. and its allies must target the networks of the two groups and cut them off from the financial networks funding the war.  In addition, as is in the case of Ukraine, the sanctioned assets should be repurposed to reconstruct Sudan and compensate victims.  The U.S. should end its policy of unconscionably deferring to the military factions to resolve the conflict and protect civilians, and instead prioritize saving lives and empowering pro-democracy groups. The U.S. should proactively make conflict more costly and hold the perpetrators accountable. Now is the time to act to prevent impending catastrophic loss of life.

"political coup","2010-12-17","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T07:58:00","Dr John Jiggens‘ Speech at The Persecution of Truth conference: WikiLeaks and Julian Assange .    According to Dr Suelette Dreyfus, Julian Assange was the most original voice in twenty-first-century journalism. She justified this claim by referencing the invention of the anonymous digital dropbox that WikiLeaks and Assange pioneered, which allowed whistle-blowers to transfer information to the public, while preserving their anonymity.  This invention was widely imitated by copycats like the New York Times and the ABC, who never defended Assange or his journalism, and treat his outrageous persecution as the normal outcome of a justice system.  The Walkley Award to WikiLeaks in 2011 for ‘outstanding contribution to journalism cited the invention of the digital drop box. The judges said:  “This innovation could just as easily have been developed by any of the world’s major publishers – but it wasn’t. Yet so many eagerly took advantage of the secret cables to create more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime.”  As well as the digital dropbox, WikiLeaks pioneered analysing large data sets in a collaborative way with the massive Cablegate files, working with a global coalition that included 89 major publications including, The New York Times, The Guardian, Le Monde, and La Republica.  Yet while this famous Australian journalist is being tortured to death, slowly crucified by the governments of the UK and the US, facing the ludicrously vengeful punishment of 175 years in prison when he is extradited to the US, there is no outcry of support from our media. For over a decade, zero support!  Instead, he is subjected to ludicrous insults like the ridiculous claim that he is not really a journalist!  Julian Assange has won 24 major awards for journalism and social activism, receiving glowing endorsements from the most prominent journalists in the world.  Assange restored to journalism its noblest ideal, an ideal that has been increasingly perverted and debased by the corporate media in their quest for power: the idea of journalists as a Fourth Estate.  In the eighteenth century, the English government was based on three estates: the clergy, the house of Lords and the house of Commons.  The idea of journalists as a Fourth Estate, serving as a public watchdog and informing the citizenry about their government, emerged in the revolutionary era during the transition from monarchy to democracy when journalists like Tom Paine inspired the American Revolution, urging the thirteen colonies to break away from the British Empire and govern themselves.  The legacy of these courageous journalists was the first amendment to the US constitution, which guarantees the right to Free Speech and a Free Press, a guarantee that is under its greatest attack with the persecution of Julian Assange, who is being brutally punished for the crime of journalism.  The Walkley Award panel acknowledged Assange’s extraordinary achievement in public interest journalism, unleashing what they described as ‘an avalanche of inconvenient truths in a global publishing coup.’ The Award read:  “This year’s winner has shown a courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism: justice through transparency. WikiLeaks applied new technology to penetrate the inner workings of government to reveal an avalanche of inconvenient truths in a global publishing coup. Its revelations on how the war on terror was being waged, to diplomatic bastardry, high-level horse-trading and the interference in the domestic affairs of nations, have had an undeniable impact.”  The corporate media avoid condemning Assange’s persecution partly though jealously, but largely because of their anger at being revealed to be corrupt warmongers, who are serially dishonest and massively compromised.  In the centuries that separate us from Tom Paine and the American revolution, journalism became dominated by giant corporations and family dynasties like the Packers and the Murdochs.  These press barons misused their media power to spin the news to become powerful political actors, boosters of their chosen politicians and policies. What matters for the corporate journalists they employ was not truth but the narrative the corporate agenda demanded.  The Murdoch press has become the most powerful political party in Australia, according to former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Another former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, described them as a cancer eating the heart of Australian democracy. Murdoch’s empire has a near monopoly in Queensland, controlling not just the Courier Mail, but every newspaper in regional Queensland.  The First World War further deformed corporate journalism, as the state harvested the propaganda power of the corporate media to convince young men everywhere to slaughter each other on an industrial scale.  Journalists of this era were christened the “stenographers of power” who reported the dictates of the war boosters and the war makers unquestioningly.  The second world war intensified this marriage between the deep state and the corporate media. When Britain’s ally against Hitler’s Germany was Stalin’s Soviet Union, the British press lauded Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and christened him Uncle Joe. Alarmed by the valorization of Stalin, one conservative confronted Churchill.  “Don’t worry,” Churchill replied: “We can turn it on and off like a tap.”  And they did. Uncle Joe became the new Hitler, then Chairman Mao, Uncle Ho, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Ladin, Colonel Gadhafi, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad as the endless wars rolled on.  In 2003, every newspaper in Australia campaigned for the Iraq war, a crime of military aggression against a sovereign nation, which constitutes the ultimate war crime. Their embedded reporters reported the war from the perspective of the US military, until WikiLeaks revealed their lies with the Collateral Murder video and the Iraq war logs. These revelations made WikiLeaks famous and made Assange the target of the Five Eyes.  Over the past year, our media have recklessly campaigned for a war with China. According to the China hawks 2027 is the year pencilled in for this war. This flock of vultures circle our planet, raucously squawking Orwell’s famous paradox that War is Peace.  In 2006, Julian Assange unleashed his revolution in journalism by adopting the Fourth Estate ideal of journalism that the mainstream media had abandoned. Instead of causing wars, WikiLeaks stopped them.  The persecution of Julian Assange shows the extraordinary propaganda power of the Five Eyes. For exposing their crimes, Assange, a hero of truth, was transformed into the most dangerous man in the world, his hideous persecution─openly, lawfully─sending its Dalek command to journalists everywhere to obey or be exterminated!

"political coup","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-20T09:56:45","[Here are Part 1 and Part 2 of this three-part series.]  In 1947, India and Pakistan gained independence. Until then, both of them were a part of British India. Since the partition, Pakistan has indulged in cross-border terrorism. In 1947 itself, Pakistan sent Pashtun tribesmen to fight jihad and conquer Kashmir.  As per the BBC, these tribesmen “shot everyone who couldn’t recite the kalima – the Arabic-language Muslim declaration of faith. Many non-Muslim women were enslaved, while many others jumped in the river to escape capture.” Had these jihadis not stopped to rape nuns, women and girls in Baramulla, they would have captured the capital Srinagar and Kashmir would have been in Pakistani hands.  Pakistan has used terror as an instrument of state policy ever since. In 1965, it sent Pashtun tribesmen, which led to a war. Then, Pakistan used terror against Bangladesh, perpetrating a genocide that is remembered to this day. Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan in 1971 thanks to Indian support. The loss of Bangladesh, which was known as East Pakistan, led the Pakistani military to double down on terror. As per Pakistani dictator General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the goal was to bleed India “through a thousand cuts.”  Unfortunately, as retired Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief Vikram Sood has pointed out, India “never ever retaliated” in the manner it should have. This reticence came from India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s pacifist policies. He worried more about a military coup than a foreign invasion. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nehruvian reticence is a thing of the past. India has adopted a more robust foreign policy, which includes cross-border military strikes at terror targets. For long-term peace, India must continue to follow its great classical philosopher Kautilya and be tough with Pakistan until it makes a bona fide gesture of peace.  Police Reforms and Cross-Border Strikes  Over the years, India has been caught with its pants down during terror attacks. Police forces have done too little too late. Such is the endemic corruption in the police force that low-level constables have acted as accomplices for terrorists.  It is an open secret that cross-border smuggling occurs with the collusion of the police, especially at the lower levels. The 1993 Mumbai attacks were facilitated by corrupt policemen who were sold out to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for the proverbial thirty pieces of silver. Corrupt policemen are also said to have facilitated the 2016 Pathankot attack. Police corruption is now a national security issue in India.  There were technical deficiencies in responding to the 2008 attacks indicating institutional weaknesses. In 2008, terrorists were able to hold local policemen at bay for three days. Starting in Pakistan, they were able to enter Mumbai easily in local fishing boats. The 2008 “attacks exposed the utter inadequacy, inappropriateness and incompetence of Indian security responses.” It is an open secret that Pakistan’s ISI masterminded these so called 26/11 Mumbai attacks.  Suffice to say, Indian police organizations are in serious need of reform. Recruitment at the lower entry levels is corrupt. So, policemen have to recoup their investment. Pay is low, the hours are long, the weapons are outdated and the equipment is inadequate. As per one survey, 73% had signs of poor psychological health and a third are on the verge of quitting. The budgets are low and auditors have found that the funds allotted are often left unutilized.  The litany of woes that affect Indian police do not need a full description here. Suffice to say, the police system does not work. Yet it is important to remember that the system is not as broken as in Pakistan. Some Indian states do better than others. India has the lowest number of deaths from terrorist attacks despite being in the top ten countries affected by terrorism.  The police are the first line of defense for India. The policeman walking his beat or driving around neighborhoods gets the first whiff of trouble. Therefore, police reforms are a top priority. The government could begin with implementing the recommendations of the 2007 Second Administrative Reforms Commission. It recommended independence of the police and an end to ministers using police forces for personal and political reasons. The police need autonomy in law-and-order situations and when conducting investigations. The colonial 1861 Indian Police Act is outdated. India needs new legislation to underpin policing nationally. It also needs independent oversight authorities that are accessible to the public and address police misconduct. India’s Supreme Court and parliamentary bodies have also come up with specific suggestions for police reform.  India’s central police organizations also need reform. These are paramilitary organizations such as the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Central Reserve Police Force. Officers in these organizations are facing major morale issues and the government must address them.  Both Sun Tzu and Kautilya ask the king not to use the army on a whim to achieve the state’s goals. Open warfare could be very destructive, expensive and unpredictable. Kautilya favored secret warfare that included intelligence, spies, deception and honey traps. Sun Tzu asks us to avoid strength, strike weakness. Pakistan uses non-state actors to unleash terror on India. They are a weak link. India must strike these actors decisively even if that means crossing the border.  The Modi government has done so. It has launched three surgical strikes on Pakistan terror camps. Yet the government can do better. It must learn from Israel, the US and the UK. They have long carried out military operations across borders. Recently, the US assassinated Qassem Soleimani with Israeli support. Israel’s Mossad assassinated Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh after eight months of surveillance, using a one-ton gun smuggled in pieces. Both operations leveraged intelligence and technology to spectacular effect. Kautilya would have approved.  Since the horrific events of 9/11, a significant change has taken place in the law of self-defense. It is now accepted that countries can exercise the right against attacks or threats posed by non-state actors. Criminal defendants enjoy protections in the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). And in constitutional guarantees. Non-state actors do not enjoy these traditional protections as they are ‘unlawful combatants’. For legal cover, we cannot direct attacks against civilians or against state actors. However, India has limited legal risk when taking actions against armed non-state actors. Hence, eroding the leadership capability of these actors based in Pakistan must be an integral part of India’s defense strategy. By eroding their leadership on a regular basis, India can pressure Pakistan to take a more mature and sensible approach at the negotiating table.  India has failed to build a top-class intelligence agency. Its ability to conduct cross-border operations or even set honey traps is limited. As the birthplace of Kautilya, India must improve its informational, influence and kinetic operations. The time has come for India to behave as a major power and hit its enemies at a time and place of its choosing.  Peace in Kashmir, Economic Cooperation and Tolerant Sufism  The Modi government abrogated Article 370 and 35(A) of the constitution in 2019, ending Kashmir’s special status. This provision was unfair to the people of Jammu and Ladakh. India has also been subsidizing Kashmiris for decades. Since the 2019 decision, the security situation in Kashmir has improved. Nevertheless the situation is not entirely normal and terrorists continue to target Kashmiri Pandits and migrant laborers.  India has to address the root of the problem. It cannot treat Kashmir as an expensive security issue forever. In an earlier article, this author recommends a range of measures for peace, including economic development and tourism.  India needs better engagement with its neighbors. For years, smaller countries have regarded India as a patronizing big brother and even old friends like Nepal have turned resentful. Since its inception, Pakistan has feared military conquest by India and has looked for what Pakistani scholar Ishtiaq Ahmed has called “strategic depth.” Hardly anyone in India now seriously pursues the idea of Akhand Bharat (greater unified India). Yet it still scares Pakistanis.  India has to convince Pakistan that the future lies in coexistence. India can neither absorb Pakistan nor does it want to. Instead, India should propose economic cooperation. In turn, Pakistan should let bygones be bygones and forgive India for the defeat of 1971. In 2023, Pakistan is facing runaway inflation, a debt crisis and economic collapse. It is clear that trade, not conflict, is the way forward. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) envisaged in 2006 is the way forward. Intraregional SAFTA trade represents just 5% of the total trade. By comparison, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations intraregional trade makes up 25% and the European Union figure is 75% of the total. For millennia, people in Pakistan and India have traded with each other. There is no reason the two countries could not return to the historical mean. Intraregional merchandise trade in South Asia can easily triple from $23 to $67 billion.  I am in favor of an even bolder idea. India should work towards an economic and monetary union (EMU) in South Asia. If France and Germany can get together after fighting on opposing sides in two world wars, there is no reason why India and Pakistan cannot be part of the same EMU. At the moment, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are facing grave crises but, after requisite reforms, they could join a South Asian EMU. Nepal already has a fixed exchange rate with India. Others could follow. A South Asian EMU would boost trade, investment and employment. Like their European counterparts, South Asians could one day even have freedom of movement of people, not just of goods, services and capital.  Finally, Sufism in South Asia is key to a peaceful region. For decades Saudi Wahhabism has spread from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Kashmir to Kerala. This has been toxic for the region. Instead, India must back the beleaguered Sufis who personify the syncretic nature of South Asian Islam.  Kautilya’s guidance for a vijigishu (victorious king) is to use psychological influence or what Joseph Nye has termed soft power. India will need to win hearts and minds in Pakistan. Today, many Pakistani commentators acknowledge that India is miles ahead of their country and seek to emulate their eastern neighbor. Others question the wisdom of falling into China’s debt trap diplomacy.  India must convince ordinary Pakistanis about the advantages of trade and economic cooperation. It must be able to win them to the more tolerant and pluralistic form of Sufism that allows for music and artistic expression, which the Pakistanis enjoy. Over 50% of Indian Muslims worship at Sufi shrines. The World Sufi Forum was held in March 2016 and in February 2022. In January 2023, an international conference on Sufism took place in Srinagar. Sufism is a draw for Pakistanis too. If New Delhi can champion Sufism effectively, then India will win hearts and minds tired of the fanatical, puritanical and repressive version of Islam that is a foreign import into Pakistan. To be magnanimous, ecumenical and far-sighted for peace requires greater toughness than waging war. India needs this toughness to embrace big ideas and then sell them for a peaceful and prosperous South Asia.

Organised by the museum and the Architectural Association (AA) in London, along with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), in Kumasi, Ghana, the show focuses on the legacy of the British architects Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, and the development of what they called ‘Tropical Modernism’. It is an exploration of modern architecture in newly independent Ghana, and a fascinating insight into the shape-shifting interplay between modern architecture and colonialism.  Installation view of Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa (Image credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  V&A's Tropical Modernism  Drew and Fry were archetypal modernists, the power couple of inter-war British architecture. In the UK, Fry had worked with Walter Gropius, and after the war, both moved to India to collaborate with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret on the plans for Chandigarh. They were also involved in designs for Nigeria and Ghana, then both part of the British Empire (when the latter was known as the Gold Coast).  Installation view of Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa (Image credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  In 1956, Fry and Drew published Tropical Architecture in the Humid Zone, an influential book that used their considerable experience to show how the Corbusian five point of architecture could be applied to equatorial conditions. So far, so predictable – a classic example of the International Style bulldozing its way towards global cultural hegemony. But Africa was in the throes of massive change, and one of those at heart of the independence movement was Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah.  Installation view of Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa (Image credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  The structures of colonialism across Africa made modern architecture more of an imposition than a collaboration, but Fry and Drew’s experience, as well as the benevolent support of Nkrumah, saw Tropical Modernism briefly flourish as the newly independent state's de facto style, as much a counterpoint to the fortifications and other colonial institutions that were indelibly linked to first the slave trade and then economic subjugation. How these post-Corbusian ideals became a strong symbol of pan-Africanism is the subject of this exhibition, curated by the V&A’s Dr Christopher Turner, and Nana Biamah-Ofosu and Bushra Mohamed from the AA.  Installation view of Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa at the Applied Arts Pavilion (Image credit: Victoria & Albert Museum)  The show is defined by an exhibition wall shaped like a brise-soleil, a typically Corbusian architectural device that screened and shaded a façade; Fry and Drew used these large-scale screens in many of their Ghanian projects. Into the gaps of this 35m long wall goes a host of archive imagery, tracing the story of this new architecture and its role in the changing political landscape of the country. In the UK, Fry and Drew founded the AA’s Department of Tropical Architecture, ostensibly for European architects to learn how to design for the colonies, but also a place for the new generation of post-colonial architects to study.  Dr Chris Turner at Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa (Image credit: Victoria & Albert Museum)  Here the waters are muddied. Architectural intervention in Ghana was both benevolent and cynical, a way of mollifying a populace that was increasingly agitating against colonial rule. Nkrumah was an instrumental figure, and after his inevitable accession to the country’s presidency following independence in 1957, he made full use of funding from London to build educational infrastructure for the country. This quid pro quo arrangement not only involved Fry and Drew, as well as links with the AA’s educational programme, but also architects from Eastern Europe and China, driven by Nkrumah’s socialist leanings; even Buckminster Fuller, who was invited to contribute to the Ghana International Trade Fair Centre in Accra.

Through this blend of co-operation and misaligned interests, Tropical Modernism emerged as a symbol of a new Afro-centrism, shaping not just universities and administrative buildings, but also monumental structures that celebrated independence.  Installation view of Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Power in West Africa (Image credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  The exhibition showcases some of the key buildings of the era, including the Wesley Girls’ Senior High School, Cape Coast, the George Padmore Library in Accra and the extensive KNUST campus, a ‘Bauhaus city within the forest. In 1966, a military coup overthrew Nkrumah, damaged by the new country’s plummeting economic prospects and increasingly autocratic rule (‘He was a very good African, but a poor Ghanian’, as one of the interviewees notes in the film). It was also the end of Tropical Modernism, and the AA closed its department in 1971.  A Jury at the Department of Tropical Architecture at AA, 1965. AA Archives (Image credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  Ultimately, the imported modernists of all political persuasions never quite grasped the social and spiritual aspects of Ghanian culture, even though Lloyd – a younger generation from Fry and Drew – had a more open and inclusive attitude towards vernacular architecture and tradition.

The Biennale’s curator, Lesley Lokko, is Ghanaian-Scottish, whilst one of the most prominent contemporary architects showing in Venice is Ghanaian-British David Adjaye, whose office is currently working on 100 hospitals in the country, amongst many other projects. The buildings and histories presented in Tropical Modernism are a vivid slice of cross-cultural pollination, a social and political pinch point where, amongst other things, aspects of the Afro-futurist aesthetic took root.

"political coup","2016-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-20T11:04:12","The next presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey are scheduled for May 14, 2023. The voting will take place amid a challenging socioeconomic environment, aggravated by the aftermath of February’s natural disasters. Deadlines for a number of promising projects have been pushed back, and the country has proved unprepared for the problems it is now facing. The ruling coalition’s hopes for a convincing victory often seem dubious, with the struggle for power accompanied by fierce disputes over how to resolve the current problems and proceed with political and economic development. Meanwhile, old and forgotten cards are being played along with new ones as external interference in national affairs has become more frequent. It is difficult to say unequivocally what the outcome of this complicated electoral process might be. We shall try to identify the most likely scenarios of the political dynamics as well as the outcome of the upcoming elections, which, according to many experts, promise to be the most competitive in the entire history of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) rule.  Today, power in Turkey is held by the People’s Alliance (“Cumhur İttifakı”) coalition led, in fact, by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The coalition consists of the AKP, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Great Unity Party (BBP) and the New Welfare Party (YRP). The need to form this coalition is fostered by the risks of repeating the scenario of June 2015, when, in the absence of political allies, the ruling AKP lost its majority in parliament, despite winning the elections. This led to a political crisis in the country, as no government was formed and the vote had to be repeated in November of the same year. According to the Turkish constitution, to form a government alone, a party must secure more than half of the seats in parliament, which, under current conditions, is an unattainable goal for existing political parties. Thus, in the current political configuration, supporters of the ruling party expect to form a government in alliance with other conservative forces, while supporters of other parties in the ruling coalition intend to  In addition to the People’s Alliance, at least four other political blocs will participate in the elections. The main opposition coalition force is the Nation Alliance, the so-called Table of Six, consisting of the following parties: 1) Republican People’s Party (CHP), led by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, one of the favorites in the presidential race; 2) the Party of Humanity, Innovation and Goodness (Good Party), led by Meral Akşener; 3) the Felicity Party (PS) led by Temel Karamollaoğlu; 4) the Party of Democracy and Progress (PDP) led by Ali Babacan; 5) the Future Party (PB) led by Ahmet Davutoğlu; 6) the Democratic Party (DP) led by Gültekin Uysal.  The third coalition, also comprised of six parties, is known as the Alliance of Labor and Freedom. It includes the following political forces: 1) the pro-Kurdish Democratic People’s Party (HDP); 2) the Workers’ Party of Turkey (WPT); 3) the Labor Party (EMEP); 4) the Labourist Movement Party (EHP); 5) the Social Freedom Party (TӦP); and 6) the Party of Greens and the Left Future (YSGP).  Another coalition is called the Union of Socialist Forces. This political association consists of parties ideologically similar to those in the Alliance of Labor and Freedom, although united under much more radical political views, slogans and programs. The coalition includes the following parties: 1) the Left Party (ӦDP), 2) the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP), 3) the Communist Movement of Turkey (TKH), 4) the People’s United Revolutionary Movement or HBDH and 5) the Revolutionary Socialist Workers’ Party (DSİP).  Finally, the fifth coalition that managed to nominate its own single presidential candidate (Sinan Oğan) is the Ancestral Alliance (ATA İttifakı), consisting of the Victory Party (PP), the Justice Party (JP), My Country Party (MCP) and Turkey Alliance Party.  Thus, five political coalitions have been formed several weeks prior to the elections. Yet, not all parties of the Republic followed the path of coalition engagement, though this is an exception rather than the rule. One such party is the Homeland Party established and led by Muharrem İnce, who, running for president from the PPR in 2018, won just over 30% of the vote, while his main opponent, R.T. Erdoğan, received over 52% of the vote. In other words, we can say that the practice of coalition formation keeps on taking root in the political life of Turkey, as it becomes an integral part of both the current election and the electoral process as a whole.  The Table below gives the most graphical representation of the current balance of political forces in the Turkish parliament that has 600 seats.  Table 1: Distribution of Seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey  No. Party Name Leader Chairperson Position Number of seats Relation to coalition 1 Justice and Development Party (AKP) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Naci Bostancı Right-wing populism, conservative democracy 285 People’s Alliance 2 Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Centre-left social democracy, kemalism 134 Nation Alliance 3 Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) Mithat Sancar & Pervin Buldan Pervin Buldan Left-wing, radical democratic socialism 56 Labour and Freedom Alliance 4 Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) Devlet Bahçeli Devlet Bahçeli Far-right ultranationalism, idealism 48 People’s Alliance 5 Good Party (İYİ) Meral Akşener İsmail Tatlıoğlu Centre-right Turkish nationalism 36 Nation Alliance 6 Workers’ Party of Turkey (TİP) Erkan Baş – Far-left socialism, Marxism 4 Labour and Freedom Alliance 7 Democratic Party (DP) Gültekin Uysal – Centre-right Liberal conservatism 2 Nation Alliance 8 Homeland Party (MP) Muharrem İnce – Centre-left Kemalism, patriotism 2 – 9 Great Unity Party, BBP Mustafa Destici – Far-right Turkish Islamic synthesis 1 People’s Alliance 10 Democracy and Progress Party, DPP or DEVA Ali Babacan – Centre Liberal democracy 1 Nation Alliance 11 Democratic Regions Party, DBP Saliha Aydeniz & Keskin Bayındır – Left-wing Democratic socialism 1 – 12 Felicity Party (SP) Temel Karamollaoğlu – Far-right, political Islam, Millî Görüş 1 People’s Alliance 13 Innovation Party (YP) Öztürk Yılmaz – Centre-left, civic nationalism, patriotism 1 – 14 Victory Party (ZP) Öztürk Yılmaz – Centre-left, Turkish nationalism, anti-immigration party 1 Ancestral Alliance (ATA İttifakı) 15 Independents 4 – 16 Vacant 23  We would like to call your attention to another table, which highlights the current balance of political forces in the country. Thus, Table 2 shows the results of sociological surveys recently conducted in Turkey. The first column indicates the sociological companies which conducted the polls.  Table 2. The Results of Turkish Citizenry Political Preference Surveys (Average Numbers)  Average Results of the Latest Election Polls  Justice and Development Party (AKP) — 32.8%  Republican People’s Party (CHP) — 27.6%  Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) — 10.7%  Good Party (İYİ) — 10.5%  Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) — 6.5%  Homeland Party (MP) — 2.9%  Democracy and Progress Party, DPP or DEVA — 1.6%  Future Party (PB) — 1.6%  New Welfare Party (YRP) — 1.3%  Workers’ Party of Turkey (TİP) — 1.2%  Victory Party (ZP) — 1.1%  Felicity Party (SP) — 0.9%  Thus, according to the average results of the latest polls, the ruling coalition may garner about 41% of the votes, while the opposing coalition may reach just slightly over 45%. In other words, the balance of power in parliament may change in favor of the opposition bloc.  As for the position of Recep Erdogan himself, most experts believe that the incumbent President feels more confident than the ruling bloc. This state of things became especially clear after the political parties from the main opposition alliance decided on a single candidate, namely K. Kılıçdaroğlu. But how justified is such overconfidence?  Indeed, as per the results of opinion polls conducted by pro-government companies, Mr. Erdogan can get more than 50% of the votes already in the first round. Building on this, predictions speculate that the president will likely repeat the success of 2018. However, the results of opinion polls conducted by companies closely associated with opposition forces generally show that the main candidates will still have to contend in the second round to be held on May 28. Notably, the main favorite in the presidential race is Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu.  Proceeding from the above-mentioned data, one should admit that forecasts made on the basis of sociological surveys conducted by the opposition forces look more realistic. This state of affairs makes us turn to the current realities and come up with forecasts taking into account not only the results of the opinion polls, but also the current reality and the processes taking place in modern-day Turkey.  First of all, the diverse position of the opposition parties united in the Nation Alliance is what catches the eye. To understand the actual incapacity of the Nation Alliance, it would suffice to recall a series of last year’s fruitless meetings of the opposition Six, as well as the incident with Meral Akshener, when she actually left the six-party platform for a while, having stated that the alliance “has lost the ability to express the people’s will.” Indeed, this assessment is not an overstatement as the parties in the Nation Alliance are far from developing a unified and consistent political program, the main agenda of these opposition meetings revolving around two topics—the collective opposition to Erdogan and the proposal to strengthen the parliamentary system.  In other words, the coalition’s members do not share a political platform, with each promoting their own political agendas and cherishing their own plans for distribution of powers and authorities in a possible coalition government. So far, there is no reason to expect a compromise between the leaders of the main opposition parties on these key issues, which is alarming, because it could lead to another political crisis. This is the last thing Turkish voters want. Quite indicatively, more than half of those polled expressed doubts in the ability of the main opposition bloc to solve the country’s current economic problems, according to a survey conducted by the Metropoll agency.  Let us talk about the main advantages of Erdogan in the context of the current electoral process. First of all, the incumbent president is actively pursuing the idea of establishing Turkey as a major regional hub for logistics and energy as well as an international transport artery for food freights. The almost simultaneous launch of all these transit initiatives in 2023 can provide Turkey with a brilliant prospect, resulting in a viable way of replenishing the state treasury. Mr. Erdogan is already garnering certain political dividends from the practical implementation of these large-scale regional projects, and we have to admit that their monetization will not be long in coming. The Turkish leader is aware of that, making great effort to ensure that these initiatives start working at their full capacity within the set deadlines.  Second, the commissioning of some major infrastructure facilities is anticipated this year, including those in the industrial, energy and logistics sectors. It is planned to expand some of the already existing large-scale projects in both infrastructure and high technology (civil, military and dual-use), which were launched during the AKP rule, bringing them to a new quality level.  Third, the Turkish president seriously expects his monetary policy to start bearing fruit already by the end of this year. It should be mentioned that his insistence on restraining and even lowering the key rate of the central bank does not fit into the generally accepted laws of economic theory, according to which one of the ways to tackle inflation is the central bank raising the key interest rate. In other words, the usual course of action should look as follows: the central bank raises the rate, while banks adapt their interest rates on loans and deposits to match the Central Bank’s higher rate. As a result, loans become more expensive, and deposits—more profitable. Accordingly, the funds of the population are drawn to deposits, the money supply is compressed, which ultimately leads to a slowdown in inflation.  However, according to Mr. Erdogan, inflation could be reined using the opposite method, which is the reduction of the Central Bank’s interest rate. This should increase the availability of cheap money in the country, boosting the production of domestic goods and services, which are then exported in exchange for foreign currency. Foreign currency is sold on the domestic market, strengthening the Turkish lira exchange rate and slowing the rate of inflation. The government expects that there will be a slowdown in annual inflation to some 20% by the end of 2023. Accordingly, in the medium term, the growing trade surplus should strengthen the national currency, as is forecast by the government. Today, the refinancing rate of the Central Bank in Turkey is going down in the face of severe pressure, amounting to 8.5% (last year it stood at 14%). If this approach, based mainly on promoting the exports of goods and tourism, is successful, Mr. Erdogan might rest on the laurels as the “innovator economist,” which will automatically make him the main author of the Turkish model of economic development, as he displaces Turgut Ozal from this pedestal, who was the father of the “Turkish miracle” and initiator of socioeconomic reforms in Turkey in the late 20th century.  Critics of this economic policy warn that the growth-oriented policy pursued in the run-up to the elections is unstable and could cause a systemic economic crisis. In turn, Turkish voters do not share the optimism of the authorities, albeit seeing no real alternatives from the opposition either.  Today, about 42% of respondents approve of what Erdogan does as president. It should be noted that this is not a bad indicator in the current difficult economic situation, but it may not be enough for Erdogan’s coalition to win the upcoming elections. Perhaps, that was the reason why the Turkish authorities were going to launch military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Another successful operation, which could have resulted in a crushing blow to the plans of a “Syrian Kurdistan,” could have strengthened the position of Erdogan and his party on the eve of the upcoming elections. In the meantime, the Turkish media review shows that public opinion is now least concerned about a new Syrian front. Moreover, the military operation is seen mostly in the context of a possible influx of new refugees. Under such circumstances, the normalization of relations with Syria looks like a much better prospect.  The incumbent President has been pointing to Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s weakness and even incompetence in foreign policy as well as security matters in every way possible. After Mr. Erdogan was announced the official candidate of the People’s Alliance for president, he addressed 10 questions to the leader of the CHP, which cornered him, as he was confronted with a difficult dilemma. These questions remained unanswered, which gave the Turkish president grounds for stating that the opposition acts not in the best interests of the Turkish electorate but to promote the interests of external forces.  It is obvious that Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu turned out to be “the most convenient” presidential candidate for Mr. Erdogan in comparison with other possible contenders—the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara. Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavaş were once the favorites among the opposition, garnering the support of 60.4 percent and 50.7 percent of voters, respectively. But in the words of Kılıçdaroğlu, these surveys are now “irrelevant.”  Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu has led the CHP, the oldest Republican Party of Turkey, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, for 13 years. Under his leadership, Ataturk’s party has evolved from a nationalist and Kemalist party into a more progressive and leftist force. The party leader abandoned opposition to the hijab and tried to build bridges with other political movements, including Islamists and conservative democrats. He also managed to convince Turkey’s nationalistic Good Party and the pro-Kurdish HDP to support the same candidate in the 2018 mayoral elections, when the opposition defeated the ruling AKP in Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in nearly two decades.  Kılıçdaroğlu promised to send millions of Syrian refugees back home and to restore relations with Syrian President Bashar Assad as part of his election program. The CHP leader does not approve of Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems, believing it has caused a rift with Washington. He also stated that, if elected, he would review the Central Bank’s management and stop interfering in its policies. Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s position on the Kurdish question is not so clear-cut. This may be due to the disputes between the nationalist and social-democratic wings of the AKP over this issue. In 2013, the politician condemned the peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) as part of a plot to create a Great Kurdistan, and the party consistently supported military action against the group and its Kurdish-Syrian allies until recently. By 2021, however, Kılıçdaroğlu had changed his position, stating that the former co-chairman of the HDP, Selahattin Demirtaş, was “unjustly” put behind bars. In September 2021, he declared that the HDP was a “legitimate body” and called it a viable partner to “address the Kurdish question”.  * * *  Today, none of the main contenders for presidency in Turkey has a clear advantage. The electoral process is quite tense, while the arguments of the parties are multifaceted, spilling over from foreign policy into economic and domestic policy domains and vice versa. Supporters of political parties often resort to polarizing society in an attempt to strengthen their base.  An important feature of the current election race in Turkey has been a blatant interference of the U.S. in the process. Even before his election, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “We need to make it crystal clear that we support the opposition leaders and that we have a road map. We have to speak louder about what we think. Erdogan needs to be overthrown by way of elections. He was kicked out in Istanbul, and his party was kicked out as well.” Notably, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Jeffrey Flake held meetings with all representatives of the country’s main opposition political forces. The Turkish president openly accused him of an unprofessional approach.  Amidst the growing anti-American, anti-NATO and anti-Western sentiments in Turkey, fostering cooperation with Russia looks quite advantageous practically in all areas. As for this track, all the parties (both members of the ruling alliance and members of the opposition bloc) hold on to a similar position, generally speaking. Most likely, this has to do with a clear demand existing in the Turkish society. There is an understanding that Turkey is a player that is to a certain extent dependent on Russia—particularly, in economic, trade, energy, tourism and other domains. Turkey remembers very well that the entire tourism industry of the Republic was seriously impaired with the sharp decline in tourist flows from Russia in 2015-2016, with hundreds of hotels closed and resort areas suffering huge losses. The Russian market is extremely attractive for Turkey; this explains the fact that recently, with the departure of Western brands from Russia, the Turks have been actively building up their presence in almost all sectors. The country understands that Russia’s position largely determines the level of its presence in a number of regions, including Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, the Black Sea region, etc. Russia and Turkey interact effectively within the framework of international formats to negotiate settlements in Syria, Libya, Karabakh.  Turkey is seeking to play a mediating role in the Ukrainian crisis. Ankara sees this as an opportunity to strengthen its position in the international arena. As an initiator and mediator in implementing the new regional mechanism under the auspices of the UN, aimed at addressing issues related to global food security, Turkey gets an additional opportunity to assert itself as a responsible global player. This is a completely new perspective for the country, which followed from permanent contacts with Russia. Today, Ankara has become virtually the only player in the Collective West, who is capable of maintaining a normal dialogue with both Moscow and Kiev. Turkey has not joined the anti-Russian sanctions and currently enjoys Moscow’s trust. It is making the most of this privilege in its communication with Western countries by demanding certain concessions from them. Such diplomatic maneuvers have provided Turkey with important advantages that its other potential competitors on the issue of the Ukrainian settlement do not possess. In other words, the growing engagement with Russia can guarantee the incumbent Turkish government success, both domestically and internationally. This circumstance is certainly taken into account by both the incumbent authorities and the opposition forces. Thus, cooperation with Russia promises to be an important and constant topic of discussion in the Turkish presidential election race.

The PJS, which has more than 2500 members, is planning to hold its general conference and elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 23 and 24.  Last month, the PJS published the names of its members, drawing protests from many journalists, especially those living in the Gaza Strip who were surprised to see that their names were not included in the list.  Later, the PJS opened the door for journalists to present their candidacy for the elections.  The syndicate then announced that only one list, The List of Palestinian Press Martyrs, has been approved to run in the elections. The list is dominated by Fatah loyalists and activists, many of whom are not journalists, according to some Palestinian journalists.

(credit: Abbas Momani/AFP via Getty Images)  A group of Palestinian journalists residing in the Gaza Strip filed a petition with a Hamas court asking that it prevent the PJS from holding the elections. The court is expected to issue a ruling on the matter on Sunday.  The journalists accused Fatah and the Palestinian Authority of “hijacking” the PJS. They claimed that Fatah and the PA have allowed many of their supporters, including security officers and government employees, to join the syndicate in violations of its regulations.  “The Palestinian Authority wants the syndicate to serve as a government agency, not as an independent union representing real journalists,” said a veteran journalist from the Gaza Strip. “In the past few years, we saw dozens of Fatah activists and security officers join the syndicate, although they have nothing to do with journalism.”  Last week, journalists held a demonstration in the Gaza Strip to protest what they described as attempts by the PA and Fatah to deprive them of their right to elect their own representatives.  The journalists also accused the PJS of banning them from joining the syndicate or receiving its press cards for political reasons.  Gaza journalists critical of PJS elections  Emad Zaqout, a prominent journalist from the Gaza Strip, described the planned elections as a “farce” and accused Fatah of planning to retain its control over the syndicate.  He and other journalists appealed to the International Federation of Journalists and other media institutions to intervene to guarantee their right to hold democratic elections for their syndicate.  Another group of Gaza-based journalists held a demonstration to protest attempts by Hamas and its supporters to prevent the elections for the syndicate. The journalists said the petition that was filed to a Hamas court by some of their colleagues was aimed at denying them the right to hold a democratic vote and choose their own representatives for the PJS.  The Ramallah-based chairman of the PJS, Nasser Abu Bakr, who is also a senior Fatah official, accused Hamas of seeking to prevent the syndicate from holding its general conference and elections.  Abu Bakr told the PA’s official news agency Wafa that Hamas is trying to control the syndicate and prevent the existence of a union body in the Gaza Strip that protects journalists and defends their rights.  Hamas, Abu Bakr charged, wants to control all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip by force, as it did when it staged a “military coup” in the costal enclave in 2007.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzY3NtIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDM2NzYvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","1923-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Calcutta"", ""WestBengal"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T01:00:54","Western NGOs have to be extremely biased to place India behind Pakistan and ac on indices such as academic and press freedom.  In an age where social media dominates our lives it is imperative for India to wake up to the challenges it faces. India is the target of an unprecedented propaganda war and it seems that it has neither the will nor the appetite to fight this vicious assault on the country. It is not enough to laugh it off or dismiss this aggression hoping that it will go away. The World Freedom Index or so called, “Reporters Without Borders” in its May 2023 report has put India below Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of press freedom. Then there is the “World Happiness Index 2023”, which lists India at number 136 behind Sri Lanka. The Global Hunger Index lists India at number 107 out of 121 countries. The Swedish based NGO, V-Dem Institute has put India behind Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan in the field of academic freedom.  Let us look at each of these institutions and investigate who the players are behind these forces.  WORLD FREEDOM INDEX OR REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS  Dr Dan Steinbock, an internationally recognised strategist of the multipolar world and the founder of Difference Group who has served at the India, China and America Institute (USA), Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore), has the following to say about Reporters Without Borders (RSF): “For years, the Press Freedom Index also known as the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has been widely quoted, even though its methodology is biased. RSF was, for long led, by a white supremacist with a penchant for US-led regime change. Now RSF is targeting Asia. RSF has cherished odd bedfellows. Amid the 2002 coup against Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, the RSF sided with the plotters, as it did in the coups against Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Manuel Zelaya in Honduras, and Evo Morales in Bolivia. According to critics the RSF has cooperated and coordinated with the US State Department against Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. The regime-change activities were funded by USAID Cuba Program, Freedom of Information Initiatives and the NEDA. In return, the Bush administration funded RSF and like-minded NGOs. In 2007 RSF justified the Iraq invasion. Similar joint interests mark RSF activities in the Middle East (Libya, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan). (NEDA or National Endowment for Democracy was originally set up in 1983 during the Reagan presidency. Its function was to take over the political regime change programmes from the CIA by presenting itself as an independent and private non-governmental organisation).”  BIASED METHODS, FUNDERS’ AGENDAS  RSF’s total budget is 6.1 million euros. It funds only 20% of its activities internally. Over 40% is based on “institutional grants” (French foreign ministry, French defence ministry), whereas 35% stems from “private foundations and NGOs” (e.g., NEDA, Ford Foundation) and “corporate and individual donations” (e.g., American Express, French bank Société Générale). Through their funding, billionaires, including George Soros via his Open Society and Pierre Omidyar, have indirectly shaped RSF activities. In return for French and US funds, the RSF has been largely silent about media abuses in France and the West.  Behind the official facades, the RSF’s index (World Press Freedom Index) has attracted much controversy. As it should. It is something of a racket. Officially the WPFI “is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF”. The questionnaire presumably evaluates very broad criteria, such as “pluralism, media independence, and self-censorship”. The qualitative analysis is augmented with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists. Moreover, when a limited sample of some 150 journalists and 18 NGOs are asked to analyse and respond to 87 questions for each country, the probability of biases and thus disconnect with realities increases accordingly. RSF and its sponsors have politicised and weaponised its mandate, methodology, targets and objectives.  THE WORLD HAPPINESS INDEX  This organisation fails to acknowledge how cultural differences shape your happiness. How can one reasonably conclude that country A is happier than country B when happiness is being measured by the way people in country A think about happiness? In India, community, family, and spirituality are significant contributors to happiness. Indian society is built on a strong sense of community and social support, which is not captured in the survey.  Why does Finland, which has been given the status of the happiest nation, have a high suicide rate? The giveaway is in the professed aim of the WHI Index. It says their goal is to realise a world with freedom, consciousness and happiness for all. For them, India, the world’s largest democracy, has less freedom than Sri Lanka, which is in political turmoil and bankrupt.  THE GLOBAL HUNGER INDEX  This organisation lists India at number 107 out of 121 countries. This despite the fact that India has rolled out the world’s largest food aid programme. It has been highly praised by the World Bank for its efficiency. There is no mass starvation in India and poverty fell in India from 22.5% to 10%. The founders of GHI is Concern Worldwide. It is Ireland’s largest aid and humanitarian agency. Some of its employees overseas were dismissed due to sexual misconduct.  SWEDISH V-DEM  Th V-Dem NGO from Sweden has put India behind Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan in the field of academic freedom. V-Dem lists 5 indexes to measure the level of democracy in a country. They are: The electoral democracy index, the liberal democracy index, the participatory democracy index, the deliberative democracy index and the egalitarian democracy index.  Going by these indices, V-Dem has to be extremely biased to place India behind Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. It is axiomatic that V-Dem is agenda driven and anti India to the core. Not surprisingly, it too is funded by George Soros.  CONCLUSION  The relentless propaganda against India has reached a crescendo. They are desperate to remove a party which champions the Hindu heritage of the country. India must wake up to these destabilising forces. The perception of India in spite of its amazing economic progress and military might is that it is weak and can easily be pushed around. This perception needs to change urgently. Indian embassies all over the world have PR departments. Why don’t they ever respond to malicious propaganda by media houses in the UK, Germany and some other countries that are so small that they are like a mouse roaring at a lion? In the Ramayana, when the time came for Hanuman to cross the ocean to go to Lanka he was engulfed with self-doubt. It was when everyone reminded him of his strength that Hanuman was motivated. Perhaps India also needs to be reminded of its might.

"political coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","2023-05-20T07:14:53","By MAWAHIB ABDALLATIF More by this Author  The Sudan crisis may have been boiling under the lid, and the spark that lit the fire had been the massive tribalism in the country which experts say borders on racism.  This week, deaths rose to over 1,000 people, 200,000 people forced to flee to neighbouring countries and 700,000 others displaced internally, triggering a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region, according to the UN.  But experts say remnants of Omar al-Bashir, ousted in 2019 in a revolution, have profited from underlying fissures among ethnic groups to ignite the conflict.  Hafiz Mohamed, the director of Justice Africa Sudan, says there are concerns that Bashir’s National Congress Party (NCP), who are largely sympathetic to Sudan Armed Forces under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, are positioning themselves to bounce back to the centre of power.  The SAF has been fighting erstwhile allies, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Daglo Hemedti.  After the war broke out in Khartoum, the RSF began mobilising Arab militias to form a strong counterforce.  Advertisement  Read: Sudan warring sides only agree to protect civilians  “Since the 1989 coup, they created numerous militias, including the Marahil forces, Popular Defense Forces (PDF), Borders Guards and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), like one who raises a monster that later turns against them when it grows up,” Hafiz Mohamed told The EastAfrican.  Mohammed says that the situation needs the involvement of serious and neutral players because the two options available are not attractive. The defeat of the RSF by the SAF would not necessarily mean the end of the war but could lead to a prolonged civil war in many parts of Sudan, he argued. This is because the composition of the RSF is tribal, the majority are Arab tribes from greater Darfur state, as well as some elements from the Baggara tribes of Kordofan.  Divide-and-rule  On the other hand, the victory of the RSF would mean the collapse of the SAF which would be replaced by an ethnically, tribally, and family-constituted militia with a bloody history in Darfur and other parts of Sudan. The takeover by the RSF would lead to an open civil war, and no one can predict when or how it would end.  The war may be prolonged, especially if we look at the RSF and their relationship with the tribes in Western Sudan.  The RSF faces two problems: ambiguity of its political project or its actual absence, and therefore the pursuit of power by some of its leaders through war, which civilians don’t support. In the days before the war, Hemedti presented himself as pro-people fighting a ‘junta’ that had sabotaged people’s will.  Indeed, conflicts between tribes have existed in Sudan for long, and their causes being historical grievances and scarcity of resources (disputes over land and between pastoralists and farmers).  The nature of these conflicts was limited and their effects not profound because the weapons used did not exceed swords, knives, sticks and unsophisticated firearms. Local administrations represented by tribal leaders addressed these conflicts with the help of the government with great success and settlement in accordance with prevailing customs.  When the Muslim Brotherhood regime seized power through a military coup in June 1989, it began to implement a dangerous policy aimed at splitting tribes and dividing civil administrations through the use of money and the temptation of power, and this policy was accompanied by the outbreak of civil wars in a number of regions, and the government steps to manufacture tribal militias and provide them with weapons and funds to fight the war on behalf of the state.  Read: Battles shake Sudan's capital Khartoum  Weapon availability  The Brotherhood regime of Bashir also worked to divide political power and distribute positions in various states on the basis of tribal affiliation in order to gain the loyalty of those tribes, in addition to establishing new states on a tribal basis, as happened in Darfur, to ensure that loyalty.  The proliferation of various weapons in a number of states, especially in the Darfur region, which resulted in large part from the wars in neighbouring countries, especially Chad and Libya, has exacerbated the nature of tribal conflicts, making them bloodier and increasing in the number of victims.  The Brotherhood has since resorted to using the tribe card as a cover to return to the political process. Indeed, there has been unprecedented fighting between tribes that have coexisted peacefully for long times in states such as the Nile River, the Red Sea and others.  Before the military coup, the transitional government, in which the parties participated, made appreciated efforts to stop the tribal fighting, but the worst development under the current regime was emergence of armed rebel movements in Darfur, eastern Sudan, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which claim marginalisation and hence potentially ripe to join either side in fighting, or defend own turf.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVhc3RhZnJpY2FuLmNvLmtlL3RlYS9yZXN0LW9mLWFmcmljYS90cmliYWxpc20tYmFzaGlyLXJlbW5hbnRzLWZ1ZWwtY3Jpc2lzLTQyNDEwNjbSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVlYXN0YWZyaWNhbi5jby5rZS90ZWEvcmVzdC1vZi1hZnJpY2EvdHJpYmFsaXNtLWJhc2hpci1yZW1uYW50cy1mdWVsLWNyaXNpcy00MjQxMDY2P3ZpZXc9aHRtbGFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The United Nations meanwhile warned that humanitarian needs are increasing in Sudan, with aid chief Martin Griffith allocating $22 million in emergency funds to help Sudanese fleeing the violence.  The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) says more than 1 million people have been displaced by the power struggle between Burhan and Daglo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, which has now raged for more than a month.  On Friday, witnesses reported exchanges of fire both in the capital Khartoum and in the troubled Darfur region, where armed civilians have also entered the fray, stoking ethnic and tribal rivalries.  In Central Darfur, RSF fighters are trying to push Burhan's military from its headquarters in the capital Zalingei, residents said.  In South Darfur capital Nyala, fighting killed 18 people Thursday, Sudan's doctors syndicate said. Witnesses told AFP clashes were ongoing Friday.  Cease-fire efforts  The persistent violence has defied regional and international calls for a humanitarian cease-fire.  Sudan has been gripped by economic and political turmoil since veteran leader Omar al-Bashir was ousted by the military in 2019.  Two years later, a coup by Burhan and Daglo derailed a fragile transition to civilian rule, and forces loyal to the two men have been fighting relentlessly since April 15.  Representatives of the warring generals have been in Saudi Arabia, which hosted an Arab summit Friday and has been trying to hammer out a humanitarian cease-fire.  Asked about those talks, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said the focus was ""on reaching a truce that allows Sudanese civilians to take a breather.""  Neighboring South Sudan on Friday defended its own efforts to broker an end to the conflict after the Sudanese foreign ministry protested its hosting of a delegation from Daglo earlier this week.  South Sudan's government ""has continued to play its part within (East African bloc) IGAD with absolute impartiality,"" the foreign ministry in Juba said in a statement.  Daglo's envoy Yusif Isha held talks with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and IGAD officials in Juba on Wednesday.  With neither side appearing to have the upper hand, on Friday Burhan sacked Daglo and appointed three allies to top jobs in the military.  ""General Burhan has issued a constitutional decree assigning Malik Agar to the post of vice-president of the ruling transitional Sovereignty Council, effective today,"" the council said on its Facebook page.  The military also reported that Burhan named General Shamsedding Kabashi to be his deputy, and chose two other loyal officers to be his assistants.  Emergency aid  Agar, a former rebel leader and governor of Blue Nile state on the South Sudan border, signed a peace deal with Khartoum in 2020 and was appointed to the Sovereignty Council in February 2021.  He leads one wing of the SPLM-North, formed in 2011 by northern fighters of the movement which led South Sudan to independence that year.  Observers consider Agar's promotion as a symbolic move which is not expected to impact the power struggle between Burhan and Daglo.  The United Nations has voiced fears the crisis in Khartoum could spread to neighboring countries now flooded with Sudanese fleeing the violence. It renewed its appeals for the safety of civilians caught in the crossfire to be respected.  ""Over a month since the fighting started, UNHCR ... is making an urgent appeal for the safety of civilians and to allow humanitarian aid to move freely in Sudan,"" Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, said Friday.  He said more than 1 million people have been displaced within Sudan or as refugees in neighboring countries.  ""Inside Sudan, people are braving danger, moving notably from Khartoum, Darfur and other unsafe areas,"" Saltmarsh said.  U.N. aid chief Griffiths said on Twitter he was ""allocating $22 million... to support relief efforts in Chad, the Central African Republic, Egypt and South Sudan,"" where Sudanese have sought refuge.  The United States on Friday promised $103 million for Sudan and neighboring countries to support displaced people.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evc3VkYW4tcy1idXJoYW4tc2Fja3Mtcml2YWwtZ2VuZXJhbC1hcy13YXItZHJhZ3Mtb24tLzcxMDE2NTguaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdWRhbi1zLWJ1cmhhbi1zYWNrcy1yaXZhbC1nZW5lcmFsLWFzLXdhci1kcmFncy1vbi0vNzEwMTY1OC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

JACQUES WITT (AFP)  The member nations of the G7, which groups together the world’s most industrialized democracies, closed ranks on the second day of a summit being held in the Japanese city of Hiroshima to send a message of firmness towards China. The final communiqué of the meeting and a specific document related to economic security contain a range of criticisms of Beijing and warnings about the group’s willingness to counter “malign practices” and acts of “economic coercion” in a coordinated manner, referring to Chinese maneuvers that seek to exploit vulnerabilities to take illegitimate advantage in the markets or influence the domestic or foreign policies of exposed countries.  The G7 nations — the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Canada, with the added political representation of the European Union — expressed their willingness to maintain a “stable and constructive” relationship with Beijing and said that their actions are not aimed at harming its development capabilities. The group also stated its strategy is based on a rhetoric of “risk reduction,” linked to dependence on China’s manufacturing might, avoiding the harsher concept of decoupling, which has been championed by many voices in Washington over recent months. However, the G7′s conclusions highlight the worrying prospect of a very tense relationship between Western democracies — with their different sensitivities — and Beijing.  The most notable developments from the summit are in the economic-technological area, which is becoming increasingly relevant in terms of security and geopolitics. The partners announced the implementation of new cooperation mechanisms in this area. The G7 announced the establishment of a Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion with the objective of strengthening “our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion.” The group also warned that those who attempt to use such practices would be met with countermeasures, “in accordance with our respective legal systems.” Many Western countries believe that China is leveraging its dominant position in multiple economic sectors to force policy changes, both in debtor countries and others that are reliant on its assets.  The member nations also announced mechanisms to control investments and exports to China in cutting-edge technologies that could potentially to boost military development. According to a European source, the aim is to plug existing gaps in the precise knowledge surrounding sensitive business transactions. From there, it remains to be seen how these limitations will develop. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of high-end microchips to China, with the cooperation of countries including Japan and the Netherlands, where companies that are indispensable in the production chain are based. In addition, synergies will be promoted to achieve more resilient supply chains and infrastructures while reducing dependencies that expose developing countries to economic coercion.  The final communiqué stresses that the group is not seeking a decoupling but has settled on a policy of risk reduction, which has been the EU’s stance for some time. The text confirms a shift in Washington’s position that had been apparent in two important speeches in recent weeks — one by Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and the other by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  The communiqué also contains several geopolitical messages for Beijing. The G7 has called on China to use its influence on Russia to persuade Moscow to end its war in Ukraine and for Russian forces to withdraw from occupied territories; it also expressed its “serious concern” about developments in the East and South China Seas and expressed its opposition to attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.  The Ukraine war  The Russian invasion of Ukraine was the other big issue on the agenda in Hiroshima, where Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrived on Saturday in an unannounced visit. Prior to the arrival of the Ukrainian president, the U.S. provided Kyiv with a major coup by opening the door to the provision of F-16 fighters while President Joe Biden endorsed the implementation of a training system for Ukrainian pilots. Sullivan added in no uncertain terms: “As the training unfolds in the coming months, we will work with our allies to determine when planes will be delivered, who will be delivering them, and how many.”  Furthermore, the G7 gave impetus to a new round of sanctions and restrictions against Moscow, at the same time as Washington announce plans for a fresh $375 million military aid package for Kyiv. In a specific communiqué on Ukraine, the group stated that “a just peace cannot be achieved without the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces, and this must be included in any call for peace.” The G7 remains strongly committed to supporting Kyiv and underlining there can be no negotiations involving Ukraine without Ukraine’s consent, on the premise that the aggrieved party has the right to set the terms of an eventual dialogue.

"political coup","2013-07-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T04:37:37","Egypt, like Pakistan, is a recipient of IMF loan and holds external debts and liabilities of $155 billion. Pakistan’s external debt is also huge, amounting closer to $126 billion. Today, over 30 per cent of Egypt’s population lives under the poverty line. In Pakistan, poverty is graded somewhere between 35 to 40 per cent. These figures are important to share, as twelve years ago a story began in Egypt — a story which is quite similar to what is happening in Pakistan today. Why must this story be told? It must be told because it’s a story in which the will of the people was subdued and what transpired was the creation of a political system that was a continuation of the old one in which anti status quo forces were defeated and status quo prevailed. From this story of recent past, we must draw some lessons, the biggest of them all is that despite the removal of the only civilian President in 2013 (Mohammed Morsi ruled Egypt for one year from 2012 to 2013) and his replacement by another military President Fattah El Sisi, Egypt has continued to go down the path of external borrowing, poverty and external debt. Should we choose to take the same path?  In 2013 in Egypt, it was the military versus the Muslim Brotherhood. Just a year earlier, Morsi became a candidate for Presidency on people’s support having defeated a military candidate for presidency on a narrow but decisive margin. Hardly six months into his presidency Morsi made constitutional amendments that showcased him as power seeking, power accumulating President, a bad president who was becoming authoritative and dictatorial. The military responded by opposing him and broadcasting a message on state television giving Morsi 48 hours to respond to military and people’s demand and step down as President. The military propagated that if Morsi was left in office, Egypt will become another Somalia and experience a civil war. To add pressure, the Headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood was burnt and looted within hours of this military announcement.  President Morsi rejected the offer and posted a message on YouTube that he was ready to sit and engage and talk with anyone. That message was also taken off the YouTube. His supporters turned out in numbers to conduct marches and arrange large sit-ins to support him; they pitched tents, blocked roads and vouched to stay put until military went back to barracks and President Morsi’s government was restored. Then came one of the blackest days of modern Egyptian history. Egyptian security forces massacred over 800 civilians mostly in Cairo’s Rabaa Square as people gathered there to protest against the military coup of July 2013. This in recent history is considered as the largest killing of demonstrators in a single day. President Morsi was removed and imprisoned. Faced with multiple criminal charges and death sentence the former president kept appearing in the Egyptian courts until June 2019 when during one of the appearances in the court he collapsed and died. President Morsi was an educated man; in fact he was an engineer who got his education from the United States. It was President Morsi who appointed General Sisi as the Commander of Egyptian Armed Forces — not knowing that he was appointing not only a new sheriff of the town but also the new law who less than a year later will replace him as President.  Egyptians had long hoped for true democracy and after the removal of President Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring it finally seemed that Egypt will take that road but it didn’t. The six-week long sit-in by people that supported President Morsi was brought to an end by brutal and merciless killing. The demand for President Morsi’s resignation had culminated into a coup but before that there was one month state of emergency declared in the country which was extended further to two months. In 2014, General Sisi removed his uniform and became the President. He even won a greater majority of votes — 97% to be re-elected as President in 2018 for a period of six years.  Under President Sisi, many people who participated in pro-Morsi demonstrations and riots are still behind bars. At least 75 people have been sentenced to death. Not a single member of security forces has so far been held responsible for the brutal murder and killing of over 800 people (Muslim Brotherhood claims 2,000 people killed by security forces). Ten years later, today the Muslim Brotherhood is an outlawed, banned organisation that is declared terrorist. President Sisi rules with impunity yet the lives of the Egyptian people have not turned for better.  When Hosni Mubarak was removed after a prolonged rule of 30 years, the Egyptians had thought that if Mubarak could go then it was time for dictatorship to finally end; and when Morsi became the first civilian President, the people of Egypt were dreaming modern democracy. That the democracy would be sidelined so soon no one had imagined. Egypt’s experiment with democracy is termed slow speed crash as everyone could see it happening but nobody could stop it. When two parties fight one way of figuring out who is fighting for the just cause is to measure the moral ground on which they stand. Measuring moral ground is simple — the values that one believes in must match the actions on ground. If there is a disconnect between both then you are not standing on the moral ground.  The despotic rule of President Sisi has given only one thing back to the Egyptians — once again ruled by a military President. Egypt is under debt; it is poor and it struggles to live up to its great civilisational potential. It is hoped that Pakistan doesn’t take Egypt’s route for we have our constitution and democratic values. As long as we live up to them and they show in our actions we may evolve into something better than what we are today. We want to be a shackled state not despotic and by no means an absent state.

"political coup","2023-02-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T17:00:00","National Party finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says her party would return a $5 co-payment to medicine prescriptions, after the Government promised to remove the fee in Budget 2023.  Andrea Vance is a senior writer and weekly columnist for the Sunday Star-Times  OPINION: It was a line that probably sounded good down at the golf club.  Nicola Willis’ knee jerked so hard to the news Labour will remove prescription fees that she smacked herself in the face.  Out came the most miserly National budget offering since Bill English’s 2012 paper boy tax: as finance minister she would snatch back that $5.  To be fair to Willis, National’s position was slightly more nuanced than the headlines suggested: the party doesn’t support the policy being universal.  READ MORE:  * Budget 2023: The bread and butter pudding budget  * Nicola Willis sits down with Stuff to talk the political week  * More trust National's leaders on the economy - Taxpayers' Union Curia Poll    Something Christopher Luxon had to clarify the following day, indicating he would target the cut to those with community services or SuperGold cards. On one level, it was slightly adorable as it’s usually her following him onto Morning Report with a mop.  Their political marriage came under the spotlight this week, with speculation that supporters were prepping her to roll him.  Twitter lost its mind at the idea of another bloody National coup, egged on from the podium of truth by shit-stirrer-in-chief Chris Hipkins.  The spark that lit this particular bin fire seemed to be last Sunday night’s Newshub poll, where Luxon dropped 2.4 points to 16.4% in the preferred prime minister rankings, trailing Hipkins on 23.4%.  National has canned leaders over worse numbers, it's true. But since that’s a strategy they’ve yet to perfect, Luxon clings on.  STUFF/Stuff Christopher Luxon, safe for now.  That people like Luxon less than Hipkins is, I agree, not optimal. But this is not National’s only problem.  For while Hipkins is camped firmly in the centre ground, warmed by the embers of his policy bonfire, Luxon et al are scrapping over votes with the wrong team.  National is allowing ACT to drag it further to the right. The miserly medicines policy; 2-for-1 farming regulations revocation (originally a Rodney Hide idea); resurrecting live export shipping; the revival of no-cause rental terminations; youth crime boot camps; and its war on Wellington bureaucracy.  These recent policies seem firmly pitched at the Groanswell demographic: older, male, rural and reactionary.  Odd really, because these voters are National’s traditional base. Their support is – or should already be – banked. If some have drifted away to ACT, National should only be grateful: better David Seymour than Winston Peters.  So why is National defending its flank, not fighting hard in the centre ground in which it badly needs to edge ahead of Labour? The party seems to be struggling to identify its audience.  Contrast that with the confidence of Hipkins and Finance Minister Grant Robertson, who are courting both centrist business leaders in Auckland, and the median voter, by rolling out a Budget that was largely rooted in economic orthodoxy and prudence.  In staying the course with Luxon, National has demonstrated that it has solved the personnel problems that dogged the party between 2017 and 2021.  But it remains stuck in 2008. The party still believes that its pre-GFC policy prescription (tough on crime, beneficiaries and spending) is the answer.  Polls that show it has regained the public’s trust on the economy have only reinforced this complacency. That’s brand National – but that brand is all that is left.  It can’t hike its vote back into the forties, because it hasn’t noticed that the public mood has shifted since John Key resigned.  That’s largely because the yawning equality gap is now too stark to ignore (as Wellington’s hostel fire tragically underlined). That’s especially true with younger voters from millennials down.  So yes, voters have been conditioned to expect fiscal discipline, but they now also demand that not come at the expense of public services, and the poorest and most vulnerable in society.  The trouble is National is only listening to its rusted-on support in the golf and Rotary clubs of New Zealand. These supporters are telling it what it wants – not needs – to hear.  If National stops fighting with ACT for a 5% vote share on the right, it might just secure the extra 5% it needs to roundly beat Labour.

Augustine, 48, a native of Alkode, was buried at Nellipara Holy Family Church Cemetery in Alkode, Kannur. The body was brought home at Alakode in Kannur district around 1.15 am on Saturday, the relatives said.  The mortal remains were brought through Indigo Airlines which reached Kozhikode airport at 9.15 pm on Friday night from Delhi.  Albert's brother-in-law Anoop T. John, relatives Vincent Mancheril, Sonny Mancheril, Baby, Abish, Albin and others had come to the airport to receive the dead body.  The body was brought home in a vehicle arranged by NORKA and was received by Albert's parents, Augustine and Mercy, wife Sybella, son Austin, daughter Marietta, sisters and other relatives.  According to the Indian Embassy in Sudan, the mortal remains were brought to India in a C-17 Airforce evacuation aircraft.  Albert Augustine was hit by a stray bullet and succumbed to his injuries on April 15, 2023.  Congress MP from Kerala's Kannur, K Sudhakaran on April 16, wrote to External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar requesting his urgent intervention to repatriate the mortal remains of his constituent Albert Augustine who lost his life amid ongoing violent conflict in Sudan.  Heavy gunfire and blasts were reported following days of tension between the armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) also claimed at least 56 lives and left around 595 people, including combatants, injured, reported Al Jazeera.  The two sides have been competing for power as political factions negotiate on forming a transitional government after a 2021 military coup. The tensions stem from a disagreement between the military, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, about how the paramilitary force should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee that process, according to Al Jazeera.  The military, 18 months after its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month. Yet, the process has been dominated by a rivalry between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan, also known as Hemeti.  The two generals have been openly criticizing one another in speeches over the past few months, and they have dispatched reinforcements and armoured vehicles to oppose military camps spread around the city.  Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Sudan urged Indians, planning a trip to Sudan, to postpone their plans.  The Indian embassy has issued an appeal to countrymen to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan.  In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, ""Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates.""  The embassy's warning came in light of clashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5tYXRocnViaHVtaS5jb20vbmV3cy9rZXJhbGEvbGFzdC1yaXRlcy1vZi1rYW5udXItbWFuLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1zdWRhbi12aW9sZW5jZS1wZXJmb3JtZWQtaW4tbmF0aXZlLTEuODU3NDY1MdIBf2h0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5tYXRocnViaHVtaS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3Mva2VyYWxhL2xhc3Qtcml0ZXMtb2Yta2FubnVyLW1hbi1raWxsZWQtaW4tc3VkYW4tdmlvbGVuY2UtcGVyZm9ybWVkLWluLW5hdGl2ZS0xLjg1NzQ2NTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Warring factions in Sudan have agreed to a seven-day ceasefire following talks in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, according to a statement from Washington and Riyadh, as fighting that has killed hundreds and displaced more than a million entered its sixth week.  The ceasefire agreement was signed late on Saturday.  It will take effect 48 hours after, at 9:45pm local time (19:45 GMT) on Monday, the sponsors of the talks, the United States and Saudi Arabia, said in their joint statement.  Numerous previous ceasefire agreements were violated. However, this agreement will be enforced by a US-Saudi and international-supported monitoring mechanism, the statement said without providing details.  The agreement also calls for distributing humanitarian assistance, restoring essential services and withdrawing forces from hospitals and essential public facilities.  “It is past time to silence the guns and allow unhindered humanitarian access. I implore both sides to uphold this agreement — the eyes of the world are watching,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.  The fighting between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has plunged the country into chaos. Stocks of food, cash and essentials are rapidly dwindling, and mass looting has hit banks, embassies, aid warehouses and even churches.  A spokesman for the Forces for Freedom of Change – Central Command (FFC-CC) had said prior to the signing of the ceasefire that it was expected to facilitate distribution of humanitarian aid and allow repairs for health, water and electricity services in conflict-affected areas under a “monitoring mechanisms” by international brokers whose details he also did not elaborate.  The FFC-CC is a bloc of political parties that shared power with the army in a transitional government before the country’s 2021 military coup. Civilian groups have criticised it for offering little support to them during the ongoing conflict.      Will this truce hold?  Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from the capital’s twin city, Omdurman, said the agreement will freeze the conflict, with the warring sides allowed to hold on to their current positions.  “The Rapid Support Forces will keep control of the presidential palace and the army keeps control of its headquarters, the General Command of the Armed Forces. As for the airport, the RSF has more control of the facilities there, so they will keep that,” she said.  But the Sudanese people — who are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance — were deeply sceptical of the agreement, said Morgan.  “People say that they are not sure if this ceasefire will hold. They’ve seen how previous ceasefires have played out. And they say that until Tuesday or Wednesday, when and if they do not hear the sound of artillery in their neighbourhoods and when and if they see humanitarian aid, then they will know if there’s an actual ceasefire.”  The ceasefire came as residents in Omdurman and Khartoum North, the two cities that lie across the Nile from Khartoum, reported heavy air raids.      Some of the attacks took place near the state broadcaster in Omdurman, the witnesses said.  “We faced heavy artillery fire early this morning, the whole house was shaking,” Sanaa Hassan, a 33-year-old living in the al-Salha neighbourhood of Omdurman, told the Reuters news agency by phone.  “It was terrifying, everyone was lying under their beds. What’s happening is a nightmare,” she said.  The RSF is embedded in residential districts, drawing almost continual air attacks by the regular armed forces.  Witnesses in Khartoum said that the situation was relatively calm, although sporadic gunshots could be heard.  Fighting in Darfur  The conflict, which began on April 15, has killed at least 705 people and wounded at least 5,287, according to the World Health Organization. Some 1.1 million people have been displaced internally and into neighbouring countries.  In recent days, ground fighting has flared once again in the Darfur region, in the cities of Nyala and Zalenjei.  Both sides blamed each other in statements late on Friday for sparking the fighting in Nyala, one of the country’s largest cities, which had for weeks been relatively calm due to a locally-brokered truce.  A local activist told Reuters there were sporadic gun clashes near the city’s main market close to army headquarters on Saturday morning. Almost 30 people have died in the two previous days of fighting, according to activists.  The war broke out in Khartoum after disputes over plans for the RSF to be integrated into the army under an internationally-backed deal to shift Sudan towards democracy following decades of conflict-ridden rule by former President Omar al-Bashir, who had appointed himself as leader of the country after staging a coup in 1989.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjEvc3VkYW5zLWFybXktcmFwaWQtc3VwcG9ydC1mb3JjZXMtc2lnbi03LWRheS1jZWFzZWZpcmXSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8yMS9zdWRhbnMtYXJteS1yYXBpZC1zdXBwb3J0LWZvcmNlcy1zaWduLTctZGF5LWNlYXNlZmlyZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fighting has ravaged Myanmar since the coup, including renewed clashes with ethnic rebel groups as well as the formation of dozens of ""People's Defence Forces"" now battling the junta.  In its crackdown against dissent, the ""military has killed a minimum of 3,500 civilians"" and the number of political prisoners has swelled to 20,000, said the report.  It added that at least $1 billion ""worth of weapons, dual-use technology, and materials used to manufacture weapons"" were brought in by the junta from the day of the coup on February 1, 2021, to December 2022, primarily from suppliers in Russia, China, Singapore, and India.  ""These weapons, and the materials to manufacture more of them, have continued to flow uninterrupted to the Myanmar military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for atrocity crimes,"" said Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar.  According to the report, the junta imported $406 million in arms and equipment from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state owned entities. Indian companies and state-owned entities accounted for $51 million in goods.  Companies based in Singapore provided an additional $254 million in supplies, while $28 million in equipment came from entities based in Thailand.  ""Russia and China-based entities are critical to the Myanmar military for transfers of advanced weapon systems and their spare parts,"" Andrews wrote.  The imports have easily circumvented international sanctions prohibiting arms trade with Myanmar, according to Andrews.  His report singled out an attack on an opposition-controlled village that killed around 170 people, including children, describing it as an example of a ""probable"" war crime.  Andrews wrote that a fighter jet dropped two bombs on Pazi Gyi village in central Sagaing region, targeting the opening ceremony of an office of the National Unity Government -- a shadow administration dominated by lawmakers from ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party.  Soon after, two attack helicopters arrived at the village and began firing on survivors and first responders, he added.  ""This brutal attack is also another example of how the Myanmar junta is using internationally supplied arms and associated materials to commit atrocities,"" the report said.  Special rapporteurs are mandated by the UN Human Rights Council but are unpaid, independent experts who do not speak for the United Nations.

""The medical supplies were carefully selected in order to meet the needs of emergencies and chronic diseases,” said Salah Daak, director of the Qatar Red Crescent office in Sudan.

The UN has appealed for $2.56 billion to provide aid to refugees who have fled their homes over the ongoing conflict in Sudan.

Honduras has one of the world’s strictest abortion bans, with a constitutional prohibition on terminating pregnancy in all cases, even rape. (AP Photo/Ginnette Riquelme)  Honduras has one of the world’s strictest abortion bans, with a constitutional prohibition on terminating pregnancy in all cases  TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- In remote mountain villages, urban neighborhoods, along the Caribbean coast — despite Honduras’ national abortion ban and amid suffocating social and religious opposition, women are terminating pregnancies with the help of clandestine networks seeking to make the procedure as safe as possible.  The networks use code words, aliases, encrypted messages, burner phones and other tactics to disguise their activity. Most participants don’t know one another, or any specifics beyond their role in the chain that ultimately provides information and the abortion pills endorsed by the World Health Organization.  Some Latin American countries -- Argentina, Colombia, Mexico -- are widening access to abortion, while many U.S. states are restricting it. Honduras doesn’t enforce its ban as strictly as its neighbors, but the possible punishment of up to six years in prison is a constant threat.  WHAT DOES HONDURAN LAW SAY?  Honduras’ total abortion ban dates to 1985. Previously, abortion was permitted in three instances: rape, risk to the mother or nonviability of the fetus.  After the 2009 coup d’état that removed then-President Manuel Zelaya, husband of current President Xiomara Castro, the emergency contraceptive pill was banned. It marked the start of several administrations linked to ultraconservative churches.  In 2021, an amendment to add the abortion ban directly to the constitution was adopted. The measure also increased the number of lawmakers needed to change that part of the constitution. It cannot be “repealed or modified” by other legal provisions, according to the text.  HOW DO THE NETWORKS WORK?  Activists learn tricks of the trade little by little. “Now there is less naiveté and more technology, virtual phone numbers, disappearing messages,” said an activist with 12 years of experience.  Some women seeking abortions call a hotline publicized on the internet as “La Línea.” They’re asked questions to try to confirm the request is real and not an attempt to track down activists. Later, calls are triangulated; sometimes phone chips are switched to avoid identifying numbers.  Other women learn about the networks via hushed word of mouth. Either way, women seeking abortion help are ultimately put in touch with the person who will be her guide, introduced via pseudonym.  The guide asks basic health questions, including how far along the pregnancy is, and requests that an ultrasound be sent through a secure application. Then the challenge is obtaining the pills – never referred to as medication abortions, or with their pharmaceutical names, but as ordinary objects, code names that change from group to group.  The networks often sneak misoprostol and mifepristone in from Mexico.  WHY IS THERE SO MUCH FEAR IF NO WOMEN ARE KNOWN TO BE CURRENTLY IMPRISONED?  With the law as it is, the threat of prison is always there.  Women also worry they’ll be stigmatized or shamed, sometimes by those closest to them, because of social pressures and the enormous influence of the Catholic and Protestant churches.  There are criminal consequences outside prison. Some women may be banned from leaving the country or may be unable to obtain the criminal record clearance needed for most employment.  Some activists say they received intimidating and threatening messages, sent anonymously to their phones and generally coinciding with political instability. They also say some women have fled the country over harassment and legal complaints.  The Honduras Gynecologists Association says the current legislation is inconsistent with science and leaves doctors vulnerable to accusations of violating the constitution every time they save a woman’s life.  ARE THESE KINDS OF MEDICAL ABORTIONS SAFE?  The use of the abortion pills is endorsed by the World Health Organization.  The network makes sure each woman has a guide during her abortion who can monitor how it is going remotely and respond to questions, in an attempt to make it as safe as possible.

"political coup","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T05:33:31","Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed high dissatisfaction over the final report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on the human rights related-political developments in the West African republic of Mali.  That report released on May 12, 2023, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on the events in Mali largely concerns “crimes” committed in March 2022 near the town of Moura in one of the central provinces of the country.  Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, during her weekly media briefing on May 17, said it was regrettable that OHCHR experts have essentially become involved in a misinformation campaign. Sadly, the report was not based on official information or the results of an investigation conducted by the Malian authorities but with reference to anonymous sources and some ostensibly trustworthy resources.  “The goal of planting this sort of information is to persuade the international public that the Malian and foreign military personnel were responsible for the killings of local civilians. Certain Western countries and the media under their control are clearly content with these allegations,” she said.  According to her, there should a clear format specifically for this type of reports. There must be no anonymous sources or unidentified interviewees a priori. Therefore, it is a document, not an expert’s private opinion, that must rely on trustworthy, credible and verifiable information. “On many occasions in the UN, at the Secretariat and among the member states, we have noted attempts to globally spread misinformation that were eventually disavowed by life itself. We have learned to trust but verify. This is why we also noted this particular report,”she angrily explained.  Zakharova, however, believes that this one-sided and non-constructive approach by the OHCHR risks undermining the reputation of this UN body and prompts questions about the Office’s impartiality. “We strongly urge UN experts to exercise their mandate in a depoliticised manner and strictly adhere to the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-discrimination, mutually respectful dialogue and cooperation,” concluded Zakharova.  Prior to the March 22 report by the Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, there were a number of other well-researched reports. For instance, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted last year that Malian forces and foreign fighters killed 300 civilians in Moura, late March. The report described as “the worst single atrocity reported in Mali’s decade-long armed conflict.” Several witnesses and other sources identified the foreign white soldiers as Russians to Human Rights Watch.  According to the report, the massacre took place over four days, with the vast majority of the victims being ethnic Fulanis group. Moura is small provincial town, epicenter of conflict-related violence. “The soldiers patrolled through town, executing several men as they tried to flee, and detaining hundreds of unarmed men from the market and their homes. The incident is the worst single atrocity reported in Mali’s decade-long armed conflict,” the HRW report said.  “Abuses by armed Islamist groups is no justification at all for the military’s deliberate slaughter of people in custody. The Malian government is responsible for this atrocity – the worst in Mali in a decade — whether carried out by Malian forces or associated foreign soldiers,” the report said.  Experts interviewed for this article argued that Russia has not carried it own investigations and has not presented any report since the accusation over the mass murder allegedly committed by the security forces, including the foreign ones, in Moura. This city is small provincial town which has a population of around 10,000 is the epicenter of conflict-related violence.  As well-known facts, two military coups have taken place in Mali since August 2020. in the latest, Col. Assimi Goita and his government have halted relations with France, moved closer to Russia. Several reports indicate that Russia has assigned, what is officially described as military instructors to Mali. The United States, France and European Union say the instructors are operatives from the Russian private security firm Wagner.  As has been in the past, under the new military leadership harrowing accounts of human rights abuses emerged. In addition to the previous abuses, the late March massacre of about 300 people in the village Malian village of Moura became very questionable, and broadly called for international condemnation.  Moscow is highly interested in exploring natural resources, has mining concession agreements in exchange with military weapons and equipment. The military is keen on fighting what it termed “active terrorist groups” in the country. On the other hand, Moscow is aggressively moving its military-technical cooperation, shows the desire to ensure the country’s defense capabilities, especially in the face of the persisting terrorist threat in the region.  According to several reports especially from Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Deutsche Welle as well as British Broadcasting Corporation, Mali’s authorities have an agreement with the Russian private military company Wagner Group that replaced the French military. Reuters reported that the contract could be worth $10.8 million a month. Mali has taken delivery of military equipment and a few hundreds of military experts and instructors are operating in the country till today.  For the African Union and ECOWAS, the scale and gravity of Mali’s military leadership violating human rights, of course, is a strong signal to hold them for responsible for this crimes which many have described reports and images of civilian killings as disturbing. Most importantly, there must be thorough systematic investigations to ascertain the primary causes, the implications and possibly to take punitive actions.  During the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Union (AU) held in Addis Ababa, African leaders spoke the most significant questions especially those including peace and security necessary for sustainable development, halting the frequency of military’s appearance unto the political scene and consolidating continental efforts for improving economic development, especially during this crucial time of geopolitical changes sweeping across the world.  Ethiopia as a host country, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, interestingly used the phrase – “African solutions to African problems” – seven times during his speech delivered on February 18 at the opening session. Besides everything, in relation to all existing conflicts and disputes on the continent, Abiy Ahmed uniquely emphasised that “it is necessary to mobilise collective efforts to resolve them and must be confined to this continent and quarantined from the contamination of non-African interference.”  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, stressing the importance of “transparency and accountability” in security operations, has also called on the Malian army and its “bilateral partners” – widely interpreted as an implicit reference to Russian mercenaries – to respect their international obligations amid growing concerns over human rights violations.  Many regional and foreign organisations have repeatedly urged the military leaders or adminstration to take efforts toward resolving outstanding political issues especially those relating transition to constitutional elected government and observe strictly the laid down principles of democracy.  With a population of nearly 20 million people, Mali is a landlocked country located on rivers of Senegal and Niger in West Africa. Since its independence from the French colony, it has had not only persistent political and governance problems, but also difficulties in tapping its existing resources. Worse is the previous governments’ adopting of poor economic policies which have resulted in current condition of under-development in the country.  As a developing country, it ranks at the bottom of the United Nations Development Index (2020 report). The Republic of Mali, the former french colony, is under ECOWAS sanctions and has been stripped off the membership of the African Union (AU) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbW9kZXJuZGlwbG9tYWN5LmV1LzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvcnVzc2lhLWV4cHJlc3Nlcy1kaXNwbGVhc3VyZS1vdmVyLXVuY2hycy1yZXBvcnQtb24tbWFsaS_SAWJodHRwczovL21vZGVybmRpcGxvbWFjeS5ldS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL3J1c3NpYS1leHByZXNzZXMtZGlzcGxlYXN1cmUtb3Zlci11bmNocnMtcmVwb3J0LW9uLW1hbGkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political coup","2019-04-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T20:45:00","The government of pillage is pushing on with its sell-off of the state. The coalition of the ultra-nationalists and the Haredim forgoes requiring ultra-Orthodox schools to teach core subjects and at the same time advances what Bezalel Smotrich calls “core missions.”  Smotrich, who is the finance minister and a minister in the Defense Ministry, ordered all relevant government ministries to prepare for the absorption of an additional half- million settlers in the West Bank within two years. He calls this bizarre plan, which will eliminate any possibility of territorial compromise and peace with the Palestinians, once and for all, and bring the wrath of the international community upon Israel, a core mission of the government.  Doubling the number of settlers, as Smotrich proposes to do, requires infrastructure work. He ordered the improvement of infrastructure for all types of Jewish settlements in the territories, large and small, those the State of Israel – and only the State of Israel – considers legal as well as illegal outposts. This includes the areas of public transportation, education, employment – everything that is needed.  In any case the government plans to legalize the illegal outposts in the months to come.  Jurists say efforts to implement the plan will face immediate challenges in the High Court of Justice, which is unlikely to approve it in its current form. But who knows whether the court will survive until then in its current form. The judicial coup has not yet been shelved.  And who will pay for all this plenty?  The estimated cost of the plan runs into the billions. The draft budget for 2023 and 2024, the time frame proposed by Smotrich for his program, does contain funding for construction and for new infrastructure in settlements, but in a much smaller scope than what is needed to handle the population increase that he envisions. Money isn’t a problem, Smotrich said, promising to come up with funding sources. From where, exactly? Perhaps he’s counting on the help of God.  And who will provide the security for the hundreds of thousands of new settlers?  The defense establishment has not received enough information to draw up an opinion on it. When they do so, they are expected to object to much of it, particularly those parts involving unauthorized settlements in locations with a high potential for friction with Palestinians. But what do such trifles have to do with Smotrich’s messianic project? The military and Israelis living inside the Green Line who just want a normal life are all Messiah’s donkeys.  The government coup is part of a messianic political program that seeks to annex the territories and distort the founding values of Israeli society and the state. The Israeli donkey must shake off its burden and intensify its resistance and the international community must wake up.  Together, we must stop this insanity.

"political coup","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T03:57:00","Erdogan is facing a runoff for the first time in his 20-year rule  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cruises on Sunday into the final week before an historic runoff election as the big favourite to extend two decades of his Islamic-rooted rule until 2028.  Secular leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu gave the opposition's best performance of Erdogan's dominant era in May 14 parliament and presidential polls.  The retired bureaucrat of Kurdish Alevi descent broke ethnic barriers and Erdogan's stranglehold on the media and state institutions to win almost 45 percent of the vote.  But Erdogan still came within a fraction of a point of topping the 50-percent threshold needed to win in the first round.  The 69-year-old leader did it despite Turkey's worst economic crisis since the 1990s and opinion surveys showing him headed for his first national election defeat.  Kilicdaroglu will now need to rally his deflated troops and beat the odds yet again to wrest back power for the secular party that ruled Turkey for most of the 20th century.  The Eurasia Group consultancy put Erdogan's chances of winning next Sunday at 80 percent.  ""It will be an uphill struggle for Kilicdaroglu in the second round,"" Hamish Kinnear of the Verisk Maplecroft consulting firm agreed.  - 'Millions of patriots' -  Erdogan rode a nationalist wave that saw smaller right-wing parties pick up nearly 25 percent of the parallel parliamentary vote.  Kilicdaroglu is courting these voters in the second presidential round.  The 74-year-old revamped his campaign team and tore up his old playbook for the most fateful week of his political career.  He has replaced chatty clips that he used to record from his kitchen with desk-thumping speeches and pledges to immediately rid Turkey of millions of migrants.  ""As soon as I come to power, I will send all the refugees home,"" he said in his first post-election address.  He has chased the endorsement of a little-known ultra-nationalist, whose tiny vote share pushed Turkey into its first presidential runoff.  Story continues  And he has punched back against Erdogan's claims that he was associating with ""terrorists"" -- a code word for Kurdish groups fighting for broader autonomy in Turkey's southeast.  ""We have millions of patriots to reach,"" Kilicdaroglu said.  But Kilicdaroglu's sharp right turn could prove costly with voters from Kurdish regions that overwhelmingly backed him in the first round.  Kurds embraced Erdogan during his first decade in power because he worked to lift many of their social restrictions.  They turned against him when Erdogan formed his own alliance with Turkey's nationalist forces and began to unleash purges after surviving a failed coup attempt in 2016.  Kilicdaroglu's new and more overtly nationalist tone echoes a secular era during which Kurds -- who make up nearly a fifth of Turkey's population -- were stripped of basic rights.  - 'Severe currency crisis' -  The political battles are being accompanied by market turmoil that set in once it became apparent that Erdogan was on course to keep his grip on power.  Turkey's recent years have been roiled by economic upheaval that erased many of the gains of Erdogan's more prosperous early rule.  Most of the problems stem from Erdogan's fervent fight against interest rates -- an approach some analysts link to his adherence to Islamic rules against usury.  ""I have a thesis that interest rates and inflation are positively correlated,"" he told CNN this week.  ""The lower the interest rates, the lower inflation will be.""  The markets' trust in more conventional economics have put massive pressure on the lira.  Government data showed Turkey's foreign currency reserves -- topped up by aid from Arab allies -- dropping by $9 billion and reaching their lowest levels in 21 years in the week running up to the first-round vote.  Analysts think most of the money was spent on efforts to prop up the lira against sharp and politically sensitive falls.  ""There is now a very real risk that an Erdogan victory could lead to macroeconomic instability in Turkey, including the threat of a severe currency crisis,"" Capital Economic warned.  - 'Special relationship with Putin' -  But Erdogan has exuded confidence since the first round.  He has ridiculed his rival's nationalist overtures and stuck by some of his more controversial policies -- including an increasingly strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Erdogan's turn towards Russia has helped secure billions of dollars of relief on Turkey's huge energy bill.  ""Russia and Turkey need each other in every field possible,"" Erdogan told CNN.  He also argued that his more ""balanced"" stance towards Putin helped him negotiate a UN-backed deal with Russia under which Ukraine was allowed to resume exporting grain.  ""This was possible because of our special relationship with President Putin,"" Erdogan said.  He also scoffed at remarks from 2019 by US President Joe Biden -- recalled by Erdogan's allies throughout the campaign -- calling Erdogan an ""autocrat"".  ""Would a dictator ever enter a runoff election?"" Erdogan asked.  zak/gil","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZXJkb2dhbi1leWVzLXRoaXJkLWRlY2FkZS1ydWxlLTAzNTc0ODI0MC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VyZG9nYW4tZXllcy10aGlyZC1kZWNhZGUtcnVsZS0wMzU3NDgyNDAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All of this has been captured in the new book ‘Definitely: The Official Story of Def Leppard’, a seriously large slab of words and pictures that throws you right in the action from the start. As part of a round of promo for the multitude of projects they’ve got going at the moment (their brilliant new orchestral album, world tour etcetera), they stopped off at the Royal Festival Hall on London’s famous South Bank to do a lengthy chat about their incredible career.  Seeing Def Leppard in huge halls is nothing new but few have had the chance to hear them talk about their story in such a relaxed and warm way. There was an easy intimacy on the stage from the very first moment the band emerged from the wings, Joe Elliott, Rick Savage, Rick Allen, Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell dapper in suits and walking on like a gang of mates.  Hosted by journalist Michael Hann, the evening was one full of anecdotes and illustrations that gave those attending a chance to look into their extraordinary world. Here was a band that have been through thick and thin, the huge highs and crushing lows making them what they are today, a mind-boggling adventure played out to the soundtrack of loud guitars.  Starting, rightly, from the very beginning, the band spoke about the raw excitement of finding their voice and style whilst getting to grips with the sheer mechanics of learning to play and sing together. Whilst some of the stories were familiar to the die-hard fans in the audience, it was a fascinating treasure trove, heightened by the camaraderie of the five and experiences brought thrillingly to life as the five bounced off each other.  From Joe’s parents keeping a wallpaper sample binder as a scrapbook of the band’s rise, the huge coup of luring Sounds legends Geoff Barton and Ross Halfin up from London to Sheffield and the two getting roaringly drunk, an eye-opening conversation with Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott and beyond, this was a night of tales of rock ‘n’ roll dreams come true.  The main thing captured by both the evening and the book is that, with determination, hard work and self-belief you CAN move mountains. Remarkably down to earth considering their status, these five individuals have taken on the world and all that can throw at them and won, the scars there but the victories shining brighter.  They may be gods of rock but beside the huge shows, the lights and the fame, here is a bunch of working-class lads who have a chemistry with each other and the fans and that, ladies and gentlemen, is worth its weight in gold.

"coup","2024-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T20:14:22","From established stage authors to wannabe first-timers, playwrights from all over the region are drawn each year to create a unique ten-minute play festival called The Variations Project. Founded in 2005 by Run of the Mill Theater and continued for a time by Baltimore’s Arena Players, the Project has been curated since 2014 by Rapid Lemon Productions.  RLP is getting ready to open the 2023 version, “Variations on The End,” which will appear at the Maryland Institute College of Art next month. We caught up with a few of the show’s playwrights to talk about their experience.  How long have you been involved with the Variations Project? What initially attracted you to it?  Malik Berry: This is my second year being involved with the Variations Project. I found their flyer at the Charles, saw they welcomed plays from all kinds of writers, and thought I’d jump at it. It was a great way to get me back into writing for the stage after my one brush with it in high school.  Larry Malkus: Since 2015. “Walter’s Claw Hammer” for “Variations on Family,” I think.  Allegra Hatem: This is my first time being a part of the Variations Project! Normally the hardest part of writing for me is getting started, so having a theme that the show is centered around was a huge draw for me.  Sharon Goldner: I’ve been with Variations since 2007. The thing about Variations is that they really do care. It starts with the playwrights coming together to informally hear their play read out loud, giving the playwrights the chance for revision and do-overs. Even kids on playgrounds everywhere are jealous over Variations’ do-overs. Variations knows that it all starts with the playwright, and they never lose sight of that.  There are lots of ten-minute play festivals nowadays. How is the Variations Project different?  Tess Huth: Variations has a community feel to it that I think a lot of ten-minute play festivals don’t. The readings prior to the production especially feel like they’re bringing a close-knit group of people together. I’ve made connections with new artists and reunited with some of my favorite collaborators in those rooms. Coming to those readings and the performances feels like coming home.  Crystal Sewell: The Variations Project is careful to lean towards the integrity of the script and asks before making changes that could threaten that.  R.A. Pauli: What makes Variations unique in my experience is that submissions are not blind. Every submission gets a reading and receives feedback from other playwrights, actors, and directors. Playwrights must be present for each reading of their work. Playwrights have an opportunity to revise and resubmit for another reading and the actors who are doing the readings are simultaneously under consideration for casting in the festival. It is also unique that the Variations audiences are invited to help select the theme for the following year’s festival. I have submitted to scores of ten-minute play festivals over the years, but have yet to see any that have the combination of features the Variations Project offers.  What else have you done that Maryland audiences might have seen recently?  R.A. Pauli: In Spring of ’22, my play “‘Shrooms” was produced at Fells Point Corner Theatre, and that fall my play “Bright Creatures of the Air” appeared in “Variations on Change” by Rapid Lemon Productions.  Crystal Sewell: Besides “I Don’t Want Your Effin Pancakes,” which can be seen in this production, I have had two other plays produced in the Variations Project. I had “(Un)Veiled” produced in the 2019’s production of “Variations on Myth” and “Bud” produced in the 2021’s production of “Variations on Holidays.”  Allegra Hatem: I’ve been involved with St. Mark’s Players in D.C. a lot this past year. I played Nina in “Vanya & Sonia & Masha & Spike,” assisted with props for “Perfect Arrangement,” and designed props for “The Color Purple.”  Joe Dennison: The Joe Show Highlandtown Gallery (art show).  Any future projects?  Jerome Alexander: I’m currently working on an episodic dramedy piece that touches on the subjects of lost love, revenge, acceptance and maturity, all centered around an unorthodox class reunion.  Malik Berry: I have a short story being printed in an upcoming anthology from A Coup of Owls Press. Aside from that, I’m working on organizing a short story collection, more plays, including a full one I’m looking to produce. It’ll be funny, strange, and thought provoking.  Allegra Hatem: Nothing lined up! I’m currently working on first drafts of two full-lengths musicals: “A Life Told Out of Order,” a non-chronological show about a young woman diagnosed with early-onset dementia (co-written with my friend Sophie Roth-Douquet), and “Perfect Match,” about a sorority girl who tries to find a liver donor on Tinder.  Sharon Goldner: I do live shows (musical & comedy) every morning in the shower, but I guess you mean shows where real people can attend. Thus far, I’ve got plays appearing in NC and San Francisco later this summer. I am also working with award-winning dramaturge Mark Bly on several of my plays.  What should audiences expect when they see this year’s production?  Larry Malkus: “Variations on The End” is a warning, a threat, a joke, and a beginning.  Jerome Alexander: The audience should expect a mix of pain, humor, preposterousness, acceptance and dissonance. The full human experience.  Tess Huth: I don’t think audiences should bring any expectations to the theater with them when they come to see the show. Because Variations is just that: varied. When I directed, there were dogs and Medusas and erotic food; this year, it could be anything. Come in with an open heart and mind so you’re ready to be surprised.  R.A. Pauli: Expect the expected to appear in totally unexpected ways! Expect to have a great evening of theater, from the beginning until…The End!  “Variations on The End” will be presented June 9 -25, 2023 as a full production of 11 world premiere ten-minute plays, directed by Jalice Ortiz-Corral. Performances will appear in the BBOX, located in the Gateway building on the corner of Mount Royal and North Avenues, 1601 W Mt Royal Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21217. For more information about dates, times, and tickets, go online.  Patrons are advised that the plays in “Variations on The End” explore a wide range of topics; some of which include self-harm, suicide, and murder.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbWR0aGVhdHJlZ3VpZGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1xdWljay01LXdpdGgtcGxheXdyaWdodHMtb2YtdGhlLTIwMjMtdmFyaWF0aW9ucy1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, he ultimately decided to play for his father's alma mater and LeBron was in attendance for his son's announcement.  He was visibly emotional and was seen wiping away tears.  Coup for USC  James' decision to sign with USC is a major coup for the school as he is a talented player who is expected to be a star at the collegiate level and his arrival could help USC become a contender in the Pac-12 Conference.  The youngster's decision to play college basketball at USC is also a major moment for his father.  LeBron is one of the greatest basketball players of all time and has won four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, and four NBA Finals MVP awards, as well as being a two-time Olympic gold medalist.  LeBron has always said that he wanted his son to follow in his footsteps and play college basketball.  Now that Bronny has made his decision, LeBron can finally relax and enjoy watching his son play the game he loves.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS9sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1sYWtlcnMvMjAyMy8wNS8xOS82NDY3NWUwMTIyNjAxZGI3MGI4YjQ1YTYuaHRtbNIBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS9sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1sYWtlcnMvMjAyMy8wNS8xOS82NDY3NWUwMTIyNjAxZGI3MGI4YjQ1YTYuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An official from the group said that the junta had launched airstrikes on Kanbalu Township and was patrolling from village to village. They have attacked over 24 villages in the township and destroyed so much that the residents of 24 villages cannot return.

"coup","2023-08-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T18:55:31","In Asian Media this week: Big economies talk about rules-based order. Plus: empire strikes back in Imran Khan showdown; hot Asian summers will add to climate change; US return to Philippines sparks sex abuse fears; Gandhi bests Modi in latest test; post-poll scenarios after progressive victory in Thailand.  The G7 is meeting this weekend in Hiroshima, the home of Japanese Prime Minister (and summit host) Fumio Kishida – and denuclearisation will be a key agenda item.  The summit will discuss concerns about the weapons programmes of North Korea, China and Russia and, says an opinion piece in The Japan Times, will aim to send a message that denuclearisation is critical to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and stopping nuclear war.  The article, written by Stephen Nagy, a professor at Tokyo’s International Christian University, says the top priority will be preserving the rules-based order – ensuring that the international community adheres to a set of norms and principles that govern the behaviour of states.  Other issues for the G7, a grouping of the big western economies – the US, France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Canada, plus Japan – will be China’s global and regional ambitions (including its approach to Taiwan and to the Ukraine war) and developing relations with the Global South.  “China has … made inroads in building strong relations with the Global South, the article says.  But a senior columnist with Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post takes the view that questions about international financial risk should be high on the agenda – that the G7 has forgotten the Bill Clinton campaign’s crucial slogan: “It’s the economy, stupid.”  Anthony Rowley, a veteran of Asian economic reporting, says in a column: “There is a growing threat of recession hanging over the global economy, ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, tightening credit, weakening investment sentiment, banking stresses, softening employment and supply chain issues.  “But you might never know it from looking at the G7 summit agenda.”  SCMP notes in a separate story that China’s Xi Jinping is hosting a Central Asian summit at the same time as the G7 gathering. He is meeting the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the historic city of Xian.  “Beijing has long seen Central Asia as a frontier critical for the country’s trade expansion and energy security, and the stability in Xinjiang, the far western region where its treatment of Uygur Muslims has been among the most contentious issues between China and the West,” SCMP says.  ‘Creeping shadow of army rule’ in Pakistan  The civil and political mayhem in Pakistan is continuing, the result of the confrontation between former prime minister Imran Khan and his army and political opponents.  Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was arrested last week, with his detention sparking attacks on public property and military installations. Ten people were killed in the clashes and more than 4,000 arrested, aljazeera.com reported.  Khan was released at the weekend but this week police surrounded his home in Lahore, claiming he was sheltering dozens of people involved in the violent protests.  A commentary piece in Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper says Khan crossed the Rubicon by lashing out at the army chief. “Now the empire has struck back,” writes journalist and author Zahid Hussain. “Some of [the protestors] could face trial under the Army Act.  “The creeping shadow of army rule is becoming more pronounced.”  Khan is backed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) and the President, Dr Arif Alvi, says a backgrounder in India’s The Statesman newspaper. The government and the army chief, General Asim Munir are on the other side.  “Neither is willing to back down,” says the writer, an unnamed retired army general.  “Every case pertaining to Imran is personally heard by the CJP and immediate relief is granted,” the general says. “The President briefs Imran on the goings on within the government…  “The army chief is anti-Imran and Imran rightly believes him to be his personal enemy. His selection was made solely on this criterion and with the intent of keeping Imran away from the PM’s chair.”  Billion air-conditioners for Asia’s hot, dry summers  Summer in Asia has started hot – and is forecast to stay hot in the coming months. This points to a worrying side effect of global warming – that summer heat in warmer countries will lead to more coal being used to generate electricity, adding to global warming.  According to a Bloomberg report published in The Japan Times, if Asia avoids drought this year the growth in renewable generation might meet the increase in electricity demand, reducing the need to burn more coal.  “Unfortunately, that prospect is looking less likely than it was only a few months ago,” the story says. “Regional climate outlooks suggest the coming summer will be hot and dry.”  Yunnan province, home of the headwaters of the Yangtze River that feeds many of China’s vast dams, has been gripped by drought this year.  Electricity production is suffering. Nationwide hydro generation fell by 8 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Dams were producing power at about 26 per cent of full capacity, the worst performance since 2014.  In warmer countries, power demand in winter is minimal. But in summer, a billion air-conditioners send demand soaring.  A second Bloomberg piece in the same paper says that summer in India is now testing the limits of human survival. “In recent weeks, more than a dozen people died in central India and thousands crowded hospitals with heatstroke symptoms,” the story says. “Temperatures will hover around 45 degrees Celsius across the northern plains this weekend.”  Demand for air-conditioners is surging in countries where incomes and temperatures are both rising – such as China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.  The story says air-conditioner sales jump when yearly household incomes near $US10,000, as it has in Indonesia and the Philippines and soon will in India.  “By one estimate, the world will add 1 billion ACs before the end of the decade,” the story says. “The market is projected to nearly double before 2040. That’s good for measures of public health and economic productivity; it’s unquestionably bad for the climate.”  Campaigner recalls ‘recreation sex land’ in Philippines  When Shay Cullen recently saw US warships steaming into Subic Bay in the Philippines, he was overcome with feelings of foreboding, frustration and a desire for justice.  Cullen, a Catholic missionary who has lived in the Philippines for more than 50 years, has long campaigned to protect women and children from sexual abuse, sex slavery and human trafficking.  Writing in ucanews.com, the Asian Catholic news site, he says seeing the ships reminded him of the time the US Navy occupied the Subic Bay base and the nearby Olongapo City became a US recreation sex land.  “Women and children were sold every day and night for a handful of dollars to drunken, sex-starved US sailors,” Cullen says. “HIV-AIDS, venereal diseases and drug trafficking were commonplace.  “The very wrong saying: ‘What is good for the US serviceman is good for the Filipino’ damaged the moral fabric and Christian beliefs of Filipinos.  “As a result, the sexual exploitation of young women and even children, domestic sexual abuse, human trafficking, and online sexual abuse of children for money are now widespread.  “It all stems from the ‘Poison Seed’ of the US bases and the sex industry that was allowed to thrive.”  Cullen says the local authorities in Olongapo and Subic are striving to maintain high standards. Brothels or sex hotels are not allowed in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.  But he cautions: “Let is avoid repeating the same old mistake.”  Historic win over Modi’s ‘relentless disharmony’  The first test of strength between PM Narendra Modi’s BJP and Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party since Gandhi was thrown out of parliament in March has brought victory to the opposition party.  Elections last weekend for the parliament of Karnataka, a south-western Indian State, saw Congress win 135 seats in the 224-member house.  A report in The Hindu newspaper’s Frontline magazine said the victory was historic, as no party had won a majority in Assembly elections in the state since 2004.  “The BJP, which won 66 seats this time…will be smarting at this defeat, as the saffron party has lost the only south Indian state in which it has ever come to power,” the story said.  A editor’s note in Frontline said the result showed that the largest opposition party was still alive and capable of kicking.  “But it is even more important because the BJP fought the election purely on divisive terms,” the commentary said. “Congress declared it would shut down people and organisations who spread hatred.  “This was a bold move, given how strongly the narrative of othering has become entrenched… For the past nine years, the BJP has spread the tentacles of disharmony with a relentlessness that has threatened to engulf the entire nation.”  Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post published a detailed “explainer” of the poll.  It recalled Gandhi was ousted from the national parliament after being found guilty of making defamatory remarks about Modi’s family name.  “Congress made the case a big part of its campaign, telling voters that the BJP and Modi were attacking freedom of speech,” the paper said. “Gandhi… also showed a greater desire to win: ahead of the vote he completed a 3,500km (2,170-mile) trek from southern India to the north, presenting himself as a man of the people.”  Thai election winner counts votes for next contest  The fledgling Move Forward Party came out on top in Thailand’s national elections but faces severe obstacles in cementing power by winning the prime ministership (as Pearls and Irritations reported this week).  The biggest hurdle is the need get a majority of votes in a joint-sitting of parliament – winning support from senators appointed by the post-coup military junta.  Thai Enquirer, an independent English-language website spelled out three possible scenarios.  The first was a Move Forward-led progressive government, possible if party leader Pita Limjaroenrat can win the support of 63 senators, to add to the 313 lower house seats in his coalition, giving a bare majority of the 750 votes in a joint sitting.  A tall order, says their article, given that all 250 senators voted for coup-maker Prayut Chan-o-cha in 2019. But it is possible: 64 senators once voted to remove the Senate’s power to vote on the PM.  The second scenario was that the Pheu Thai party, which came second in the election, might form its own coalition if Move Forward fails to win the prime ministership. But this would be a public relations disaster as the party had said several times it would not put together a rival coalition.  The third possibility would be a conservative-led minority government. All the parties in the current government would form a new government. They would get the support of the Senate but would later lose in a lower house no-confidence vote. Most unlikely, Thai Enquirer said.  Bangkok Post said in an editorial that the armed forces could stage a coup from time to time, armed with guns, but that ordinary citizens, armed with mere paper and pens, would send them back to their barracks.  “Sunday’s vote outcome should serve as a reminder for the Thai military that tanks can help a soldier win a battle on the frontline but not in a democratic game,” the paper said.  It called on all senators to respect the wishes of the majority and take part in the selection process in a constructive manner.  “Failure to do so will lead to the Senate being remembered as the destabiliser of the democratic institution it is supposed to promote,” the editorial said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vam9obm1lbmFkdWUuY29tL3RoZS1jcmVlcGluZy1zaGFkb3ctb2YtYXJteS1ydWxlLWFzaWFuLW1lZGlhLXJlcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Arteta, who spent over three years at the Etihad during his stint on Pep Guardiola 's coaching staff, lured Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to the Emirates from City last summer.  The duo went on to play a major role in the Gunners' unexpected title challenge. But after running City close this term, Arsenal believe their rivals could refuse to allow Cancelo to discuss a transfer to the Emirates.  The Telegraph reported Arsenal's interest in Cancelo earlier this week. The 28-year-old full-back is currently on loan at Bayern Munich but the German giants have decided against pursuing a permanent deal for the Portuguese international.  Arteta worked with Cancelo briefly before returning to Arsenal as manager in 2019 and is keen to bolster his full-back options in the summer. Cancelo, who is adept at playing on either flank, would be regarded as a major coup for the Gunners.  However, the report goes on to outline that there is a genuine 'fear' within the club that City will attempt to block any potential deal now that the Gunners have emerged as genuine title contenders.  Despite blowing a commanding eight-point lead at the summit of the Premier League over the course of the last few weeks, Arsenal have enjoyed their best domestic campaign in years and have already qualified for next year's Champions League.  Join the debate! Do you think Man City would let Cancelo join Arsenal in the summer? Let us know here.  Image: Sebastian Widmann/Getty Images) Sebastian Widmann/Getty Images)  Arteta is expected to be handed a handsome summer transfer budget in a bid to strengthen his side for another title challenge next year.  The 41-year-old was under immense pressure last season when Arsenal imploded in the final weeks of the campaign and missed out on a top-four finish. But Arteta has silenced his critics in style this term - and he admitted that he has pinched one or two of the tactics deployed by his old mentor to help him take Arsenal to the next level.  When he was asked about Arsenal's penchant for utilising Zinchenko in an inverted wing-back position, Arteta said back in March: ""It started when I was in Barcelona, we used to play a 3-4-3 diamond and one of the full-backs used to play there. But Pep did it at Bayern for the first time with Phillip Lahm and then that was developed at City with many different ways of doing it with different players.  ""So that is the great thing, that you can take all [of] the time, things from other sports, other coaches to make yourself better and that curiosity is necessary to evolve and be better.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2Fyc2VuYWwtYXJ0ZXRhLW1hbmNpdHktZ3VhcmRpb2xhLXRyYW5zZmVycy0zMDAyMTMxMdIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2Fyc2VuYWwtYXJ0ZXRhLW1hbmNpdHktZ3VhcmRpb2xhLXRyYW5zZmVycy0zMDAyMTMxMS5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Bengaluru"", ""Karnataka"", ""India""}","2023-05-19T10:51:28","Follow us on Image Source : INDIA TV. OPINION | IMRAN KHAN VERSUS ARMY.  With the 24-hour deadline to hand over ‘terrorists’ hiding in former Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s Lahore residence in Zaman Park over, the stage is set for an army-led operation to storm the place. Punjab Police, Rangers and other security personnel waited for the Friday prayers to be over, before entering the former PM’s residence. The entire locality has been surrounded and all roads leading to Zaman Park have been closed to public. Meanwhile, a nationwide crackdown is going in with police nabbing all leaders, activists and supporters of Imran Khan’s party Tehreek-i-Insaaf. Meanwhile, the courts have granted bail to Imran Khan in all cases related to May 9 violence. Sources said, PM Shahbaz Sharif’s government offered Imran Khan the option to either take a safe passage and leave Pakistan, or face action under Army Act. Imran Khan said, he was ready to negotiate about holding general elections , but at the same time, made it clear that no talks are going on in that direction, as of now. The former PM is facing a huge crisis, with most of his party leaders and activists deserting him to avoid police and army action. Imran Khan has alleged that the army and government are trying to decimate his party. Watching the fast-paced developments in Pakistan, it seems the army and government have made up their mind not to give Imran Khan any more chance. The establishment wants either Imran Khan to leave Pakistan immediately, or cool his heels inside jail. This has been the norm for past rulers in Pakistan. General Ayub Khan, after the military coup in 1958, forced Pakistan’s first President Iskander Mirza to quit the country. Mirza had to go to the UK and was buried in Iran in 1969. Among other leaders, Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz Sharif and Gen Pervez Musharraf had to leave Pakistan and settle abroad. Nawaz Sharif is still in London. Asking Imran Khan to quit Pakistan is not new. Imran Khan has been saying that he was not going to leave Pakistan, at any cost. For Imran Khan, it is now a choice between the cauldron and the fire. Shahbaz Sharif’s formula is quite clear. The establishment wants to intimidate Imran’s supporters citing violent attacks on army installations on May 9. This action will prevent the masses from coming out on the streets in support of Imran. Secondly, top leaders of Imran’s party are now being arrested, creating panic in the second line ranks. The establishment wants that once Imran Khan finds himself isolated, he could be intimidated to leave Pakistan under threat of being arraigned before an army court. If he refuses, he will be jailed and will face sedition charges before an army court. Already, five army courts have been set up to prosecute the offenders of May 9 violence. The government and the army are working in this direction. Imran Khan is facing a déjà vu with a difference. In the past, he had punished Nawaz Sharif and his relatives and supporters, with the help of the army, and now Nawaz Sharif’s brother is repaying him in the same coin, with the help of the army, of course. In Pakistan, the script remains the same, only the actors change.  GOVERNMENT FORMATION IN KARNATAKA:  Karnataka will have its Congress government on May 20 with a grand swearing-in ceremony at Sree Kantirava stadium, Bengaluru. Both the CM-designate Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM-designate D K Shivakumar met with senior party leadership on Friday to finalize the list of ministers. They met the Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot on Thursday night and staked claim to form the government. This is the first big victory for Congress in Karnataka since 1989. The party has won absolute majority and there are indications that the government will remain stable. The people of the state have much expectations, as every community voted for the Congress. Leaders from different communities expect to get their due share in governance. G. Parameshwar, a Dalit leader, is seeking proper representation for Dalits in the government. M.B.Patil belongs to Lingayat community, and he wants that the community must get due respect in government. Most of the Muslim voters voted en bloc for Congress this time, and their leaders, too, want a good representation. Lok Sabha elections are due next year, and the Congress will try to keep all sections happy. For Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the path will not be easy. First, he has to fulfil the “five guarantees” that the party gave in its manifesto. The real test will now come after the government formation is over. Secondly, the oath taking ceremony will be used by the Congress to display unity in anti-Modi front. I remember, when H D Kumaraswamy was sworn in as head of JD(S)-Congress coalition government five years ago in 2018, Sonia Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav, N Chandrababu Naidu, K Chandrasekhar Rao, Arvind Kejriwal and Dr Farooq Abdullah were present on the dais. This time, too, most of these leaders will be present.  GEHLOT VERSUS PILOT IN RAJASTHAN:    Supporters of Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and dissident leader Sachin Pilot came to blows at a meeting in Ajmer on Thursday. Slogans were raised and the two camps exchanged blows. These supporters had gathered at a meeting where co-incharge of Rajasthan Amrita Dhawan had gone to collected feedback from district level leaders. Gehlot’s associate Ramchandra Chaudhary and Dharmendra Rathore reached the venue with their supporters and occupied the front row. When Pilot’s supporter Mahendra Singh Ralawata came with his supporters, they were stopped from entering, leading to quarrel. The situation went out of control, and both sides exchanged blows. Not a single top leader from Congress was present. In Jaipur, supporters of chief minister Ashok Gehlot changed slogan ‘I Love You Gehlot’. This was an imitation of Pilot’s supporters chanting the slogan ‘I Love You Sachin Pilot’. Both sides are engaged in showing off their clout. Senior Congress leaders know that if Gehlot and Pilot camps continue to fight each other, it could be difficult for the party to retain power in the Rajasthan assembly polls due by the end of this year. Five years ago, both the sides joined hands and brought the party to power, though it was a marginal victory, but now it’s a question of ego for both leaders. Gehlot is unwilling to quit his chair, and Pilot is unwilling to wait anymore. Chances of a rapprochement appear to be bleak.

"coup","2019-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Managua"", ""Managua"", ""Nicaragua""}","2023-05-19T11:16:22","Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government in Nicaragua has shut down another Catholic university, the latest in anti-Catholic Church persecution that does not show signs of abating.  The Immaculate Conception Catholic University in Managua, run by the Archdiocese of Managua, and which offers philosophical and theological formation for seminarians was permanently closed and its operating license canceled by the Nicaraguan Ministry of the Interior on May 18.  This is the latest move to suppress the Catholic Church that already had universities suppressed. Earlier this year the Nicaraguan government rescinded the legal status of Universidad Juan Pablo II and Universidad Cristiana Autónoma de Nicaragua ""for non-compliance with the laws that regulate them."" In the past year alone, the Nicaraguan dictatorship closed 17 other private universities.  Immaculate Conception University had been inaugurated in 2011 and was training seminarians from various dioceses across Central America.  The university closure comes amid tensions between the powerful Catholic Church that represents 58.5 percent of the 6.5 million inhabitants and Ortega, a one-time Marxist guerrilla, who ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990 without interruption, returning to power in 2007.  In 2018 the Ortega regime cracked down on anti-government demonstrations, leaving at least 355 people dead and 2,000 injured. It also jailed about 500 protesters and forced tens of thousands of others into exile, including Bishop Silvio Jose Baez, auxiliary bishop of Managua, who was forced to flee the country. The government has also arrested opposition leaders and many of them were held in secret locations, incommunicado, with no access to relatives or lawyers.  Result of criticizing the regime's repression, crimes and rights violations  Catholic bishops have since 2018 been vocal in criticizing Ortega, saying citizens have the right to live in peace and freedom. And Ortega has attacked the priests who criticize the regime's repression, crimes and violations of rights and freedoms, even calling Catholic bishops ""terrorists"". Ortega also accused Catholic leaders of plotting a coup while anti-government forces took to the streets because bishops and priests had exhorted people ""to exercise their right to peacefully demonstrate on the basis of civic and evangelical values"".  Ortega's Sandinista government then expelled Archbishop Waldemar Sommertag, apostolic nuncio to the Central American country. The Holy See currently now has no diplomatic representation in Nicaragua since past March when the Nicaraguan government forced it to close its nunciature after Pope Francis described Ortega's regime as a ""crude dictatorship"".  Bishop Rolando Jose Alvarez Lagos of Matagalpa (central Nicaragua) who voiced criticism over the government's harassment of the Church is now in prison on a 26-year-sentence ""for undermining national integrity and propagation of false news through information and communication technologies to the detriment of the State and Nicaraguan society"". He has also been stripped of his citizenship.  This year the government also expelled two nuns and a Panamanian Claretian missionary and banned outdoor Holy Week celebrations, a popular spiritual devotion in the country.  Earlier, the regime earlier ordered the closure of the television channel of the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua and expelling the Missionaries of Charity – the congregation Mother Teresa of Calcutta founded – accusing the nuns who work for the poorest of the poor in the country since 1988 of ""money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5sYS1jcm9peC5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC9vcnRlZ2FzLXNhbmRpbmlzdGEtcmVnaW1lLXNodXRzLWFub3RoZXItY2F0aG9saWMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1pbi1uaWNhcmFndWEvMTc4MzjSAXtodHRwczovL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwubGEtY3JvaXguY29tL2FtcC93b3JsZC9vcnRlZ2FzLXNhbmRpbmlzdGEtcmVnaW1lLXNodXRzLWFub3RoZXItY2F0aG9saWMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1pbi1uaWNhcmFndWEvMTc4Mzg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-06-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:00:00","Rutgers could be closing in on a four-star defensive end while its offense may have found its No. 1 receiver this week when Division-II All-American JaQuae Jackson picked the Scarlet Knights over offers from Texas A&M, Miami, Michigan State, and Colorado after graduating from the California University of Pennsylvania this spring.  The 6-foot-3, 180-pound graduate-transfer texted Rutgers coach Greg Schiano on Wednesday — “Are you guys ready? I’m going to put it out today” — after committing to Schiano almost two weeks beforehand.  It had appeared that Jackson would mull his options after earning an offer from the Michigan State Spartans around the time he opted in with Schiano, but Jackson had only delayed his announcement while moving out of his college dorm and taking a summer vacation soon after that.  Jackson made his intentions public on Wednesday, officially stamping himself a Scarlet Knight and plug-and-playmaker for offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca and quarterback Gavin Wimsatt to put to best use.  It’s a win-win for Rutgers, who needs offensive playmakers, and Jackson, who has real length, speed, soft hands and versatility, and who gets to prove himself on his path to the NFL via the Big Ten.  There are some young, six-foot-three-plus wide receivers on Rutgers’ roster who could contribute this year, like Famah Toure — a tough, versatile, two-way player from Irvington high; Ian Strong, another big, fast, talented athlete from Long Island City, who enrolled early and was one of Rutgers’ breakout players this spring; and Dylan Braithwaite, who isn’t tall, but runs good routes and can fly.  The addition of Jackson, who will use his final year of college eligibility at Rutgers, takes pressure off of Dave Brock’s wide receiver room.  The attention Jackson should demand will help his fellow pass catchers — some who are just coming on — space to operate, and Brock time to develop and possibly redshirt some of Rutgers’ young players with upside.  Looking forward to 2024, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound blue-chip from Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, who boasts the quickest first-step in New York City, Caden Brown tells NJ Advance Media that he will officially visit Rutgers from June 8 to June 11, joining teammate and three-star defensive tackle Aaris Bethea — who Rutgers is also in position to land if things continue trending that way. Apparently, Rutgers is close to landing Brown, ranked four-stars, while badgering from opposing schools give him pause.  “To be honest, I was ready to commit to Rutgers, but Penn State, Syracuse and Cincinnati are making me want to take a closer look before I make my final decision,” Brown told NJ Advance Media on Friday morning.

Mike Bohn resigned Friday from his position as athletic director, university president Carol Folt announced. Bohn oversaw USC’s decision to leave the Pac-12 for the Big Ten and hired Lincoln Riley from Oklahoma as football head coach during his four years at USC. He is also credited with modernizing the USC athletic department as a whole.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Bohn's resignation comes amid a review of the school's athletic department, including ""criticism of [Bohn's] management."" Per the Times, ""four current and former USC employees said that staffers inside the athletic department had raised concerns about Bohn"" to the outside law firm overseeing the review, particularly over comments he made to women working in the department.  From the Times' report:  Bohn made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female colleagues, including remarks about their dress, hair and weight, that staff members said made them feel uncomfortable, according to two USC sources with knowledge of the incidents. They spoke on condition of anonymity fearing retaliation. They said Bohn’s comments left colleagues — especially women — feeling awkward.  Three USC sources said several people confronted Bohn about comments they felt were inappropriate, but they continued.  Bohn, 62, cited health reasons and wanting to spend time with his family in a statement to the Times. His resignation is effective immediately.  “I have been fortunate to have had so many wonderful opportunities and met so many terrific people, and I depart wishing the very best to all with whom I worked and served. In moving on, it is important now that I focus on being present with my treasured family, addressing ongoing health challenges and reflecting on how I can be impactful in the future,” Bohn’s statement said.  Athletic director Mike Bohn introduces Lincoln Riley as USC's new head football coach on Nov. 29, 2021, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)  Bohn arrived at USC from Cincinnati in November 2019 and was tasked with overhauling a bumbling athletic department and revitalizing the struggling USC football program. He initially retained Clay Helton as head coach before firing him early in the 2021 season, opening the door for a head-start in the coaching search that ultimately yielded Riley in a major coup.  Story continues  Later, Bohn played a key role in USC's moving on from the Pac-12 and joining the Big Ten. USC will play one more season in the Pac-12 before officially becoming a Big Ten member ahead of the 2024 season. With Bohn resigning, the school’s next athletic director will be in charge of overseeing that conference transition.  “After more than 40 years of college athletics leadership, it is the right time to step away from my position as Director of Athletics at the University of Southern California,” Bohn said. “I have dedicated my life to serving student-athletes and advancing the enterprise of intercollegiate athletics. I will always be proud of leading the program out of the most tumultuous times in the history of the profession and at USC with a restored reputation and national milestone accomplishments. I led the process to join the Big Ten Conference, hired marquee head coaches, produced the highest graduation rate in school history and won numerous national and conference championships.”  In a message to the university community, Folt said ""a thorough review"" of the athletic department was conducted, including looks into its ""operations, culture, and strategy."" Folt will put together a “transition team” as the school launches a national search for Bohn’s replacement.  “Over the last four years, the USC athletics department has transformed into a national powerhouse. In our singular pursuit of excellence, I am committed to ensuring we have the right leadership in place to achieve our goals,” Folt said. “As part of that commitment and as we prepare to move to the Big Ten, we conducted a thorough review of the athletics department, including its operations, culture, and strategy. Having built a strong foundation over the last few years, now is the time for a new direction grounded in our values and in expertise needed to fulfill our aspirational vision for Trojan athletics.”  Before his time at USC, Bohn served as the athletic director at Cincinnati, Colorado, San Diego State and Idaho.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdXNjLWF0aGxldGljLWRpcmVjdG9yLW1pa2UtYm9obi1hYnJ1cHRseS1yZXNpZ25zLTIxMDczODA3My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2021-02-28","Not Discerned","{""Manhattan"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T18:17:01","(New York Jewish Week) — The ongoing search for a successor to Park East Synagogue’s 93-year-old rabbi has hit a fresh hurdle, as the rabbinic search committee has been disbanded and another of the congregation’s rabbis has left his job.  For more than a year, the prominent Orthodox congregation on Manhattan’s East Side has sought someone to succeed Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor who has led the synagogue for six decades. But none of the prospective candidates has yet panned out, while at the same time multiple assistant rabbis have exited the synagogue.  The synagogue suggested in a statement that another of its assistant rabbis could be the heir apparent. But Park East members worry that the turmoil is endangering the future of their storied synagogue, which has hosted a pope and a string of other dignitaries as Schneier has shaped the synagogue into a stage for his human rights activism.  In February, Schneier told the New York Jewish Week, “When it comes to the selection of a rabbi, it is entirely up to the membership.” But multiple synagogue members said the rabbinic search committee disbanded after a top British rabbi withdrew from consideration in February and Schneier is now running the search himself.  “Members feel disenfranchised,” said one Park East member who is familiar with the synagogue’s management and, like others in the community, asked to remain anonymous for fear of ruining their relationships in the congregation.  “It is very difficult,” the member said. “We’ve had Rabbi Schneier here for a very long time and many people do love him very much, and it’s hard for them to imagine someone else taking that place.”  Some are sympathetic to Schneier’s position. Reuven Kahane, a longtime member at Park East who often delivers sermons at the synagogue, told the New York Jewish Week that “Rabbi Schneier has flaws and makes mistakes — like everyone else.”  “But who has done so much for so many?” Kahane asked. “The rabbi literally watched Kristallnacht, then turned that tragedy into saving Jewish lives for 70 years.”  The uncertainty began in late 2021, when the synagogue abruptly fired Schneier’s popular assistant rabbi, Benjamin Goldschmidt, whom Schneier’s allies accused of trying to stage a coup. Four months later, the synagogue announced a search for a “worthy successor” to Schneier. Goldschmidt has since founded his own popular congregation, called the Altneu, in the same neighborhood.  In February, Park East appeared close to hiring Rabbi Yitzchak Schochet, who leads a large synagogue in London. But a question-and-answer period at the synagogue following a lecture by Schochet devolved into argument when a member publicly protested the rabbi’s views about same-sex marriage. Schochet eventually withdrew from the rabbinic search.  Now, Rabbi Elchanan Poupko — who has taught at the synagogue’s affiliated day school since 2015, and who has served as the synagogue’s interim assistant rabbi since last year — confirmed that he is leaving the synagogue. Members said Poupko was well liked and was once floated as a prospective successor to Schneier. When he assumed the assistant rabbi role, he posted on LinkedIn, “May it be the will [of Hashem] that … the Divine Presence, rest in our work.”  Both Poupko and the synagogue attributed his departure to his physician wife’s work as a professor of neurology at the University of Connecticut. Poupko said “the schlep is too much” between the two workplaces.  Support the New York Jewish Week Our nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York. Donate  “We wish Rabbi Poupko, his wife Rachel, and their daughters the best in their new home in Connecticut,” the synagogue said in a statement. “Their contributions to our community have been greatly appreciated and they will be missed.”  The synagogue’s statement added that it has asked another assistant rabbi, David Flatto, to serve as “​​acting Associate Rabbi.” Flatto previously served as the rabbi of another prominent Upper East Side Orthodox synagogue, Kehilath Jeshurun, and is a professor of law and Jewish philosophy at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  His biography on the Park East website says he is at the synagogue “until he resumes his academic responsibilities at Hebrew University in the fall,” but members told the New York Jewish Week that they understand Schneier wants to keep Flatto on as his successor.  “He is well known and respected by the Park East community having served as our Assistant Rabbi in 2022,” the synagogue’s statement said. “He exhibited warmth and caring in his outreach and pastoral duties during Shabbat, High Holiday services, and during life cycle events.”  Neither Flatto nor Schneier responded to requests for comment.  Two members of the disbanded committee declined to comment, and the synagogue’s statement did not address an inquiry about the committee’s status, saying, “Our search for a full-time candidate is ongoing. We will continue to engage our membership in this process.”  The member who is familiar with Park East management said the search committee “chose to disband themselves” after Schochet dropped out. The member added that the committee members, “frankly, did not feel that they had any more interest in putting more effort based on the fact that the last person didn’t go so well.”  Now, members say, Schneier and a close circle of confidantes are spearheading the search.  “He’s holding on to the last vestiges of power, like an older relative who just doesn’t know when to hang it up,” said another member who is active at the synagogue and who also asked not to be named. “He’s a good man, but this is just pathetic.”  That member and others said there had been a spat between Poupko and Flatto surrounding Shemini Atzeret, the Jewish holiday immediately following Sukkot last fall. Flatto allegedly had “a temper tantrum” because Poupko was asked to participate, the member said, and ultimately refused to lead services. Other members confirmed that account.  “He literally just didn’t show up,” the active member said. “I was ticked because we’re paying him. He acted immature, so he left a very bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths.”  Some members say that while they’re impressed with Flatto in many ways, they still place him in the same category where a growing list of rabbis have found themselves during the past year and a half: respected and appreciated but, ultimately, not exactly right for Park East Synagogue.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin will build the landing system for Artemis V, which is currently set to launch in September 2029. While they didn't mention the choice of vehicle, the company is already working on a Blue Moon lander. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Draper are among those involved in the NASA project. The NASA award is worth $3.4 billion, and Blue Origin said in the announcement event that it's contributing ""well north"" of that figure on its own.  An Orion capsule flight will take four astronauts to the Moon, where two of the crew members will use a Blue Origin lander docked to the Gateway space station to touch down at the lunar south pole. They'll spend a week conducting moonwalks, rover operations and science experiments while the other astronauts expand and take care of the Gateway.  NASA has already chosen SpaceX's Starship for the first (Artemis III) and second (Artemis IV) human landings. The agency said it would accept proposals for a second lander last year to both provide a backup and foster competition. Blue Origin made its bid for another lunar contract last December. The company objected to SpaceX's win and sued NASA for allegedly ignoring safety concerns when awarding the contract, but a federal court dismissed the claims.  The decision is a coup for Blue Origin. While it already has a NASA contract for a Mars science mission and financial support for its Orbital Reef space station, it hasn't had success scoring a crewed trip to the Moon. This also highlights NASA's increasing reliance on privately developed technology for its missions beyond Earth orbit, such as Axiom Space's Artemis suits.

Taungoo Prison in Taungoo Township, Bago Region is where ousted civilian President U Win Myint has been held since January.  Some ten political prisoners, including a woman and two inmates sentenced to death, escaped from a cell of the special court in Taungoo Prison during a trial after stealing weapons from the police, according to a leaked report from the junta-controlled Myanmar Correctional Department. Nine of the ten prisoners managed to escape the jail, taking with them four weapons seized from military regime forces.  A Myanmar military sergeant was killed and a former army sergeant injured in his leg during the jailbreak, said the Correctional Department’s report.  Locals told the media that pro-junta Pyu Saw Htee militia are assigned to guard Taungoo Prison alongside the army and police as the junta does not have enough personnel to man the jail.  “Junta troops and Pyu Saw Htee militia chased and attacked the prisoners when they fled from the prison cell. They [the prisoners] got two more weapons after countering the regime forces and militia,” the spokesperson for Bago Region People’s Defense Force (PDF) told The Irrawaddy on Friday.  However, one prisoner was wounded in the escape and had to be left behind.  All nine escapees have now reached a liberated area in Bago Region controlled by a PDF, added Ko Wai Yan, Bago Region PDF spokesperson.  Taungoo District PDF, part of Bago Region PDF, and the allied Karen National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Karen National Union, are also active in Taungoo Township.  “This is the voice of the people’s struggle as well as the struggle of our comrades who broke out of the prison. This escape is one of the important things during our revolution,” said Ko Wai Yan.  Last September, two political prisoners were rescued after a resistance group attacked a vehicle in Amarapura Township transporting them to Obo Prison in Mandalay from Kyaukse Police Station.  Five political prisoners including two resistance fighters also escaped in September 2022 during a jailbreak in Pakokku Township, Magwe Region.  At least ten political prisoners reportedly escaped in Hkamti Township, Sagaing Region last October.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXJtYS9teWFubWFyLXBvbGl0aWNhbC1wcmlzb25lcnMtZXNjYXBlLWluLXRhdW5nb28tamFpbGJyZWFrLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnJhd2FkZHkuY29tL25ld3MvYnVybWEvbXlhbm1hci1wb2xpdGljYWwtcHJpc29uZXJzLWVzY2FwZS1pbi10YXVuZ29vLWphaWxicmVhay5odG1sL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-02-23","22:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T18:53:03","23 SHARES Facebook Twitter  Back in February, news broke that Rami Malek would star in a CIA thriller “Amateur,” about a cryptographer who blackmails the agency into training him to go after the terrorists who killed his wife. Sound like a good role for Malek? Indeed it does, and Deadline has the word on the supporting cast around him for the film.  READ MORE: ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ Final Season Trailer: Rachel Brosnahan Returns One More Time In Prime Video’s Acclaimed Comedy Series  And it’s an interesting trio of actors to join the project, with “The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel” star Rachel Brosnahan leading the way. The other two: “Outlander” star Caitríona Balfe and Laurence Fishburne. Not a bad supporting cast; Adrian Martinez already joined the film earlier this year.  And most intriguing is who helms the film. “Slow Horses” is director James Hewes‘s movie, with “American Made” scribe Gary Spinelli penning its most recent draft. Malek also serves as executive producer on “Amateur,” with Hutch Parker and Dan Wilson producing for 20th Century Studios.  While Fishburne is no stranger to agency thrillers like “Amateur,” this film is a coup for the likes of Balfe and Brosnahan. Both actresses have found massive success on “Outlander” and “Mrs. Maisel,” respectively, but neither has had a big-screen breakout yet; Brosnahan may get it if James Gunn indeed casts her in “Superman: Legacy.” But Balfe did get nominated for a BAFTA for Kenneth Branagh‘s 2021 film “Belfast,” so she’s due for a big role like this. As for Mr. Fishburne, the veteran actor recently starred in “John Wick: Chapter 4” and Netflix‘s “The School Of Good And Evil.” He reunites with Francis Ford Coppola next for the much-anticipated “Megalopolis.”  Do these castings make “Amateur” on the more intriguing films that may hit theaters in 2024? Malek doesn’t have anything really lined up after he’ll appear in Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” so this film may be where audiences see him next; either that or the untitled Buster Keaton series Malek is attached to.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RoZXBsYXlsaXN0Lm5ldC9hbWF0ZXVyLXJhY2hlbC1icm9zbmFoYW4tbGF1cmVuY2UtZmlzaGJ1cm5lLWNhaXRyaW9uYS1iYWxmZS1qb2luLXJhbWktbWFsZWstZm9yLXVwY29taW5nLWNpYS10aHJpbGxlci0yMDIzMDUxOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Connecticut State Police credited the arrest to multiple 911 calls received about the erratic motorist, who has been identified as Michael Wiggins, 67, of Waterbury.  According to state police, Troop L and the Litchfield County Dispatch received a number of 911 calls at about 1:29 a.m. about a motorist driving south on the northbound side of Route 8 in Torrington in the area of Exit 43.  One caller told dispatchers the motorist at one point was seen turning around and traveling in the correct direction before getting off Route 8 at Exit 44. The motorist then allegedly got onto the southbound side of Route 8 where he drove “in an erratic manner, swerving across the travel lanes,” state police said.  Troopers pulled Wiggins over in the area of Exit 41, as his vehicle was believed to be the one that had been driving the wrong way, according to state police. He showed signs of impairment and failed multiple field sobriety tests, state police said.  Wiggins has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, failure to drive in the proper lane and driving the wrong way on a divided highway. He was released on a $1,000 non-surety bond and is scheduled to be arraigned in Torrington Superior Court on June 2.  “We thank the members of the public who did not hesitate to call 911 to report this incident,” Connecticut State Police said in a statement. “As always, we ask that anyone who observes a vehicle traveling in the wrong direction please keep a safe distance away and call 911 as soon as possible, as this is a true emergency.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vd3Jvbmctd2F5LWRyaXZlci1jaGFyZ2VkLWR1aS0xNDA3MDA4NTMuaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC93cm9uZy13YXktZHJpdmVyLWNoYXJnZWQtZHVpLTE0MDcwMDg1My5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T00:45:31","Since Donald Trump became a legitimate presidential candidate, the mainstream media has reserved a special kind of hate for him. They have portrayed him as nothing short of the Antichrist.  Their narrative has been that Trump will destroy democracy. He is a fascist and a dictator. Trump didn’t help himself in the aftermath of the 2020 election, but his four years in office demonstrated that just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean somebody isn’t out to get you.  For Trump, it wasn’t just the media burying a Republican. The “Deep State” aided the press. The FBI, DOJ, and State Department bureaucrats who survive from one administration to the next understood when Trump talked about “draining the swamp,” he was talking about them. They fought back.  The release of John Durham’s “Report on Matters Related to Intelligence Activities and Investigations Arising Out of the 2016 Presidential Campaigns” details how an “invisible government” within the FBI and DOJ fought back to stop Trump. When it didn’t prevent him from winning the election, they metaphorically annihilated the Trump presidency before he was sworn in.  Reading the report reminded me of Mr. X, Donald Sutherland’s shadowy character in Oliver Stone’s “JFK,” emerging to tell Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) the plot’s conception:  “Like Caesar, he’s surrounded by enemies, and something is underway. But it has no face. Yet, everybody in the loop knows. The people in the loop, they fight back their way. It started in the wind. It was just conversations, nothing more.  There’s been no vote. Nothing’s on paper. There’s no one to blame. No one’s guilty because anyone in the power structure has plausible deniability. What’s paramount is that it must succeed no matter what. No matter how much it costs. The perpetrators must be on the winning side and never subject to prosecution for anything by anyone. That is a coup d’état.” (edited)  And that is how democracy dies.  The Durham Report tells the true story of what the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) did behind the scenes during the 2016 presidential election. It provides the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation, which looked into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and other activities that impacted the 2016 election and Trump’s presidency.  The report also disabuses anyone still clinging to the notion of Trump-Russian collusion. The report shows how the FBI manufactured the hoax.  The FBI attempted to influence the election at its highest levels and held two different standards of justice for the campaigns.  Former FBI Deputy Director and other conspirators are already calling the report a “nothing-burger.” Addressing those who choose to believe them, I challenge:  President Biden to declassify the redacted portions of Former CIA Director John Brennen’s handwritten notes from the August 3, 2016, White House briefing that included President Obama, then: VP Biden, FBI Director James Comey, AG Loretta Lynch, and others about the “Clinton Plan,” on “July 26, a proposal from one of her campaign advisors to vilify Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming inferences by Russian security services.”  All parties involved who did not testify for Durham’s office should testify, with the scope limited to The Clinton Plan,” before a Congressional Committee.  Andrew McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI, may be the worst of the conspirators. He ordered Crossfire Hurricane. McCabe had many opportunities to provide “defensive briefings” to the Trump campaign. A defensive briefing is when the FBI reports a potential issue to a campaign, such as a team member possibly having improper contact with foreign agents.  McCabe declined to give defensive briefings to the Trump campaign. However, he permitted them for the Clinton campaign when the FBI had considerably more damning information.  The report states: “Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were directly involved in matters relating to the opening of Crossfire Hurricane.” Strzok was the Section Chief and later the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. Lisa Page was an FBI attorney detailed as a Special Assistant to Deputy Director Peter McCabe. They also had an affair.  Strzok and Page texted one another about their mutual distaste for Trump. A series of their text messages are public and, in the report, famously including one from August 8, 2016, where Page texts: “[Trump’s] not going to become president, right? Right?” To which Strzok responds: “No. No, he’s not. We’ll stop it.”  The scandal’s genesis came after George Papadopoulos, named a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign in March 2016, met twice in May in London with two Australian diplomats, Jack Crown and Australian High Commissioner Alexander Downer, over drinks.  In late July, Australia provided the U.S. with a summary of their meeting. The key was what became known as “Paragraph Five.” In essence, it described Papadopoulos’ suggestion that Russia could assist with releasing damaging information about the Clintons. It wasn’t clear how the Russians obtained the material or if Trump’s team accepted the offer.  Paragraph Five is unspecific; it doesn’t mention Clinton’s emails or the DNC hack. According to the Durham Report, Downer’s recollection “simply stated, ‘the Russians have information,’ and that was all.”  The two men had vastly different impressions of Papadopoulos. He either “had an inflated self of worth” or was “insecure and was trying to impress.” It appears that the only reason they felt it was worth reporting Papadopoulos’ comments was because of the DNC email dump by Wikileaks on July 22.  The Durham Report concedes, “As an initial matter, there is no question that the FBI had an affirmative obligation to examine the Paragraph Five information closely.”  Three days after receiving Paragraph Five, the FBI determined, without further analysis, additional corroboration, other intelligence from Australian or other friendly governments, or even other U.S. intelligence agencies, that the information alone was adequate for opening a full investigation into whether individuals associated with an ongoing presidential campaign were coordinating activities with the Russian government.  The FBI acted prematurely and did not follow proper policy and procedures. Although it may not be provable by law, texts, other documents, and the comparative handling of the Clinton campaign make it self-evident that personal agendas drove decisions.  Like the pundits at the time, they assumed that Mrs. Clinton would win; therefore, they didn’t need to go public. But as Strzok texted Lisa Page, they had their “insurance policy,” just in case anything went wrong—the invisible government was maneuvering in the shadows, orchestrating a malevolent symphony that would haunt Trump throughout his presidency.  In addition to Paragraph Five, Crossfire Hurricane was predicated on the infamous Steele Dossier. Christopher Steele described himself as a former intelligence official for the British government. He was also a confidential human source for the FBI.  Steele was eventually closed as an FBI source in November 2016 for disclosing his status while providing information to the media regarding his work with Fusion GPS for the Clinton campaign and the DNC against Trump.  The famous phrase from Watergate is “Follow the money.” The money trail for the Steele Dossier flowed from Perkins Coie, a U.S.-based international law firm representing the Clinton campaign. It hired Fusion GPS, an American investigative firm, to conduct opposition research on Donald Trump and his associates. It, in turn, hired Steele. The information Steele received came from Igor Danchenko.  Danchenko was a paid FBI confidential human source. Steele was also paying him for information that would eventually become the Dossier. Steele didn’t know that while Danchenko was supposedly living in Russia gathering intel on Trump, he was living in Washington, D.C. None of the information he gave the FBI corroborated Steele’s report.  The FBI knew that the Clinton campaign paid for the Steele Dossier. At least in part because Steele and Danchenko were FBI human confidential sources. At the highest levels, the FBI knew the Steele Dossier was a fictional work made up by Igor Danchenko and people who worked for him.  The FBI used the information in the Steele Dossier to obtain FISA warrants on Papadopoulos and Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. These warrants were illegal. For those who choose not to believe the Durham Report, in 2020, a federal judge declared the warrants invalid because they “lacked legal basis.”  Contrasted with the FBI’s rapid opening of Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI appears to have made no effort to investigate the possible illegal campaign contribution (which allegedly was a precursor to a more significant sum of money) on behalf of a foreign government or the Clinton campaign’s purported acceptance of a campaign contribution made by an FBI’s confidential human source on behalf of a foreign government.  As mentioned, as early as late July, the FBI was aware of the Clinton campaign’s idea of creating a scandal vilifying Trump for working with the Russians. It was known as “The Clinton Plan,” and the FBI and CIA believed Hillary Clinton approved it herself.  The FBI did not act on this information. It did not investigate, nor did it slow down, Crossfire Hurricane. It accepted it as “one data point,” yet it accepted the Steele Dossier as truth.  The report leaves no doubt that the FBI quickly jumped into an investigation of Trump-Russian collusion on flimsy uncorroborated evidence driven by personal agendas. There is a stark contrast in how the FBI treated the Trump and Clinton campaigns.  The Durham Report shows how democracy dies.  In 1966, a New York Times article reported “one of the highest-ranking officials of his administration,” saying that JFK wanted to “splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.”  After reading the Durham Report, I wonder, if the FBI isn’t splintered into a thousand pieces and scattered to the winds, can democracy survive?

Sign Up Today  There has been a cavalcade of interest in St. Louis’ Major League Soccer expansion franchise, which by all accounts has been a smash success at the gate, in merchandise sales and in fan appeal.  City SC’s popularity as a television draw, however, has remained a secret because all 11 of its matches have been streaming-only productions, shown on Apple TV+. Some have been available for free to Apple customers, but others have been behind a paywall. Nielsen, which measures television viewership, does not track any of these Apple games — and neither Apple nor MLS say how many people are watching.  But City SC won’t remain a TV mystery much longer for many of its fans, or potential fans, who still have cable. Its match Saturday, at home against Kansas City, will be shown on a familiar channel — FS1 — as well as being available for free on Apple TV+.  The same feed for City’s match will be used on both outlets, but with different announcers. For Apple, Jake Zivin has the play-by-play and native St. Louisan Taylor Twellman is the commentator, joined by Jorge Perez-Navarro and Marcelo Balboa. For FS1, Nate Bukaty does the play-by-play with former U.S. national soccer team goaltender Tony Meola providing commentary.  The contest starts more than an hour later than usual for a City SC home contest, probably not until 8:55 p.m. That’s because FS1 has NASCAR coverage before that, starting at 6 p.m. with qualifying for Sunday night’s Cup Series All-Star race, followed by a lengthy soccer pregame show.  City SC will be making the first of its three appearances this season on a conventional television channel. Also on tap is June 11, a noon contest against the Los Angeles Galaxy (on KTVI, Channel 2) and the Aug. 20 game, at 8:30 p.m. against Austin (on FS1). Those also are home contests.  MLS has moved its games to Apple this season under a 10-year deal, with a handful of its contests also sprinkled across FS1 or Fox (Channel 2 locally).  In addition to not releasing ratings figures for individual matches, the league and Apple have not said how many people are buying the MLS package — for which Apple TV+ customers are charged $12.99 per month or $79 for the season ($14.99/$99 for those who do not subscribe to Apple TV+).  But Apple announced a few days ago that it is offering a one-month free trial of the package, something that many industry observers see as a sign that it could be concerned about how sales have gone.  THE STREAM RAPIDLY RISES  Streaming is here to stay for a long time and continues to grow — massively.  Major League Baseball, the NHL and European soccer have streaming-only games, with the biggest firestorm created locally by such coverage being the outcry last season when Albert Pujols’ milestone 700th career home run took place in a Cardinals game available only on Apple TV+, not any conventional television outlets.  Then last season the NFL sent “Thursday Night Football” from Fox to Amazon under an 11-year deal that reportedly is worth $1 billion annually to the league. Until this week that was the biggest such move yet by any American sports league. But on Monday the NFL announced that a playoff game next winter will be shown only on Peacock, the streaming platform of NBC Sports, other than in the markets of the teams involved in the contest where it also will be shown locally.  It will be a wild-card game on Jan. 13, 2004, a Saturday, played in prime time. That will be the first time an NFL postseason game will be shown only via streaming to the vast majority of the nation. Peacock also has an NFL regular-season game exclusively — Buffalo-LA Chargers on Dec. 23.  “Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League,” NFL executive vice president and chief operating officer of NFL Media Hans Schroeder said in a statement. “And bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  Peacock has exclusive streaming rights to some MLB games, Notre Dame and Big Ten football and Big Ten basketball contests, Premier League soccer matches as well as some tennis, golf, cycling and IndyCar events. But an NFL playoff game will be the biggest coup for not only that platform, but for any streamer.  “As Peacock continues to grow, nothing says ‘must-have’ programming more than live NFL games,” Peacock president Kelly Campbell said in a statement.  BSM’s PANG SEEKS NEW DEAL  Lead Blues television analyst Darren Pang’s contract with Bally Sports Midwest has expired, and he’s hopeful of receiving a new deal that he and his agent are seeking.  “We have not received an offer at this point,” Pang said Thursday. “Our expectation is that we will, and that could be any day now.”  BSM officials would not comment about contract talks, but it is believed they hope to have their entire Blues broadcast team back next season.  Bally Sports Midwest parent company Diamond Sports Group, a division of Sinclair Broadcasting, is in bankruptcy but it has been business as usual in St. Louis despite troubles elsewhere. BSM is one of 19 Sinclair regional sports networks.  “I’m optimistic,” Pang said. “But I do understand business.”  BSM Blues play-by-play announcer John Kelly is under contract for next season. The radio broadcasters work for the team.  Pang, a popular figure in St. Louis for the nearly decade and a half he has been broadcasting the Blues, said he has been contacted by other organizations about his availability. But his goal is to stay put.  “Absolutely,” he emphatically said. “My No. 1 priority is staying in the city and being with the team I’ve been with for 14 years.”  Pang has moonlighted as a national NHL broadcaster for many years and currently is with TNT. He said he is close to signing a three-year extension there, and his next job with a team must allow him to continue filling that role.  “No matter what I’m doing, it will be tied to TNT,” he said.  Pang is not part of that network’s coverage of the Eastern Conference finals that are taking place now, but was involved in the first two rounds of the playoffs and will be on the crew covering the Stanley Cup Final in a variety of capacities.  “That will be a lot of fun,” Pang said.  XFL FINALE  St. Louis led the XFL in attendance and television viewership in the regular season, but with the Battlehawks falling just short of making the playoffs the Gateway City came in 13th nationally in ratings for the league title game.  Nielsen, which measures viewership, says that 1.3% of the market tuned in to KDNL (Channel 30) to see Arlington upset (Washington) D.C. for the crown.  Interesting, the two top-rated markets for ABC’s telecast do not have XFL teams — Oklahoma City (3.6) and Tulsa (3.1). But there is a caveat. Arlington was coached by Bob Stoops, a favorite son in Oklahoma who coached the Sooners for many years and led them to the national title for the 2000 season. Washington was third, at 2.3.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2Rhbi1jYWVzYXIvbWVkaWEtdmlld3MtYS1jaXR5LXNjLW1hdGNoLXdpbGwtYmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLW9uLXJlZ3VsYXItdHYtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUvYXJ0aWNsZV9kNWNkMDNiMC1lMjU5LTExZWQtYTZlMS00ZmVlYWMwYzcyMWYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:58:00","Nicole Holofcener has learned a few things about Hollywood over the years.  That attending the Oscars is more fun as a guest than a nominee. That when someone just says “congratulations” after a film, they didn’t like it and don’t want to tell you. That getting to work with your idols is one of the best perks of the job. And that your problems don’t go away once you put them on screen. But, even so, it can be ridiculous fun to watch great actors play out your plights.  Since her debut, “Walking and Talking,” Holofcener has time and time again gone back to Catherine Keener, a forever friend and muse to help bring her thoughts to the screen. Then just over a decade ago, Julia Louis-Dreyfus entered her orbit. Like everyone, she knew her as Elaine — almost obsessively so, she said. But when they sat down for dinner, she quickly realized Louis-Dreyfus was nothing like her “Seinfeld” character. Instead, she was more like her.  “She was nice,” Holofcener said. “We talked about the script. We talked about our kids going away to college. We both teared up. I felt like, ‘Wow, I’d be lucky to have this woman play a version of me.’”  The film was “Enough Said,” in which Louis-Dreyfus plays a woman who inadvertently befriends the ex-wife (Keener) of the man she’s dating ( James Gandolfini ). As soon as it was over, they longed to do it again — though 10 years was a little longer than they'd hoped.  For their new film, “You Hurt My Feelings” (in theaters May 26), Holofcener landed on an even stickier scenario: An author overhears her husband saying that he doesn’t like her latest book, sending her into a spiral of doubt about her talent and her relationship.  “I found it to be an utterly captivating notion because it’s like an infidelity, but it’s not an infidelity,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “I was considering how devastating it would be, as an artist myself, if my spouse had been absolutely and totally lying to me about his reaction to whatever I was doing. I would be mortified.”  It’s something Holofcener thinks a lot about in her own relationships. Some years ago, she actually had the experience of dating a man who was crazy about her but didn’t seem to like or get her movies.  “I tried really hard to have that not matter,” she said. “But in the end, it really mattered.”  After watching “Please Give,” her 2010 film about a couple who fill their pricey furniture store with bargain estate sale findings, she remembered the first thing he said was that the old woman was really cranky. She was floored that that was the takeaway.  “My movies are so personal to me,” she said. “I couldn’t understand how someone could get me or get my sense of humor or my values or what’s important to me and not enjoy my films. I still don’t have an answer to that.”  In “You Hurt My Feelings,” Beth (Louis-Dreyfus) is a moderately successful author living in New York City with her husband Don ( Tobias Menzies ), a therapist whose confidence has also been shaken at work, with some memory gaps and unsatisfied patients (Amber Tamblyn and David Cross play a very unhappily married couple). Beth and Don also worry about their son (Owen Teague) who, in their eyes, is floundering in his career and personal life.  Louis-Dreyfus was able to draw on her own 35-year marriage to help paint a believable picture of this couple, who like to share food — even ice cream cones — much to the horror of their son.  “We both felt very strongly that we really wanted to depict a couple who have been married for a long time but were still in love in a believable way, you know? Not saccharine and lovey-dovey,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “They’re very bonded to one another.”  The film contains acute observations about family, marriage, gift-giving, artistic neuroses, mid-life crises and parenting adult children. It’s funny and poignant and sometimes gnawingly uncomfortable and has an enviable cast of great actors, including Michaela Watkins as Beth’s sister and Arian Moayed as her husband.  The budget was small, the shoot was quick (22 days) and the circumstances were sometimes challenging. Holofcener tested positive for COVID-19 and spent several of their precious few shooting days directing remotely from an iPad.  Filming in Manhattan with famous people can be its own headache too. Louis-Dreyfus remembered one difficult scene in which her character has just overheard her husband’s confession and has to walk out of a sporting goods store looking nauseated and dry heaving on the city sidewalk. Across the street, there were paparazzi taking pictures.  “It made me feel very self-conscious,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “Why would I want pictures of myself vomiting on the street?”  But they got through it and on the whole it was a lovely experience. Holofcener even said it’s the most fun she’s ever had on a film.  “Maybe it’s getting older,” she said. “I’m calmer. A little more confident.”  She loved when Louis-Dreyfus would ad-lib and innovate in scenes. One of the biggest laughs in the film is one of those impromptu additions (without spoiling, it involves a conversation about Botox).  ""She gets the tone. She always surprises me,"" Holofcener said. “And her face just kills me.""  And both were delighted to get the chance to work with Jeannie Berlin, who plays Beth’s mom. It was a particular coup for Holofcener who cites Elaine May's “The Heartbreak Kid” as the movie that made her want to make movies. She even got to meet May, Berlin's mother, at a screening.  May has seen, and loved, the film. And she's not alone. After it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year to fantastic reviews and audience reactions, A24 decided to give the film a nationwide launch. This is both exciting and a source of anxiety for Holofcener, used to smaller openings.  Since her first film put her on the map in 1996, Holofcener has always done supplemental work, writing scripts or directing episodes of television, from “Gilmore Girls” to her most recent gig doing two episodes of “Lucky Hank” with Bob Odenkirk. But they’re not just paychecks — she would do it more if that were the reason.  “Since I don’t have scripts that I want to make very often, it’s a great way to keep going and meet new actors,” she said. “I’m pretty picky. After ‘Walking and Talking,’ I got offered things. But if I didn’t like them that much, I just didn’t do them. I guess it’s always about quality of life more than money.”  Holofcener grew up with a significant connection to the business: Her stepfather, Charles H. Joffe, was a talent manager and producer of most of Woody Allen’s films, including “Annie Hall” and “Hannah and Her Sisters.” Her mother occasionally worked as a set decorator too. And while it was true that Joffe paid for Holofcencer’s schooling and helped get her PA work on some of Allen’s films, she also thinks that people tend to give too much significance to that part of her biography.  She’s even read articles that claim she was mentored by Allen or Martin Scorsese, who was her teacher in film school for all of three months. This is a source of embarrassment for her because, first, she’s pretty certain Scorsese has no recollection of this and, second, she remembers him falling asleep during one of her shorts.  “I don’t think he cared for my work,” she laughed.  Besides, in the past three decades of making films, she has carved out her own space that is uniquely and perfectly hers.  As Louis-Dreyfus put it: “Nicole has her finger on the pulse of human connection and the complicated nature of that connection. And as a result, she tells extraordinary stories.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJheW5ld3M5LmNvbS9mbC90YW1wYS9hcC1vbmxpbmUvMjAyMy8wNS8xOS90aGUtYmVhdXRpZnVsLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24tb2Ytbmljb2xlLWhvbG9mY2VuZXItYW5kLWp1bGlhLWxvdWlzLWRyZXlmdXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2021-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:01:38","A total of 47 comrades of the Demoso People's Defense Force (DMO-PDF) in Karenni State paid the ultimate sacrifice during the Spring Revolution, which was sparked by the Myanmar Military's infamous coup, DMO-PDF announced. Their young lives have been prematurely ended by the tragedy of war.  DMO-PDF announced the heartbreaking loss of 47 comrades who sacrificed their lives during the two-year revolution, on May 10th.  The majority of the fallen comrades were young individuals, approximately 19 years old, a press officer of DMO-PDF said. ""Most of our fallen comrades were barely over 19 years old, with a few in their 20s, and even a handful in their 30s. Recently, one of our comrades tragically lost his life, not in battle, but due to a direct hit from artillery. It raises concerns that the Military Council may be using drones to spy on our movements.  While there are other injuries, fortunately they are not severe. In general the majority of our fallen comrades are in their late teens and early twenties, and their deaths usually occur during battles”, he told the Kantarawaddy Times.  Among the fallen comrades of DMO-PDF, the primary causes of death were engagements in shootouts, shelling incidents, and encounters with landmines. Particularly shelling emerged as the most prevalent cause. The casualties included a dedicated female medic and courageous revolutionary fighters.  As of May 10th, Demoso Township has witnessed a staggering number of 159 confrontations between the resistance forces, including the DMO-PDF, and the Military Council. During the revolution's battles, the toll on DMO-PDF comrades was severe. Not only did 47 comrades lose their lives, but also 101 comrades were wounded, with 19 among them experiencing the devastating loss of limbs and other vital organs.  An official from DMO-PDF stated that comrades who are no longer able to participate in combat due to the loss of limbs and other body parts, are provided with alternative opportunities, such as engaging in pig farming or pursuing skills that align with their interests and hobbies.  ""It would be more accurate to say that this initiative was organized with assistance from abroad and various organizations, rather than being solely planned by us. As for our comrades who express an interest in pig farming, we ensure their needs are met by providing them with the necessary pigs. Alternatively we arrange opportunities for them to acquire skills aligned with their interests, such as computer programming or phone repair. It's important to clarify that these arrangements pertain to our current plans”, he explained.  On May 6th, 2021, the Demoso Township Strike Committee, consisting of 12 members, established DMO-PDF under the guidance of the National Unity Government (NUG). According to DMO-PDF, they have a membership of 4,500 individuals residing in 120 villages. However these figures have not been independently verified by Kantarwaddy Times.  At this time the DMO-PDF is engaged in an expansion of military operations, in collaboration with local allied forces, across several townships including Pekon, Pinlaung, Bawlakhe, and Demoso.K","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuaW9ubGluZS5uZXQvZW4vbmV3cy9kZW1vc28tcGRmLXJlc3BlY3QtZmFsbGVuLWNvbXJhZGVzLWR1cmluZy0yLXllYXJzLXJldm9sdXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

People carry the body of a Cyclone Mocha victim during a funeral near the Basara Rohingya camp in Sittwe, Rakhine state, Myanmar, on May 16, 2023.  Myanmar’s junta says that 100 Rohingya died from last weekend’s Cyclone Mocha – and that news outlets that say it’s higher will be sued.  The shadow National Unity Government, made up of former parliamentarians and opponents of the military, which took control of the country in a 2021 coup, puts the number at 455 – more than four times higher.  Reports by media that more than 400 were killed “were baseless and have frightened the public,” a junta statement Friday said. “We will take action against those media using existing laws.”  The storm that hit the coast of Rakhine state and parts of Bangladesh last weekend, flooded villages and battered camps where displaced Rohingya have lived for years.  Authorities evacuated the Rakhine population before the storm and accommodated 63,302 of the 125,789 Rohingyas from 17 refugee camps who needed to be evacuated, the junta statement said.  Those who died in the storm were people who didn’t comply with the authority’s evacuation procedure and remained in their homes on their own accord, the military said.  Radio Free Asia reported earlier this week that many people couldn’t evacuate because emergency shelter centers quickly became overcrowded.  Some 130,000 Rohingya have lived for more than a decade in internally displaced persons camps in and around Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.  The deaths of so many villagers from the storm was a result of their poor living standards in restricted camps near the seashore, Rohingya activists told RFA. Many villagers weren’t properly informed of the coming cyclone, they said.  Two Rohingya villagers told RFA that it has been difficult to collect every dead body that was washed into the sea after the storm struck the coast.  The junta said Friday that 18 army officers would be assigned to each township to oversee rehabilitation work for the 18 townships in Rakhine and Chin state that were affected by the storm.  In those areas, transportation infrastructure and some telephone networks have been out of service, and there are still areas where food, medicine and shelters haven't arrived.  NUG’s statement on Wednesday said more than 42,000 acres of agricultural land in four states and regions were destroyed by the storm.  Translated by Myo Min Aung.

This year there are fifty-nine events in a dozen venues, featuring at least thirty-three acts.  There are concerts, sessions, workshops, a twmpath/ceilidh, the famous Pirates and Smugglers Walk, traditional dancers, a musical picnic (weather permitting) and much more.  The festival remains proudly ‘mostly free’. This year out of all the events, you only have to pay for - drum roll - the three headline concerts in Theatr Gwaun.  Sam Sweeney, star of stage, screen and Bellowhead, is the first headliner on the Saturday afternoon. Possibly the most exciting British fiddler of the last twenty years, the organisers said that getting Sam for the festival was quite a coup.  On Saturday evening you can hear the exhilarating Granny’s Attic supported by the delicate harmonies and lovely playing of upcoming duo Janice Burns and Jon Doran.  The last headline concert is on the Sunday night: Emily Portman, one of the most beautiful voices in folk, accompanied by Rob Harbron and supported by local favourites Broadoak. Concert tickets cost £15 and are available from Theatr Gwaun, either on 01348 873421 or online.  Beyond the concerts, there is a huge amount to do - active participation is the heart of the festival. Dance to live music, learn to play the spoons or the bodhran (go on, you know you want to), sing yourself hoarse at a singaround, play at a session where you could be sitting next to someone straight off the stage - or get up on stage yourself at an open mic event.  “You never know quite what you can do, or what you might enjoy, until you have a go - so come along and find out,” said the festival’s organisers.

As the head of the Council, Burhan appointed former rebel leader Malik Agar as the deputy on the Council.  Sudan spiraled into chaos after the two powerful groups of the country; the army led by Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Hemedti, turned on each other.  The men were allied in the 2021 coup and the toppling of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019.  That led to the establishment of a joint civilian-military Sovereign Council headed by Burhan that was supposed to rule Sudan until elections, set for 2023.  But the integration of the armed forces or how the RSF would be integrated into the military led to tensions between the generals.  Talks for a democratic transition halted after the 2021 coup, but the armed forces and the RSF under international pressure signed a preliminary deal in December to chart a path to democratic transition.  Still, the issue of having control over fighters and weapons wasn't resolved and the tensions ultimately led to a full-blown crisis on April 15.

"coup","2019-07-25","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T10:32:47","Democrats may have to act radically to deny Donald Trump the 2024 Republican nomination. We cannot rely on Republicans to do it. They do not understand the stakes involved.  Take the case of Georgetown University law professor Randy Barnett.  Barnett is America’s leading constitutional conservative. He is the originalist’s originalist.  It was Barnett who almost convinced the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 that Obamacare was unconstitutional.  Barnett is now campaigning against Trump.  That is the good news.  The bad news is that Barnett, and by extension The Federalist Society and its many followers, still do not understand the mortal danger that Trump represents.  Barnett recently penned a series of tweets that amounted to an argument in favor of Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis—or someone much like him — for president in 2024.  Barnett wrote that “one can believe” both that “Trump was a far better President than [Hillary] Clinton would have been & the US is better off he won in 2016” and that Trump is unlikely to win in 2024 and “would govern badly if he did.”  Barnett added that it would be better to nominate someone else who can win, has demonstrated executive skills and character to govern better than Trump would and would be able to serve two terms if elected.  It is not a bad argument, if a little cool and indirect for mainstream politics.  But it demonstrates that Barnett has not yet come to terms with the tragic mistake he made in supporting Trump in 2016.  No, America is not “better off” that Trump was president.  Barnett is focused on the newly minted conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court he now enjoys, courtesy of Trump.  In considering various policies that Trump pursued as president, Barnett is ignoring the one unforgivable sin Trump committed —refusing to peacefully transfer power after the 2020 election.  Instead of conceding defeat, Trump told his supporters that he had actually won, took arguably unlawful actions to try to stay in power, and fomented a riot at the Capitol when he could not convince Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the election result.  Trump left office only because he could not figure out anything else to do.  People forget that the fundamental problem the framers of the Constitution were attempting to solve was the peaceful and continuous transfer of power—the issue that had led to civil war in Great Britain and throughout world history.  America’s constitutional democracy functioned well in this regard until Trump.  For anyone who loves the Constitution, Trump’s actions after the 2020 election disqualify him from ever holding office again.  What makes Barnett think that a President Trump, having resisted once, would yield power after the presidential election of 2028? Trump repeated his big lie about the 2020 election just last week on CNN.  It is true that Trump’s first attempt at a coup was clownish and bound to fail.  So was Hitler’s first attempt at a coup in 1923.  Because Barnett’s campaign against Trump does not point out this danger, it is far too mild to have any effect on Trump’s chances.  If Barnett were a patriot, he would write this open letter to the Republican Party faithful:  Donald Trump let us down by attempting to overthrow our Constitution in 2020. He is unfit to be President. If Trump is nominated, I, and many thousands of my fellow constitutional conservatives, will be forced to vote for Joe Biden.  And then Barnett would convince the leadership of The Federalist Society to sign the letter with him.  We Democrats must be willing to match the action I am calling on Barnett to take.  If Trump is still a viable candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination when the Pennsylvania primary comes around, I will change my party affiliation from Democratic to Republican and vote for the Republican candidate with the best chance of defeating Trump for the nomination.  And I hope many of my fellow Democrats will do the same thing, in Pennsylvania and across the country.  Of course, if we do this, we will be hurting Joe Biden’s chances of being reelected. If that were the only consideration, Trump would be the easiest Republican to beat.  But Biden’s reelection is not the most important consideration.  Any chance that Trump might become president again is a threat to be avoided at all costs.  While I strongly oppose the policies that someone like DeSantis as President would enact, no political loss in our system of government is permanent. If your opponent gains power and executes bad policies, the damage can be undone in the next presidential election.  With DeSantis, and really every Republican with a chance at the 2024 presidential nomination, I can be confident that there will be a next election.  Trump is the lone exception. Trump is the only political figure in America who threatens the end of constitutional democracy.  It is time for Barnett, who helped unleash this threat in the first place, to face that reality and take the necessary steps to prevent it.  But if he will not take that responsibility, then, for the sake of the Constitution, we Democrats will have to step up.  Trump must be defeated. No matter what it takes. The first, and best, chance to do that is a Republican primary.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW5uY2FwaXRhbC1zdGFyLmNvbS9jb21tZW50YXJ5L2lmLXRoZS1nb3Atd29udC1kby1pdC1kZW1vY3JhdHMtd2lsbC1oYXZlLXRvLWJsb2NrLXRydW1wcy1ub21pbmF0aW9uLWZvci10aGVtLWJydWNlLWxlZGV3aXR6L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T17:34:35","The recent invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to COP 28 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) marks a great comeback for him. Assad ruthlessly prosecuted a civil war that is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 of his citizens, at least 5.5 million refugees—most of them in the neighboring countries of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan—and 6.8 million internally displaced persons.  After being a pariah for a long time, Assad was warmly welcomed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He is attending the summit of the Arab League. This is the first time Assad has participated in such a summit after the Arab League suspended Syria in 2011.  Assad Is Back  The state-controlled Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) made full play of Assad’s political and public relations coup. SANA published images of Assad reading the letter of invitation from Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the president of the UAE and the ruler of Abu Dhabi,i with a UAE diplomat looking on approvingly. A statement from Dubai’s COP 28 organizers spoke of an “inclusive process that produces transformational solutions (which) can only happen if we have everyone in the room.”  Over the years, the UAE has led the efforts to bring Syria in from the cold. This latest effort can be viewed as politically useful both to the Emiratis and Assad. Yet it makes sense in having Syria attend regional summits. In the battle to mitigate the impact of climate change globally, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is on the frontlines with temperatures warming at nearly twice the global average. It is a region already profoundly threatened by extreme water scarcity. So, the involvement of all actors, including Syria, is a good idea.  Indeed, many experts say drought conditions were a significant causational contributor to the war in Syria. From 2006 to 2010, the country experienced a catastrophic drought, the third in a little more than two decades. The drought led to the collapse of the agricultural economy, driving millions into urban centers seeking work. These desperate people rose in rebellion during the 2011 Arab Spring movement.  Sadly for them, the Assad regime was prepared to use any amount of force to suppress what began as a series of peaceful protests. This wanton use of violence proved to be the perfect storm for a civil war that began in March 2011 and continues to this day.  Water Scarcity Woes  Water scarcity is also at the heart of the growing conflict between countries in the region hosting Syrian refugees and local populations. This is particularly the case in Jordan, the second most water deprived country in the world, and Lebanon where water scarcity has been exacerbated by the ongoing political crisis.  The Gulf countries are better off. Their coffers are swollen because of surging oil prices. These countries are well placed to absorb the body blows inflicted upon them by climate change. Desalination projects in the Gulf continue apace. Saudi Arabia has doubled its desalinated water output over the past decade and Riyadh-based ACWA Power has just announced a $667 million (2.5 billion Saudi riyals) Red Sea desalination project.  The UAE derives nearly half of its water needs and almost all of its potable water requirements from 70 desalination plants. According to a UAE government website, the plants account for 14% of the world’s total production of desalinated water. Note that the UAE has less than 10 million people, suggesting that their water usage habits are wasteful in the extreme. Other Gulf countries are similarly wasteful.  Other Challenges Ahead and What Can be Done  Along with water scarcity, extreme climate events are dramatically increasing in MENA. The intensity and frequency of sand and dust storms (SDS) is wreaking havoc with food production and people’s health as well as damaging industrial equipment and vehicles. A report by the Washington-based Arab Center last year noted:  “For all the disruption caused by this force majeure, much about SDS, including how to mitigate the phenomenon’s effects, remains poorly understood and has received relatively little scientific or policy attention. Considering the growing prevalence of SDS across the Middle East and North Africa, the storms’ impact on health, society, and the economy must surely be addressed, and policies need to be instituted to alleviate their effects.”  COP 28 faces daunting challenges from water scarcity to SDS. Developing countries do not have the money to tackle them. Yet it is unclear if developed countries will fulfill commitments to assist developing states in transitioning to green alternatives. Developed countries were supposed to set up a $100 billion fund by 2020, which remains an unfulfilled obligation.  The world’s attempts to hold global warming to 1.5° Celsius is already slipping away in the MENA region. A recent report from the World Resources Institute noted:  “Every fraction of a degree of warming will intensify these threats, and even limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degree C is not safe for all. At this level of warming, for example, 950 million people across the world’s drylands will experience water stress, heat stress and desertification, while the share of the global population exposed to flooding will rise by 24%.”  Sultan al-Jaber was appointed the boss of COP 28 in January. Howls of protest broke out. Jaber is the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the UAE state-owned giant energy conglomerate. Climate activists have not liked his appointment. Jaber has a delicate balancing act ahead of him. Skeptics say he should be the last person to head COP 28. Supporters point out that Jaber has a strong record as an advocate of renewable energy.  ADNOC and Saudi Aramco together could have a significant positive impact if they commit to renewables. Of course, they will want to protect their dominant fossil fuels market position while pursuing renewables. This is indeed a tricky balance. Yet if the Saudis and Emiratis buy into renewables, the $100 billion target might be achievable.

"coup","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Geneva"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T15:27:47","GENEVA  Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.  On our radar  Darfur bears the brunt of Sudan’s conflict  Much of the coverage of Sudan’s conflict has focused on the battle for Khartoum. But some of the worst fighting has occurred in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state. On top of combat between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), clashes have broken out in the town between local RSF-aligned Arab militias and members of the area’s non-Arab Masalit group. A Sudanese doctors’ union said 280 people were killed in just two days this month, while other local groups said the total death toll now exceeds 2,000. More than 150,000 people from the town and surrounding areas have been displaced, many to neighbouring Chad. The security situation has been better in Darfur’s other main towns after community leaders brokered ceasefires between the army and RSF, but some of these initiatives now appear to be breaking down. Across the country, over half the population needs aid – some 25 million people, the highest ever recorded in Sudan – according to the UN, which launched an appeal for $3 billion in funding.  Restrictions slow aid after Cyclone Mocha  Cyclone Mocha left widespread destruction in Myanmar’s Rakhine State. But aid groups and local communities are still trying to get a clearer picture of the damage days after the storm’s 14 May landfall, with parts of the state and neighbouring areas still cut from communications and direct access. Casualties are expected to rise; a Rohingya diaspora group said Cyclone Mocha killed at least 400 people in neglected internal displacement camps. “No humanitarian aid has reached the affected Rohingya people,” Tun Khin, head of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, said in a statement. International aid groups said they are pushing for authorities to loosen restrictions that have long hampered relief across Myanmar. Civil society groups in Rakhine – as well as leaders of a rebel government and the Arakan Army armed group – are raising funds and delivering aid in some areas. International aid access in Myanmar has always been volatile, and restrictions have continued after the military junta seized power in a February 2021 coup. Rakhine state – also home to Myanmar’s embattled Rohingya minority – is particularly closed off. Years after a military purge pushed hundreds of thousands of people into Bangladesh, Rohingya still in Rakhine State face apartheid-like conditions. Some 140,000 people live in camps that lack basic infrastructure, “contributing to a growing tally of preventable deaths and annual threats from extreme weather,” Human Rights Watch said.  Food cuts lead to rising malnutrition in refugee camps  Uganda is Africa’s largest refugee-hosting country and has been widely praised for the way it treats people seeking safety. But aid groups are warning that recent cuts to humanitarian funding are leaving refugees in a bad way. According to the International Rescue Committee, levels of acute malnutrition are rising among women and children in different settlements, with dietary diversity “sharply impacted” by food ration reductions. A funding crunch has forced the World Food Programme to embark on a “prioritisation” exercise that will mean some refugees no longer receive food aid, while others will get significantly reduced amounts. Aid groups are expecting the process will result in refugee households leaving the settlements (many already have) and will create safety concerns for their own staff working in camps. WFP cuts are also affecting refugees in other countries, from Burundi – where rations are being slashed by half – to the Rohingya in Bangladesh, where food vouchers were reduced in March and are likely to be lowered again, unless money is forthcoming.  Another reprieve for Black Sea grain deal  Russia has agreed to a two-month extension of the Black Sea grain deal that allows safe passage for Ukrainian maize and wheat to hungry world markets. Question marks had hung over the survival of the Turkish and UN-brokered agreement after Russia had threatened to bow out. Moscow argues a separate deal, to facilitate the shipments of Russian food and fertiliser, has not been upheld. Yet there was no mention of concessions when Türkiye announced the extension of the grain agreement – amid profuse thanks to President Vladimir Putin. The deal is a key step in stabilising global food prices. They rocketed last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, hurting consumers in the many countries reliant on Ukrainian exports. It’s the third extension of the initiative since it was first agreed in July 2022, with negotiations fraught each time. But although plugging Ukraine back into the international food system is important, it doesn’t ease the processing and transport costs, also driving up prices in local markets.  Deportations of Syrian refugees sow fear in Lebanon  The Lebanese government is continuing a wave of raids and deportations of Syrian refugees, “creating anxiety and panic” among the community of 1.5 to 2 million people who have fled their country’s war. Lebanon has not allowed the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, to register new refugees since 2015, meaning that many have had trouble acquiring or updating residency papers. Amid anti-refugee rhetoric from politicians, who have long used Syrians as a scapegoat for Lebanon’s disastrous economic collapse (despite not being the cause), Médecins Sans Frontières says that many refugees are too afraid to leave the safety of their homes to seek medical care. Meanwhile, the country’s economic crisis shows no sign of abating. On 16 May, a French judge issued an international arrest warrant for the longtime governor of Lebanon’s Central Bank, Riad Salameh, who European countries are investigating – along with other associates and officials – on allegations of fraud and illicit enrichment of $330 million worth of public money.  The world nears a climate threshold  Global temperature rise is almost certain to exceed the crucial 1.5C threshold in the next five years, according to new research by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Experts say limiting temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is necessary to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change – including more frequent droughts, heat waves, floods, and wildfires that help worsen humanitarian crises. Researchers attribute the latest projections to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and the looming El Niño weather pattern. Breaking the 1.5C threshold is likely to be temporary, the WMO says, meaning there is still time to cut emissions.  What’s on the agenda at the World Health Assembly  The World Health Organization’s annual ministerial meetings begin 21 May in Geneva, with a heavy focus on pandemic preparedness and a more reliable budget. Countries use the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, to influence global health policy. Among the issues that could spark fireworks, according to Health Policy Watch: language over reproductive health; geopolitics, with Russia’s Ukraine invasion top of mind and the US and China tussling over Taiwan’s status; and the right way to increase WHO’s funding. How the WHO addresses aid worker sexual abuse and exploitation will be one of many issues raised, at least as part of broader audit reports. A potential new treaty on pandemic preparedness is in tight negotiations and won’t see daylight until next year’s meetings. But the WHO’s oversight committee, comprising senior experts from governments and the aid system, is one of many bodies asking whether the health agency is prepared. The WHO’s health emergencies programme is “overstretched”, the committee warned in a report going before the assembly: “[It] would encounter tremendous difficulties in the event of a new pandemic like COVID-19.”  Weekend read  Gang violence has long been a neglected humanitarian issue in Latin America and the Caribbean, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes every year, either to become internally displaced or to seek refuge or more secure lives abroad. There are other common byproducts too, including higher gender-based violence, economic deprivation, and increased hunger, not to mention entire generations of children whose futures are being stolen. Latin America Editor-at-large Daniela Mohor has launched a new series, Gangs Out of Control, that examines the spread of gangs and the failure of regional governments to control the violence. Her initial overview lays out the scale of the problem, explores the humanitarian fallout, and points to some large gaps in the aid response. This intensifying violence presents a relatively new and unorthodox challenge for humanitarians more used to operating in war zones and disasters. But getting to grips with this challenge may rise up the sector’s priority list: In the worst-hit countries like Haiti, the violence is so extreme that it is driving some communities towards starvation – famine is now feared as half the population of 10 million is gripped by a hunger crisis, even as the insecurity often means aid agencies are unable to reach those in need.  And finally…  Art can be a powerful way to process trauma, and The Guardian has two articles that put the spotlight on how Iraqi music is doing just that, 20 years after the US-led invasion. The piece on rap explains that Iraqi artists tend towards satire as they utilise a genre that comes from “the country responsible for their nation’s predicament.” Sometimes this connection is quite literal: Iraqi music producer UsFoxx first heard 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” thumping from an American Humvee that was patrolling near his home back in 2004. The pieces showcase lyrics about oil, corruption, war, and some truly excellent beats. Music from Iraq and the Iraqi diaspora aren’t just about war, of course, and there are many types of music coming out of the country. But current events do have an important and lasting impact on culture: British-Iraqi manager Nazar Risafi says that mass protests, which began in October 2019 and lasted around two years, led to music about revolution, as well as new collaborations between Iraqi musicians and others around the world.

The road to Cannes has been fraught with struggle for the filmmakers behind Goodbye Julia, the first Sudanese film to make the official selection in the 76-year history of the festival.  Sudan descended into civil war just two days after the announcement that the directorial feature debut of Mohamed Kordofani would play in Un Certain Regard. It marks the latest conflict in a country that has suffered numerous outbreaks of violent clashes for decades.  “Sudanese filmmakers don’t have the luxury of working in a comfortable environment,” says Amjad Abu Alala, the film’s producer, who won the Venice Lion of the Future award in 2019 with his own debut feature You Will Die At Twenty. “We can’t wait for things to settle down. We always have to struggle.”  Goodbye Julia is reflective of these historic challenges, set against a backdrop of events that led to the South Sudanese independence referendum in 2011, in which 98.8% of southerners voted to split from the north.  Days of atonement  Set in Khartoum, the drama follows two women hailing from the north and south of the country. Mona is a retired singer who seeks redemption for causing the death of a man from the south by offering a job as a maid to his widow, Julia, who is oblivious of Mona’s involvement. The roles are played respectively by Eiman Yousif and Sudanese supermodel Siran Riak, making her feature acting debut.  It follows four years of work on the project by Alala and Kordofani, who first worked together on the latter’s short film Nyerkuk in 2016. “I am always looking to work with ambitious Sudanese filmmakers and I heard about Kordofani, an aircraft engineer who was trying to make films,” recalls Alala. “He has built this story around a tragic period in the history of Sudan. He was born and raised in Khartoum, so has personally lived through these events.”  Finance was pulled together from myriad sources, beginning with the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture in 2019, and going on to include an impressive patchwork of producers. Sudan’s Station Films is lead producer, with co-producers comprising Egypt’s Red Star Films, Sudan’s Klozium Studios, Germany’s Die Gesellschaft, France’s Dolce Vita Films, Saudi Arabia’s CineWaves Films and Egypt’s Ambient Light, as well as Sweden’s RiverFlower and Egypt’s CULT.  The film was shot in 40 days from November 6 to December 15, 2022, with the score recorded during the bombing of Khartoum by young music producer Mazin Hamid. Such conditions have taken their toll on the filmmakers. “It has been exhausting,” says Alala. “I am taking medicine for my blood pressure and we had to keep track of Kordofani’s health during shooting.”  Kordofani is part of a new wave of filmmakers that began to rise following Sudan’s 2019 revolution, which ended a three-decade dictatorship led by Omar al-Bashir. But a military coup in late 2021 and the recent outbreak of war have set back these efforts.  “It is a very sad situation because every time we try to move forward, conflicts set us back,” says Alala. “Now we are facing a civil war that might destroy the country, but it won’t stop us filmmakers.  “As Sudanese we have mixed feelings, between joy for our film being selected for Cannes and sadness because of this violent war.”  However, there is already anticipation for the film’s life beyond Cannes. Pan-Arab distributor MAD Solutions moved into international sales with this title and landed a deal with ARP Sélection for French distribution before the festival began. Goodbye Julia will receive its MENA premiere at the sixth El Gouna Film Festival in Egypt this October.  Meanwhile, Alala continues to work on generating fresh films. As a producer, he recently finished shooting Last Miracle, the first short directed by Egypt’s Abdelwahab Shawky, his first assistant on You Will Die At Twenty.  As a director, Alala is keeping details under wraps, but is lining up two features with Egyptian producers and says there is a wealth of Sudanese tales to tell. “We haven’t had a film industry in Sudan until now and we have a huge treasure trove of untold stories from different cultures that can be shared with the whole world.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JlZW5kYWlseS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ29vZGJ5ZS1qdWxpYS1wcm9kdWNlci1vbi1jYW5uZXMtZmlyc3Qtc3VkYW5lc2UtdGl0bGUtY2l2aWwtd2FyLW1pZ2h0LWRlc3Ryb3ktdGhlLWNvdW50cnktYnV0LWl0LXdvbnQtc3RvcC11cy1maWxtbWFrZXJzLzUxODIzMzQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Considering the management and programmatic challenges inside that office, stemming from prolonged periods without political leadership, we seek additional information regarding your policy priorities for S/GWI, as well as information on how those priorities align with the work that preceded your arrival.  As you may know, we have strongly supported efforts by the Department of State to advance women’s economic empowerment as an important priority of U.S. foreign policy. In 2020, we introduced bipartisan legislation to codify the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (WGDP) Initiative and strengthen USAID and State Department managerial structures related to women’s empowerment, including within the S/GWI office. The WGDP Initiative enjoyed strong bipartisan support and appropriately prioritized concrete lines of effort around women’s participation in the global economy including a labor force and providing women with quality education, training, and support to secure higher increase in women’s participation in the global paying jobs and increase the access of women entrepreneurs and business owners to financing, market opportunities, and training to establish and grow their businesses.  In 2021, however, the Biden Administration announced it would utilize the funds Congress provided to implement the WGDP Initiative for the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund, which expands the focus beyond women’s economic empowerment to include other issues such as climate change, gender-based violence, and global health. We are concerned that by blending these priorities, the emphasis on women’s economic empowerment will be diminished and eclipsed. We are also concerned that the Biden Administration appears to have abandoned the interagency priorities announced in 2021 for implementation of the U.S. Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Act (P.L. 115-18) and is instead moving to focus the WPS agenda on “gender” rather than the needs of women and girls. Finally, we have concerns about S/GWI’s decision to re-engage with the problematic UN Women Generation Equality initiative.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2ZvcmVpZ25hZmZhaXJzLmhvdXNlLmdvdi9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL21jY2F1bC13YWduZXItcHJlc3Mtc3RhdGVzLWd3aS1vZmZpY2Utb24taW5hZGVxdWF0ZS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWFuZC1taXNwbGFjZWQtcHJpb3JpdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fuentes says, gesturing out to the gallery before him.  At the May 5 opening reception of Mission Grafica’s latest exhibition at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts (MCCLA), decades worth of posters and prints fill the room, all contributing to Grafica’s iconic legacy of artistic activism.  The air is thick with the coterie. Old friends, some who have frequented MCCLA since its inception, throw their arms around each other’s shoulders. Laughing children playfully weave in and out of the crowds. Some people dance to the music, others remain so swept up in the art before them that they remain oblivious to the celebration that has erupted around them.  The scene is a reflection of the community that has allowed MCCLA to flourish in the Mission as a hub of artistic expression for over 45 years.

The work that’s here symbolizes resilience and resistance to those things.”  The posters cover a variety of social and political issues, ranging from the Salvadoran civil war and the infamous 1973 Chilean military coup, to calls for respect for women’s bodily autonomy and better housing conditions in San Francisco.

It’s a mark of time, a mark of consciousness, and of what people are going through. Even though [younger generations] might not know about some of the political events, they should come see what it was about … Art is timeless.”  Fuentes, who curated the exhibition with co-curator Calixto Robles and artist Art Hazelwood, pulled from Mission Grafica’s extensive archive as well as private collections and other Chicano art collectives for the exhibition.  MCCLA Executive Director Martina Ayala insists that the flames of injustice that first sparked the creation of MCCLA and Mission Grafica continue to inspire and ignite younger generations of artists.  “As our artists get older and become elders, it’s important to pass down that tradition to the new generation … and to educate our young artists on our cultural and historical legacy so that we can continue to grow and move forward as artists of social change,” Ayala said.

The cultural center now offers 36 classes a week, many of which are free or low-cost.  MCCLA was first established in 1977 by a group of artists and activists, who, inspired by the local movements of the time, aspired to create a haven for the artistic endeavors of the community. It’s the self-proclaimed largest Latinx cultural center in the continental United States and functions in San Francisco today as a historical, legacy organization. It was also recognized as a designated San Francisco landmark in 2022.  “This center was created with love and with passion for justice and equity,” Ayala said. “We came out of inequity and made sure our people had a place to go so that our culture could be preserved and promoted. It’s this same spirit that keeps us going.”  Culture and Politics” on May 5 at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts (MCCLA). The exhibition showcases posters and prints that have contributed to Grafica’s iconic legacy of artistic activism. Courtesy photos  While many pieces in the exhibition were made implementing traditional methods of screen printing and other mediums, Fuentes encourages younger artists to take advantage of newer technology to continue to push for change.  “The bottom line is that these works were used to advance political struggles or social issues,” Fuentes said. “Those things can still be done, and we still need that … we did it our way during that time period because those are the tools we had. Now, there are even more tools — the window of expression is even wider for youth to use.”  As the tools used for artistic expression evolve, so does the social messaging behind it.  La Llorona’s Sacred Waters, a recognizable piece by artist Juana Alicia, for example, flips the protagonist of a famous Mexican folktale into a woman who weeps for having been cut off from safe drinking water. The image was the basis of the current mural on York and 24th streets.  Culture and Politics” on May 5 at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts (MCCLA).

It’s nice to see the history.”  As MCCLA approaches nearly five decades of service to the community, Ayala says more support is always needed for new equipment, building repairs, and paying artists and teachers equitable wages for their work.

Screen printing is also taught by Robles on Tuesdays from 6-8 p.m.  “We’ve always been resourceful and resilient and made the best with what we have, but it is also time for us to aspire for more and have what we deserve,” Ayala said. “This new generation needs all the tools possible to continue our legacy and continue to promote our cultural heritage […] If we don’t invest in Latino artists, who will?”  Mission Grafica, 46 Years, Community, Culture and Politics will run at the MCCLA until June 25.

"coup","1952-07-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T04:21:04","Sharon Kennedy  Community Columnist  Two weeks ag,o I watched King Charles and Queen Camilla as they traversed through the throng in their golden carriage en route to their new home. Ostentatious as it was, the coronation was a momentous occasion that may never be repeated. When the king’s son takes the reins, he might settle for less ceremony. I won’t offer an opinion on the pomp and expense involved in creating such grand theater, but I will mention something I observed that was in stark contrast to our country: There were no gunmen wielding assault weapons and opening fire on the crowds. Onlookers were not frantically searching for a safe hiding place. Children were not screaming as their parents covered them in an attempt to thwart bullets meant for their bodies.  True, there were small groups of dissidents who railed against the grandeur, but they did not resort to violence. They used their voices to protest what they considered an outdated, outlandish and unnecessary display of wealth in crowning a new monarch. It’s very likely that in the crowd of British observers, there were people who were unhappy about seeing such opulence forever out of their reach. How did they express their outrage? Did they try to spear the carriage carrying their king? Did they call for the head of their new queen? Or did the majority of common folks simply wait in the rain to send their sovereign and his wife good wishes?  I don’t know anymore than you do. I only know what I saw as I watched some of the proceedings. As with that infamous day when a coup was attempted in our nation’s Capitol, the interpretation of what we witnessed will vary. I saw a multitude of individuals who looked happy and excited and ready to give King Charles their blessing.  I heard wishes of goodwill and shouts of “long live the king.” You might have focused on angry bystanders hollering insults and slurs, while I neither saw nor heard them.  When I thought about the peaceful transfer of the crown, I couldn’t help but compare it to Jan. 6. Previous to the insurrection, that date had no significance to me other than it was the birthday of one of my aunts and a cousin. I had no idea it was the day our vice president affirmed the winner of the Nov. presidential election. To me it was just another day with no historical importance but like Sept. 11, it will forever have a new meaning for anyone old enough to remember the tragic events that unfolded — unchecked and deadly — for hours.  But I digress. The point of this musing is the absence of disgruntled men or women randomly shooting into the English crowds. An assault rifle would have resulted in many deaths and hundreds of injuries. A bomb or grenade or any other weapon of destruction would have turned the streets into a bloody nightmare scene. But we know such acts of violence rarely happen in other civilized countries. For some unexplainable reason, the U.S. reigns supreme when it comes to mass killings.  Why? Nobody seems to know and I certainly don’t, but neither do I think the senseless rampages will end. Obviously, this is the new normal. From the first shiploads of Europeans, we’ve always been a violent people. Our leaders are crooks, our neighbors are strangers and our patience is over. It’s dog-eat-dog. Get the first bite in and go for the throat.  — To contact Sharon Kennedy, send her an email atauthorsharonkennedy.com.

Humanitarian assistance from international organizations has begun to arrive in the country although access to it has been restricted by the authorities.  As per the UN statement, World Food Program teams have begun distributing food at evacuation shelters in Rakhine State and Magway region, the two worst-hit areas in Myanmar, while still attempting to reach the other affected people.  The military junta ruling the country since the 2021 coup has still not opened access to international aid for many of the affected regions, although some organizations have been able to initiate aid in some areas where they had prior authorization to enter.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Southeast Asia spokesperson Pierre Peron told EFE on Friday they are able to provide “initial support” in some parts of Rakhine state.  “In parts of Rakhine where there were pre-existing authorizations and operations, workers have offered initial support to all affected communities” including thousands of displaced Rohingya Muslims, who live in precarious refugee camps, he said.  Mocha made landfall on Sunday between southern Bangladesh and western Myanmar, leading to problems in mobility and communication due to the destruction of infrastructure during the cyclone.  This has prevented the authorities and nonprofits from getting a proper idea of the number of casualties and the extent of damages caused, with reports of several villages completely destroyed in the catastrophe.  Despite these initial relief efforts, much of the humanitarian aid remains blocked, as the junta has restricted international aid to affected areas.  “Negotiations for humanitarian access continue with all parties involved. In the meantime, our partners continue their field observations and are ready to start coordinated field missions once they are approved,” Peron explained.  According to the UN, the cyclone has left some 3.2 million people extremely vulnerable, and in many areas electricity and telephone connections remain cut, while there prevails an “urgent” need for drinking water and fuel.  Conditions are especially difficult in the camps for displaced people, where tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have been languishing for years.  This ethnic minority community is not recognized by the Myanmar authorities as citizens and have been persecuted by the army especially in recent years.  Preliminary data – although unverified – from the opposition National Unity Government of Myanmar, or the rebel government, indicate that the cyclone has claimed the lives of at least 455 people – 431 of them in Rakhine.

"coup","2020-09-19","Not Discerned","{""Magway"", ""Magway"", ""Myanmar""}","2023-05-19T00:33:45","Widespread conflict has had a devastating impact on paddy farmers in war zones, but the slump in production is driving up prices for farmers in more stable areas, despite new onerous export restrictions.  By FRONTIER  Farmer U Kyaw Naing was once able to grow enough crops to feed his family and sell the surplus from his five acres in Sagaing Region’s Khin-U Township. But since his home and about 400 other households in Myo Thit village were burned down in a military raid, he has been forced to rely on rice donations from charity groups.  “I can’t even think about growing monsoon paddy this year because my house was burned down. All of my paddy seeds for planting and the rice we reserved to eat are gone. Nothing is left,” he said. “Last year, I could only grow one-and-a-half acres of paddy because we had to flee the military council’s troops.”  But one man’s loss is another man’s gain. With conflict affecting large swathes of Sagaing and Magway regions, which are major agricultural hubs, the supply of the staple food has dropped. This has driven up prices and allowed farmers in more stable areas to capitalise.  “It’s the nature of the market that if demand is higher than supply, you get a good price,” said the owner of a rice brokerage in Magway’s Pakkokku town.  After the military violently cracked down on protests against the February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s formerly peaceful central Dry Zone became an unlikely stronghold of armed resistance. Many residents of the area, which includes Magway and Sagaing, formed new anti-coup militias called People’s Defence Forces, initially armed with little more than homemade hunting rifles.  As the PDFs grew in strength, the military launched brutal counter-insurgency operations, burning down entire villages and bombing residential areas with fighter jets.  Grain merchants say the fierce conflict – and mass displacement of civilians – has reduced the area available for rice production. Meanwhile, an economic downturn and a depreciating kyat, combined with a heavy reliance on imported fertiliser, have drastically raised production costs.  Devastation in Sagaing and Magway  Many farmers in this part of the country have either had their homes and farms destroyed or been forced to abandon their property.  The Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar, a think tank, said in January that 43,216 buildings in Sagaing had been destroyed since the coup, nearly half of which were targeted between November and January alone. Another 11,000 buildings have been torched in Magway since the coup.  “In Khin-U Township, more villages were torched and destroyed this year,” said Bo Lynn Yaung, a member of the Khin-U PDF in Sagaing.  “The junta’s Ogre Column burned the houses. Paddy seeds and bean and pulse seeds were burnt to ashes, so the acreage of cultivation might decrease this year. Last year, villages close to where military troops were deployed were unable to grow any crops,” he explained, referring to soldiers from the Light Infantry Division 99, infamous for its brutal methods against the civilian population.  Kyaw Naing, the farmer whose home was destroyed in Myo Thit village, called for the parallel National Unity Government to support farmers in conflict-affected areas by providing them with seeds in time for the growing season.  “Rice is our staple and I want to grow it if possible. Even if I can’t produce a surplus that could be sold, I would be content with enough for my family to eat,” he said.  Most PDFs are nominally loyal to the NUG, which was appointed by elected lawmakers deposed in the coup, and have tried to roll out affiliated local administrations in areas where the junta’s governance has collapsed.  Even those who could grow some crops last year had to cut back on production due to rising costs and security risks.  “I couldn’t afford enough fertiliser, so an acre only yielded 40 baskets,” said Ko Phyo from Khin-U’s Inn Pat village, who was only able to use enough fertiliser to grow on three of his six acres.  “This year junta troops are stationed in many areas, and I worry that I may not be able to grow as much as last year.”  Daw Htar Htar, a farmer in Kanni village in Magway Region’s Myaing Township, said military raids made it impossible to produce a surplus.  “Farmers couldn’t produce a surplus for sale and could only grow enough for their own households last year,” she said, predicting more of the same this year.  “We have to flee our villages regularly.”  Women farm workers tend to rice plantation outside Nay Pyi Taw on May 1, 2018. (AFP)  Higher prices push up production  There are two rounds of paddy planting and harvesting each year. The monsoon crop is planted in June and harvested a few months later, while the summer crop is planted in November or December and is being harvested now.  Prices are already on the rise for the summer crop, and there’s speculation this will incentivise farmers in more stable areas to devote even more land to monsoon paddy.  An April report by the United States Department of Agriculture forecasted that “attractive market prices… will encourage farmers to increase rice acreage despite higher production costs and changing export and foreign currency regulations”.  The USDA forecast for rice production in 2022/23 was down 3 percent from the year before, largely due to lost acreage in conflict areas, but the report said market prices in March more than doubled from the reference rate of K315,000 per metric tonne to K750,000-850,000.  Traders told Frontier that the paddy being harvested this year was fetching up to K1.8 million for 100 baskets (or about K540,000 per tonne), compared to only around K1 million the year before. This is lower than the USDA figure, but industry sources said prices were continuing to rise.  “The current price is for newly-harvested and milled paddy, and it might rise after the paddy is drier,” said a farmer in Ayeyarwady Region’s Maubin Township, an area largely devoid of conflict.  A farmer who sells paddy seeds in Mandalay’s Patheingyi Township said he had a surge in customers for this year’s monsoon paddy crop because of the expected increase in profits.  “Farmers will grow the most profitable crops. If paddy fetches a good price this year, they will grow paddy,” said U Myo Tint Htun, deputy permanent secretary of the junta’s agriculture ministry.  The prices of beans and pulses are also up, according to U Kyaw Thwin, vice-chair of the Mandalay Region branch of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He said three baskets of beans and pulses are fetching K100,000-300,000, a roughly 60pc increase compared to last year.  U Myint Lwin, who farms 15 acres in Mandalay Region’s Madaya Township, said current paddy prices were good for farmers but acknowledged that they squeezed consumers at a time of economic hardship. He said in the long run, both producers and consumers would benefit from a more stable market and lower production costs.  “While it’s true that all people work in the hope of making a profit, it would be good if we can sympathise with each other,” he said.  Currency policy collapses exports  Economic policies under the junta have been erratic, often changing suddenly and typically aimed more at shoring up political control or replenishing the regime’s dwindling foreign currency reserves than creating healthy markets. The rice industry has been no exception.  On March 1, the junta rolled out a new policy that 65pc of border trade earnings from rice and rice products must be converted into kyat at the exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Myanmar. The remaining 35pc can be converted at the market rate, which is significantly more favourable.  Exporters said the new policy, which forces them to accept huge losses on their foreign currency earnings, has resulted in an extraordinary decline in exports via land borders.  “Rice exports to China have nearly stopped because of the policy change, but crops such as beans, sesame, maize, rubber and marine products are being exported as before,” a rice trader told Frontier on May 4.  The Myanmar Rice Federation says the overland trade in rice products hit 46,000 tonnes in January and 53,000 tonnes in February, but collapsed after the new regulations, dropping to just 270 tonnes in March and around 2,000 tonnes in April. State media corroborated those figures for April, reporting 2,228 tonnes exported.  Traders said rather than exporting through land borders, they’re sending the rice by sea or selling it domestically. State media said over 85,000 tonnes were exported by sea in April. These shipments are subjected to the same 65pc policy, but traders say they make more of a profit on maritime trade.  The Myanmar Rice Federation has set a target of exporting 2.5 million tonnes of rice this fiscal year, which ends in March 2024, an increase from the 2.26 million tonnes exported last fiscal year. But USDA projects the new policies will depress exports. Using April’s figures as a reference, Myanmar would fail to reach even half of that goal.  A rice exporter in the town of Muse, a trade hub on the Chinese border in northern Shan State, said traders were too afraid to publicly oppose the regime’s policies but were trying to raise the issue in meetings with lower-level officials.  “We might get into trouble for opposing their policy,” he said. “[The junta] did this because they want foreign currency.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVybXlhbm1hci5uZXQvZW4vY29udGludWVkLWluc3RhYmlsaXR5LWJyaW5ncy1taXhlZC1mb3J0dW5lcy1mb3ItcmljZS1ncm93ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2021-07-25","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T08:06:50","The proliferation of digital products and services like virtual Gucci’s bags sold via Roblox and token-gated members clubs, begs the question: what really defines true luxury in the metaverse today?  Though luxury had experimented with the metaverse for a number of years, the virtual world’s rise to mainstream acceptance occurred in 2021, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 and a shift to digitalization.  It’s estimated that metaverse luxury goods segment revenue could reach as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley.  What qualifies as luxury in the offline terrain encompasses a number of key factors, including exclusivity, authenticity and the creation of hedonic value through customer experiences. With more businesses adopting Web3, luxury brands are having to look for new ways to deliver all-frills digital experiences and diversify their offerings.  Pulling off a community coup  Community is the bedrock of Web3. The rise of consumer communities in the virtual realm is forcing luxury brands to restrategize their retail models to favor incentivization and rewards systems, and defend their values, such as excellence.  As in the offline world, in the digital space luxury spenders seek access to exclusive products and services that differentiate them from the mainstream crowd.  To be sure, obtaining items from a brand’s collection at its flagship boutique is not possible in Web3 (unless in avatar form). In a report published by Boston Consulting Group last year, 67 percent of survey respondents thought luxury brands’ digital experiences do not meet the standards of the labels’ in-store experiences.  The challenge of replicating offline luxury’s level of quality in the metaverse means brands have begun exploring alternative ways to deliver the luxury-standard experience and drive client engagement.  High-profile brands exploring Web3 acknowledge that consumers of luxury will refuse to settle for mediocrity.  For example, luxury jeweler Asprey’s Web3 arm, Asprey Studio, developed its token-gated “Asprey Club” community back in 2022 following its non-fungible token (NFT) collaboration with automotive label Bugatti, which tapped the auto manufacturer’s rich cultural heritage. Community membership provides access to high-profile offline events, with each member gifted an Asprey gold signet ring as an esteemed ‘badge of honor.’  “We chose the ring to make our audience feel like part of the club. This isn’t just for flippers, it’s for people who love collecting,” Ali Walker, Chief Creative Officer at Asprey Studio tells Jing Daily.  The devil is in the details – every aspect of a luxury-standard activation in Web3 should be considered. In Asprey Studio’s case, this comprised selecting the cream of the crypto crop for maximum security and assurance among its community.  The partnership’s latest project was composed of 111 objet eggs, each made with 1,500 pavé diamonds and carbon fiber. Minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the eggs were made available earlier this month for between $20,000 to $50,000.  “Bitcoin is one of the most secure and decentralized blockchain networks, and it really is a very premium blockchain. It is suitable for small, very high-end luxury and art drops, which is why we chose it,” Walker says.  Maintaining desirability  The metaverse has a branding problem; and luxury is taking note. In a bid to foster digital relationships with consumers and move away from the collective distaste of NFTs and crypto, the sector is eschewing off-putting terminology.  Maintaining desirability in Web3 also requires scarcity. Demand outweighing supply boosts the ‘almost-unattainable’ allure of a brand and its cultural status.  One success story is Dolce & Gabbana’s highly coveted Collezione Genesi NFT collection in 2021. Consisting of only nine, one-of-a-kind pieces, the series fetched a history-making $6 million at auction.  Collectors of luxury items have consistently been enticed by extreme rarity and scarcity, which explains why Dolce & Gabbana achieved such success with its inaugural metaverse offering.  But the bar for creating in Web3 is lower than in the offline world due to better accessibility and democratization across the ecosystem, in turn leading to an overabundance of digital assets and services. To excel in Web3’s luxury segment, brands must embrace rarity, which is key to superiority.  Luxury is also deploying customization and personalization in Web3 to enhance the appeal of digital products and services.  One of the advantages of generative AI technology is that it can help businesses “customize products for individual consumers at scale (for example, eyeglasses based on facial topography)” according to McKinsey’s Generative AI: Unlocking the future of fashion report, switching the shopping experience from an analog process to a memorable interaction.  Crystal clear  Knowledge is wealth, and transparency is the new name of the game. According to Boston Consulting Group, six out of 10 of consumers say that they consider sustainability when making purchasing decisions, with 80 percent believing that luxury fashion houses should commit to product life-cycle management beyond the production and sales’ processes.  Both online and offline luxury are now strongly aligned with traceability, with consumers perceiving extensive product knowledge as a luxury itself.  “Today’s consumers want to know that their purchases have been responsibly sourced and increasingly expect evidence of this, rather than just verbal assurances,” Jason McIntosh, chief product officer at De Beers Group’s B2B blockchain solution platform Tracr told Jing Daily earlier this year.  With a generation of consumers growing more conscious of where and how their products are made, luxury brands should present information in the digital realm that extends beyond the ‘made in …’ credentials.  To do so, they are turning to the blockchain as a means of delivering product provenance, ownership details for resales, and production information.  “On-chain product passports offer a new perspective on products, incorporating data, and digital elements. This paves the way for truly ‘phygital’ high-utility experiences, where consumers gain access to a wealth of new information about a product,” Carol Hilsum, Senior Director of Open Innovation and New Venture at Farfetch says. “This evolution in product thinking and the integration of a digital DNA layer has the potential to enhance longevity and value in the physical realm.”  Recommended Reading By Bethanie Ryder Loro Piana Partners With Aura Blockchain Consortium To Present Its Origin Story In Web3 By Bethanie Ryder  A case in point is super luxury label Loro Piana and diamond company De Beers, which are both leading the way in presenting in-depth information to their clienteles through blockchain technology.  The former joined the Aura Blockchain Consortium in March this year, and pledged to issue digital certificates alongside purchases of all new garments from its The Gift of Kings collection, while De Beers’ Tracr program harnesses a combination of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and advanced privacy to track the journey of each diamond across the value chain.  Both businesses provide extensive information on how their products are distributed and made, in turn bolstering the emotional value and reputation of their brands.  As luxury breaks free from conventional practices to keep up with shifting consumer attitudes, it’s revolutionizing its own industry in the process. With the next generation of luxury products and services being rolled out across the virtual terrain, Web3 will play a key role in the segment’s evolution and permanently disrupt the concept of what constitutes true luxury today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS93ZWIzLWx1eHVyeS1yZXRhaWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-26","10:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:30:00","Perhaps it's time to start taking old tech giant Oracle (ORCL 0.49%) more seriously in the public cloud market. While cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services continued to report slowdowns in growth to kick off 2023, Oracle's cloud platform is sizzling. This has helped with a resurgence of growth. Shares are up some 40% in the last year, bringing Oracle stock close to all-time highs last reached in late 2021.  How is Oracle suddenly enjoying such success? And is it too late to buy?  Oracle Cloud gets some help from an acquisition  Oracle's stock performance over the last few years has been supercharged. Zoom out and subtract the last three years, and you can see that Oracle was mostly a sleepy tech stock in the 2010s. What changed?  The key to its resurgence has been Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) -- yes, another public cloud provider -- as well as Oracle cloud software, which often gets bundled into a package with infrastructure services for customers. Oracle said total cloud revenue totaled $4.1 billion in the three-month period that ended in February 2023, up 45% year over year.  But remember much of this growth is due to Oracle's massive acquisition ($28.3 billion, to be exact) of healthcare industry software giant Cerner last summer. Excluding the $600 million in revenue in the last quarter from Cerner, as well as negative headwinds from currency exchange rates, Oracle's combined cloud business grew at a more modest 28% year-over-year pace. Come June of this year, though, Oracle won't get the bump in growth from Cerner anymore, since the acquisition was finalized over the summer of 2022.  Using the ""Oracle playbook""  Also bear in mind that Oracle has been leveraging Nvidia's pioneering work with high-performance computing chips and software. Oracle was the first to offer DGX Cloud, adding Nvidia's top GPUs to its own cloud infrastructure to beef up its appeal to customers. Oracle has been able to land some victories against its big-tech peers (again, like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS). One coup it pulled was nabbing Uber Technologies last quarter as the ride-hailing company migrates some of its workloads over to the more affordable Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ecosystem.  Indeed, Nvidia has helped level the playing field in cloud infrastructure, and cracked the door open for Oracle to wedge its foot into Azure and AWS' pantry. Let's not take too much away from Oracle here, though. Even fellow enterprise software maven Marc Benioff, CEO and co-founder of Salesforce, said he was adopting the ""Oracle playbook."" Oracle CEO Safra Catz is now borrowing the term when explaining the company's insistence on doing more with less, rather than pursuing growth at any cost.  In other words, Oracle isn't going to be the flashiest cloud stock out there, but that's OK. By the second half of 2023, expect revenue growth to moderate once the company is done lapping the pre-Cerner acquisition. At that point, I'd expect overall (cloud and noncloud) revenue growth to return to high-single-digit- or low-teens-percentage growth over the long term, with earnings and free cash flow per share averaging just a slightly higher growth rate.  The stock currently trades for 33 times trailing-12-month earnings (or 37 times free cash flow), and 20 times one-year forward expected earnings. Given the fact Oracle's pace of expansion is set to moderate, it's not a particularly compelling buy in my book at this point. However, given the company's fast and steady cloud expansion in recent years, it's certainly worth putting on watch if you'd forgotten about this top software giant of yesteryear.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3VwLTQwLWluLXRoZS1sYXN0LXllYXItaXMtaXQtdG9vLWxhdGUtdG8tYnV5LW9yYWNsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Protesters step on posters of Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing during a rally to mark the second anniversary of the military’s 2021 military coup, outside the Embassy of Myanmar in Tokyo, Feb. 1, 2023.  Holed up in his palace in Naypyitaw, Myanmar Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, must be apoplectic.  Over two years since seizing power in the Feb. 1, 2021 coup, the military has still not consolidated power. Despite vowing to crush the opposition, the junta leader had to acknowledge recently that 132 of Myanmar’s 330 townships–42 percent–were not under government control.  The shadow opposition National Unity Government, their People’s Defense Forces (PDFs), and allied ethnic resistance organizations, have held their own and enjoy overwhelming popular legitimacy.  The military’s supply lines, through the once safe ethnic majority Bamar heartland, are increasingly vulnerable and casualties are mounting.

Credit: Citizen journalist  The exasperation of the leadership is palpable and manifest in several key ways.  First, the military has increased its attacks on civilians in an attempt to terrorize them into submission through collective punishments and reprisals. The military is waging a scorched earth campaign and has arsoned over 65,000 homes, 48,000 in Sagaing alone.  The regime has stepped up their use of air assaults, a glaring admission that they are unable to deploy troops on the ground. And when they do, they will often dragoon civilians to serve as human shields.  Second, the regime has increased their reliance on pro-military militias and death squads.  Third, so desperate to defeat the NUG this year, the military increased its own budget by 51 percent, despite the moribund economy and diminished revenue streams.  Fourth, the regime has increased its cash rewards for members of the PDFs to surrender with their weapons. These offers are clearly caveated and do not amount to blanket immunity, but the expenditures do factor in the soaring rates of poverty caused by the junta’s mismanagement.

Credit: Associated Press  Fifth, when things are going badly, the military leadership tends to micromanage.  In February, Min Aung Hlaing met with the leadership of the Western Command in Rakhine. The following month, he made an inspection tour of the headquarters of the Northwest Command that is overseeing the campaigns in Sagaing and Chin States.  The previous month, the junta placed 14 townships in Sagaing, five in the Magway region, and four in Chin state under martial law.  These trips outside of Naypyitaw are all the more notable because Min Aung Hlaing rarely leaves the fortress capital, and he travels with a small army of bodyguards..  That’s no profile in courage compared to the NUG’s acting president, Duwa Lashi La, who has made multiple trips to visit front line troops.  Light Infantry Divisions  But an unappreciated sign of frustration is the rotation of commanders in the face of battlefield losses and failed offensives.  Myanmar’s military is divided into 14 different Regional Commands and six Bureaus of Special Operations.  Myanmar’s military is smaller than often reported, roughly 150,000 soldiers, with the air force and navy adding 50-60,000 more personnel. Yet only 70,000 are frontline troops.

Credit: Mekong News  The majority of kinetic operations are conducted by 10 Light Infantry Divisions (LIDs), which should be about 20,000 men in total, divided into roughly 100 battalions.  The Light Infantry Battalions are the shock and awe troops. They are the best armed and equipped, the most mobile, and by far the most lethal. They are operating at a decreased levels. According to Ye Myo Hein, the majority of these are under 150 men each, well below the already lowered 200-man floor.  They are the troops that the regime has relied on to achieve its strategic goals, including the 2017-2018 ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya. Today the 99th LID’s such as the “Ogre Column” in Sagaing do the bulk of the scorched earth operations against civilians.  The majority of forces are territorial, and deployed in static and defensive positions, where they are increasingly surrounded and harassed by PDFs and EROs. Their resupply of food, munitions, and fuel is increasingly perilous and sporadic.  Estimates of the current strength of LIDs, given a conservative casualty rate of 15 percent, is around 16-17,000 men. Recruitment has slowed and the operational tempo for the troops is unsustainable.  All of this compounds poor battlefield performance and the frustration of the leadership.  Even fewer restraints in targeting  One of the most important indicators of the regime’s frustration is rotation of operational commanders.  Between February 2021 and July 2022, only two of the 14 regional military commanders were rotated. In August 2022, five were replaced. Since then, four more others were rotated out, including Major General Myat Thet Oo, the Southeastern Commander in March 2023. Two other lieutenant generals, Khin Hlaing and Thant Hlaing who oversaw operations in Karen and Sagaing States were sacked in February-March 2022.  Since October 2022, three commanders of the six Bureaus of Special Operations, all lieutenant generals, have likewise been rotated out.  At the operational level, there have been fewer rotations in the past six months than expected. The 11th LID commander was promoted to be the commander of the Southeast Regional Military Command. But the heads of the 44th and 77th were transferred to non-operational billets. The commander of the 88th LID had a horizontal transfer to the 77th.  Part of this is the annual reshuffle, though the tempo has increased in the past six months.  Almost all of these officers moved on to non-operational positions including at the Myanmar Economic Corporation or the Defense Services Technological Academy. The junta is careful to make sure all get soft landings.

Credit: Screengrab from Arakan Princess Media video  Issues around the rotation of operational level leaders are compounded by battlefield losses, which are not insignificant. Between January 2023 and mid-May, 20 mid-level officers were killed, including four colonels, six lieutenant colonels, and 10 majors, based on open source reporting.  While a sign of frustration, the rotation of commanders is bad news for Myanmar’s people. The replacements will be even more sycophantic and slavish to the State Administrative Council leadership. Zealotry and a desire to prove themselves will lead to even fewer restraints in targeting.  While the NUG has outperformed militarily, it’s incumbent that the regime’s colonels and one-star generals–the people who actually have to execute the war and who are not getting their cut of the windfall of plundered wealth that the leaders of the SAC are taking for themselves–realize that the war cannot be won.  The rotation of commanders should be a further reminder, not just a sign of the leadership’s exasperation.

The United States’ defense of that right includes issuing the International Religious Freedom report each year to assist those who protect this fundamental freedom.  On May 15, Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued the 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom and credited those who work to advance religious freedom, often at great personal risk.  “This report wouldn’t be possible without the contributions of our civil society partners around the globe who help to shine a spotlight on abuses and advocate for victims of religious persecution,” Blinken said. “We are grateful for their vital work.”  Today I joined @IRF_Ambassador Hussain to launch the International Religious Freedom Report: a key part of our efforts to advance freedom of religion or belief, a core American value and a fundamental freedom enshrined in international law. pic.twitter.com/xEJPLQJfGu — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) May 15, 2023  Defending freedom  He commended the Campaign for Uyghurs, the Uyghur Human Rights Project and other advocacy groups that document the genocide and crimes against humanity committed by the People’s Republic of China against Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.  In Burma, thousands of teachers of Muslim, Buddhist, Christian and other faiths continue to teach the value of human rights, despite the military regime’s ongoing repression of minorities, including the Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group.  Blinken hailed the bravery of Martha Patricia Molina Montenegro, a lawyer exiled from Nicaragua, where the Ortega-Murillo regime has attacked the Catholic Church and its supporters. In 2022, Molina Montenegro exposed more than 160 attacks against the Catholic Church and its supporters, including desecrations and unjust arrests.  The annual report comprehensively reviews the status of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories. It tracks violations and abuses of religious freedom as well as positive governmental or societal actions. The report also informs critical U.S. foreign policy decisions.  Expanding protections  The 2022 report highlights countries that took steps to protect religious freedom in 2022, including:  Brazil passing legislation that protects Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian faith communities from religious and racial intolerance.  Belgium formally recognizing and expanding freedoms for its Buddhist minority.  The Central African Republic special criminal court prosecution of cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians since the coup in 2003.  “The United States will continue to stand with and support these brave advocates for religious freedom,” Blinken said. “We’ll keep advocating for religious freedom in countries where the rights are under attack, both publicly and directly in our engagement with government officials.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2hhcmUuYW1lcmljYS5nb3YvdXMtc3RhbmRzLXdpdGgtZGVmZW5kZXJzLXJlbGlnaW91cy1mcmVlZG9tL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2017-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Nashville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:34:35","Cost: $15+ ,  From the venue:  Singer-songwriter Mike Ryan has achieved impressive accolades in just under 10 years, building a career independently thatâ€™s not only earned the devotion of fans, but the respect of other artists and notables in  the music industry. Mike Ryan is just that caliber of talent. His gift as a songwriter has led to collaborations with such major label acts as Brad Paisley and Brandy Clark, and he has opened for some of the biggest names in the business, including Miranda Lambert, Hardy and Morgan Wallen, in addition to selling out his own headlining gigs. At times, even selling more tickets than major label acts with top ten singles. Itâ€™s a coup heâ€™s managed to pull off thanks to hard work and undeniable talent. Ryan co-wrote Paisleyâ€™s Top 20 â€œLast Time For Everything,â€ and his songs have garnered over 265 million streams with 10 of them earning over ten million streams, 19 of them earning more than four million streams and 27 of them earning more than one million streams.    Now after five years, Ryan has returned with Longcut, a 13-track collection that spotlights his growth as an artist and songwriter, and the broader emotional palette he paints from now as a father with two young sons with more life experience under his belt. The songs run the gamut from the playful drinking song â€œOff My Thinkerâ€ to the soulful anthem â€œAll My Songsâ€ and the albumâ€™s intriguing closer â€œForgiveness and Rain,â€ a portrait of a farmer and son wrestling with the guilt of raising questionable crops.    â€œI felt all along every project that Iâ€™ve put out has been better than the last one,â€ Ryan says. Weâ€™ve been working for years on some of these songs and that was one thing that was unique to this record. We had these songs for a while and lived with them. After a while, I felt like I wanted to change things and Iâ€™ve never really had the ability to do that with albums in the past. Itâ€™s taken me a little bit longer and itâ€™s definitely a different album in some ways than it would have been if I would have put it out a couple of years ago, but I think itâ€™s only become better.â€    Thereâ€™s an edge to this album and a more expansive feel because Covid led to a more relaxed timeline. There was no need to rush. Ryan, his co-writers and producers Bart Butler and Ryan Gore took their time and as a result the up-tempo tracks kick harder and the poignant ballads pack more emotional punch. Thereâ€™s an intensity and maturity in this collection that signal a new chapter for Ryan. His musical integrity is firmly intact, yet thereâ€™s a much more mainstream, radio-ready feel to these songs.    â€œThereâ€™s definitely been some sonic growth. Weâ€™ve used a different producer this time than I have in the years past,â€ Ryan says of Butler, known for his work with Randall King and Jon Pardi among others. â€œBrent  Anderson has produced a lot of my stuff and several of these songs were written with Brent. He ended up producing â€˜Forgiveness and Rainâ€™ as well so heâ€™s still there, but it was my first time working with a producer outside of Brent. Bart brought in some new players and different elements that I just thought were really crucial in making this album sound as good as it does and Iâ€™m excited about that. Working with Bart was really cool, and heâ€™s become a good friend of mine.â€    Though Ryan co-wrote songs on the album, he was also open to contributions from outside writers and some of the most distinguished names in Music City share their top shelf songs on his new project. Hillary  Lindsey, Gordy Sampson and Colin Elmore penned â€œLoser.â€ â€œWay it Goesâ€ was written by Phil Vassar, Brett Sherokey and Andrew Peeples. Adam Hood and Pat McGlaughlin crafted â€œGonna Take a Woman.â€ Brandon Kinney and Josh Thompson wrote â€œWonâ€™t Slow Downâ€ and â€œOff my Thinker,â€ with award winner Ben Hayslip joining them on the latter cut.    Ryanâ€™s own songwriting skills are what initially gained him notice in Nashville and landed him a publishing deal early in his career. Always a respected songwriter, his creativity and work ethic has attracted  some A-list collaborators, including Brent Anderson, Smith Ahnquist, Chris DuBois and Brandy Clark. The latter joined Ryan and Anderson to pen â€œJacket On,â€ an uptempo look at a disgruntled lover who says hell would freeze over before she ever came home yet her man ends up sharing, â€œI guess the devilâ€™s got his jacket on.â€ CMA Award winner Jenee Fleenor adds her signature fiddle skills to the infectious song.    Always looking to improve his skills, Ryan also worked with a vocal coach who changed his approach. â€œBetween the last album and this one I have changed the way I sing a little bit,â€ he shares. â€œI started taking vocal lessons and learning a little bit different technique because in some of the live shows I was noticing I was running out of gas towards the end of the set. When playing three or four nights in a row, I was really struggling the last night, and it turns out I was not quite taking care of myself the way I need to be. So, I learned a few warmup and cool down techniques and then just some basic stuff about why voices work the way they do and what can cause them to not work as good. I sing just a little bit different because of those lessons and itâ€™s helped me do a lot better on multi-show runs.â€    That newfound vocal strength and increased confidence are on full display on Ryanâ€™s new record, particularly on such incendiary tracks as the current single â€œDie Runnin.â€™â€ Ryan is looking forward to flexing his  new vocal skills as when he opens for Wallen at Globe Life Stadium in Arlington, Texas. â€œWeâ€™ve gotten to do a bunch of arenas and amphitheaters and stuff, but this is the first stadium and for it to be at Globe Life, thatâ€™s just going to be nuts,â€ the proud Texan says of entertaining the rabid fans in his home state. â€œWeâ€™re based in the DFW area and Iâ€™ve played pretty much everywhere you can play in and around that stadium, but this will be the first time performing inside of it and for a crowd like that, I canâ€™t even imagine. Itâ€™s going to be so wild.â€    Such a gig is a dream come true for a talented kid who grew up absorbing a variety of music including The Eagles, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder and Elton John in addition to such country legends as George Strait, Clint Black, Tim McGraw and Garth Brooks. â€œThe first song I ever learned how to play was a Bob Seger song,â€ he recalls, â€œbut I grew up in the 90â€™s and so I was listening to 90â€™s music every single day and that is still my favorite era of country music.â€    Ryan was also inspired by his grandfather, who directed the Texas National Guard Band for three decades. â€œThe first instruments that I played were in his living room,â€ Ryan recalls. â€œBeing a band director, he  had a basic knowledge of just about every instrument under the sun and he had most of those at his disposal at the house. So, heâ€™d pull one out and had me play it for a while, and then if I liked it, Iâ€™d keep playing. If I didnâ€™t, heâ€™d pull out another one and so weâ€™d just go down the line. He made a living out of showing people how cool and how much fun you can have playing music and how it just really changes peopleâ€™s lives in a lot of different ways.â€    By the time Ryan was in college, he was making his own music and building an audience on the competitive Texas music scene. â€œI put a band together and every step of the way was just encouraged by what I  saw and what happened,â€ says Ryan, who became a regular at Billy Bobâ€™s Texas, the worldâ€™s largest honky tonk and mecca for every hungry artist looking to make a name. â€œThere were definitely some times where I was living pretty lean and wasnâ€™t sure if I was going to be able to make my bills but it was all part of the process.â€    These days, those years of hard work are paying off as he has since scored nine No. 1 songs on the Texas music charts, and his previously-released album Blink Youâ€™ll Miss It landed at No. 15 on the Billboard  Heatseekers Albums chart and in the top 40 on Billboardâ€™s Independent Albums chart. His music has been embraced nationwide and he packs venues from the West Coast to the Southeast and several places in  between. Heâ€™s got a new album heâ€™s proud of and a stacked itinerary.    â€œWeâ€™re certainly enjoying our time and playing a lot of really fun shows. Itâ€™s just great to be out there and continue working for as long as we have,â€ says Ryan, who is booked by WME. â€œThe live shows are my favorite part of the business, and we never really slow down. Weâ€™re always playing, which is great.â€","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vY3JlYXRpdmVsb2FmaW5nLmNvbS9ldmVudC01Mjc4MTgtbWlrZS1yeWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-09-25","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T02:00:59","Giants southpaw Thomas Szapucki is undergoing surgery to correct thoracic outlet syndrome today, the team informed reporters (including Maria Guardado of MLB.com). The club didn’t provide a recovery timetable, though it seems likely the left-hander will miss the majority or all of the 2023 season.  Szapucki has been on the 60-day injured list since Opening Day. He left a Spring Training outing with arm discomfort that apparently is related to the nerve condition. Thoracic outlet syndrome has become relatively common for pitchers in recent years. It’s a condition that typically requires the removal of part of a rib to reduce nerve pressure on the arm.  The track record for pitchers returning from thoracic outlet syndrome is mixed at best. Diamondbacks righty Merrill Kelly bounced back from the procedure in 2020 to turn in two-plus productive seasons. The likes of Matt Harvey, Tyson Ross and (to this point) Stephen Strasburg haven’t been so fortunate. Harvey and Ross never recaptured anything approaching their pre-TOS form, while Strasburg has only been able to pitch once since undergoing the surgery nearly two years ago due to various setbacks.  Obviously, the Giants and Szapucki are hopeful he’ll be able to recapture his pre-surgery stuff and avoid those kinds of long-term complications. One of four players acquired from the Mets last summer for Darin Ruf (a trade that looks like a coup for San Francisco given the production they’ve gotten out of corner infielder J.D. Davis), Szapucki pitched 10 times in relief down the stretch. He allowed only three runs in 13 1/3 innings, striking out 16 against four walks. Szapucki’s previous major league experience consisted of five innings in which he was tagged for 15 runs in Queens.  The 26-year-old Szapucki had been considered one of the more interesting pitching prospects in the Mets’ system since entering the professional ranks as a fifth round pick in 2015. He’s been a starter for the bulk of his minor league time, including opening 16 of 18 appearances for the Mets’ top affiliate in Syracuse last year. Szapucki will collect major league service and be paid around the MLB minimum rate while he’s on the injured list. He’s controllable through the 2028 season.  San Francisco also provided updates on a pair of players who landed on the injured list this morning. Righty Ross Stripling and catcher Joey Bart each went for imaging. Bart was diagnosed with a Grade 1 strain (the lowest severity) of his left groin. Stripling, whose official diagnosis was a lower back strain, has no structural damage and will be reevaluated next week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYnRyYWRlcnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2dpYW50cy10aG9tYXMtc3phcHVja2ktdW5kZXJnb2luZy10aG9yYWNpYy1vdXRsZXQtc3VyZ2VyeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-19T18:10:51","It wasn’t dodgy polling that convinced Turkey’s opposition they stood a chance at overturning Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s two-decade rule, or not dodgy polling alone. In the twelve years since Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu became leader of the CHP, the UK has cycled through three main opposition leaders and five prime ministers. Turkish voters have been here before – so many times before – and are attuned to subtle changes in the air. This time the changes weren’t even subtle.  There were plenty of good reasons for the opposition to be confident of putting an end to their 21-year losing streak. The economy’s slow-motion crisis has lately achieved an excruciating clip, thanks to eccentric policies indelibly associated with the president – so who better to spearhead a return to orthodoxy than Kılıçdaroğlu, a challenger who, though 74 years old, closely resembles a young Friedrich Hayek? Against a backdrop of inflation hovering around 50 per cent, it would have been crazy not to believe.  It could and should have made a difference that so many opposition parties united around a single challenger. In the terrified atmosphere after 2016’s failed coup, Erdoğan succeeded so completely in equating opposition to him personally with opposition to the state that the ‘no’ camp only feebly contested the 2017 referendum on shifting to a presidential system. Their flags in that campaign didn’t feature anyone actually known to the electorate, instead using the benign face of a schoolgirl available for download from Shutterstock for $49. This time the opposition showed their faces, offering as an antidote to one-man rule the beaming triumvirate of Kılıçdaroğlu alongside the popular mayors of Ankara and Istanbul.  Incorporating parties to the right and left of the ruling AKP as well as high-profile defectors from within its ranks, the opposition coalition had something for everyone who wanted change. Too many Turks did not. Sunday’s election was both a parliamentary vote, which has concluded in favour of the AKP-led bloc, and a presidential election which goes to a runoff next week after no candidate gained an outright majority. But it was Erdoğan who came closest to clearing that hurdle, with 49.5 per cent to Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.9. It would have created a constitutional conundrum for voters to install Erdoğan’s opponent as president while the AKP held a majority in parliament, as many polls predicted. Now that conflict seems unlikely to arise.  Commentators so recently confident of an upset now point to factors that were there all along. The government has dismantled the independent media. In times of crisis people turn to a strong man, overlooking his complicity in their fates. All the things that were admired about Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign might, in retrospect, have been weakness: too mild, too clean, too Alevi. Within the opposition alliance there is renewed debate over whether he was the wrong candidate. These are not the sorts of conversation that presage a last-minute comeback. Ahead of the first round of voting, at the Istanbul ferry hub of Üsküdar, all the parties had pitched extravagantly sized tents blaring campaign songs while their volunteers dispersed leaflets to commuters. Two days after the vote the place had returned to its factory settings: a single tent and the face of one man.  At next Sunday’s run-off Kılıçdaroğlu somehow has to target the 5 per cent of voters who came out for the ultranationalist third candidate (Sinan Oğan) without jeopardising his informal alliance with the predominantly Kurdish party of the left. In the first round, Kılıçdaroğlu won his highest shares of the vote not in his own party’s secular heartlands but in the Kurdish provinces. His first major post-election broadcast underlined his difficult position. He chose to emphasise border security, voicing a coded promise to expel millions of Syrian refugees. Before the election the opposition’s informal symbol had been a heart formed by two joined hands.  Observers like to say that Turkey’s elections are ‘free and not fair’. In recent times, the first part of the assertion has come under some strain. There were allegations of irregularities (there often are). And there was some evidence of it (there often is). Two days after the election it turned out that some numbers had been entered into the wrong parties’ columns as the votes were aggregated. One of Kılıçdaroğlu’s deputies said that the party had raised objections at thousands of ballot boxes nationwide and will chase every last vote but he admitted that even if the appeals stand it won’t change the result. It seems unlikely that these allegations will play so prominent a role in the second round: no one needs to fiddle the numbers when morale on one side is this low.  At least participation was high, the armchair modernisation theorists on Twitter agreed: turnout of 89 per cent is truly among the world’s highest. But another way to look at this is that in a nation where power has become so centralised, the stakes around elections are far too high. When the party in power is the one that gets to conduct purges of a nominally independent civil service, ignore the rulings of regulatory bodies and appoint the judiciary that will imprison their enemies on flimsy pretexts, elections may be important for all the wrong reasons. They shouldn’t have to matter this much.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxyYi5jby51ay9ibG9nLzIwMjMvbWF5L3Rvby1pbXBvcnRhbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police collected information from the 20 victims who were enticed with false promises of employment in Myanmar. But they were forced to work for online scam.  In another case, six Filipinos claimed they were trafficked to Myanmar and forced to work as cryptocurrency scammers. Later they filed criminal complaints against their recruiters.  The United States Institute of Peace reported last year that over a dozen criminal zones in Myanmar are involved in “industrial-scale” human trafficking and the operation of complex online scams. Some traffickers enticed victims through social media ads promising lucrative office jobs, tricking them into illegally crossing the border to a “scam zone” in Myanmar.  Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have emerged as ""countries of destination"" for victims, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). International alarm is growing over internet scams in the region that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus crypto investments.  In the past year, Indonesia has rescued more than a thousand of its nationals working in online scams in Myanmar and Cambodia.  Philippine authorities recently rescued over a thousand people from several Asian nations who were trafficked into the country and also forced to run online scams.  Victims tended to be ""middle-class graduates who have limited employment opportunities"" at home, said Itayi Viriri, IOM regional spokesman for Asia Pacific.  The scam centres were involved in online gambling, cryptocurrency, online money lending and romance applications, Viriri said.  After the Myanmar military coup in 2021, Myanmar has emerged as a preferred location for criminal groups to operate their trafficking and scams. Corrupt border guards are bribed to turn a blind-eye to the human trafficking.  One problematic area is Shwe Kokko Yati New City Project in Karen State that was billed from 2017 to 2020 by as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, the National League for Democracy government could suspendes the project. As a consequence, Thailand cut supplying power and telecommunications services to Shwe Kokoo, causing the project to roll to a standstill before 2021. However, just two weeks after the Myanmar military coup in February 2021, the project immediately resumed with restoration of Thai electricity and internet.  Both China and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have voiced concern over their nationals caught up in the illegal trade.  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gan visited Myanmar on 2 May and met with Myanmar Military Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing during the former’s trip to attend the SCO Foreign Minister’s meeting in India. During his visit in Naypyidaw, Qin Gang urged Myanmar to take effective measures to crack down on cross-border telecoms fraud targeting Chinese nationals, and he also called for a joint law enforcement to tackle the scams.  Various nationals are caught up in the scams. In November last year, at least 12 Filipinos were promised jobs in Thailand, but they were finally trafficked into a Chinese crime ring based in Shwe Kokko to work as crypto scammers.  During the ASEAN Summit this month in Jakarta, member nations vowed to take tougher action on human trafficking as criminals increasingly use social media and other online platforms to recruit and exploit victims.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1penppbWEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbXlhbm1hci1iZWNvbWVzLW5vdG9yaW91cy1odW1hbi10cmFmZmlja2luZy1hbmQtc2NhbS1odWLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He was 89.  In a swift reaction, President Buhari condoled with his family and affirmed that Chief Balogun, “through foresight, wisdom, and hard work, lived ahead of his time, by starting FCMB.  The high-ranking Ijebu chief’s death has not been officially announced, but sources said his family had informed the Awujale of Ijebuland of his death and a formal announcement would be made soon in line with tradition.    The late banker was born on 9 March 1934 in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State to Muslim parents. He attended Igbobi College, Lagos and thereafter worked briefly as a teacher before leaving for London. He studied Law at the London School of Economics.  Following his graduation in June 1959, he was called to the English Bar in December of the same year. After earning his law degree, Balogun returned to Nigeria to join the Ministry of Justice of the defunct Western Region, and later as an assistant parliamentary counsel in the Federal Ministry of Justice in Lagos.  However, the January 1966 coup prompted a shift in his career trajectory towards the banking sector. He later joined the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank after the coup.  Doyen of Banking  Balogun was a pioneer in the Nigerian capital and money markets. The deceased entered into the financial sector, reshaped and became a household name in the industry until his death.  He first later founded City Securities, a stock broking and issuing house, which handled Mobil, Texaco and Total petroleum marketing companies’ equity offerings. Balogun later secured a merchant banking licence to establish First City Merchant Bank.  When the operations of the bank took effect in 1983, Balogun established an entrepreneurial culture at the new bank in contrast to the government owned banks at the time.  The late FCMB founder was a long-time member of the council of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.  His philanthropy  Otunba Balogun was a constructive philanthropist and a distinguished church leader who devoted a substantial part of his private resources toward the care and service of the less privileged.  He built a National Pediatric Centre in Ijebu-Ode and donated the centre to University of Ibadan’s College Teaching Hospital.  During one of Balogun’s birthdays, the FCMB in a statement celebrated his philanthropic gestures thus: “His story is that of a man who understood early in life that the true essence of wealth is achieved only when it is deployed to the service of humanity, especially the less privileged. A man of proven immense wealth who is highly regarded, respected and honoured in society, the honour bestowed on Otunba Balogun does not, however, stem from the immensity of his wealth, but from the good use to which he has put this wealth for the service of humanity.”  His Strong Character  Otunba Balogun was a strong character with unwavering inner convictions that earned him resounding successes in many spheres of life.  “I have a very strong character. There is nothing that I did that I wish I had not done. I have no regret over any of my past actions,” the late billionaire said in one of his interviews.  Otunba Balogun devoted his life post-active banking years to serving God, society and doing things that add significant value to humanity.  The deceased converted to Christianity during his secondary school days in Igbobi college. Until his demise, Balogun, a direct descendant of Oba Tunwase of Ijebu-Ode, was the Otunba Tunwase of Ijebuland. He was also the Olori Omoba of Ijebuland, the Asiwaju of Ijebu Christians, the Baba Oba of Ijebu-Ife and the Asalu-Oba of Ijebu Mushin.  Reflecting on His Life  Reflecting on his life in 2019 on his 85th birthday, Balogun said, “I am at peace with my God. I marvel on every occasion at why He has been so kind to me. I don’t have any airs about me; I am always myself. I can only credit this to the amazing grace of God.  “At the climax of anything I may have achieved, I attribute everything to the awesomeness of God and His love for little me. I spend all my time talking about God. A friend recently called me and said he noticed that before I say three words, I would mention God. It is a measure of my appreciation to attribute everything that has happened to me to the amazing grace of the almighty God.  “I am just humbled by the awesomeness of the almighty God to think of a puny human being like me. I see my contemporaries, people who had achieved even before I was born, and those I consider my mentors, and on every given occasion, I am amazed as to why God has been so kind to me. I will spend the rest of my life thanking Him. There are many of my peers who have one problem or the other, but I am still hale and hearty. I still swim regularly.”    He received several awards in his lifetime. He was a recipient of the American Biographical Institute Inc’s Distinguished Leadership Award for outstanding contributions to the development of Investment Banking.  He was also a recipient of the University of Ibadan’s Degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) in recognition of his outstanding achievements both in the field of Law and his contributions to the socio-economic development of Nigeria; a Merit Award for philanthropic services to Ogun State in particular and the country as a whole, and also the Ijebu Development Association award and Council Membership of a number of multi-national Chambers of Commerce.  The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria made him a Fellow of the Institute for his pioneering and outstanding contribution to the Banking Industry.  Buhari Mourns Subomi Balogun  President Buhari has condoled “with family members, friends, and associates of the revered businessman, whose legacy of kindness and charity stretched into many homes, institutions, and communities, touching lives through education, health, and multiple empowerment opportunities.”  President Buhari affirmed that Chief Balogun, through foresight, wisdom, and hard work, lived ahead of his time, “by starting the FCMB, which has grown over the years, with branches across the country, and working assiduously for the take-off and success of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.”  The President noted the outpouring of testimonies on the life and times of the legendary banker, especially his towering influence in grooming many talented leaders in the sector, who had since set up their investment platforms, within and outside the country.  President Buhari prayed that the Almighty God will receive the soul of the departed, and comfort all his loved ones.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyaXNlLnR2L290dW5iYS1zdWJvbWktYmFsb2d1bi1mb3VuZGVyLW9mLWZjbWItZGllcy1hdC04OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Saudi Press Agency/Handout... Read more                DUBAI, May 19 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attended a summit of the Arab League in Saudi Arabia on Friday to canvas support for his people, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed his readiness to mediate in the war between Moscow and Kyiv.  Also at the Jeddah gathering, Arab leaders warmly welcomed back into their fold Syria's President Bashar al-Assad - who has received heavy support from Russia in his country's civil war - following a decade of isolation.  ""We reaffirm the kingdom's readiness to continue mediating efforts between Russia and Ukraine, and to support all international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis politically in a way that contributes to achieving security,"" the Saudi Crown Prince said in his opening speech.  Prince Mohammed has mediated in the conflict before.  Zelenskiy, who was also due to attend a summit of the G7 leaders in the Japanese city of Hiroshima this weekend, thanked Saudi Arabia for its past help and said delegates would each receive the text of his 10-point peace plan. He asked them to work with Ukraine directly without intermediaries.  Gulf states have tried to remain neutral in the Ukraine conflict despite Western pressure on Gulf oil producers to help isolate Russia, a fellow OPEC+ member.  'SAVING PEOPLE'  In his address to the summit, Zelenskiy said some countries including members of the Arab League preferred to ""turn a blind eye"" to Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian land and to its jailing of some Ukrainians during the 15-month war.  ""I am sure we can all be united in saving people from the cages of Russian prisons,"" he said, speaking in English.  Last year, in a diplomatic coup, Crown Prince Mohammed secured the release of 10 foreigners captured by Russia in Ukraine. The move was apparently made possible by his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plays a significant role and we are ready to take our cooperation to a new level,"" Zelenskiy said wrote on Twitter shortly after arriving in Jeddah.  Saudi Arabia faced heavy criticism from the United States over an OPEC+ decision to cut oil production, seen as helping Russia to refill its coffers by boosting prices.  Even though the October decision initially drew the ire of the United States and other Western countries, market dynamics since then have shown the cuts to be prudent.  At a time when Russia's war on the Ukraine has roiled global energy markets, the role the kingdom plays as the world's largest oil exporter has grown in importance to both Washington and Moscow.

The Mariners host Adelaide United on Saturday in the second leg of their semi-final, bringing a 2-1 lead after overhauling 'The Reds' in front of a noisy crowd at Hindmarsh Stadium.  An hour north of Sydney, the sleepy coastal town of Gosford will be rocking as Nick Montgomery's men look to complete the job at Central Coast Stadium and book a first final since Graham Arnold guided them to their one and only title in 2013.  Renowned for its thrifty management and lacking the big city amenities enjoyed by rivals, Central Coast have never been seen as a destination club in the Australian top flight.  Yet Englishman Montgomery, the former Sheffield United stalwart, has managed to turn a squad of raw, rejected and recycled players into a seriously competitive unit.  Scottish-born striker Jason Cummings, too much of a loose cannon for his former club Dundee, has been laser sharp for the Mariners. His winner in the first leg against Adelaide was the 27-year-old's 17th goal of the campaign.  At the other end of the pitch, 38-year-old goalkeeper Danny Vukovic is savouring his second stint at the club after struggling for game time in the Netherlands.  Informing Montgomery is his own experience as a former Mariners captain and midfield general in a career spanning more than 100 appearances.  His stint from 2012-17 was spiked by the great disappointment of missing the 2013 championship decider for earning two yellow cards in the semi-finals.  It was to prove a major miss as the Mariners soon went into a tailspin when Arnold, now Australia's national coach, left the club.  Languishing at the bottom of the league, the Mariners pulled off a major publicity coup by luring 100 metres world record holder Bolt for a short-lived trial in 2018.  Bolt was unable to reach an agreement on a contract to remain at the club, however, with the Jamaican's camp looking for a deal worth around A$3 million ($2.03 million) according to media reports.  The Mariners have not resorted to any such gimmicks since and after years of underachievement managed to break back into the finals in 2020/21 under former coach Alen Stajcic, with Montgomery his assistant and head of the club's youth academy.  Montgomery took over as head coach after Stajcic quit in 2021 and has kept the ball rolling.  Though dreaming of one day heading to the English Premier League as a coach, Montgomery has unfinished business at the Mariners, 10 years after missing the 2013 'Grand Final'.

Unveiled at the 2023 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este on the shore of Lake Como in Italy, the 2-seat concept aims to show how a modern-day coupe variant of the third-generation Z4 may have appeared had it been granted production approval by the German automaker.  Drawing on design ideas first explored on the Z3 Coupé launched in 1998 and followed up by the sleeker Z4 Coupe introduced in 2006, the Touring Coupé (pictured, below) retains the familiar styling of the latest Z4 roadster at the front but adopts a 2-door shooting brake (station wagon) silhouette at the rear to extend the impact of its appearance and provide it with added everyday practicality.  BMW  Destined to remain a one-off, the new concept was developed by a team at BMW’s Munich-based design studio.  “The BMW Concept Touring Coupé celebrates the original sheer driving pleasure,” says Domagoj Dukec, head of BMW design. “A highly emotional vehicle like this shows that the passion for everything that goes into driving pleasure has been essential through the ages and will be for the future.”  Among the Touring Coupé's key exterior elements is a brushed-aluminum-look kidney grille with vertical louvers (pictured, below) in place of the black plastic honeycomb mesh insert of the production Z4 roadster.  BMW  Farther back are a new windshield surround and a hardtop roof with a deep central channel. It runs back to blend seamlessly with new rear three-quarter panels, forming a wide pillar and substantial rear haunches.  Along the sides, there's a distinctively shaped glasshouse. It receives a rising waistline that tapers inward quite appreciably toward the rear, additional rear side windows and a prominent brushed-aluminum surround.  The rear is distinguished by a shallow liftback-style tailgate with a large spoiler element that visually extends the roof.  Inside (pictured, below), BMW has provided the Touring Coupé with a more luxurious cabin than the standard Z4 roadster. Highlights include tan leather seats with baseball mitt-style stitching. The same leather is used within the lower section of the dashboard, the center console and the luggage compartment at the rear.  BMW  BMW’s design team worked with the Schedoni leather workshop based in Modena, Italy, to create a custom-made luggage set (pictured, below) consisting of two larger and one small weekend bag, as well as a garment bag for the Touring Coupé.  BMW says it chose the Touring Coupé name for its new concept as a nod to the 328 Touring Coupé that won the Mille Miglia in 1940. It also says the shooting brake design recalls the 2002 Touring – the first modern-day BMW to receive the Touring name as a means of differentiating it from the 2002 sedan.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmRzYXV0by5jb20vdmVoaWNsZXMvYm13LXVudmVpbHMtb25lLWtpbmQtY29uY2VwdC10b3VyaW5nLWNvdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Earlier on April 16, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday expressed grief over the death of Albert Augustine, an Indian national, who worked at a Dal Group Company in Sudan''s Khartoum. Taking to Twitter, Jaishankar said, ""Deeply grieved to learn about the death of an Indian national in Khartoum. The Embassy is making all efforts to extend fullest assistance to the family. The situation in Khartoum remains one of great concern. We will continue to monitor developments."" Sharing details about the deceased Indian national, Indian Embassy in Sudan tweeted then, ""It has been reported that Mr Albert Augestine, an Indian National working in a Dal Group Company in Sudan who got hit by a stray bullet yesterday succumbed to his injuries. The embassy is in touch with family and medical authorities to make further arrangements."" Heavy gunfire and blasts were reported following days of tension between the armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) also claimed at least 56 lives and left around 595 people, including combatants, injured, reported Al Jazeera. The two sides have been competing for power as political factions negotiate on forming a transitional government after a 2021 military coup. The tensions stem from a disagreement between the military, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, about how the paramilitary force should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee that process, according to Al Jazeera. The military, 18 months after its coup, had promised to cede control to a civilian-led government this month. Yet, the process has been dominated by a rivalry between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan, also known as Hemeti. The two generals have been openly criticizing one another in speeches over the past few months, and they have dispatched reinforcements and armoured vehicles to oppose military camps spread around the city. Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Sudan urged Indians, planning a trip to Sudan, to postpone their plans. The Indian embassy has issued an appeal to countrymen to suspend their ongoing plans to travel to Sudan. In a tweet, the Indian embassy on Saturday wrote, ""Indian planning to travel to Sudan should postpone their travel. Please also stay calm and wait for updates."" The embassy''s warning came in light of clashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces.

"coup","2022-11-01","Not Discerned","{""Corona"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T08:46:14","Veteran media executive Yoko Higuchi-Zitzmann took over as CEO of Telepool in January, barely a year after Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s Westbrook took full control, in December 2021, of the German rights giant.  The appointment was a bit of a coup. The Japan-born, Germany-educated Higuchi-Zitzmann has more than a quarter century of experience in some of Europe’s biggest media companies. She was an acquisitions exec for Constantin Film — scoring Olivier Dahan’s Oscar winner La Vie En Rose for the German market among other deals — and producer at renowned German groups Ziegler Cinema — where she delivered sleeper hit My Blind Date With Life, a romantic comedy that earned more than $5 million at the German box office for distributor StudioCanal — and Studio Hamburg, where her hits included Herzogpark, a Desperate Housewives-style series for leading German network RTL. She joined Telepool from Matthias Schweighöfer’s production outfit Pantaleon Films (Army of Thieves), where she was managing director.  Telepool has been a mainstay of the German and European industry for decades — the Munich-based production, sales and distribution group celebrated its 60th anniversary last month — and Higuchi-Zitzmann inherits a well-oiled machine. The company’s international film sales and TV distribution arm, Global Screen, headed by Julia Weber, has international success with everything from animated and children’s titles — The Amazing Maurice, School of Magical Animals — and action thrillers (Don’t. Get. Out! from Dogs of Berlin director Christian Alvart). In Germany, Telepool’s licensing and theatrical distribution operations, led by Julia Müntefering and Matthias Remmele respectively, oversee a massive German rights library whose recent additions include Will Smith’s Westbrook-produced feature King Richard and Millennium Media’s upcoming Hellboy reboot The Crooked Man. Telepool also runs a home entertainment division under its EuroVision label, led by Daniela Pander and Kevin McDonald, and a Swiss TV licensing business run by Philippe van Doornick.  But it’s in production where Higuchi-Zitzmann wants to make her mark. “We plan to move into production, we’re in the unique position as a German company that is a fully-owned subsidiary of a strong American production company,” she says, “that gives us amazing synergies to do international productions.”  Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of her first Cannes market as Telepool boss, Higuchi-Zitzmann outlined her company’s strategy for the future, explained her combination of German and Japanese executive techniques, and  How did you get into this business, did your family have a media background?  No, I come from a family where everyone is a lawyer, a manager, or a doctor. That’s why I first studied law, because in our family you either study medicine or law, that’s it. But I always knew, even as a child, that I wanted to be in film. I was always my passion. As a kid first with Steven Spielberg movies, and then, in my teenage years, I went through an extreme art house phase, I only watch French films. Later, when did acquisitions for Constantin Film, I started to lean into a more commercial, audience-oriented cinema. Now my tastes are totally mixed. I like anything that’s entertaining, anything that excites me emotionally.  So first, the question I’m asking everyone in Cannes this year: What impact do you think the Hollywood writers strike will have on the business at the market?  I don’t see any immediate effect. We are looking at some great projects at the market, which of course were already finished scripts or finished projects, done before the strike. I think you’re not going to see the impact until later in the cycle, probably at AFM. But the impact will be felt then. Like everyone, we want the strike to end as soon as possible. Creatives are at the heart of our business, they always come first for us.  What’s your general take on the Cannes market this year?  We all got through the COVID crisis together, in the last two years, we’ve seen a lot of good projects coming through. I’ve got the feeling that the market is starting to heat up again. Of course, we also look to get the really top titles in every market but for Germany, because it is so competitive, that means buying at the pre-sale level. We are even getting in at the development stage, with our deal with Millennium [announced last November] that will see us get involved financially very early on, at the script development stage, where not all the elements are in place so that we get the rights to big, American star-studded projects as early as possible. Our first co-development project will be The Crooked Man, part of the Hellboy franchise, directed by Brian Taylor, who did Crank, and featuring Deadpool 2 actor Jack Kesy. We’ll be announcing other projects soon.  What’s the strategy behind the Millennium deal for Telepool?  The strategy is that we take all the German-language rights, with the intention of bringing these films into theaters ourselves — we have a booking and billing deal with Paramount — or our partners, and then licensing them across all German-speaking countries. We have long-standing contacts with the German free TV broadcasters, but also with the streamers, and we also have our own home entertainment house through EuroVideo, which not only releases on DVD and BluRay but also licenses digitally across all platforms.  How important is a theatrical release for overall performance these days?  The main source of revenue comes from ancillaries: free TV, pay TV, and streaming. It used to be that ancillary revenue was very, very closely linked to cinema success. 20 years ago, when I started in the industry, cinema ruled supreme. This was before Netflix. Things have obviously changed but cinema is important. We have the Has Fallen franchise and the fact that those films screened in cinemas raises viewers’ perception of them. People noticed it, and it makes them more likely, even if they didn’t catch the film in theaters, to watch it later on a streaming platform.  The Has Fallen franchise, which kicked off with Olympus Has Fallen in 2013, has been a major money maker for Telepool  But box office ambitions have adjusted. It’s no longer the case that we’re hoping for 1 million admissions for every commercial film we release, which used to be the benchmark for a hit in Germany. Now, especially after corona, we have more modest expectations. We’re happy when a film gets 300,000 or 500,000 admissions. But a theatrical release is still helpful, because it boosts the overall value of a film, and raises it about the level of being “just” a home entertainment title. But home entertainment is better than its reputation. A lot of people think it’s dead and gone, but we still do very good business in home entertainment. Of course, the DVD business is declining more and more, but digital sell-through is strong. On one of our titles — Serial Bad Weddings 3, part of a very successful French comedy franchise — we did more than 250,000 downloads in the first two weeks, which are very good numbers for us.  The one area where Telepool is not traditionally very strong has been production. Given your background, I expect you want to change that.  We want to use it to go into production more. We’ve begun our first co-production, which will be shooting in the fall in Germany: Don’t. Get. Out! 2, the sequel to the first film, from Christian Alvert, which young German filmmaker Tini Tüllmann will direct. We had the first film just as a sales title and it was a huge success, we licensed it all over the world. So for the sequel, we’re getting involved as a co-producer with Alvert’s Syrreal Entertainment, so we can be much more involved creatively, as well as financially. Co-productions are the first step for us. We are in a unique position, being a German company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a strong American production company, namely Westbrook. We are looking to cooperate with them. So if I option a German bestseller that could have an international setting, and would make sense to shoot in English, I can set it up with Westbrook right away. Longer-term, we want to be developers and lead producers on our own projects. We’ll be setting up an in-house production department here next year.  How closely do you work with Westbrook?  I speak with my production colleagues in Los Angeles every week, with the head of productions, with all the departments: Cinema, series, fictional formats, digital formats, etc. Together, we are trying to find projects where we can use the synergies of the company. Do they have something that would make sense to set up as an international production? Do I have a great project, from my network of authors and showrunners in Germany and Europe, which would work as a project for Westbrook?  What sort of projects are you looking to do?  Commercial projects, ideally with a strong German creative lead, which can be well positioned internationally in terms of sales. We’re not limiting ourselves, we could also do a commercial art house film that would open in cinemas and sell to public broadcasters. We’re looking at series as well. I see great international potential in sophisticated, high-gloss crime series. English productions are a focus but I think a film like All Quiet on the Western Front had taken German commercial arthouse to a new level, showing a German-language film can win four Oscars. I see potential in the German market, both in terms of film and series, if the productions can be made at a very high, international level. But at least 50 percent of our development projects will be in English. And everything we do has to fit into our core business of licensing and sales.  You were born in Japan but did most of your schooling in Germany. Do you feel your management style is more German or more Japanese,?  Well, my courtesy is very Japanese. I’m always very proper and polite. But I’ve learned German directness, which is not so typical in Japan. But in a business, it’s important to speak directly. As a producer or managing director, sometimes you have to say no to a project, which is not easy, but you have to be able to make those decisions. I really appreciate the very direct, straightforward approach, which is typically German. Even if I’m probably a bit more polite about it. But I think honesty is a great German quality. I have two children, my son is 14 and my daughter is 7 and they are pretty much German, they go to German school, etc. We only visit Japan on holiday. But when it comes to food, it’s all Japan. They could live on just Ramen noodles and sushi. Their cultural roots are in Germany but their stomachs are fully Japanese.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9jYW5uZXMtMjAyMy1jcmVhdGl2ZS1zcGFjZS10ZWxlcG9vbC1jZW8teW9rby1oaWd1Y2hpLXppdHptYW5uLTEyMzU0OTQ5MTEv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2Nhbm5lcy0yMDIzLWNyZWF0aXZlLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVwb29sLWNlby15b2tvLWhpZ3VjaGkteml0em1hbm4tMTIzNTQ5NDkxMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lasso faces charges for embezzlement of funds by a congress with an opposition majority. A two-thirds of the votes is required to oust the conservative President. This would be the first time in 44 years an Ecuadorian president would be overthrown by the legislative.  The counts revolve around the irregular granting of contracts related to oil transportation. Tension rose on Wednesday when Lasso used a constitutional mechanism known as crossed death to dissolve the congress. He argued they were trying to destabilize the country and avoid collaboration between the two branches of government.  The impeachment appears to have hit a road block, as the crossed death seem as a self-coup to avoid trial. Now, the National Electoral Council has 7 days to call for new legislative and presidential elections. The main beneficiaries of this seem to be the left Citizen’s Revolution party, who are likely to have a favorable outcome in the following elections.  In the short term expect the government, backed by security forces, to crack down on any protests by left and indigenous groups demanding that the president does not avoid his trial. In the medium-term, expect public policy to focus on security, economic, and labor issues to gain ground in the run-up to the election.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbmJyaWVmLmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzL2ltcGVhY2htZW50LXRyaWFsLW9mLWVjdWFkb3JpYW4tcHJlc2lkZW50LWRlbGF5ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Likewise, Bayern Munich are said to not be keen on the German international’s services, should they be available in the coming summer window.  “Several talks have taken place with City so far without an agreement. Barca are very interested, agent and uncle Ilhan have already had talks,” the German reporter wrote.  “The Spanish outfit is said to be prepared to offer a contract until 2026. Nothing signed there either. Gündogan is not an issue for FC Bayern.  “BILD knows: With Kimmich, Gortezka and the talent Gravenberch, one sees oneself as sufficiently occupied. At 32, Gündogan is no longer considered a player with whom you want to continue the upheaval. In addition, Bayern is looking for a mentality player, as Gündogan is not considered.  “Dortmund also does not want to bid for Gündogan because it is too expensive.”  The 32-year-old midfielder, who assisted the equalising goal in the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final clash with Real Madrid, could leave on a free at the end of the season if his contract is allowed to run its course.  Barcelona’s interest in Gundogan is well-documented, as is the club’s insatiable appetite for free transfers amid their ongoing financial turmoil off the pitch.  If an agreement can’t be struck with the chiefs at the Etihad, one might reasonably presume the former Dortmund man would be keen on the prospect of extending his career at one of the most prestigious clubs in European football.  It would represent yet another coup for the Catalan giants too right off the back of their £42.5m acquisition of Bayern Munich hitman Robert Lewandowski.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdG9vX2V4cGVuc2l2ZV9ib3J1c3NpYV9kb3J0bXVuZF9jbGVhcl9hX3BhdGhfZm9yX2JhcmNlbG9uYV90b19zd29vcF9mb3JfcHJlbWllcl9sZWFndWVfbWlkZmllbGRlci9zMV8xNTk1M18zODgzMzM1NNIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1wL3Rvb19leHBlbnNpdmVfYm9ydXNzaWFfZG9ydG11bmRfY2xlYXJfYV9wYXRoX2Zvcl9iYXJjZWxvbmFfdG9fc3dvb3BfZm9yX3ByZW1pZXJfbGVhZ3VlX21pZGZpZWxkZXIvczFfMTU5NTNfMzg4MzMzNTQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Myanmar military arrested the four men and one woman – Kaung Pyae Sone Oo, Zeyar Phyo, Hsann Min Aung, Kyaw Win Soe, and Myat Phyo Pwint – in Yangon on September 3, 2021.  During the attack, which occurred amid a nationwide wave of armed resistance against the coup that took place nearly seven months earlier, six police officers had been fatally shot on a train traveling Yangon’s circle line.  The detainees were charged with murder and illegal weapons possession under several statutes, including the 1949 Arms Act and 2014 Counterterrorism Law.  Kaung Pyae Sone Oo was handed two death sentences under the Arms Act and terror charges, while Kyaw Win Soe, Hsann Min Aung, Kyaw Win Soe, and Myat Phyo Pwint received one death sentence and one life sentence each.  The verdicts were decided by Khin Ni Ni Aye, the district judge of Ahlone Township—where the attack occurred nearly two years ago—and the sentences were given at a closed-door hearing on Thursday morning at Yangon’s Insein Prison, according to a source familiar with the proceedings. Security at the prison was reinforced for the occasion, the source said.  The source emphasised that the death penalties were first given by the civilian judiciary rather than a military court since the coup. The sentences are alarming, the source added, particularly when other detainees are awaiting trial for the same charges.  “Only military tribunals used to hand down [death sentences]. But this one is the first from a judge in the civilian court system, which made people uneasy,” the source said.  Convicted prisoners can submit an appeal of their sentences to the military council within a week of the verdict, according to the same source.  A total of 117 post-coup prisoners are currently on death row, and the military regime has sentenced another 42 people to death in absentia, according to data maintained by the monitoring group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Earlier this month, the military regime commuted the death sentences of 38 prisoners to life imprisonment, and thousands of political prisoners detained for incitement charges received pardons.  However, the regime executed four democracy activists—Phyo Zeyar Thaw, Ko Jimmy, Hla Myo Aung, and Aung Thura Zaw—in July of last year. The executions, which were the first instance of a Myanmar regime carrying out capital punishment in the country in decades, prompted condemnations from around the world.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbXlhbm1hci1ub3cub3JnL2VuL25ld3MvbXlhbm1hci1yZWdpbWUtc2VudGVuY2VzLWZpdmUtdG8tZGVhdGgtZm9yLWFsbGVnZWQtcm9sZS1pbi0yMDIxLXRyYWluLWF0dGFjay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Broncos head coach Sean Payton said recently that Williams should return just in time for training camp.  While that is certainly music to Broncos Country's ears, Terrell Davis, the greatest running back in Broncos history, has enough experience of rehabbing knee surgeries to suggest with some authority that baby steps might be the most prudent approach for Williams.  “The knee injury is tricky because nobody wants to be on the field more than we do,” Davis told Phil Milani of the team website. “But you have to listen to your body, and a lot of times your knee, or whatever your injury is, is not responding based off whatever the time period is. 6 to 8 months? And you come back, and you're like, ‘Wait a minute, I know they said it was going to be 100% but it’s not ready.' You would much rather slow roll this thing than to try and get back sooner, and then all of a sudden, you have a setback and you’re not 100%.”  Should Williams suffer any kind of setback, or the medical staff opts to extend his recovery program, the current contingency plan would be power-back Samaje Perine, the runner the Broncos picked up in free agency from the Cincinnati Bengals. Davis knows Perine's game well, so he's fully aware of the physicality the 27-year-old can bring to the table when his number is called.  “Watched him for a very long time. I like his game,” Davis said. “You compliment that with the power in the backfield—that’s what Sean Payton—[is] now trying to find, that little jitter-bug guy is probably the next step.”  READ: Broncos Sign Prolific XFL Running Back  As Davis suggested, inserting a scat-back type option into the mix might be a nice way to round out what the Broncos have assembled to date. No one was added to the running back room during the draft, although a pair of college free agents and an XFL vet were signed. Williams' recovery timeline suggests fairly strongly that the Broncos felt comfortable rolling with what they already had in the room.  The rumor mill continues to connect the high-profile name of Minnesota Vikings superstar running back Dalvin Cook to the Broncos, but that would be a real front-office coup by GM George Paton that would require some serious juggling.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL25mbC9hcnRpY2xlcy90ZXJyZWxsX2RhdmlzX2NhdXRpb25zX2Jyb25jb3NfbmV3X3RpbWVsaW5lX2Zvcl9yYl9qYXZvbnRlX3dpbGxpYW1zL3MxXzE2NjYxXzM4ODMxNjcy0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL25mbC9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbXAvdGVycmVsbF9kYXZpc19jYXV0aW9uc19icm9uY29zX25ld190aW1lbGluZV9mb3JfcmJfamF2b250ZV93aWxsaWFtcy9zMV8xNjY2MV8zODgzMTY3Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I believe that for a novel, it’s always a connection to life, but not immediate life. Rather something I have experienced, seen, imagined, maybe dreamed. Then, I need some time to put it on paper. Cinema is different. It takes even more time. What we put in is life, contingencies, happiness, misfortunes. In my mind, I wait for the moment when material things become immaterial, that’s when creation begins. Today, I’m talking with you, I can’t immediately write because you’re in front of me. This conversation needs to enter my mind, to become somewhat immaterial, something that no longer exists.  All art is the moment when absence begins.  And the filming process?  When I write, I pull out the few remaining hairs I have. Whereas in cinema, it’s simple. Because around me, there is a whole team with whom I share my uncertainties, my anger, my joys, my happiness on the set. We become children again. We are the king, the child king. You’re there in your director’s chair, giving orders, shouting, hitting, and so on. It’s like a kind of Lego. The ego. In cinema, our ego triumphs over everything to some extent.  Even in writing?  Yes, because even in writing, we imagine the actors, even if in the end, it won’t be them. We have images in our heads, the cinematographer, the sound, the music, all of that when we write. We’re not alone. But of course, I isolate myself to write. And there, that ego takes a serious blow. I can’t share my doubts about a word with anyone. I try to construct a sentence for a day, sometimes two.  Do you have a writing routine?  I write all the time. I think that even when I’m here talking, there’s a part of me that’s writing… When I asked Jean-Claude Carrière, my master, my friend, and spiritual father, how he managed to work on so many projects, he would always reply: “I have invisible workers.” He passed on these invisible workers to me as an inheritance.  Do you compartmentalize your brain?  Yes, that’s it, they’re partitions. For example, right now, I’m working on three projects: an animated film, a more realistic film, and a screenplay that I’m writing for someone else. So each project has its room in my house in a small village where I live. When I enter the room, I settle in, and the brain also opens and closes its own. In the morning, I work on one project, in the afternoon on another. When I change places, everything I had thought before about the other project seems to no longer exist. Then, I go for a walk, prepare my dinner, and go to another room until midnight to work on the third project. It’s really strange, though.  Is there an Afghan cinema?  We can’t talk about Afghan cinema because we haven’t had time to create a cinematic identity. For the filming of my film Earth and Ashes in 2003,We can’t talk about Afghan cinema because we haven’t had time to create a cinematic identity. For the filming of my film “Earth and Ashes” in 2003, for example, it went well because the country had just emerged from the terror of the Taliban for the first time. There was a kind of energy, a return to life. Then, for The Patience Stone (2013), I didn’t have that chance. I filmed in Casablanca, but for the outdoor scenes, I wanted to shoot in Afghanistan because you can’t find the mountains of Kabul anywhere else. I went with a very small team, and I told everyone that I was making a documentary. Even so, I was threatened. For my next film, I shot it in Rwanda, in search of that thing that haunts me, which touches upon the disaster of war, the mechanism of hatred. Love has its literature, but there are very few books about hatred, about its birth. At what moment does it seize us?  I lost my elder brother in the war while I was in France. I couldn’t mourn, and this mourning haunts me. But now, I would like to eventually move on from that and tell another story.  What story would you like to tell?  The absurdity of human beings, what is funnier. Whether it’s in love, even in war, in social events, and so on. It’s a subject that deeply affects me.  You must get along well with Ruben Östlund then!  Yes, of course. In fact, I told him on the first day, “I resent you.” He asked, “Why?” Because I had been writing a film with a friend for two years that touched on the same themes as “Force Majeure.” We’ll have to start over!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlc3RpdmFsLWNhbm5lcy5jb20vZW4vMjAyMy9lbmNvdW50ZXItd2l0aC1hdGlxLXJhaGltaS1tZW1iZXItb2YtdGhlLWZlYXR1cmUtZmlsbXMtanVyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2014-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T04:41:38","AFP  After shocking Thailand's military-backed elite with a historic election breakthrough, the Move Forward Party now wants to take on the nation's biggest political taboo -- laws on insulting the monarchy.  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy's status, with some protesters calling for the king's power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday's election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  - Tough laws -  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges -- at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  ""We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,"" he said.  ""We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.""  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate -- monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut's junta -- are threatening to block Pita's bid for the job.  ""I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said.  ""I will not accept Pita as a PM because he... has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can't accept.""  - Cycle of unrest -  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  ""I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,"" Napon told AFP.  ""This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.""  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  ""This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics -- the status quo has been demolished,"" Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.

"coup","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T07:18:17","By Henrique Caine  Now let me add my two cents to all this Congau-Country asstray, and yes, I say 'asstray' because this divisive pattern in Liberia today has become consistent in every election of late.  Since I was born well before the 1980 coup, like many, I have a full understanding and recollection of the Liberia of yesteryear. I can say with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY, that the LIB of yesteryear is not the LIB of today and will never be again, nor should it necessarily be so. Not after all this country has gone through.  The perpetrators of that continuing Country-Congau divide go full throttle in galvanizing young people to push their rhetoric, when they have run out of ideas. After a revolutionary coup, 14 years of intermittent civil wars, over 250,000 lives lost, massive internal and external displacement of a citizenry, and a complete breakdown of a society, it took major efforts by an international community of nations to help commence rebuilding. So what the hell, just for kicks, here are a few reasons I say it's all a bunch of complete good for nothing asstray:  1) When we gather as friends and neighbors to talk about the happenings of daily life in LIB, or bitch about how hard the country is, we talk about it with no division of Country-Congau;  2) When we go to our local restaurants, beaches, entertainment centers to eat and jolly-jolly, we dance and sing to the same afrobeat, hipco, hiplife or LIB music, and nobody is there tripping on Country-Congau;  3) When we enter the various Ministries and Agencies of Government and complain about the level of dysfunction in the service delivery in, say, getting a passport, marriage or driver's license, business registration, or birth certificate, we are so united in our disappointments and nothing about Country-Congau;  4) When students line up at the various universities struggling to get their billing and clearances to move to the next level and line up at banks hoping to make their payments, no student even thinks about divisive Country-Congau;  5) As we watched the recent recruitment of soldiers into the AFL a few months ago, and men and women lined up the streets around the Barracks for miles trying to enter the military, and take fitness and aptitude tests, not a concern about Country-Congau, just people trying to help each other get in.  6) When we line up outside the gates of the US Embassy waiting for appointments for visa or in the case of some of us dual nationals, consular services, no one says a damn thing about Country-Congau, because we all know that asstray doesn't matter one lick to Uncle Sam and those foreign folks behind the counters;  7) When we register our kids in the various schools (including the elite prep schools for those who can afford it, including parents from all tribes and counties), parents just want to educate their kids, and not one of them goes to the PTA meetings about Country-Congau;  8) When community residents hold meetings to discuss LEC and how to fight for a transformer or get meters for their communities, or get together and visit LEC management for an intervention to get them a transformer, not a soul thinks Country-Congau;  9) When various labor groups and union organizations, including the recent protest by Government workers for increased pay and fair wages go on strike, I don't hear a single soul mention Country-Congau;  10) When Liberians gather at SKD or ATS stadiums for Lonestar games or County Meet Tournaments, I see people claiming tribal and county ties to all counties and cheering their county REGARDLESS of LAST NAMES! Again, no divisive country-congau talk;  11) When youngsters go from store to store, office to office, NGO to NGO, or Ministry to Ministry desperately looking for work with Diplomas and CVs in hand, they do so hoping that experience, education and merit rules the day, and again, not thinking Country-Congau;  12) When tragedy hits a community, as was the case of the fire that destroyed my neighbor's house just a few months ago, we all woke up at 3am to help put out that raging fire, as is often the case in many communities hit with tragedy, and no one is doing it as a Country or Congau;  13) When you're like me and probably hang out and party hard with beauty queens from just about every County, you better damn well believe, ain't NOBODY thinking Country-Congau! That's for sure!!!!  I can go on and on but let me stop here. These failed politicians, failed online prognosticators, and failed manipulative agitators, including many from the past will always gravitate to that old worn out Congau-Country narrative when they have NOTHING else to offer up the Liberian people. The Country will continue to move forward with or without them. We know them all too well and will reject them every time in this new dispensation.

So, is America a top-level destination for families and other tourists, or a nation too dangerous for all but the most hardened, risk-tolerant travelers? What do other countries say, officially? For decades, the U.S. has ""enjoyed the supremacy and monopoly of issuing travel warnings"" for citizens considering visits to ""countries marred by violence or terrorism,"" the Tourism Academy travel industry school observed in a June 2022 essay. ""The balance of power has however shifted, with foreign nations warning their citizens to avoid traveling to the United States,"" starting after a pair of back-to-back deadly mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, in 2019. Skip advert Even then, the number of countries raising their warning levels was small: Venezuela and Uruguay urged their citizens to avoid travel to the U.S., while the Japanese Consulate in Detroit, 200 miles north of Dayton, noted that the U.S. is a ""gun society"" and advised Japanese citizens they ""should be aware of the potential for gunfire incidents everywhere in the United States."" Amnesty International called on ""people worldwide to exercise caution and have an emergency contingency plan when traveling throughout the USA"" due to ""ongoing high levels of gun violence in the country."" Other countries, like New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, and Germany, have cautioned their citizens about America's gun violence without advising them to stay away. Most of the big drivers of U.S. tourism counsel would-be visitors that ""the U.S. is more violent than what you're used to,"" they should ""learn to take precautions that you might not have to take at home,"" and ""violent crime rarely involves tourists,"" CNN Travel reported in January. Concern about U.S. gun violence and tourism isn't exactly new, as this 2015 New Yorker cartoon illustrates. BREAKING NEWS: USA hoping to increase tourism with gifts at border entries. #travel #tourism #vacation pic.twitter.com/N4VD1YwFjh — Shannon McMullan✨ (@manitoulinmagic) June 6, 2022 But before 2019, foreign tourists to the U.S. were mostly warned about things like ""expensive emergency health care, overly sensitive attitudes toward nude sunbathing, and gross tap water,"" Mental Floss reported in 2016, with examples. But mass killings started to rise in the U.S. in 2019, and they have kept going up amid a subsequent jump in gun sales and mental and financial stress from the Covid-19 pandemic, James Alan Fox, a gun violence expert at Northeastern University, told USA Today. Mass shootings ""are the kinds of events that make headlines, scare people, and make them look around when they go into a supermarket or retail store,"" he added. The U.S. typically experiences about six public mass shootings a year, but it reached that number in May with the outlet mall shooting in Allen, Texas. Is America getting a free pass from wealthy allies? Yes, ""even in our thoroughly globalized world, there is an inherent unfairness in how we determine what countries are 'safe' to visit in the wake of a tragedy,"" and the U.S. especially gets a ""seemingly infinite benefit of the doubt,"" Rosie Spinks wrote at Skift in 2019. Tourism lives and dies on perception, and America gets to ""indulge in a kind of identity-forging belief that it is 'the greatest country in the world' — even when, say, it's the only country in the world that suffers mass shootings to this degree."" Skip advert  In fact, unlike the State Department's Level 2 advisory for parts of Europe or its guidance ""for Turkey — which, at Level 3, advises travelers to 'reconsider travel' and stay away from regions near the Syrian and Iraqi border — there is no rhyme or reason to where the threat of a mass shooting in the U.S. lies,"" Spinks pointed out. You could get shot anywhere, at any time, ""and sure, while the statistical likelihood of a traveler being caught up in a mass shooting in America is low, is it any lower than that of a terrorism attack in Turkey or Western Europe?"" Has gun violence affected tourism? Anecdotally, yes. And there is some data that suggests tourism drops off for months in places where there were high-profile mass shootings, like Las Vegas after the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in 2017 and Orlando after 2016's Pulse nightclub killings. Nationally, foreign tourism numbers dipped across the U.S. a bit in 2019, then plummeted in 2020 and 2021, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. International visitor arrivals jumped 128% between 2021 and 2022, to 50.9 million visitors from 22.3 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Administration, but foreign arrival numbers were still 36% lower than in 2019. Even after pandemic-related testing requirements to enter the U.S. lifted, ""travelers are likely to pause before rushing back to a country where hate crimes and mass shootings are becoming far too commonplace,"" Lebawit Lily Girma wrote at Skift in June 2022. Travelers do research their destinations while planning a trip, Eastern Kentucky University hospitality and tourism professor Daegeun Kim told USA Today, and the more frequently they see news about gun violence at ""a destination where they want to go, it is more likely that it's going to affect their decision-making process."" Skip advert Canada was the top source of U.S. tourism in 2022, followed closely by Mexico, with Britain a distant third. But ""there's no getting around it — gun violence and racial and political division are growing deterrents for Canadians and other international travelers to visit one of the world's great destinations,"" Bruce Parkinson wrote at Canadian Travel News in May 2022. ""We love exploring the United States,"" but ""for many Canadians, real freedom is about living in a civil, tolerant society where gun violence is a minuscule threat. The same goes for when we travel."" And it's not just Canada, Parkinson added. ""The fact is that most of the world sees America's unfettered gun laws as bizarre and disturbing. And a growing number are literally afraid of traveling to places where the guy sitting beside them at the bar may have a gun on his hip — and is fully within his rights to do so."" Should tourists shun the U.S.? ""In Europe there is a deep sense that U.S. rampant gun violence is a totally domestic issue, tragic of course, both a stain to the country's image and a total mystery, but that it won't affect the visitor's everyday life,"" Vincent Bontoux, a consultant based in France who recently visited New York City with his 87-year-old mother, told Skift.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vdHJhdmVsLzEwMjM1MTUvaGFzLWd1bi12aW9sZW5jZS1tYWRlLWFtZXJpY2EtdG9vLWRhbmdlcm91cy1mb3ItdG91cmlzdHPSAV9odHRwczovL3RoZXdlZWsuY29tL3RyYXZlbC8xMDIzNTE1L2hhcy1ndW4tdmlvbGVuY2UtbWFkZS1hbWVyaWNhLXRvby1kYW5nZXJvdXMtZm9yLXRvdXJpc3RzP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2018-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Manila"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-19T07:01:21","The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that took place last week in Luan Bajo, Indonesia, came up with the usual self-congratulations and wish list for future action but failed to produce forward movement on the two issues that pose fundamental challenges to the regional organization’s raison d’etre: the Myanmar junta’s bloody reign and rising geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea.  Myanmar Settlement Eludes ASEAN  Ever since the February 2021 coup, ASEAN has grappled with how to deal with a regime with no domestic support, no legitimacy, and that relies only on brutal repression to stay in power. With Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia taking the lead, ASEAN forged a Five-Point Consensus that the junta pledged, grudgingly, to respect: an immediate end to violence; dialogue among all parties; the appointment of a special envoy; humanitarian assistance by ASEAN; and the special envoy’s visit to Myanmar to meet with all parties in the domestic conflict.  The junta, however, walked back its commitment a few days after it was trumpeted by ASEAN, and has since escalated its violent attacks on the population, refused to allow the special envoy to visit imprisoned chief of state Aung Sang Suu Kyi, and made it difficult for ASEAN humanitarian assistance to reach people. Indeed, a few days before the summit, an attack on an ASEAN humanitarian mission occurred in an area controlled by the military government.  To be sure, ASEAN’s push for a role in promoting a peaceful solution in Myanmar is a positive departure from its traditional policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of member countries. At the same time, however, it shows the limits of consensual decisions with no enforcement powers. In this regard, ASEAN is far behind the African Union, which has organized multinational peacekeeping teams to intervene in civil conflicts.  With ASEAN flailing at the sidelines, the violence in Myanmar has escalated. The junta has been responsible for at least 2,940 deaths and 17,572 arrests since the coup. The military operates with absolute impunity, employing what the United Nations Human Rights Office report describes as a “four cuts strategy,” including “indiscriminate airstrikes and artillery shelling, razing villages to displace civilian populations, and denial of humanitarian access — to cut off non-State organized armed groups and other anti-military armed elements from access to food, finances, intelligence and recruits.”  To some observers, the ferocity of the military’s campaign shows that resistance is widespread and gaining momentum, with the underground National Unity Government (NUG) successfully pursuing its political project of welding the Burmese majority and the ethnic minorities into a more unified political and military force. Many reports confirm that the military is losing control of vast areas of the country while the NUG, according to a recent comprehensive study by International IDEA, “now controls significant territory, commands the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of its people, and provides security and justice in the areas under its control.” What this seems to indicate is that the democratic forces in Myanmar, instead of relying principally on ASEAN and other foreign countries as the main agents for democratic restoration, now see their ability to fight back politically and militarily as the decisive factor that will gather international support.  The South China Sea Cockpit  At the Indonesia summit, ASEAN once more proved to be a bystander in developments in the South China Sea, the other crisis that is testing the organization’s fundamental purpose of acting collectively.  Over the last 30 years, China’s moves in the area have alarmed ASEAN states, particularly those that border that body of water. China has seized maritime formations from the Philippines and Vietnam and unilaterally declared that an estimated 90 percent of it belongs to China, ignoring the Exclusive Economic Zones that the other littoral states are accorded by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. While individual countries like the Philippines and Vietnam have registered strong protests, ASEAN has failed to come up with a common declaration condemning China’s claims and a unified strategy to counter its moves, owing to Beijing’s strong influence on some countries, particularly Cambodia and Laos.  China’s moves in the South China Sea are mainly driven by an effort to expand its defense perimeter outward in order to protect its eastern and southeastern coasts from attack from U.S. bases entrenched in the so-called “First Island Chain” that stretches from South Korea to Japan, Okinawa, Guam, and the Philippines. But instead of negotiating an agreement with ASEAN aimed at demilitarizing or reducing tensions in the area — an initiative that would benefit both China and ASEAN — Beijing has acted unilaterally, poisoning relations with key ASEAN countries.  Taking advantage of the rifts between ASEAN and Beijing, the United States has moved aggressively to implement its global military strategy of containing China in the region. In the last few months, Washington has successfully pressured the new administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr, to grant it four more bases in the Philippines, in addition to the five it now has under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Manila.  Washington has also brought the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into the equation, with ships from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany now impressed into patrolling the area, along with vessels from Australia, South Korea, the Philippines, and the massive U.S. Seventh Fleet. Invoking “freedom of navigation,” U.S. ships have sailed through the Taiwan Strait in recent months to back up President Biden’s repeated declarations that Washington will defend Taiwan militarily — a posture that in effect tears up the One China Policy that has been the official U.S. stance since 1979.  But Washington’s rhetoric now elicits worries among some ASEAN governments that they are being drawn into a regional confrontation that is not in their interest. Particularly alarming has been a recent leaked memo by Gen. Mike Minihan, who heads the U.S. Air Mobility Command, that asserts, “My gut tells me will fight in 2025.” Minihan, it bears noting, is not alone in predicting imminent war with China. Last October, Adm. Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, warned that Washington should prepare to fight in 2022 or 2023.  Even without such statements, the level of hostile activity in the South China Sea has been alarming. During a visit to Vietnam I made as a congressman back in 2014, top Vietnamese officials expressed concern at how, owing to the lack of rules of engagement, a collision by American and Chinese ships or their aircraft “playing chicken” could immediately escalate to a more intense level of conflict.  Like the Philippines, Vietnam has criticized Beijing’s moves, and its vessels have engaged Chinese Coast Guard ships in water-hosing jousts in the South China Sea. Unlike Manila’s acquiescence to Washington, however, the aggressive posture of the Biden administration has led Hanoi to affirm a neutral stance. On a recent visit to Beijing, the head of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Truong, assured Chinese President Xi Jinping that his government would continue to hew to its “Four Noes” policy approach in the region; that is, that Vietnam would not join military alliances, not side with one country against another, not give other countries permission to set up military bases or use its territory to carry out military activities against other countries, and not use or threaten to use force in its international relations.  Much like its failure to come up with a common position and agenda for action on China’s controversial territorial claims and actions in the South China Sea, ASEAN has watched from the sidelines as Washington has made major moves that threaten two historic aspirational documents of ASEAN: the declaration of Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN) and the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ).  Some observers have asserted that its failure to address the Myanmar crisis and the South China Sea powder keg poses an existential crisis for ASEAN. This is an exaggeration. ASEAN’s role as a talk shop is important for its 10 member states. But will it ever become a unified force capable of confronting external forces that are constantly intervening to shape the region to their advantage? More and more, that future, which served as ASEAN’s guiding vision at its launch in 1967, is receding from view.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcmVzcG9uc2libGVzdGF0ZWNyYWZ0Lm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L215YW5tYXItYW5kLXNvdXRoLWNoaW5hLXNlYS1jcmlzZXMtdGVzdC1hc2VhbnMtbWV0dGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

RSF via Twitter/via REUTERS  Summary Air attacks, ground fighting in Khartoum, Bahri  Humanitarian crisis worsens with 843,000 people displaced  Mass looting plagues trapped Khartoum residents  Fighting hits South Darfur capital Nyala, 27 dead                KHARTOUM, May 19 (Reuters) - Sudan's capital Khartoum and sister city Bahri came under renewed air attack on Friday as the war between the army and paramilitary forces entered its fifth week, deepening a humanitarian crisis for trapped and displaced civilians.  Mass looting by armed men and civilians alike is making life an even greater misery for Khartoum residents pinned down by fierce fighting between the regular military and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), witnesses said.  The conflict has displaced an estimated 843,000 people within Sudan and put around 250,000 to flight into neighbouring countries, the United Nations refugee agency said on Friday.  Army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan took the long-anticipated step on Friday of removing RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, from his post as his deputy on the ruling Sovereign Council.  The two had run the council since 2019 when they overthrew strongman President Omar al-Bashir amid mass protests against his rule, before staging a coup in 2021 as a deadline neared to hand power to civilians for a transition towards free elections.  There has been no breakthrough in Saudi- and U.S.-sponsored ceasefire talks in the Saudi city of Jeddah.  At an Arab League meeting there on Friday, a statement by Sudan's envoy accused the RSF of looting and rape, and of violating a succession of ceasefires.  ""We trust that you will stand by the Sudanese army and will accompany us in the next step of reconstruction,"" envoy Dafallah al-Haj added.  The RSF has accused the army of starting the conflict and violating ceasefires. It says that those who have committed crimes are wearing stolen RSF uniforms.  Fighting broke out on April 15 after disputes over plans for the RSF to be integrated into the army and over the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal to shift Sudan towards democracy after decades of conflict-ridden autocracy.  Burhan installed Malik Agar, leader of a rebel group who joined the council in 2020 after signing a peace agreement with the government, as his new deputy, according to a second decree.  Later that day, Burhan promoted other military officers who served on the council, including appointing General Shams El-Din Kabbashi as deputy commander of the armed forces. Generals Yasser Al-Atta and Ibrahim Jabir were each appointed assistants to the commander.  'BODIES EVERYWHERE'  Air strikes on Friday targeted districts in eastern Khartoum and witnesses reported hearing anti-aircraft weapons used by the RSF. Bahri and Sharg el-Nil across the Nile river from Khartoum were subjected to air strikes overnight and Friday morning.  ""On the road I saw about 30 military trucks destroyed by (air) strikes. There were bodies everywhere, some of them army and some RSF. Some had started decomposing. It was really horrible,"" said Ahmed, a young man making his way through Bahri.  The RSF is embedded in residential districts of much of Khartoum and adjoining Bahri and Omdurman, drawing almost continual air strikes by the regular armed forces.  Witnesses said the army had also started placing barriers on some roads in southern Khartoum to keep the RSF away from an important military base there.  Fighting also flared in the city of Nyala, capital of the South Darfur region in the southwest, for a second day after weeks of relative calm.  Heavy gunfire and artillery detonations went on all day in Nyala. A local market caught fire and it was difficult for those injured to get to hospitals, local activists said. The Darfur Bar Association, a human rights group, said that 27 people had been killed and dozens injured so far.  They called on the RSF, whose movements it blamed for the flare-up, to re-commit to a locally brokered truce.  Militia attacks and subsequent clashes in the West Darfur city of Geneina have claimed the lives of hundreds.  With the fighting has come a collapse in law and order, with rampant looting, blamed by the army and RSF on each other, hitting Sudanese homes, factories, gold markets, banks, vehicles and churches. A rapid dwindling of stocks of food, cash and other essentials has driven much of the pillaging.  ""Nobody protects us. No police. No state. The criminals are attacking our houses and taking everything we own,"" said Sarah Abdelazim, 35, a government employee in Khartoum.  Some 705 people have been killed and at least 5,287 injured, according to the World Health Organization.

"coup","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","{""Brasilia"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Brazil""}","2023-05-20T06:11:39","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro speaks to the press outside his house after Federal Police agents carried out a search and seizure warrant in Brasilia, Brazil, Wednesday, May 3, 2023. When asked about the search of Bolsonaro’s home in Brasilia, the Federal Police press office gave a statement saying officers were carrying out searches and arrests related to the introduction of fraudulent data related to the COVID-19 vaccine into the nation’s health system. (Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo Peres.)  SÃO PAULO – A bill intended to raise big tech’s responsibility to avoid the dissemination of disinformation has sparked a heated debate in Brazil – and divided Catholics as well, in the country with the largest Catholic population in the world.  Introduced in 2020, the so-called “Fake News bill” is endorsed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s allies in Congress, and has been fiercely repudiated by supporters of the conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro.  The bill requires that large digital platforms must “prevent and mitigate illegal practices in the sphere of its services.”  Current legislation does not consider technology companies such as social media platforms liable for spreading disinformation published by users. The new project establishes that internet companies which fail to restrain the dissemination of criminal content will be fined and sued for their actions.  The opposition, especially members of congress connected to Bolsonaro, claim that the bill would impose censorship in Brazil. They argue that Lula’s Workers’ Party, a left-wing organization, wants to increase its control over society and implement a dictatorship in the South American nation.  For Lula’s supporters, passing the bill in Congress is an important measure. During Bolsonaro’s tenure, social media were flooded with misleading content on several themes – from the alleged risks of COVID-19 vaccines, to the supposed voting machines’ lack of reliability.  Such postings have been keeping Bolsonaro’s constituency mobilized and active on internet forums.  Many consider that the thousands of pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators who invaded government buildings in Brasilia on January 8 and tried to stage a coup were, to a great extent, moved by such internet-based disinformation.  Earlier this month, a set of Catholic movements released a public letter to show their support for the “Fake News” bill. The letter was signed by Signis Brazil (the Catholic Association for Communication), the Bishops’ Conference’s Communications Pastoral Ministry (known as PASCOM in Portuguese), the Brazilian Commission of Justice and Peace, and other Catholic groups.  The document recalled that other countries have passed legislation to publicly regulate on-line platforms, something “that is fundamental for the full exercise of democracy and the struggle against crime, hate speech, and disinformation.”  The Brazilian bill is inspired by the European Digital Services Act, approved at the end of 2022.  “Securing transparency in the processes and mechanisms to hold accountable [the spreaders of] malicious content is not censorship, like the bill’s opponents have been saying,” the letter read, adding that an independent entity must be created in order to monitor the “fulfilment of the rules, initiate administrative proceedings, and impose sanctions.”  The document also emphasized that “the bill does not put religious freedom in danger.” A number of congressmen have been declaring on social media that it is part of the government’s plan to censor religious publications on the internet.  “That is a greatly necessary proposal. The internet does not have a regulating entity, and has become a lawless space. People do what they want, and nobody is held accountable,” Alessandro Gomes, who heads Signis Brazil, told Crux.  The discussion of the bill has once again revived the political polarization seen in Brazil during the presidential campaign last year, which ended up with Bolsonaro being narrowly defeated by Lula. Many of the former president’s backers see the proposal as revenge against him and a way of criminalizing their activism.  “He really acted as a liar on many occasions, like when he published fake news that said that ivermectin and chloroquine were effective against COVID-19. But that is not about him, there are common people spreading lies on social media every day,” Gomes said.  Fake news also brought division to the Church, affirmed Marcus Tullius, PASCOM’s general coordinator.  “In the religious world, disinformation is especially harmful. Rifts are contrary to the logic of the Gospel. But they have been affecting all segments of the Church,” he told Crux.  Fake news and hate speech have been continuously disseminated by the clergy and lay people, Tullius claimed.  “If a pastoral leader or a minister sends fake news to a community member, the person – who trusts him for religious reasons – will not verify it before sharing its content. That is dangerous,” he said.  While most Church groups have endorsed the bill, traditionalist Catholics have been publicizing their criticism over the past few weeks and hope the law will not be approved.  Initially expected to be voted at the beginning of May, the bill was taken out of the Chamber of Deputies’ schedule because its proponents realized they would not have enough votes to pass it.  In the opinion of Frederico Viotti, a spokesperson for the Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Institute – a traditionalist Catholic organization which originated in the Tradition, Family, and Property movement – the bill may result in the classification of Catholic moral teachings as “fake news.”  “In the name of struggling against disinformation, many opinions – especially conservative ones – have been labeled as ‘fake news’,” Viotti told Crux.  He argued that the notions of disinformation and hate speech are too broad in Brazil now and can even include the ideas of Catholic people who are against things that they consider to be sins, like homosexuality and abortion.  “Of course, nobody is in favor of disinformation. But a bill like that should not work as an instrument of censorship,” Viotti added.  The “Fake News” bill is currently being amended, and some of its measures – including a provision concerning payment by big tech companies for content protected by copyrights – may be included in separate proposals. In the next weeks, there might be another attempt of getting the bill approved.  “Those who defend fake news do not defend the Gospel of Christ. Spreading lies is something that is contrary to our mission on Earth,” Gomes said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vY2h1cmNoLWluLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhcy8yMDIzLzA1L2Zha2UtbmV3cy1iaWxsLXNwYXJrcy1kZWJhdGUtZGl2aWRlcy1icmF6aWxzLWNhdGhvbGljcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, in an effort to put an end to persistent speculation and rumours in media coverage since his death, a source close to the family told PS that the chef died of natural causes, effectively ruling out a drug overdose or suicide. A source also denied multiple reports claiming that Zonfrillo was secretly battling a cancer relapse and had been the subject of multiple welfare checks. For years Zonfrillo himself had been open about his previous heroin addiction and mental health battles, both topics canvassed in great detail in his much scrutinised 2021 biography Last Shot.  Zonfrillo’s death has been referred to the Victorian Court for Coronial Investigation. A spokesperson told PS that it remained an “active investigation”, and no further comment would be made. When a death is reported to the court, Victoria Police are asked to complete an initial report of the facts and circumstances. Following initial investigations, the coroner will determine if they request a brief of evidence. The length of time required to compile a coronial brief can vary depending on the complexity of the matter and the information sought by the investigating coroner. Similarly, the length of a coronial investigation is dependent on the facts and circumstances being reviewed by the coroner. Findings are published when an inquest is held, recommendations have been made or a coroner otherwise orders they be published. The court cannot confirm if inquests will be held for matters until dates are set and all parties have been notified.  Fashion star is born It would be easy to dismiss Afterpay Australian Fashion Week as a trivial sideshow, but there were some seriously wonderful moments this year. This includes the runway debut of emerging young Sydney designer Nathaniel Youkhana – one sadly missed by the recently installed globe-trotting US-based Vogue Australia editor-in-chief Christine Centenera, who made a blink-and-you’d-miss-her appearance at fashion week between catch-ups with Margot Robbie.

She later apologised for her emotional state explaining: “I’m just a very proud mother”. Rosa Youkhana – chicly dressed in a gown created by her son – was clearly moved by the reception, explaining he had invested thousands of hours of “blood, sweat and tears” into the collection, with just as much dedication as any aspiring cricketer, footy player or Olympian we often hear about.

Her mother made patterns drawn on old copies of the Herald which wrapped the beans in her father’s eastern suburbs fruit shop. “And now hopefully the rest of the world will get to see his wonderful creativity too.”  Eating at Edna’s Table As tributes have flowed for comedian Barry Humphries, former Sydney restaurateur Jennice Kersh, who with her brother Raymond ran one of the hottest eateries in town, called up PS to share her own anecdote. Humphries was a regular at Edna’s Table, amused by the fact it was not named after his alter ego but in honour of the Kershs’ late mother. During one visit in late 1985 – decades before Hannah Gadsby chronicled her vulnerabilities through comedy and took him to task over his off-stage transgender comments – Humphries was feeling particularly depressed. Lonely at the top: the late Barry Humphries photographed in 2016. “He phoned me up saying he was down in the dumps after his show had been panned by the critics. He told me how lonely life could be when times are bad because he felt he had no one to turn to. I invited him in for lunch, and we had a very long talk,” Kersh says.  Humphries then hatched an idea of hosting a lunch for all the great comedians of the day: a way to connect with his peers, and hopefully build a few bridges. Humphries would pay for the lunch to let his fellow comics know how appreciated they were. “Well, they all wanted to come. We had Noeline Brown, Grahame Bond, Willie Fennell, Norman Erskine, Doug Mulray, Jan Adele ... even though none of them really knew Barry, they were just so flattered he would invite them,” Kersh says, adding Humphries didn’t want any fanfare. “He really was just such a lovely man.” Tina Turner performs in London, 2009.

"coup","2023-07-17","22:00:00","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-19T20:18:08","The war in and over the Ukraine has entered a new, heightened phase in the past few weeks as the two warring sides step up their efforts to break each other’s will.  The new phase – consisting primarily of tit-for-tat, high-tech attacks – carries with it the risk of conflict spreading beyond the battlefields of eastern and southern Ukraine, as well as political upheaval in the Kremlin.  The latter applies more to Vladimir Putin than his lieutenants in the Russian military hierarchy.  “Patriot” Games for Zelensky  On Tuesday night, the Russian military carried out a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.  The attack followed weeks of systematic Russian bombardment of the country’s frontline units, reserves, ammunition and fuel depots.  The strikes come as Putin’s forces resume attacks in western Ukraine, particularly along the Lviv-Ternopil-Khmelnytskyi logistical route, bringing to an abrupt end the relative lull in fighting in the region.  In doing so, Russia managed to destroy several significant ammunition depots which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team have been busy restocking with western support in preparation for a series of counter-offensive operations.  A massive explosion of munition depots in the Khmelnytskyi area sparked fears of a potential radiation leak because the weapons contained depleted uranium.  The Ukrainian authorities rebuffed contamination claims and accused Moscow of spreading propaganda.  No amount of political spin though can hide the fact that the Russians achieved a major tactical and public media success in hitting one of the Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence systems that was safeguarding skies over Kyiv.  Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. Picture: Sean Gallup/Getty Images  Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon have more reasons to lose sleep if Russsia's ""angry patriots"" get their way in the Kremlin, writes Alexey Muraviev. Picture: Sergei GuneyevTASS via Getty Images  Ukraine fired some 30 SAMs in under three minutes in a desperate attempt to shoot down Kinzhal supersonic missiles, at a total cost of some US$150 million of western taxpayers’ money.  The loss of one of their Patriot systems is a major PR failure for Ukrainian authorities.  Adding to that, the now-almost inevitable fall of Bakhmut to the Russians would be a disaster for Zelensky, who told the West he would defend the city no matter the cost.  He was reportedly advised by his own military commanders to abandon the city weeks ago and save thousands of Ukrainian personnel from perishing in the “Bakhmut meat grinder”.  Conceding Bakhmut would put a great deal of pressure on Kyiv to launch their promised counter-offensive sooner rather than later.  Putin and the “Angry Patriots”  The recent battlefield victories aren’t exactly putting Putin at ease either.  The Russian leader may soon have more reasons to lose sleep, despite the recent confidence and optimism he has displayed in public.  In recent weeks, the so-called “angry patriots” stepped up their public attacks on the Kremlin and Putin himself.  Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin should be considered one of Putin's political heirs of choice, writes Alexey Muraviev. Picture: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images  They accuse Russian authorities of being indecisive and lacking the professional competence to sustain the Ukrainian campaign.  They go further and speak of the so-called “liberal fifth column” inside the Kremlin walls, e.g. elements of the ruling elite inside Putin’s administration who continue to lean towards the west.  Some include Putin’s personal friends and affiliates, among them one of Russia’s most influential and impactful oligarchs Roman Abramovich; chairman of the board of directors of Russia’s most potent and successful bank, Sberbank, Herman Gref; even Putin’s press secretary Dmitriy Peskov, to name a few.  Putin continues to shield these friends and loyal dependents from criticism, which only serves to make the ultra-patriots even angrier towards the Russian president.  In addition to searching for enemies at home, the ultra-patriots are getting more furious about Ukraine’s successful efforts at stymying the Russians.  Recent weeks have been marked by repeated acts of sabotage in Russian border regions, including a train derailment in Crimea on Thursday.  The deployment of the British-supplied Storm Shadow long-range airborne high precision missiles came as a nasty surprise.  So did the Ukrainian tactical successes in Bakhmut.  The fierce resistance of Zelensky’s military and their stubborn refusal to back down infuriates Russia even more.  Adding to that, a carefully choreographed social media campaign by the founder of the Wagner Group Evgeniy Prigozhin, who accused generals of “starving” his forces from ammunitions, won a lot of sympathy among Russian patriots.  Many in Russia believe that Prigozhin is secretly backed by the Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration Sergei Kiriyenko.  Once viewed as a pro-western liberal, Kiriyenko has rebranded himself as one of the strongest proponents of the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Just like Russia’s former President and now Deputy Secretary of the National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.  Both can be tipped to be Putin’s political heirs of choice; both may have power ambitions of their own, particularly since they are fast becoming some of Russia’s most influential people.  None of them have openly challenged their boss.  But they don’t exactly stop others from pointing the finger at Putin.  It brings me back to the mysterious drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month.  In previous analyses, I argued the incident may have been the work of the Ukrainian security services or even the Kremlin themselves.  But there may be another side to the mystery.  What if the drone attack was a warning to Putin from these angry patriots?  As I have argued before, staging a surprise attack over Russia’s national capital, which is one of the world’s most guarded and policed cities with a massive layered air defence, is almost impossible.  It’s hard to believe these drones somehow flew undetected over sensitive security and defence sites, especially after Moscow had gone into a security lockdown prior to the annual Victory Day celebrations.  It’s less difficult to envisage an attack arranged or supported by senior members of the security and defence apparatus who no longer consider Putin a viable political figure because of his failure to neutralise the mysterious “fifth column” inside Russia’s power circles.  If this is the case, Putin desperately needs Ukraine to launch its offensive, which may take some heat off him and his friends.  Should the Russian military succeed in repelling their advance, Putin would likely end up as the winner in this messy internal power struggle.  The longer the Ukrainians delay their promised offensive the more impatient Russia’s angry patriots will get.  It’s a paradox but this time the West’s interests and the ones of Putin collude.  Both sides are waiting impatiently for Zelensky to give his troops the signal to attack, and both want their victories at the finish line.

"coup","2023-07-09","Not Discerned","{""Sudan"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:12:27","The conflict in Sudan is rapidly escalating, already killing close to 1,000 people (some estimates go as high as 2,000 in West Darfur alone) and forcing nearly 1 million people to flee their homes—all at the hands of two generals, Abdul-Fattah al-Burhan, leading the Sudanese Armed Forces, and his erstwhile ally Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, or Hemedti, heading the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. In response to the mounting death and destruction, the Biden Administration has authorized sanctions against individuals and entities destabilizing Sudan and “undermining” its democratic transition. But the executive order issued earlier this month remains mere words, and until it is implemented and targets the main perpetrators of the war and their financial networks, the U.S. will continue its failed policy on Sudan.  The Biden Administration drafted the initial version of the executive order after the October 2021 coup in Sudan, which consolidated power in the hands of the military generals, rupturing Sudan’s democratic transition. The administration, however, never released it to avoid rocking the boat with Burhan and Hemedti. That decision meant blindly placing faith in the two generals to resolve their differences and usher in a peaceful democracy, despite their two-decade history of committing atrocities with impunity in Sudan.  Sudanese general Abdel-Fattah Burhan, speaks during a military-backed rally in Omdurman, Sudan, in June 2019. Hussein Malla—AP Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), attends a rally in the village of Abraq in June 2019. Yasuyoshi Chiba—AFP/Getty Images  From 2003 to 2008, Burhan and Hemedti orchestrated mass atrocities in Darfur in a conflict that killed over 300,000, forcibly displaced more than 3 million, and resulted in the only genocide charge ever issued by the International Criminal Court against Sudan’s longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2010. In 2019, following the popular uprising precipitating a military coup, Bashir was removed from power, and a Transitional Military Council (TMC) was established. Burhan chaired the council, and Hemedti served as his deputy. The two generals portrayed themselves as the guardians of the glorious Sudan revolution. They even arrested Bashir and senior members of his regime. Soon, however, their forces massacred pro-democracy protesters in Khartoum in front of the military headquarters.  The TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), an umbrella group that led the pro-democracy protests, negotiated a political agreement to form a civilian-led government, according to which the Transitional Sovereign Council (TSC) was set up. The TSC then appointed Abdallah Hamdok as Prime Minister in 2020. Though a civilian government was established, power largely remained in the hands of Burhan and Hemedti. Then, in October 2021, the generals violently seized control of the country in a military coup—arresting Hamdok and the majority of his cabinet, as well as disbanding the TSC.  Despite all this, the U.S. has only sanctioned one Sudanese entity since the coup, a lower-level police unit called Sudan’s Central Reserve Police for its use of excessive force against demonstrators. This is a stark contrast to the nearly 3,000 Russian individuals or entities currently sanctioned by the U.S., and the imposition this week of U.S. visa bans on individuals undermining Nigeria’s democratic process during the 2023 general elections.  Sudanese refugees women, who fled the violence in their country and who were waiting desperately for food distribution, dodge the soldiers attempting to hold them back to grab bags of provision when they saw that supplies brought by a Turkish aid group (IHH) were running out, near the border between Sudan and Chad on May 7. Zohra Bensemra—Reuters  The Biden Administration can do more. The financial networks sustaining the current conflict can be directly traced and targeted, as already exposed by independent investigations carried out by Clingendael Institute, Global Witness, and others. Such sanctions would redeem the U.S.’ image before the people of Sudan and reinforce its role as mediator because they would be applied equally and neutrally to all parties implicated in the ongoing violence. And they could force a change in Burhan and Hemedti’s calculus, isolate them, and cut them off from the financial flows that fund the war.  Such an action is sorely needed given the scale of the crisis in Sudan. The country faces imminent environmental, water, and health catastrophes. The healthcare system is on the verge of collapse, with 70% of hospitals near battlegrounds now out of service. The situation is even more dire in a country with 1.3 million refugees and over 4 million internally displaced people living in precarious conditions. A third of the population had already been dependent on humanitarian aid before the fighting; now more than half of Sudan, or 25 million people, are in need of aid and protection. Yet international humanitarian groups have largely withdrawn from the country due to safety concerns.  As this conflict drags on, the people of Darfur face an even more frightening situation beyond the reach of international observers. The longstanding fragility of the region’s security was exacerbated by the withdrawal of the U.N. African Mission in Darfur without alternative forces in place to protect civilians and humanitarian workers. Given the power vacuum, Darfur is at increased risk of an influx of Sub-Saharan terrorist groups and conflict along ethnic lines between what is perceived as Arab and non-Arab African ethnic groups.  People stand next to a trench in Khartoum amid ongoing fighting between the forces of two rival generals on May 18. AFP/Getty Images  Yet sanctions are hardly the only tool at the Biden Administration’s disposal. The U.S. and its allies should engage directly with the grassroots democracy movement as the rightful stewards of a future, peaceful Sudan. The international community should also support local resistance committees and community leaders who have most effectively protected and provided for the vulnerable. Meanwhile, key diplomatic players can work to permanently cease hostilities, open humanitarian safe zones, and protect aid groups.  The U.S. has an opportunity to reverse its past mistakes vis-à-vis Sudan and lead its allies in a concerted effort to target the funding underpinning this war, instead of standing by as Burhan and Hemedti commit open atrocities. The international community has common sense tools at their disposal to immediately impose costs on the individuals waging this war and prevent further destruction. At this critical juncture, the U.S. and its allies can choose to perpetuate 20 years of impunity or chart a new path forward and prioritize the dignity of human life. The choice is an obvious one.

"coup","2019-09-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T07:44:58","Myanmar’s military has imported at least USD 1 billion worth of weapons and related material from Russia, China and other countries since its February 2021 coup, some of which it has used to carry out atrocities against civilians, according to a UN report released on Wednesday. The weapons continue to flow to the military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for the atrocities, including some that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, said Tom Andrews, the UN independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar.  As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help. He said at least 160 people were killed, including many children. In addition, the machine guns and bombs used in the attacks included parts and materials from companies located in Singapore, China and Thailand, he said.  Myanmar is mired in strife because of a political crisis unleashed when the military took power. Its takeover prompted widespread peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with deadly force, triggering armed resistance throughout the country that the army has been unable to quell. Andrews said at least 22,000 political prisoners have been detained since the coup, at least 3.500 civilians have been killed and 1.5 million people have been forcibly displaced. The report documents over 12,500 purchases that were shipped directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working for the military from Feb. 1, 2021, when the military ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, until December 2022, Andrews said at a news conference. He said the volume and diversity of equipment the military received was “staggering,” ranging from fighter jets and attack helicopters and drones to advanced missile systems, tank upgrades, sophisticated communications equipment, radar complexes and components for naval ships. Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine , said he had received “highly credible and detailed information from confidential sources” identifying the major networks and companies involved in the arms trade with Myanmar. The report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council identifies USD 406 million in weapons and material that went to the Myanmar military from Russia, USD 267 million, China, $254 mn from Singapore, USD 51 million from India and $28 mn from Thailand.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cGlvbmVlci5jb20vMjAyMy93b3JsZC8tLS1teWFubWFyLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWltcG9ydGVkLXdlYXBvbnMtd29ydGgtdXNkLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1zaW5jZS0yMDIxLWNvdXAtLS0uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2017-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Shanghai"", ""Shanghai"", ""China""}","2023-05-19T07:13:00","An online market is growing for blind box mementoes of former relationships, particularly with a giveaway in the form of stories of what went wrong.  Withered roses, knickknacks, a used electric shaver, photos, letters and all and sundry mementoes associated with a previous relationship – these are objects that evoke sadness, regret or even relief about a past attachment.    In the cyberspace, however, these sentimental leavings could also be packed up, randomly, in a blind box, and marketed to purchasers with voyeuristic impulses.    By paying a price that generally ranges from 100 to 1,000 yuan (US$14 to 140) per box – often accompanied by a story – the buyer might experience, vicariously, the sentimental journey or, more often, end up with a pile of trash.  With the so-called Internet Valentine's Day marked on May 20 in China, this new trade in what remained of one's old relationship is worthy of being explored from an ethical and legal perspective.  Only a very small minority are interested in the physical value of these trinkets, while most potential buyers are more drawn by the story behind the objects, with many stipulating explicitly that the story related to the objects should be provided graciously.  To substantiate the authenticity of these objects, some sellers provide screenshots of chats on social media, or personal letters. If these objects are real, then such blatant commercial exploitation of legacy from old attachment could be scrutinized from legal or ethical dimensions.  Especially if these objects end up in the hands of livestreaming hosts who would open the box, with running comment, in a live session, in the hope of drawing viewers.  In many cases, it just provides a novel means of clearing out stock, with some boxes priced at 800 yuan containing no more than such things as fluffy toys, plastic hairpins, or cosmetics – all smacking of the run-of-the-mill fare from the Yiwu wholesale market.  One host unraveled a glittering rose that at first glance seemed to be made of gold but which, upon checking online, turned out to be exactly the same as an item priced at less than 2.85 yuan on a sales platform. Some contained plastic dishes obviously sourced from a nearby grocery store.  While these items are insignificant, daily life objects in themselves, they are sometimes sexed up by love stories so moving and dramatic that they are clearly made up.  According to someone interviewed in a recent report on Shanghai Observer, a local news website, if one is really serious about getting rid of the legacy from a past relationship, it would be more reasonable to simply market them on a second-hand goods platform.  The blind box sales, fueled by rumors that someone obtained a brand-new mobile phone by opening a box, is often a marketing stunt for cheap trinkets, in cahoots with livestreaming hosts eager to inflate their viewership.  It could be more complicated in cases where the purveyed items are authentic.  The Shanghai Observer reported on a woman surnamed Sun who, before moving into a new home, tried to dispose of things belonging to her ex-boyfriend in a blind box. Ironically, she said though that relating her sentimental journey on several occasions in the process had helped her ""make peace"" with her past. She is now firmly on a path to rejuvenation, according to the report.  In an interview with Shanghai Observer, a dramatist named Xin Lei purchased such a box containing many bills, a ticket to a performance in 2015, and a one-way ticket for a journey in 2022. Xin said the bills and tickets alone sufficed to help piece together a sentimental tale of love. Obviously, Xin preferred to view these as a type of behavioral art where a past life became reconstructed with the help of used objects.  If some blind boxes might lay claim to a certain therapeutic or artistic value, there is a catch: those witnessing or looking on at this catharsis or reconstruction are merely having their voyeuristic urges satisfied.  The ethical ramifications for giving total strangers glimpses into one's intimate past, whether for a healing purpose or profitable motive, should be discussed.

"coup","2019-02-24","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-19T21:30:00","Vice President Sara Duterte on Friday parted ways with the ruling Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) party in an unexpected move seen setting off the first major political tremor in President Marcos’ year-old administration.  Duterte’s decision to leave Lakas-CMD, where she served as cochair, followed the sudden demotion of former President and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as a House leader on Thursday.  ADVERTISEMENT  From being the Senior House Deputy Speaker, considered the chamber’s de facto No. 2 position, Arroyo is now just one of nine Deputy House Speakers. Replacing her in the senior position was another Pampanga congressman, Aurelio Gonzales Jr.  ‘Disavowal’  In a statement issued late Thursday night, Arroyo denied rumors that she was plotting to unseat Speaker Martin Romualdez, the Lakas-CMD president and a cousin of President Marcos.  Becoming Speaker for a second time was no longer part of her “political objectives,” she said, adding that some of her actions may have been “misconstrued,” like her “recent trip with a delegation of congressmen to Korea for some official meetings.”  Arroyo said her “disavowal” should now “preempt any needless politicking” so that the Speaker and President Marcos could continue doing their jobs “with minimum distraction.”  In a statement explaining her departure from Lakas-CMD, Duterte made no direct reference to the developments at the House, only saying that she would not allow “political toxicity” and “execrable political power play” to affect her work.  “Nothing is more important to me than being able to meaningfully serve our fellow Filipinos and the Philippines—with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. leading the way,” said Duterte, who was Mr. Marcos’ running mate in the 2022 elections under the UniTeam coalition.  Just here to ‘help out’  Duterte took her oath as a member of Lakas-CMD on Nov. 11, 2021, just hours after resigning from Hugpong ng Pagbabago, the regional party that she headed. Two days later, she filed her certificate of candidacy for Vice President under Lakas-CMD.  On Nov. 17, 2021, barely a week after becoming a party member, Duterte accepted the offer to serve as its chair.  On Feb. 5 this year, Lakas-CMD reelected Duterte as party chair, Romualdez as president, and Arroyo as chair emeritus.  ADVERTISEMENT  In her statement denying the coup plot, Arroyo maintained that she only had three political objectives: to represent Pampanga’s second district, to support the legislative agenda of Romualdez and President Marcos, and to use her experience as former President to “help out when I am called upon to do so.”  Alluding to her previous turnaround in 2004 when she decided to run for President despite earlier declaring that she was no longer interested in the post, Arroyo said that “later events with serious national security and political implications” convinced her to change her mind, among them “our war on terrorism following 9-11 and the continuing attempts at destabilization at that time.”  Arroyo admitted she had initially aspired for the speakership when President Marcos won in the 2022 elections, “(b)ut it soon became apparent that he was most comfortable with then Congressman Martin Romualdez as Speaker.”  “This relationship of deep trust between the Speaker and the President has been beneficial in smoothly enacting the legislative agenda of the President,” she said.  A source privy to the Vice President’s decision, who asked not to be named for lack of clearance to speak to the media, said her resignation from the party was “obviously influenced” by the action taken by Romualdez’s allies against Arroyo.  “The Vice President is very close with the former President. They regularly talk about their work as senior government officials,” the source told the Inquirer, adding that Duterte and Arroyo spoke on Thursday night.  Another source, from a group belonging to the ruling coalition, also described Duterte’s decision as an offshoot of Arroyo’s demotion in the House: “It’s a chess game. This is a power play, plain and simple.’’Loyalty pledges  Meanwhile, several Lakas-CMD officers and members reiterated their support for Romualdez and President Marcos.  “Through the darkest of storms and greatest of tribulations, we have proven time and again that our unity will never be torn down,” Sen. Ramon Revilla Jr., the party cochair, said in a statement.  Agusan del Norte Rep. Jose Aquino II, the Lakas-CMD secretary general, said the ruling party was thankful to Duterte for “helping us build a Unity Team aimed at bringing meaningful change to Philippine society.”  Aquino echoed Duterte’s call “for all political leaders to unite in support of President Marcos and for all of us to work for the success of this administration for the benefit of our people.”  The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), another administration ally, also assured the President and the Speaker of the support of its 43 members in the House.  The assurance was conveyed through the media by NPC chair and former Senate President Vicente Sotto III.  Support  Also among those who expressed support for the President and the current House leadership were Deputy Speaker Kristine Singson-Meehan and Rizal Rep. Michael John Duavit of the NPC.  The Partylist Coalition Foundation Inc., led by the House appropriations committee chair, Rep. Elizaldy Co, expressed the group’s commitment to “remain a staunch partner of the supermajority … in addressing (the) issues and concerns of its constituents as part of its legislative functions.”  The National Unity Party, chaired by former Interior Secretary Ronaldo Puno, vowed “to continue working in close partnership with the House Speaker,’’ saying his leadership had led to “an unprecedented number of priority bills passed on third and final reading in less than a year in office.”  —With A REPORT FROM Inquirer Research  g/  Your subscription could not be saved.

"coup","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T00:05:02","Former President now Pampanga 2nd District Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has denied any coup plot against House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez.  “When I learned that there were reports that I was suspected of plotting a ‘coup’ against Speaker Romualdez, I decided I must speak out to clarify my political position. Indeed, some of my actions may have been misconstrued, such as my recent trip with a delegation of congressmen to Korea for some official meetings,” said Arroyo in a statement issued late Thursday.  “On the 17th of May 2023, I received news that Deputy Speaker Dong Gonzales was elected Senior Deputy Speaker in my place. My first reaction was that it is always the prerogative of the House to make changes in its leadership structure. Thus, I congratulate Dong, and I hope his new position will help him fulfill his mandate to represent our fellow Kapampangans,” she added.  On further reflection, Arroyo said she now feels it necessary to explain her thoughts on the matter.  According to Arroyo, her political objectives are clear: to represent the 2nd district of Pampanga, to support the legislative agenda of Romualdez and President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., and to use whatever experience she has as a former President to help out when she called upon to do so.  “Outside of my role as congresswoman, my public interest going forward is to help reduce tensions between the United States and China, given that I was strongly allied to both countries when I was President,” she said.  “As I have learned during my three decades as a politician, such events are part and parcel of Philippine politics. Still, I do not want it to precipitate or intensify any tendencies towards early politicking. We are just barely a year into the administration of President Marcos Jr., and it would be unfortunate if early politicking resulted in any dilution of the tremendous mandate that the UniTeam, led by our President, earned in the 2022 elections. After all, the President ran on the platform of unity,” she added.  When President Marcos won, Arroyo admitted that she wanted to aspire for the Speakership of the House.  But it soon became apparent that Marcos was most comfortable with his cousin, Romualdez, as Speaker, she said after realizing the wisdom embedded in that sentiment.  In the Philippines, Arroyo said the House leadership has traditionally been closely associated with the sitting President, and this relationship of deep trust between Speaker and President has been beneficial in smoothly enacting the legislative agenda of the President.  “I think this is acceptable, because in the Philippines, the check and balance needed in any democracy has traditionally been well provided by the Senate,” she said.  Arroyo said it also should be noted, “being Speaker once more is no longer part of my political objectives.”  “This has been my position ever since Speaker Romualdez was elected in the 19th Congress, and I continue to urge my Lakas-CMD partymates to support our party President in that role,” she said.  “Am I firm in this position? Some may recall that in December 2002, I publicly declared that I would not run for President in 2004. But I had responsibilities of a sitting President then, so later events with serious national security and political implications convinced me to change my mind. I refer to such matters as our war on terrorism following 9-11 and the continuing attempts at destabilization at that time,” she said.  This time, Arroyo said, she is a mere congresswoman, “so issues of national importance no longer depend on my role in Congress. Thus, I have no compelling reasons to change my mind about foregoing my ambitions for the Speakership.”  By this disavowal, the former president said she hopes that we can preempt any needless politicking so that the House and our President can focus on the job at hand with minimum distraction.  Support  Amid coup issues, political parties and groups reiterated their support for President Marcos and Speaker Romualdez after the leadership decision demoting Arroyo from Senior Deputy Speaker position to a Deputy Speaker.  The House of Representatives has elected Deputy Speaker Aurelio “Dong” Gonzales Jr. as Senior Deputy Speaker to “unburden” his “cabalen,” Arroyo, of the “heavy load” required from the position, said Majority Leader Mannix Dalipe.  Asking for her comment, Arroyo only said, “It’s the prerogative of the House.”  For his part, Gonzales, who is PDP-Laban national treasurer, said his party expressed its full support for the administration and the leadership of Romualdez in the House of Representatives.  “Our party reiterates its unwavering support for both the President and Speaker Romualdez. Together, they have accomplished much for our country and our people,” said Gonzales.  “Our Speaker is a valuable ally and helping hand to the President in terms of shepherding the administration’s legislative priorities in Congress,” he said.  He added PDP-Laban is thankful to the House and Romualdez for choosing and electing him as senior deputy speaker.  “As in the past, as a loyal member of the majority, I will always support the Speaker and will continue to work for the benefit of my constituents in the 3rd district of Pampanga and of my kabalen in the province,” Gonzales added.  Deputy Speaker and Nacionalista Party Spokesperson Camille Villar also expressed the party’s unequivocal support to the leadership, as “we remain fully committed to the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to its vision of a united and prosperous nation.”  Surigao del Norte Rep. Robert Ace S. Barbers said Gonzales is one of their reliable and diligent partners in the House of Representatives and a great addition to the working force of Romualdez.  “We reiterate the party’s strong support to the leadership of Speaker Romualdez who is deeply committed to the well-being and progress of our nation,” he said.  “At the same time, we also reiterate our full support to President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr., whose 8-point Socio-Economic Agenda guides our work as legislators,” he said.  House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan reiterated the minority bloc’s full support to Romualdez, “who has ably steered the House in delivering unprecedented accomplishments less than a year in our terms.”  “The minority is absolutely committed to our partnership with Speaker Romualdez and the entire House leadership, as we seek common ground to swiftly create more jobs and livelihood opportunities, lift a greater number of households from poverty, and move the country forward,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvcmVwLW1hY2FwYWdhbC1hcnJveW8tZGVuaWVzLWNvdXAtcGxvdC12cy1ob3VzZS1zcGVha2VyLXJvbXVhbGRlei_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2019-05-06","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T03:10:00","1. You expect the home team down 1-0 to open Game 2 with a burst of desperate energy, but if we’ve learned anything from this postseason it’s that the HEAT don’t care one bit about expectations.  Miami opened on a 9-2 run, surviving on second chances as the Celtics were coming up empty in trying to post-up Max Strus and Gabe Vincent. The Boston crowd kept trying to lift up the home offense only to be met with a miss off iron and Miami was well on their way to a solid first quarter. Then Bam Adebayo hit the bench and Boston’s delayed burst began immediately, pushing the pace off misses and draining threes en route to a 19-2 run and a 12-point lead.  Just like in Game 1 it felt like things were slipping away a bit for the HEAT. Just like in Game 1, they answered right back. With Rob Williams assigned to Caleb Martin, Martin took it as a green light to get aggressive and almost immediately punished the matchup with 14 points – the only non-Butler player in double digits through two quarter – on 6-of-9 shooting in the first half, both driving the rim and taking the open threes. After Boston generated a handful of buckets hunting mismatches, Erik Spoelstra toggled to zone and bought some time – some open threes were allowed, but most of them missed. The HEAT’s run extended to 26-10 through the break after falling behind by a dozen, and they led by four, topping 40 percent from three (6-of-14) a game after making more than half of their attempts, with a few tough mid-range makes tossed in.  Again, Miami wasn’t getting the better shots – at least as the shots would be colloquially defined – but they were making more regardless. Boston fought back with drives and paint attacks, and yet just as soon as they re-took the lead there was Butler with another mid-range hit. Jayson Tatum (34 points on 20 shots) took over for a couple minutes to take the Celtics back up 11, and again there was a response from Martin and Butler to keep things stable. Boston by eight going into the fourth, but it felt like anyone’s game.  Boston stretched the lead back out to double digits, trying to find a hammer to put down, but again there was a Martin attack followed by a pair of Duncan Robinson threes – scoring on a trio of backdoor cuts throughout the game – to get it back to four. Then it was Butler time, going head-to-head with Grant Williams, literally for a couple moments, for a handful of scores to once again close the gap. Then another couple of Butler jumpers, shouldering the burden, to take a two-point lead with two minutes to play. Once again, it was turnovers costing the Celtics as the HEAT won in the margins, Adebayo (22 points, 17 rebounds, nine assists) snatching a rebound out of the air for a putback to go up five under a minute. Then it was Gabe Vincent with just his second make of the game, on a stepback jumper to go back up four. Another clutch game, another clutch win, 111-105, as Miami, improbably based on history, goes up 2-0 on the road. There aren’t enough superlatives for what this group is doing right now.  2. Maybe he wasn’t the hero in the final minutes, but his minutes made it possible for others to make the heroic plays that matter and so this is The Caleb Martin Game for now. Boston tried to stash Rob Williams on Martin but even they had to know it was a legitimate gamble with how well Martin has shot the ball, in stretches, and how he has attacked sagging-off centers in the past. It didn’t work. Martin (25 points on 16 shots) was, as he always is, game for a challenge, and his aggression off the dribble, hitting a few threes but never settling for them, was often the only reason the HEAT were within striking distance every time Boston made a push. You could say this about so many players on the team, but Martin perfectly embodies everything this group is about – toughness, force, stability and a willingness to do whatever it takes in the moment.  Butler played the closer, as he almost always does. It wasn’t hit most efficient night, 27 points on 25 shots, but he made the ones that decided the game, draining a string of mid-range jumpers to push Miami ahead. And that speaks to everything the HEAT have been about in these two games, in this postseason really. Even if things aren’t going well, even if they’re missing shots or falling behind, they never stop playing with purpose and force – running their stuff and forcing the other side to stop them. As Spoelstra has said, Butler is the HEAT and the HEAT are him. Neither side messes around with a single second of a game.  3. A few reasonably big adjustments from Boston in this one. First, after giving up a variety of late-clock threes in Game 1 after sending doubles at Butler and Adebayo, the Celtics trusted their individual defenders to switch onto Butler – while also leaving Horford to defend Adebayo one-on-one – and keep him out of the paint. Results were mixed there, especially once Derrick White came into the game and Butler started to hunt that matchup, but it was only a 5-of-12 first half for him overall as he had to create shots for himself with the offense flattened out. To White’s credit, he stopped Butler outright on drives a couple times in the second half.  The other move was that Payton Pritchard’s minutes got cut as Grant Williams was inserted back into the rotation. Williams had his moments defending Adebayo the last postseason so Joe Mazzulla put him on Miami’s center and the other Williams, Rob, on Martin so he could roam. That look stalled the HEAT out for a few possessions only to be met with Martin’s aggressive barrage that turned the tide. Of course, it was Williams who also took the brunt of Butler’s fourth-quarter surge.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmEuY29tL2hlYXQvbmV3cy9jb3Vwcy10YWtlYXdheXMtY2FsZWItbWFydGluLWtlZXBzLWhlYXQtaW4tc3RyaWtpbmctZGlzdGFuY2UtamltbXktYnV0bGVyLXN0cmlrZXMtdG8tdGFrZS0yLTAtbGVhZC1vbi10aGUtcm9hZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Sydney"", ""NewSouthWales"", ""Australia""}","Fri 19 May 2023 05:24:43","Based on the noise surrounding the cancellation of Joe Biden’s visit to Australia and PNG, you might think that the sky is falling in.  One analyst described the decision as “a self-inflicted wound”. Another said that Washington is “sinking [its] own boat”.  From the left, former foreign minister Bob Carr said it showed that “Australians have been enormously gullible and optimistic about our American partner”.  “Act like a client state, get treated like one,” Carr warned.  From the right, The Australian columnist Peter Jennings linked the decision to what he regards as the Albanese government’s lacklustre defence funding. “That type of complacency garners no presidential visits when other priorities are pressing.”  These criticisms are overblown, overwrought and, in some cases, simply wrong.  Of course, it’s a shame that President Biden isn’t visiting next week. The image of the leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia assembling at the Sydney Opera House would have been a coup for Anthony Albanese and a show of solidarity by four democracies in the face of China’s challenging behaviour.  Biden’s speech to the Australian parliament would have been a notable moment in the history of the alliance.  More significantly, his visit to Port Moresby would have been the first by a sitting president to a Pacific Island country and a chance to finalise the new US-PNG security agreement.  So, Washington has missed an opportunity this week. But let’s keep things in perspective.  In America’s messy and disaggregated political system, the executive doesn’t control the legislature. Biden’s top priority in the coming week is to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt, which would cause global financial instability and undercut American economic leadership. Biden judged that his presence in Washington was required to avoid that outcome. Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?  Americans need to take care that their domestic problems don’t spill over into foreign policy. But Biden’s cancellation is not a symptom of post-imperial decline. Bill Clinton cancelled a trip to APEC to avoid a government shutdown in 1995, when America was in the full flush of its unipolar moment.  Neither is it a sign of presidential “frailty”. Biden is a serious political figure and a potent foreign policy president.  In 2020, Biden did America’s allies a great service by marching the appalling and dangerous Donald Trump out of the White House.  His administration has responded to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine with strength and subtlety. It has brought consistency to the US relationship with China. Last week, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spent two days in Vienna talking sense to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.  The White House’s decision does not “raise questions about the reliability of the United States as a regional ally”, as political editor of The Australian Financial Review Phillip Coorey reported on Thursday.  On the contrary, Biden has restored America’s regional alliances after the trauma of the Trump years. He has deepened diplomatic and defence links with Japan.  Last month, he closed a deal with the president of South Korea to counter the nuclear threat from Pyongyang and prevent Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear deterrent.  This month, Biden hosted Ferdinand Marcos jnr – the first Philippines president to visit the Oval Office in a decade – and reinvigorated US-Filipino military ties.  It was Biden who first convened the Quad countries at the leaders’ level. Hopefully, the four leaders will now meet in Hiroshima and advance the Quad’s agenda.  What about Australia? As part of AUKUS, Biden agreed to share one of America’s most advanced technologies – its naval nuclear propulsion system – to enable us to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.  This is a “big bet” on Australia, Jake Sullivan told the Lowy Institute in 2021. “We trust you, we believe in you. And we believe even more importantly in our collective combined capacity to produce greater stability, security and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region.”  Some commentators seem to have a case of nerves. They should take their lead instead from the Australian public.  Over the course of nearly two decades of Lowy Institute polling – and even at the depths of the misbegotten Iraq war – strong majorities of Australians have seen the US alliance as “very” or “fairly” important for Australia’s security. In the 2023 Lowy Institute Poll, which will be released next month, eight in 10 (82 per cent) continue to see the alliance as important to our security. One presidential no-show won’t change that long-held view.  The US presence in Asia gives structure to the region, which would otherwise be dominated by one giant authoritarian power. Through our active diplomacy in South-East Asia and the Pacific, as well as through the alliance, AUKUS and the Quad, Australia is contributing to a stable balance of power.  Nothing has changed this week. The sky remains in place.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd3lpbnN0aXR1dGUub3JnL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9jYW5jZWwtbm8tc2hvdy1vdmVycmVhY3Rpb24tcG90ZW50LWZvcmVpZ24tcG9saWN5LXByZXNpZGVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All rights reserved.  False posts in Thailand have passed off photos of a freelance model wearing lingerie as images of a young politician from the Move Forward Party. Rukchanok Srinork -- whose party would claim victory in national elections in May 2023 -- said she had filed a complaint with the police.  ""This MP candidate of Move Forward Party wants to show off so much, so we shared her photos to meet her demand,"" reads a Thai Facebook post on May 11.  ""Even some sex workers don't dare to take these kinds of photos,"" the post adds. It features 28-year-old Rukchanok Srinork's campaign poster alongside photos of a woman wearing orange-coloured lingerie.  Orange is associated with the Move Forward Party, and the party's orange triangle-shaped logo can also be seen in the photos (archived link).  The post circulated days before Rukchanok's progressive Move Forward Party rode a dramatic wave of support in an election pitting a young generation yearning for change against a conservative old guard of septuagenarian generals and backroom billionaires.  The party claimed victory in the May 14 election, as voters turned out in record numbers to deliver a brutal verdict on the near-decade-long rule of former coup leader Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha. Local media reported that Rukchanok also won her race (archived link).  Screenshot of the false post taken on May 18, 2023  Facebook posts here, here and here and private messages on the mobile application Line also shared the photos with a similar false claim.

A search on Facebook found Warunee posted the photos on May 6 with a caption that translates as, ""I was born in the era of Move Forward Party-led government"" (archived link).

Is Myanmar serious about the effort?  Advertisement  In early May, 20 Rohingya Muslims and government officials from Bangladesh recently visited Myanmar’s Rakhine State in an effort to urge their voluntary homecoming, which can be regarded as a major development in terms of the long-stalled Rohingya repatriation. The Rohingya delegation traveled across the transboundary Naf River to visit a community in Rakhine State.  Nearly 1 million Rohingya Muslims live in camps in Bangladesh’s border town of Cox’s Bazar, the bulk of whom fled a military-led crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2017. Until recently, Myanmar’s military has shown reluctance to accept the return of any Rohingya, who have been treated as foreign intruders in Myanmar, refused citizenship, and subjected to maltreatment. The current effort would involve the repatriation of around 1,100 refugees, but no timeframe has been established.  Attempts to start repatriation in 2018 and 2019 failed since the refugees refused to return due to fear of violence. The matter remained stalled, and Bangladesh needs Myanmar’s initiative to regain momentum. Then, on March 15, a 17-member team from Myanmar arrived in Bangladesh to look through the list of Rohingya refugees obtained as part of the repatriation program. In another sign of progress, on May 5, a delegation of 20 Rohingya, accompanied by seven Bangladesh government officials, visited two of Rakhine State’s 15 villages at the request of the Myanmar government.  A Major Breakthrough?  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  One of the 20 refugees who joined the delegation said the Rohingya wanted to return home with “all our rights and security.” However, given the violence the community has repeatedly suffered, the Rohingya have questioned the repatriation plans, insisting that they will only return permanently if their safety is assured and they are awarded citizenship.

This is the first time a Rohingya refugee team has visited Rakhine to investigate the situation there.  Bangladesh has been housing over 1.2 million Rohingya refugees for the past six years. However, its socioeconomic and security situation is deteriorating as a result of the large refugee issue. There appears to be no other option than repatriation, which has been a hanging case for the previous six years.  Previously, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to return a large number of Rohingya to Myanmar between 2017 and 2019, but these efforts at repatriation ended in smoke because the Rohingya refused to return to their country for fear of more persecution. Refugees and human rights advocates alike cited a lack of a conducive climate for repatriation.  Advertisement  With the cooperation of several countries, Bangladesh has highlighted the matter at every international conference. However, Myanmar has remained oblivious to international rules and conventions. Finally, the military government took the symbolic action of inviting a Rohingya delegation for an inspection tour – most likely to appear in a better light ahead of its upcoming submission to the International Court of Justice on the Rohingya genocide case.  This time, Bangladesh and the international community are optimistic about Rohingya repatriation. A “pilot repatriation initiative” where both nations gain historical experience and references to repatriate Rohingya is the first step.  Catalyzing the Junta’s Response to the Repatriation  Myanmar’s military has previously shown little willingness to accept any Rohingya, who had been denied citizenship and subjected to persecution for years. But Myanmar is now more proactive than before, thanks to Chinese intervention.  As part of the Dhaka-Naypyidaw discussions, a conference between Bangladesh and Myanmar was conducted on April 18 in Kunming, mediated by China. A committee from Myanmar visited the world’s biggest refugee camp in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar region to assess possible candidates for their repatriation. It was determined that the pilot program will begin with the repatriation of 1,076 Rohingya in May of this year. The Rohingya delegation that recently visited Rakhine State is part of that plan.  Why have China and Myanmar abruptly implemented collaborative repatriation efforts after such a long time?  First, Myanmar’s military junta has increasingly come under fire for human rights abuses since seizing power in a coup in February 2021. Members of Myanmar’s deposed National League for Democracy (NLD) and ethnic organizations have founded the National United Government (NUG), a government-in-exile that claims to be the rightful ruler of the country. The military’s control is under stress as NUG-affiliated militias, as well as the usual array of ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) fight against military control.  Enjoying this article?

Against that backdrop, Europe and the United States have upped their pressure on the junta, as has ASEAN, the grouping of Southeast Asian states. The exclusion of the Myanmar junta from ASEAN summits, as well as mounting international pressure following a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions from various countries, are acting as catalysts to project the initiative for Rohingya repatriation. By starting the long-stalled project, the Myanmar junta may hope to soften international attitudes.  Finally, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued temporary measures to safeguard the Rohingya as part of the still-pending case accusing Myanmar of genocide. According to the ICJ’s interim ruling, Myanmar must provide all relevant material every six months until the matter is resolved. On May 24, this year, the military regime must advise the ICJ of the actions they have taken and the country’s objectives. It’s in the junta’s interest to have some progress to show before then.  Is Myanmar’s Military Sincere?  Advertisement  Despite two efforts in 2018 and 2019, repatriation did not begin due to Myanmar’s insincerity and the Rohingya’s resulting objections to the lack of a conducive atmosphere in Rakhine. To address these concerns, Bangladesh is attempting to include the U.N. Refugee Agency in the repatriation process. However, Myanmar’s military government is showing reluctance to do this. As a result, the Rohingya’s lack of confidence remains unresolved.  After all, the United Nations recommended that army head Min Aung Hlaing and other generals “should be investigated and prosecuted… for genocide” in a 2018 report – and the top general is now the country’s de factor ruler following the 2021 coup.  It appears that the agreement to repatriate just over 1,000 Rohingya was nothing more than a decoy by Myanmar’s military regime to relieve itself of pressure and accountability. The decision to return only 1,000 refugees appears to be an attempt to alleviate pressure from China and other countries.  The country’s military administration said in April that it will begin repatriating Rohingya from Bangladesh. They further claim that Myanmar is undertaking a trial operation to repatriate 1,500 Rohingya and that as part of that, a Myanmar representative team visited Bangladesh and accomplished the duty of inspection. However, Myanmar’s government might have initiated this eyewash campaign solely in order to gain an edge before the ICJ opens hearings in the Gambia’s case accusing Myanmar of genocide against the Rohingya.  This also occurred in February 2022. Back then, all of a sudden, Myanmar expressed strong interest in the joint working group meeting with Bangladesh. They also spoke about how this kickstarted repatriation and presented it to the court as evidence in their favor.  The latest gambit may have worked. On May 12, the ICJ awarded Myanmar’s military regime an extension until August 24, 2023, to submit its arguments in the case, despite the Gambia’s objections. Before the end of August, then, Myanmar will want to start repatriating Rohingya to keep the attitude of the court in their favor.  Bangladesh, in turn, will want to seize this opportunity to begin the process of repatriating the Rohingya. Myanmar’s junta is now experiencing a legitimacy problem both at home and abroad, as well as conducting various battles with rebel factions within the nation. Now is the time to push the military rulers – with help from China – to take real action to bring the Rohingya back home. To achieve this, Bangladesh must keep pressuring China and the international community for their continuous involvement so that any nefarious intentions on Myanmar’s part can be nipped in the bud.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvaXMtcm9oaW5neWEtcmVwYXRyaWF0aW9uLWZpbmFsbHktbW92aW5nLWZvcndhcmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-15","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 08:01:31","The parliamentary election held in Turkey on 14 May produced an overwhelming majority for nationalist parties in the country’s parliament. Nevertheless, the presidential election, which was held simultaneously, will now go to a second round of voting. Although Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the main Turkish opposition, finished behind incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the first round, he remains in the race for the presidency.  Kılıçdaroğlu had promised to pursue a radical break from Erdoğan’s approach in a variety of policy areas, including foreign policy. His inclusive rhetoric and commitment to reconciling with marginalised groups had raised hopes among those who support closer relations between Turkey and Armenia.  The traumatic history of antagonism between the two countries and the Armenian genocide dispute continue to complicate Armenia-Turkey relations. However, while the Turkish and Armenian governments have failed to establish diplomatic ties, civil society actors on both sides have done a great deal of work to foster closer cooperation across the realms of arts and culture, the media, education, business, and tourism, among others.  But these initiatives have suffered greatly from the unpredictable and unstable foreign policies of Erdoğan’s governments over the last two decades, underlined by Turkey’s military support for Azerbaijan during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020. They have also been undermined by the ultranationalist tone of one of Erdoğan’s key allies, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).  A closed land border  Turkey was one of the first nations to recognise the independent Republic of Armenia following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Yet the mutual trust and commitment to dialogue needed to restore full diplomatic relations between the two countries has never materialised. Initial normalisation efforts were derailed by the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, which took place between 1992 and 1994. The so-called Zurich Protocols, which were signed by Armenia and Turkey in 2009 as a step toward normalising relations, failed to be ratified in the two parliaments, under pressure from Azerbaijan.  In 2020, after the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia signed a statement which also mentioned opening all trade routes in the region. In 2021, Turkey and Armenia started a new normalisation process by appointing diplomatic representatives. As part of this process, it was announced in 2022 that the land border between Turkey and Armenia would be opened to third-country nationals, however no concrete steps have yet been taken to open the border.  One week before the 2023 Turkish elections, Kılıçdaroğlu announced proposals for a new Silk Road project connecting Europe to China without mentioning Azerbaijan, which signalled distance from the long-lasting ‘one nation two states’ motto that encapsulates the close relationship between Ankara and Baku.  Although Kılıçdaroğlu and his team have not said anything about favouring relations with Armenia over Azerbaijan, and made no comment over the recent closure of Turkish air space for Armenian flights, they have at least signalled they would not establish the same kind of relationship with Azerbaijan’s President, Ilham Aliyev, that Erdoğan has had.  It is not clear to what extent this approach to Aliyev, a popular figure among Turkish nationalists, influenced the results of the first round of the presidential election, but the unexpectedly high votes for the third candidate with Azerbaijani descent, Sinan Oğan, along with the weight of representatives from nationalist political parties in parliament perhaps give some indication.  Imprisoned peacebuilders  Kılıçdaroğlu had said he will work to improve Turkey’s poor human rights record and release political prisoners. Turkey’s civil society has suffered through difficult times ever since the failed coup attempt in 2016 and the two-year period of emergency that followed. The subsequent government crackdown on civil society organisations in Turkey, according to both Turkish and Armenian civil society actors, set back some of the progress made in the preceding decades.  This is underlined by the arrest of Osman Kavala in October 2017 during the state of emergency. Kavala was a key figure in programmes promoting civil dialogue and normalisation with Armenia. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2022 for allegedly organising the 2013 Gezi Park protests and the failed coup attempt. Six activists, including Çiğdem Mater, another key figure in the Armenia-Turkey dialogue working for the NGO Anadolu Kültür, were sentenced to 18 years in prison for participating in the Gezi Park protests and supporting Kavala.  Human rights defenders have argued that the prosecution of Kavala and his associates is based on insufficient evidence, and in 2019 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey had violated Kavala’s fundamental rights and demanded his immediate release. Referring to this decision, Kılıçdaroğlu indicated that “no one should be imprisoned for their thoughts.” The outcome of the second round of the election could therefore have major significance for wider efforts to establish cooperation with Armenia.  Frozen relations with the EU  The opposition in Turkey was confident that it could revive EU accession negotiations very quickly if it won the elections. The EU has played and is expected to play an important role in the reconciliation efforts between Armenia and Turkey. EU financial support for civil society has been particularly important in ensuring the sustainability of activities in this field during turbulent times.  However, there is a chronological mismatch in Turkey and Armenia’s engagement with Europe. On the one hand, Armenia, as a former Soviet state that cares about maintaining close ties with Russia, aspires to adopt western values, while Turkey, as a NATO member, has almost entirely abandoned the goal of joining the EU, especially in the last few years under Erdoğan. In addition, civil society has secured more freedom in Armenia since the Velvet Revolution in 2018, though it remains a target for the political opposition. In contrast, Erdoğan’s governments have remained distant from civil society and in some cases even hostile towards it.  Erdoğan currently holds the upper hand ahead of the second round of the presidential election, but supporters of Kılıçdaroğlu concerned with Turkey’s relations with Armenia remain hopeful about his prospects and about the potential to develop future cooperation with Armenia on the basis of shared democratic values. In this scenario, Turkey would undoubtedly gain more credibility in efforts to reach stability in Armenia’s relations with Azerbaijan.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3MubHNlLmFjLnVrL2V1cm9wcGJsb2cvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC93aGF0LXRoZS10dXJraXNoLWVsZWN0aW9uLW1lYW5zLWZvci1hcm1lbmlhLXR1cmtleS1yZWxhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, global indices measuring various aspects of development show Myanmar is actually moving backward at a rapid pace.  Asian danger zone  According to the Global Peace Index, military-ruled Myanmar is among the most dangerous countries in Asia, ranking 9th behind Afghanistan followed by Yemen, Syria, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran.  Myanmar is undisputedly the most dangerous country in Southeast Asia, being the only regional power in the “dangerous” category.  Western countries including the US and Britain have warned their citizens against traveling to Myanmar. Even the regime itself has warned its officials and military personnel to exercise caution while traveling within the country as it struggles to contain a nationwide resistance movement.  Meanwhile, Myanmar citizens live in fear of arbitrary arrest and killings by regime forces. Tourism website Travelling Lifestyle warns that Myanmar is among the most dangerous countries in Asia, citing the Global Peace Index.  The country was ranked 12th on the index under the now-ousted National League for Democracy (NLD) government.  World’s top 10 food-insecure countries  Agriculture is the mainstay of Myanmar’s economy. So it seems absurd to report that many people are now going hungry in the country. But this is true, all thanks to the military junta.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned early this month that Myanmar faces a worsening food crisis. Myanmar now ranks sixth on the organization’s list of countries facing severe food insecurity, after DR Congo, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Yemen.  FAO says conflicts, economic chaos, and natural disasters triggered by climate change are primary drivers of acute food insecurity. Unfortunately, Myanmar is experiencing all three. The regime is also contributing by torching farms along with grain stored for cultivation in the country’s agricultural heartland of central Myanmar.  Families across the country are facing hardships as a result of armed conflicts, high fuel and food prices, and unemployment, among other factors.  Prices of basic foodstuffs and necessities have almost tripled over the past two years. This has forced residents even in towns that are relatively stable to reduce their consumption, with some surviving on one meal a day. In the largely rural conflict zones, meanwhile, huge numbers of villagers displaced by junta raids survive on food donated by other civilians.  Near-bottom of Press Freedom Index  Junta suppression of media saw Myanmar ranked 173 out of 180 countries in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index compiled by France-based Reporters Without Borders.  Myanmar is now the second-biggest jailer of journalists after China but by far the biggest in terms of population size.  By comparison, Myanmar was ranked 139th under the NLD government.  Religious freedom a cause for concern  The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has listed Myanmar as a country of particular concern, in a list that also includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.  Regime troops’ campaign of arson against villages in central Myanmar has not spared Buddhist monasteries, despite Min Aung Hlaing’s duplicitous attempts to promote himself as protector of Buddhism and his junta as legitimately representing the country’s Buddhist majority.  Junta soldiers could not have torched the dozens if not hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and churches in Chin and Kayah states as well as Magwe and Sagaing regions without approval from their chain of command headed by Min Aung Hlaing.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken marked the release of the 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom by criticizing the regime’s repression of religious minorities in Myanmar and declaring Washington will support brave advocates for religious freedom.  The US religious freedom commission listed Myanmar as a country of particular concern in 2020 under the NLD government, citing the military’s crackdown on Muslim Rohingya.  One of the most corrupt countries  Myanmar ranked 157th out of 180 countries on the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) compiled by Transparency International, challenging North Korea as among the worst countries in Asia-Pacific.  In the 2020 CPI report, Myanmar under the NLD government had risen 13 points since 2012.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXJtYS9nbG9iYWwtaW5kaWNlcy1yZWNvcmQtbXlhbm1hcnMtcmFwaWQtZGVjbGluZS11bmRlci1qdW50YS1ydWxlLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnJhd2FkZHkuY29tL25ld3MvYnVybWEvZ2xvYmFsLWluZGljZXMtcmVjb3JkLW15YW5tYXJzLXJhcGlkLWRlY2xpbmUtdW5kZXItanVudGEtcnVsZS5odG1sL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-01","22:00:00","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 11:30:00","Devin Haney, Tank Davis, Shakur Stevenson and now Andy Cruz could lead new ‘Four Kings’ era of dominance like legends  When Cuba’s talented Andy Cruz agreed to turn professional with Matchroom it introduced into the already remarkable lightweight division the fourth fighter required to define an era.  The Olympic gold medallist – who demonstrated his vast potential by defeating America’s admired Keyshawn Davis at Tokyo 2020 – could even prove, to the minds of some observers, the finest fighter of the four.  6 Marvin Hagler, left, and Thomas Hearns, right, along with Sugar Ray Leonard and Robert Duran, became known as the 'Four Kings' Credit: Getty - Contributor  That even the great Vasyl Lomachenko – on account of his 35 years and being so much smaller than his rivals – Teofimo Lopez and Ryan Garcia have widely been discounted from the modern era’s possible equivalent to the Four Kings reflects the standards to which the anointed four are being held.  Any group hoping to earn parity with the great 'Sugar' Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran must not only consist of the very highest calibre fighters but be willing to accept the most dangerous of fights. It may even transpire that between them, Devin Haney, Gervonta Davis, Shakur Stevenson and Cruz have the necessary physical and technical abilities to do so, but not the conditions to secure what would be their defining nights.  When Davis so seamlessly stopped Garcia in April he further vindicated Floyd Mayweather’s faith in him, and – as 1.2m pay-per-views and Las Vegas’ fifth highest ever gate showed – with a suitable rival the extent of his appeal. He was already recognised as the heaviest handed of the four fighters and by stopping the exciting Garcia he showed the extent to which Garcia would struggle to compete against he, Haney and Stevenson – already established as their division’s best.  The 28-year-old, from Baltimore, had already won a world super featherweight title by the time he made his move to 135lbs. His finest victory, over Garcia, came at a catchweight of 136lbs against a naturally bigger fighter more comfortable at super lightweight, and preceded him being sentenced to 90 days of home detention and three years of probation when having left four people – a pregnant woman included – injured he pleaded guilty to a hit-and-run.  6 Cuban's Olympic gold medallist Cruz, right, is likely to make his pro debut in July and with that, a new era of dominance could be here Credit: Getty  6 Davis is already one of the most bankable PPV stars in boxing with devastating power Credit: Ryan Hafey/PBC  Haney’s progress has been considerably less dramatic, and yet no less convincing. When he beat George Kambosos Jnr in Australia to become the undisputed lightweight champion he did so after Kambosos Jnr shocked Lopez, precipitating the talented Lopez’s move to 140lbs. Lopez fought Kambosos Jnr having previously recorded one of the most impressive victories of the modern era – he outpointed Lomachenko when the Ukrainian remained thought of as the world’s very best.  It is no secret the extent to which Mayweather remains an admirer – nor to which Haney has modelled himself on another fighter considered among history’s best – but perhaps on account of not quite having the calibre of rivals as once did Leonard, even Mayweather is not yet revered in the same way as the Four Kings.  For all of his and Davis’ achievements – and they have been as significant as they have been impressive – it is the then-19-year-old Rio 2016 silver medallist Stevenson who is widely expected to succeed Mayweather as the widely recognised pound-for-pound king. Since Mayweather’s retirement at various times Lomachenko, Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, Terence Crawford and Oleksandr Usyk have been considered the world’s finest active fighter, but none has defined their sport at their peak like Mayweather and before him the great Roy Jones.  Newark’s Stevenson eased to victory over the dangerous Oscar Valdez at super featherweight a year before Davis as convincingly overcame Garcia. He has since moved to 135lbs where he is proving a natural, and where, in his only fight, he has already proved the extent to which he poses Haney a threat.  6 Stevenson had his first fight at lightweight in April and the division is boxing's most exciting Credit: Getty  If it requires remarkable talent to surpass Stevenson’s amateur achievements then Cruz, 27, proved that that is what he possessed in not only winning Olympic gold but following doing so by securing a third successive world championship gold medal and two gold medals at the Pan American Games. He is even considered the most rounded fighter to emerge from Cuba since the great Guillermo Rigondeaux, whose progress as a professional was only halted by Lomachenko at the Ukrainian’s peak.  “Right now, in the division he can fight, who is better?” asked the respected Ismael Salas – a compatriot of Cruz and once Rigondeaux’s trainer – of Davis after his victory over Garcia. “Haney? Lomachenko is getting older. Now Lomachenko has to prove how good he is – with Haney [when they fight on May 20]. Then you can talk about Lomachenko.  “[Davis has] impressed me for a long time. His timing’s amazing. He’s started to read each and every punch, and will always try to hurt you.  “He’s a slow starter. A very slow starter. But after he measures you, he takes over.”  6 Eddie Hearn called signing Cruz a major coup and cannot wait to see him in action Credit: AFP  6 Haney holds all the belts at lightweight and so the 'Four Princes' era begins Credit: Mikey Williams/Top Rank  Bob Arum – who once promoted not only Mayweather but Manny Pacquiao, Haney and Lomachenko, and oversaw fights between the Four Kings – said to Stevenson: “As good as [Hagler] was, and he was great, you’re gonna surpass him. I really believe that.”  None other than Floyd Mayweather Snr described Haney, 24 and of Vegas, as a 'carbon copy' of his son, and Mayweather Jnr, who has since sparred with him, said: “After seeing him work in the doghouse, I know he's going to be unbelievable.”  Eddie Hearn, having described Matanzas’ Cruz as 'maybe our greatest ever signing' after previously working with Alvarez, Usyk and others, said: “[Cruz is] going to start with ten rounds in July [on his professional debut] and I’ll say it now. You’ve heard me ranting and raving about Shakur Stevenson, and I think he’s unbelievable.  “I would back Andy Cruz against any lightweight in the world now. This kid is unbelievable, and I am so blessed to secure his signature. It is a major, major coup.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa3Nwb3J0LmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvMTQyNTQ5MC9kZXZpbi1oYW5leS10YW5rLWRhdmlzLXNoYWt1ci1zdGV2ZW5zb24tYW5keS1jcnV6LWZvdXIta2luZ3Mv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly90YWxrc3BvcnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2JveGluZy8xNDI1NDkwL2RldmluLWhhbmV5LXRhbmstZGF2aXMtc2hha3VyLXN0ZXZlbnNvbi1hbmR5LWNydXotZm91ci1raW5ncy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation Vyacheslav Volodin made the statement when asked about the possibility of Russia-Ukraine peace talks, BelTA has learned.  Vyacheslav Volodin said: “I have my own point of view in this case. Until Washington makes the decision, neither Zelenskyy nor Ukraine will begin negotiations. Ukraine does not exist as a state. At present this territory is a proving ground for the weapons all the NATO countries are supplying. The Ukrainian government is absolutely a pocket one. Everything is controlled by advisors from Washington and from Brussels. If we talk about Zelenskyy, he is just a TV host. And he speaks the text someone else writes.”  Vyacheslav Volodin went on saying: “There are no legitimate government bodies over there [in Ukraine]. They stopped representing the people a long time ago. They seized control as a result of a coup d'etat. Washington is in charge over there. It is Washington that will determine how long the war will last and how many Ukrainians will be killed. Ukraine residents are expendables for Washington.”  Vyacheslav Volodin said that the West led by the United States of America is trying to make the unipolar world system last. “We are in favor of a multipolar fair world. Where every country should have a future. A nation has to have prospects. And when Washington decides whether a country can exist or not… You and I saw it in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya. Virtually the same could have happened in Syria. It happened in Afghanistan,” the MP remarked.  The head of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament pointed out that today's situation affects Europe the most: “Europe loses while America gains. Inflation in Europe varies from 16% to 27%. Businesses are leaving Germany for the USA. Americans blew up the Nord Stream. An attack against whom? Against Germany, Netherlands, France. Cheap energy resources allowed Germany to make competitive products. Germany is the most powerful economy in Europe. But it stands to lose the most. Exactly because it no longer has these preferences. Who got them? The USA. Because their shale gas is many times more expensive than the gas Russia used to supply.

(AP Photo/Gregoire Merot)  France is facing a migration quagmire on the island territory of Mayotte off Africa’s east coast  CHIRONGUI, Mayotte -- Facing a migration quagmire on the French island territory of Mayotte, off Africa’s east coast, France’s government has mobilized 2,000 troops and police to carry out mass expulsions, destroy slums and eradicate violent gangs.  But the operation has raised concerns of abuse, and aggravated tensions between local residents and immigrants from the neighboring country of Comoros. It is also laying bare entrenched poverty among both communities, tensions over the island’s status — and deep inequalities between Mayotte and the rest of France.  While Mayotte is a part of France, Comoros — about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the northwest across a strait in the Indian Ocean — was also once a French colony but has been independent since 1975. Mayotte is by far the poorest corner of France, but its average annual income of around $3,500 is still more than double that in Comoros. This has created a powerful pull.  “How can they imagine for a second that (the operation) will make things better?” asked Momo, a father of five from Comoros who has lived in Mayotte for 30 years and is opposing efforts to destroy his family home. “The fight against us is not the one Mayotte needs.”  He is among those who say a lack of attention from the French state is at the core of Mayotte’s problems. Like most immigrants who spoke to The Associated Press, Momo fears having his full name published for fear of reprisals or expulsion.  Meanwhile, anti-migrant collectives on Mayotte, a volcanic island north of Madagascar known for its picturesque lagoon and vanilla and ylang-ylang herb plantations, are starting to take things into their own hands.  Some are blocking hospitals treating foreigners, disrupting shipments of medicines and goods to Comoros and threatening to destroy slums if the authorities don’t get there first.  Youth gangs are fighting back — some, unusually for France, with guns. Military forces and police are struggling to keep Mayotte under control.  Both communities are majority Black and trace their origins to a chain of islands whose status is the source of historical dispute.  In 1841, France bought Mayotte from its self-proclaimed sultan in exchange for protection. French colonization then extended to the other main islands of the Comoros chain. As independence movements emerged after World War II, tensions arose among the populations of the different islands.  In a 1974 referendum, three islands supported independence and became the new nation of Comoros, but Mayotte voted against and remained French. Comoros still claims Mayotte as part of the same chain.  While development in Mayotte remains far behind that of the French mainland, Comoros is wracked by corruption, run by a former coup leader and struggles to provide even basic public services. Mayotte is seen by Comorians as a land of refuge where people can at least get medical care and children can go to school.  Since 1991, the population of Mayotte has almost quadrupled to around 260,000, according to the French statistics agency Insee — and many other immigrants are believed to remain uncounted. Insee says that of the 10,600 children born on Mayotte in 2021, 46.5% had two parents who weren’t French.  But once they turn 18, these young people have few job or education options. It takes years to get a residence permit, and even those who have it can’t travel to mainland France. Many turn to the underground economy. Crime has flourished.  That's the backdrop for “Operation Wuambushu,” launched on April 24 for two months. It’s expected to be extended because of setbacks suffered by the French government and Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, the architect of the operation and the driving force in France’s overall efforts to stem migration.  Just as police arrived from the French mainland, a court blocked expulsions, and Comoros refused to take the migrants back. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Comoros President Azali Assoumani last week to try to break the deadlock.  This week, a court approved the destruction of one neighborhood, and on Wednesday, around 20 Comorians were deported by sea, the first since the operation started. French government representatives watching the departure welcomed it as “a first step""; anti-migrant activists on the docks protested that the ship held too few people.  “What will we do now?” asked Zenabou, whose family home was razed in this week’s police action in the town of Majikavo. She fled Comoros 26 years ago and settled in Mayotte, where she has seven children born on French territory. “We have lost everything, they destroyed our lives. How can our children grow up positively when living through this?”  Many residents welcome the security surge. Earlier this month, more than 1,000 people demonstrated in Chirongui in southern Mayotte in support of the operation, and to express their attachment to France.  On Sunday, people in the village of nearby Tsimkoura compiled a list of “foreigner settlements” and sent it to the mayor, demanding that he expel the residents by the end of the week.  “Otherwise, we will take care of it,” said Kourati Youssouffa, a public servant with the local administration of Mayotte.  In the isolated village of Hagnoundrou, a printed message circulating this past week warned of an imminent “hunt for migrants.” It warned, “Don’t forget your children, they are part of your luggage.""  There is little room for moderation or neutrality. Many Mahorais, or Mayotte residents, feel the arrivals from Comoros deprive them of potential development and of their right to live in peace.  Comorians like Momo, meanwhile, are well-anchored on Mayotte, but now live in fear of military patrols coming to mark their home with red paint to indicate that bulldozers are coming — or violence by anti-Comorian collectives.  If the police “don’t manage to carry out their mission, it’s the collectives who will do the work,” said Momo, who has submitted documents to try to obtain property rights as a longtime resident of a neighborhood of shanties in Majikavo.  Some of his neighbors are giving up hope, and are demolishing their houses themselves to recover the materials and build elsewhere.  The French government has deported an average of 25,000 Comorians per year since 2018. It gave Comoros 150 million euros between 2019 and 2022 to try to fight illegal migration, according to France's overseas affairs minister.  But despite the risky sea journey, thousands of those deported return from Comoros. The policy has broken up families and left thousands of children and teens unaccompanied, pushing many to join gangs.  Operation Wuambushu's supporters include Mayotte lawmaker Mansour Kamardine, who says that “it’s a matter of days’’ before the situation explodes, and is pleading for tougher police and diplomatic action.  But human rights defenders worry about the fallout.  Among critics are the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, which warned that a surge in arrests and expulsions would increase the risk of children being separated from their parents. In a statement, it called on the French government to ensure housing for families expelled and mental health support for children whose homes are razed.  French refugees' rights groups CIMADE warned that the surge would “aggravate the precariousness of the population and exacerbate the social tensions it's claiming to fight.”  For now, security forces are acting as a buffer between gangs and anti-migrant militias, while the population, split in two, girds for new tensions as the operation unfolds.  ___  Angela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.  ___  Follow AP migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvYW50aS1taWdyYXRpb24tb3BlcmF0aW9uLWZyZW5jaC1hZnJpY2FuLWlzbGFuZC1tYXlvdHRlLXN0aXJzLTk5NDE4MzY50gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvYW50aS1taWdyYXRpb24tb3BlcmF0aW9uLWZyZW5jaC1hZnJpY2FuLWlzbGFuZC1tYXlvdHRlLXN0aXJzLTk5NDE4MzY5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The resolution, signed by the Minister of Governance, María Amelia Coronel Kinloch, states that after accepting the dissolution, the ministry agreed to “proceed with the cancellation of the Registration and Perpetual Number” assigned to UCICAM as a nonprofit association.  The closures of the universities, including Juan Pablo II University and the Christian Autonomy University of Nicaragua (UCAN), were ordered in March for “non-compliance with their obligations under the laws that regulate them,” and their assets were transferred to the state.  These university closures are part of a series of measures taken by President Daniel Ortega’s left-wing government, which has resulted in sanctions from the United States and the European Union. Over 2,000 private organizations, including several private universities and business associations, have been banned in Nicaragua, accused of violating laws.  The government has also had confrontations with Church leaders who have criticized its policies, including the arrest and sentencing of Bishop Rolando Álvarez to 26 years in prison on charges such as “undermining national integrity.”  The government’s repression following the 2018 protests against Ortega, who has been in power since 2007 and repeatedly reelected under scrutiny, led to the detention of hundreds of opposition members.  The protests, which lasted for at least three months, involved roadblocks and clashes between opposition protesters and government supporters, resulting in over 300 deaths according to the UN. The government viewed the protests as a US-backed coup attempt, while international organizations accused the government of repression against the opposition.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGljb3RpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2Nsb3N1cmUtb2YtbmljYXJhZ3Vhbi11bml2ZXJzaXR5LWFwcHJvdmVkLWJ5LWRhbmllbC1vcnRlZ2FzLWdvdmVybm1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1999-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Karachi"", ""Sind"", ""Pakistan""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:18:22","(Bloomberg) -- Pakistan investors are bracing for a sudden jolt as former premier Imran Khan’s showdown with the powerful military, and the government, reaches a tipping point.  Warnings of a massive drop in the rupee are flaring up, with some analysts forecasting another 20% decline is possible. Heightened tensions after Khan’s arrest last week may push an International Monetary Fund’s $6.7 billion bailout further out of reach, with bond managers staring at the specter of a sovereign default.  Khan, who was later released by the top court, is challenging the military’s influence in politics and pushing the government to hold early elections. Risks are rapidly increasing for investors as the upheaval is a potent reminder of the nation’s history with three coups since 1958, while an apparent assassination attempt on the 70-year-old politician in November underscored that violence may intensify.  “To be invested in Pakistan means you should be prepared for bigger risks,” said Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging-market sovereign debt at abrdn plc, a long-time investor in the nation. “Black swans are a bigger probability.”  Moody’s Investors Service said this month the nation may default after June if it fails to secure IMF funding. In February, the company downgraded Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to an all-time low. Pakistan’s external debt service is estimated at about $22 billion for fiscal year 2024, which begins in July, according to Columbia Threadneedle Investments, about five times the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves.  Bond investors are growing more nervous, with the extra yield they demand to hold Pakistan’s dollar bonds over US Treasuries climbing above 35 percentage points to a record this month. Pakistan’s dollar bonds are trading at distressed levels, with notes due in 2031 quoted at about 34 cents on the dollar.  The rupee slid to a record-low 299 per dollar at close last week and ended at 285.6 on Thursday. The currency has lost about 20% this year, among the worst performers in the world.  Khan said he fears another arrest after police surrounded his home in Punjab province on Wednesday, stoking concerns of a repeat of the violent clashes last week. Authorities now say they intend to search his home for supporters who were suspected of attacking military facilities during the unrest.  “Any worsening of the political environment such as the imposition of martial law could deter the IMF,” said Patrick Curran, a senior economist at Tellimer based in Portland, Maine. “Default risk will continue to loom large and bonds and the currency will remain under pressure.”  The rupee may slump to as low as 350 per dollar in June if Pakistan fails to secure the loan, said Adil Ghaffar, chief executive officer at Premier Financial Services Pvt. in Karachi, who correctly predicted the currency may decline to current levels in January. Standard Chartered Plc, meanwhile, is sticking to its call for the rupee to decline to 300 by the middle of the year, according to Farooq Pasha, an economist in Karachi.  “The rupee trajectory remains subject to considerable uncertainty as market sentiment is fragile,” Pasha said. “Politics will remain the key risk in the near-term until the elections.”  Pakistan’s dollar stockpile, which stood at $4.3 billion in mid-May, is not enough to cover even one month of imports despite heavy restrictions, according to Bloomberg Economics. Import cover fell to the historically low level of 0.5 months in January, said Ankur Shukla, an analyst in Mumbai. It has risen slightly after the nation secured loans from China.  For Johannes Loefstrand, portfolio manager of the frontier markets fund at T. Rowe Price in London, stock picking in Pakistan is more crucial than ever. The company is invested in Systems Ltd., an information technology company which benefits from the rupee weakness as its revenue is mainly in foreign currency.  Coups  Pakistan’s military has long dominated the political landscape, ruling directly for 32 of the 76 years since independence from British rule and backing many of its civilian regimes.  The South Asian nation last had a coup in 1999 when General Pervez Musharaff came to power. Though the army vowed last year to stay out of politics, Khan’s arrest is casting doubt on that promise. The military has denied any involvement in the shooting last year that injured his leg.  A general election is due to be held by October this year. Emboldened by strong support in opinion polls, Khan called for an early vote and forced the dissolution of two provincial assemblies to build momentum for this but the government is reluctant to go ahead.  IMF Bailout  Pakistan has been negotiating with the IMF to restart its bailout program since November, with the financing gap among the biggest roadblocks. There’s about $2.7 billion left to disburse from the $6.7 billion program that’s scheduled to expire next month.  “Significant additional financing is essential to complete the loan review,” IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack said this month.  The nation has a tumultuous track record with the IMF. Most of its previous bailouts — 13 since the late 1980s — weren’t completed. The government got a $1.1 billion loan in August, part of a package it secured in 2019. But the program has been halted multiple times because of Islamabad’s failure to meet loan conditions and attempts to change terms.  --With assistance from Ankur Shukla (Economist).  ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9wYWtpc3Rhbi1pbnZlc3RvcnMtYnJhY2UtZm9yLXRodW5kZXJib2x0LWFzLWltcmFuLWtoYW4tdGVzdHMtYXJteS0xLjE5MjIyMjjSAXBodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibm5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY2EvcGFraXN0YW4taW52ZXN0b3JzLWJyYWNlLWZvci10aHVuZGVyYm9sdC1hcy1pbXJhbi1raGFuLXRlc3RzLWFybXktMS4xOTIyMjI4LmFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""NakhonPathom"", ""NakhonPathom"", ""Thailand""}","Fri 19 May 2023 05:25:07","May 19, 2023  SINGAPORE – A 15-year-old girl who spent 50 days in juvenile detention for allegedly insulting Thailand’s monarchy was released on Thursday.  Thanalop “Yok” Phalanchai walked out of the Ban Pranee Juvenile Vocational Training Centre for Girls in Nakhon Pathom city, in central Thailand, after a court refused, as police had asked, to extend her detention, the Bangkok Post reported.  Thanalop was arrested on March 28 for allegedly violating Thailand’s lese-majeste law when she criticised the Thai monarchy during a rally in front of Bangkok city hall in October 2022.  Protesters at the rally called for the release of political detainees and for the abolition of royal defamation prosecutions.  “By arresting a 15-year-old girl, the Thai government is sending the spine-chilling message that even children aren’t safe from being harshly punished for expressing their opinions,” Ms Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said earlier, as her group pushed to get Thanalop released.  Thanalop had been detained the longest among 19 others who are 18 years old and younger whom police had charged under Section 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code, the lese majeste law, reported the Bangkok Post, citing the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) organisation.  She was not the youngest to be held, though. A 14-year-old girl from Phitsanulok city, north of Bangkok, was arrested and released on bail this week.  The lese majeste law has been increasingly enforced ever since the Thai military took power in 2014 in a coup, and many people have been punished with harsh jail sentences.  Critics say the military-backed government uses the law to clamp down on free speech, and the United Nations has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it.  But the government says the law is necessary to protect the monarchy, which is widely revered in Thailand.  The TLHR has reported that at least 242 government critics have been charged for violating the lese majeste law during political protests since 2020.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5ld3MubmV0d29yay8xNS15ZWFyLW9sZC1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWluc3VsdGluZy10aGFpbGFuZHMtbW9uYXJjaHktcmVsZWFzZWQtYWZ0ZXItNTAtZGF5cy1pbi1kZXRlbnRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 21:12:35","By many measurements, democracy is in a troubling decline, even in many Western states. As the debate about economics becomes increasingly hijacked by nationalist sentiments, it is little surprise that “flawed” democracies and “Hybrid” regimes are becoming more commonplace.  In its approximate century of substantive existence, democracy has been an idea whose time seemed to have come. It has been a mechanism for mediating competing interests, helping form them as political parties playing by “the rules of the game,” while producing a largely equitable system for political organisation.  Yet, democracy is now in decline. There are fewer democracies, fewer people live in democracies, and most established democracies have veered towards more authoritarian responses. The world passed its democratic highwater mark in 2012. This decline may be permanent.  Just 24 countries are “full democracies,” with just eight percent of the world’s population. Including “flawed democracies,” that number increases to 72. Such “flawed democracies” includes the United States, Poland, South Africa, and Botswana. People in 95 countries live under “hybrid” or authoritarian regimes.  Democratic countries have also become less democratic, reflecting increasing levels of autocracy, political populism, the personalisation of political power, restrictions on free speech, and other forms of democratic “backsliding.” This trend began in 2006, with around three-quarters of all democratic countries undergoing degrees of democratic deterioration by 2021.  Such democracies have increasingly adopted authoritarian measures, often with popular support, and include Brazil, India, the US, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. Authoritarianism is deepening in non-democratic states and autocratisation has increased overall. The undermining of otherwise reliable election results that started in the US in 2020 has since spread to Brazil, Mexico, Myanmar (where it rationalised a military coup), and Peru, among others.  Following the Cold War, a number of former Soviet, Warsaw Pact, and client states began to democratise, sparking a type of liberal democratic triumphalism. Such hubris, though, has been caught out by the unsentimental march of events. Those events have impacted in three areas, on developing countries, rising developmentalist economies, and on established democracies.  Many developing countries that had begun to democratise in the post-Cold War period succumbed to underlying tensions, including ethnic competition, poor economic performance, and elite rivalries. This has led to the widespread failure of democratic consolidation.  Many middle-income countries have also decided that autocracy is at least as good a fit for producing economic growth as democracy, and not nearly as messy. That China has shown that economic development can occur without democracy has made that model more appealing.  The world’s democratic stalwarts have also tended to gravitate towards nationalist populist figures specialising in fear-mongering. As in the past, economic insecurity, manifested as a sense of betrayal, has been a key driver for this nationalist populist wave.  Such economic insecurity has been most sharply felt by less-educated Westerners whose once secure manufacturing jobs have been sent off-shore and where job security and even full-time work is, for many, a thing of the past. Added to this is a growing gap between rich and poor, and consequent resentment.  The post-war social contract that underpinned democratic consolidation, in which improving living standards were widely shared, has been lost to neo-liberalism’s fundamental economic reordering, accelerated by technological change. Perceptions of competition for scarce good jobs from “others” has consequently been more easily manipulated by unscrupulous politicians.  This manipulation has been reflected in the rise of “nationalism,” not of a civic pride in well-functioning institutions but an insular, exclusivist, and dumbed-down reaction to a changing world. Manipulation of this politics of resentment has resulted in the tearing up of the democratic “rules of the game,” noticeably in the US.  The rise of Europe’s Far Right also reflects the politics of insecurity. France has faced recent elections between the Centre Right – as saviour of democratic rules, supported by what used to be the Left – against the Far Right.  In Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland, the UK, and Russia, populist reaction against decline, insecurity, and nationalist assertion dominates and polarises political debate. The “rules” are, for many, regarded as an expression of older, vested interests. In some countries, such as Turkiye, Thailand, and the Philippines, such “rules” never had a firm grip.  Yet, the “rules of the game” are essential to a voluntary political order. Without agreement on these “rules,” there is conflict within and between groups of peoples. Without consistent “rules,” democracy fails.  Arguing against the “rules of the game” is usually undertaken through the impoverishment of political vocabulary in order to limit complex and critical reasoning. Complex questions are, thus, answered with simplistic or dishonest answers.  Reflecting this political diminution, rather than Left and Right, political divisions are now more evident between technocratic economic management regimes, regardless of party, and nationalist populism. And, as developmentalist autocracy has demonstrated, democracy is not necessary for economic well-being.  The question must now be asked whether a global technocratic future need also be a democratic one. Following that, if democracy does have an intrinsic value, the further question arises as to how, or whether, democracy’s future can be secured.

The motion, authored by state lawmaker Fábio Félix of the left-wing Socialism and Freedom Party (Psol), was approved in a 4-0 vote.  Mauro Cid served as Mr. Bolsonaro’s personal aide-de-camp, mostly running errands and arranging payments of the president and his family’s personal expenses. He was arrested by the Federal Police on May 3 on suspicion of defrauding Covid vaccine records.  The Federal Police investigation showed that Col. Cid’s cell phone, as well as a computer at the presidential palace, were used to create digital copies of a fraudulent Covid vaccination certificate in Mr. Bolsonaro’s name.  Col. Cid also tried and failed to recover jewelry gifted to the president by the Saudi government, valued at BRL 16 million (USD 3.3 million), which had been withheld by the Federal Revenue Service. He sent a military official to São Paulo’s international airport to retrieve the gifts in December 2022, during the final days of the Bolsonaro administration.  Mauro Cid was back in the news after the leak of audio messages he received from two military officers close to Mr. Bolsonaro, discussing a coup d’etat.  The Brasília select committee approved the request to question Col. Cid about the January 8 riots, as well as the December 12 attack on the Federal Police headquarters by pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators.  Separately, Col. Cid is scheduled to testify again to the Federal Police this afternoon about the Covid certificates case. This will be the third time he has testified this year. He was previously questioned in April about the Saudi jewelry case, and testified again on the day of his arrest on the Covid certificates case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYnJhemlsaWFuLnJlcG9ydC9saXZlYmxvZy9wb2xpdGljcy1pbnNpZGVyLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYnJhc2lsaWEtc3VicG9lbmEtYm9sc29uYXJvLWFpZGUv0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly9icmF6aWxpYW4ucmVwb3J0L2xpdmVibG9nL3BvbGl0aWNzLWluc2lkZXIvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9icmFzaWxpYS1zdWJwb2VuYXMtYm9sc29uYXJvLWFpZGUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The governor named a major road in Makurdi after the key actor in the botched 1990 coup.  Orkar was executed by firing squad after he was found guilty as charged by the military regime of former President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.  The insurrection led by the Benue-born soldier was crushed by troops loyal to Gen. Babangida.  The late Major hailed from Apir, Makurdi Local Government Area.  In broadcast aired on the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Okar exercised four northern states from Nigeria.  Orkar’s elder brother, Professor John Okar, who was at the inauguration of the road, said the same injustice his bother complained about in the coup broadcast 33 years ago still persists.  According to him, naming the road after the late Major would remind the federal government to address the injustice.  Prof Okar told The Nation in a chat that the family was happy with the immortalisation of their late brother by governor.

Hunter had previously declared for the 2023 NBA Draft but left to door open to returning to college. The decision is now official — Hunter is back for the Longhorns.  With the decision, Hunter will be viewed as a top player coming back for the 2023-2024 season. A huge get for head coach Rodney Terry as he heads into his first full campaign in Austin.  Hunter will be entering his second season with the Longhorns but third overall. He was brought into the program via Chris Beard, originally playing for Big 12 foe Iowa State. In what wound up being a huge coup for Texas, Hunter played a factor in a run to the Elite Eight under Terry.  In 38 games last season, Hunter averaged 10.3 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. Hunter wound up being Texas’ fourth-leading scorer, proving the depth available in Austin this past year.  Some roster turnover means Terry will need a bit more production from Hunter. A bigger role is in store for the third-year player but even after losing Marcus Carr, Hunter will still have a star guard to play alongside.  Tyrese Hunter, Max Abmas to play together in Texas backcourt  With Hunter’s return, he will be linking up with a new face in the Texas backcourt. Max Abmas has transferred in via Oral Roberts, filling a huge position of need for the Longhorns. He was just one of the few NCAA transfer portal wins Terry has been able to pull off this season.  Abmas spoke about potentially playing with Hunter with The Field of 68 after making his commitment official. He is willing to play both roles with Hunter, understanding there can be a key area of development by taking the ball out of his hands at times.  “I think we’ll both be able to play on the ball and off the ball,” Abmas said. “Playing at the next level, you’re going to be playing with other good guards too. I’ve been in offenses where I’ve played both on and off the ball.  “The last few years I’ve been really ball-dominant, always having the ball in my hand. But to be able to switch it up and play on and off the ball?

The spokesperson dismissed any official or unofficial connection between the arrestees and the Islamic Republic of Iran, stressing, “The popular relationships between the citizens of the two countries are heartfelt, emotional, historical, religious and even family-based. The government of the Republic of Azerbaijan should not attribute such deep-rooted and historical bonds of its nationals to security issues or associate them with neighbors.”  Kanaani noted that every government has the inherent right to take action against the law-breaking citizens, but made it clear that Baku’s move to arrest and imprison many citizens by making the allegation of connection with Iran is inadmissible and unacceptable.  The Azerbaijan Republic’s interior ministry, security service and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement on Tuesday that at least nine Azeri nationals have been arrested, suspected of being “linked to Iranian secret services and of plotting a coup and assassinations”.

"coup","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:26:21","In 100 days, college football will officially return. Rejoice!  But who are we kidding? Just because there have been no games since January, college football has become a 365-day sport. We’ve been discussing the 2023 season since Georgia blitzed TCU in the National Championship. We’ve previewed the best positional units in the country. Outlined our favorite coaches, and power ranked each conference.  And with the latest transfer portal coup by Florida State on Wednesday — FSU landed Michigan State standout receiver Keon Coleman — it’s time to officially settle college football’s 2023 Hype-Off Bowl.  Texas is back! vs. The Year of the Noles.  Which “buzzy, offseason team” — Texas or Florida State — is more likely to crash the College Football Playoff this fall after offseasons overflowing with optimism?  Both programs enter the summer with as much juice as any team not named Georgia or Michigan. Both the Longhorns and the Seminoles are favored to win their conferences, potentially ending separate streaks that have lasted far too long (14 years for UT, nine years for FSU). Both programs play SEC powerhouses early in the 2023 season. Both programs return 16 starters, have darkhorse Heisman Trophy contenders at quarterback and added key pieces from the transfer portal.  Texas doesn’t have the best roster in America, but the Longhorns are loaded after swiping Georgia wideout AD Mitchell and Arkansas safety Jalen Catalan to fill the few holes they had in their starting-22. All five starting offensive linemen are back, plus star playmakers on both sides of the football like wideout Xavier Worthy, tight end Ja’Tavion Sanders and linebacker Jaylan Ford.  And lest we forget, Quinn Ewers was considered a transcendent quarterback talent just two years ago.  Meanwhile, Coleman was just the latest transfer portal home run for Mike Norvell, who has supplemented FSU’s roster with impact transfers from South Carolina, Auburn, Virginia, Colorado, Penn State and Western Michigan.  The Seminoles ranked No. 1 in ESPN’s returning production, with quarterback Jordan Travis and standout pass rusher Jared Verse among the 87% of production back in 2023.  As for other preseason metrics, ESPN’s FPI loves Texas, slotting the Longhorns at No. 5 in the country, with a 54.4% chance to win the Big 12 and a whopping 34% — which is actually 4th-best nationally — to make the CFP.  Florida State is ranked 14th in FPI, with a 17% chance to win the ACC — considerably lower than Clemson’s 44.5% chance to win the league again. The Seminoles’ playoff odds are a meager 4.4%, too.  The computers have always loved Texas, even when the Longhorns were coughing up second-half leads a year ago, so those numbers are of note but not the end-all in the debate.  So which program is likely to live up to hype this fall — perhaps even exceeding expectations — and make the College Football Playoff? Which team can truly say it’s, “BACK!” come the end of the fall?  Chop on. I’m rolling with the ‘Noles.  WHY I HAVE FSU OVER TEXAS AS THE LIKELIER PLAYOFF PARTY CRASHER IN 2023  Maybe Texas doesn’t Texas this year, and actually avoids stepping on the rake and suffering debilitating self-inflicted losses. But history suggests a Steve Sarkisian-coached team is going to lose close games — and in what projects to be muddled Big 12, there could be plenty of gotcha games on the schedule.  Even if the Longhorns didn’t have a propensity to lose one-score games (4-10 in one-score games the last two seasons), they have a more difficult schedule this fall, with an early road trip at Alabama, and another seven projected bowl teams on the slate.  Florida State, which was 4-2 in one-score games in 2022, plays a neutral site game against LSU in Orlando, and while it must go on the road at Clemson, the rest of its schedule is cake in a down ACC (79th nationally, per Phil Steele) — especially when you add in the fact that rival Florida is expected to be so-so to bad in 2023, too.  Both teams have obvious areas for improvement defensively. Texas’ defense was solid last season, but the Longhorns were poor at forcing takeaways (14 total, second-fewest in the Big 12). FSU was really good defending the pass, but its rush defense left a lot to be desired.  As high as I am on Texas’ offensive potential, I think FSU’s latest transfer portal addition gives the Seminoles a legitimate chance to field a Top 5 offense in the country this year.  Last season, FSU led the ACC in scoring (36.1 points per game), yards per play (6.96), rushing offense (214 yards per game), rushing touchdowns (33), third downs (51%) and passing yards per attempt (8.9) — all numbers better than Texas.  Travis has made a leap every single season, and it would be no shocker if he threw for close to 3,500 yards and 30 touchdowns in 2023.  In 2022, FSU’s biggest bugaboo offensively was a lack of OL depth and too many drops from receivers. The OL has been significantly bolstered with multiple transfers and four starters back, and the pass-catching options — especially when you add in two talented tight end transfers — are infinitely better, too.  Coleman, a No. 1 receiver, joins Johnny Wilson, Kentron Poitier and a host of blue-chip freshmen to give FSU an explosive receiving core. Texas might have the best receiver room in America not residing in Columbus, Ohio, but thus far, Travis has proven better at getting his playmakers the football compared to Ewers.  The one wild card with FSU is QB depth, though. The ‘Noles are in big trouble if Travis is sidelined for any significant period of time, whereas Texas has Maalik Murphy and Arch Manning behind Ewers.  When it comes to coaching, I’m betting on Mike Norvell over Steve Sarkisian. I’ve repeatedly mentioned the “hasn’t won 10 games narrative” over and over because it’s pertinent. Whether at USC or Texas, Sarkisian has done less with more. Norvell certainly had his struggles out of the gate at FSU, but he’s methodically rebuilt that program from the studs, winning 10 games for the third time in his career last season. He also has a keen eye for coaching talent, forming an excellent staff during his days at Memphis (Dan Lanning, Kenny Dillingham, Ryan Silverfield) and building a strong set of assistants as FSU, led by future head coach Alex Atkins.  So in the 2023 Hype-Off Bowl, give me Florida State over Texas. If it’s going to be a wild year, it might as well be The Year of the Noles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vL25ld3MvMjAyMy1oeXBlLWJvd2wtaXMtdGV4YXMtb3ItZmxvcmlkYS1zdGF0ZS1tb3JlLWxpa2VseS10by1jcmFzaC10aGUtY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC1wbGF5b2ZmL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 15:20:02","LIMA (18 May 2023) – The Government of Peru must ensure those responsible for killing and injuring protestors during a recent wave of historic demonstrations in the country are brought to justice, a UN expert said today.  “Excessive and disproportionate use of force led to the killing and injury of protestors and bystanders during the protests that began in December 2022,” said Clément Nyaletsossi Voule, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful assembly and association in a statement at the end of a 10-day official visit to Peru.  Voule said accountability and political reform were key to overcoming the social and institutional crisis in Peru.  “To resolve the current crisis, the Government must address the victims of recent protests and recognise their suffering. It has an obligation to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations during the protests are effectively held to account,” the expert said.  “The State must guarantee access to justice, remedies, reparation and compensation to victims, including by bearing the cost of medical treatment for wounded persons,” he said.  Protests erupted across Peru after President Pedro Castillo was removed from office by Parliament in December 2022 for allegedly attempting a coup. Law enforcement responded with a crackdown on protestors and use of excessive and disproportionate force by law enforcement. Over 60 people were killed in clashes which also injured hundreds and led to the destruction of property. Protestors and bystanders, including children, women, indigenous people, and law enforcement officers were victims of the violence.  “The protests reflect a decline of trust in Peru’s existing democratic order and its institutions,” the UN expert said. “Indigenous and rural populations feel particularly excluded and unrepresented in Peru’s economic, social and political systems. They suffer the bulk of Peru’s exclusion and poverty, and claim they have been unable to benefit from years of democracy,” he said.  The expert urged the Government of Peru to uphold the human rights of all Peruvians by addressing historical root causes of the protests.  “Peru must recognise that the solution to this crisis lies in addressing profound social and economic injustices, and disparities affecting rural and indigenous communities,” Voule said. “This includes ensuring access to justice, education and health care services, and adopting political reforms to strengthen the rule of law, the separation of powers and create a more representative and participatory democracy.”  A broad and representative dialogue to discuss reform, including with protesting communities, will help to lower tensions in the country, the expert said.  Voule was alarmed by how structural racism and discrimination had affected the management of the protests.  “I deplore the way indigenous people protesting were stigmatised and treated. The Government must recognise that indigenous people suffered disproportionately during the violent repression of the protests,” he said.  The expert condemned the hostile rhetoric used against the protest movement, particularly the labelling of protestors as terrorists. “Given Peru’s violent history of terrorism, this accusation is dangerous and traumatic,” Voule said.  The UN expert said the Peruvian judiciary had upheld the rights of peaceful assembly and association in the past and recalled the State’s responsibility to protect these rights, including against criminalisation and stigmatisation.  “Today, more than ever, Peru’s judiciary must act independently to preserve the human rights to peaceful assembly and association,” he said.  “Victims rely on the judiciary to uphold human rights standards and protect their rights, and I urge authorities to guarantee due process to all those who have been charged or are being investigated,” Voule said.  The expert commended the work of victims’ associations and civil society and recommended strengthening the capacity and independence of the Ombudsman´s Office (Defensoría del Pueblo) which had played a key role in monitoring, ensuring legal support to victims and preventing further violence.  Voule thanked the Government of Peru for its willingness to facilitate his visit, and encouraged authorities to continue cooperation with the UN system.  A report on the Special Rapporteur’s visit to Peru will be presented to the Human Rights Council in June 2024.  ENDS  Mr. Clément Nyaletsossi Voule was appointed Special Rapporteur on the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association by the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2018.

"coup","2021-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 02:48:26","Myanmar: Arria-formula Meeting on the Humanitarian Situation  Tomorrow (19 May), the UK will convene an Arria-formula meeting on the humanitarian situation in Myanmar. A representative of OCHA and two female civil society representatives are expected to brief.  The meeting, which will begin at 10am and take place in the ECOSOC Chamber, will not be shown on UNTV. It appears that the UK decided not to broadcast the meeting. Council members, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, ASEAN dialogue partners, and countries bordering Myanmar have been invited to participate.  The UK has prepared a concept note for the meeting, which says that it aims to highlight the complex and worsening humanitarian situation in Myanmar. The concept note also says that the meeting will provide an opportunity to consider what the international community can do to address the humanitarian challenges in Myanmar and mitigate the associated risks to international peace and security, including by exploring how to further support ASEAN’s efforts to implement the Five-Point Consensus. (The Five-Point Consensus, which was adopted by ASEAN in April 2021, called for an immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue among all parties, the appointment of a special envoy of the ASEAN chair to facilitate mediation of the dialogue process, humanitarian assistance, and a visit to Myanmar by the ASEAN special envoy to meet all parties concerned.)  Three guiding questions for the meeting are outlined in the concept note:  Bearing in mind the ongoing conflict, how can the international community encourage urgent progress to address humanitarian challenges in Myanmar, including ensuring humanitarian assistance reaches all those in need? How can the international community best support efforts, including by ASEAN, to address humanitarian needs in Myanmar? How can the international community ensure that the voices of the Rohingya are heard and that their challenges are responded to, while also ensuring that any returns are voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable?  The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remains dire. According to OCHA, approximately 17.6 million people—nearly one third of Myanmar’s population—were in humanitarian need at the beginning of 2023. OCHA’s latest regular humanitarian update on Myanmar, which was published on 6 May, notes that ongoing hostilities across the country continue to endanger civilians and increase humanitarian needs, particularly in Kachin state and north-western and south-eastern Myanmar. The update further says that humanitarian access is complicated by “heightened military hostilities, administrative constraints, and interference in humanitarian activities”, which are “seriously impeding relief operations meant to assist people in need”.  The ongoing fighting in Myanmar—which has worsened in recent months and is particularly heavy in Kayah state, Kayin state, the Magway region, Sagaing region, and southern Shan state—has also led to mass displacement and contributed to increased refugee flows. In a 1 May emergency update, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that an estimated 1.83 million people were internally displaced in Myanmar as at 1 May, approximately 1.5 million of whom have been newly displaced since the 1 February 2021 coup. A further 1.12 million refugees and asylum seekers from Myanmar were reported as being present in neighbouring countries on 31 December 2022.  The humanitarian challenges facing Myanmar have been exacerbated by Cyclone Mocha, which made landfall in Rakhine state on 14 May, causing heavy rain, flooding, and wind gusts up to 250 kilometres per hour. According to a flash update released by OCHA on 16 May, early estimates indicate that approximately 5.4 million people across Rakhine state and north-western Myanmar were in the path of the cyclone, 3.2 million of whom are considered most vulnerable and likely to require humanitarian assistance, including healthcare, relief items, shelter, and clean water. Humanitarian actors have also reported encountering difficulties in obtaining access to affected areas. In a 17 May statement, OCHA Regional Public Officer Pierre Peron said that “bureaucratic access constraints are affecting all partners, including the UN and NGOs”.  In their statements tomorrow, Council members are likely to express concern regarding the humanitarian situation in Myanmar, emphasise the importance of unhindered humanitarian assistance, and urge the military authorities to facilitate humanitarian access to populations in need. Some members may highlight that the 2023 Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan, which requires $764.3 million in funding, is currently only 9.8 percent funded. Members may also call for the full implementation of resolution 2669 of 21 December 2022, which reiterated the need for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and scaled up humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, among other matters.  Several Council members are expected to focus on the situation of the Rohingya. According to media reports, a delegation of Myanmar military officials visited the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh in mid-March to interview Rohingya candidates for a pilot repatriation program to Myanmar. In a 31 March statement, Human Rights Watch warned that conditions in Myanmar are not conducive to the safe return of refugees and highlighted several concerns regarding the proposed repatriation program. During the meeting tomorrow, some Council members may stress that any return of refugees to Myanmar must be voluntary, safe, and dignified and carried out in accordance with international law.  Although tomorrow’s meeting will focus primarily on the humanitarian situation in Myanmar, Council members are nonetheless expected to refer to other topics, including ASEAN’s role in resolving the crisis in the country. During the latest ASEAN summit, which ran from 9 to 11 May, Indonesian President Joko Widodo reportedly acknowledged that “there has been no significant progress in the implementation of [ASEAN’s] Five-Point Consensus”. (Indonesia assumed ASEAN’s rotating chairmanship for 2023 in January and has established the Office of the ASEAN Special Envoy to Myanmar, which is headed by Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and staffed by a team of experts, including senior Indonesian diplomat Nguarah Swajaya. Previous ASEAN Chairs have appointed their foreign ministers as ASEAN’s Special Envoy to Myanmar.) Some Council members are likely to express their support for ASEAN and stress the importance of implementing the Five-Point Consensus. Some members may call for greater engagement and cooperation between ASEAN and the UN regarding the Five-Point Consensus, including more regular Council meetings on Myanmar.  The worsening violence in Myanmar is another likely topic of discussion. In a 6 March statement delivered to the Human Rights Council, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk noted that armed conflict in the country has continued to grow in scope and intensity. He added that military airstrikes against civilian locations and incidents in which homes and neighbourhoods were set on fire had also increased by 141 percent and 380 percent, respectively, in the second year following the coup. In this context, Council members may refer to the 11 April airstrike on Pazigyi village in Sagaing region, which killed at least 165 people and wounded dozens more. A draft press statement condemning the attack was blocked by China and Russia. (For more information, see our 12 April What’s in Blue story.)  The difficult negotiations on the draft press statement are indicative of the ongoing challenging dynamics on the file. China, which has resisted stronger action from the Council for many years, appears to be drawing closer to the military authorities. On 3 May, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the junta. According to media reports, Qin Gang told Min Aung Hlaing that China “stands with Myanmar on the international stage” and indicated that China would continue to support Myanmar’s development. Although China has often taken the lead in blocking Council action on Myanmar, Russia has become more active on the file and seems to be developing increasingly strong business and diplomatic links with the military authorities.  In recent years, some elected members have pushed for more attention to be paid to the situation in the country. The UK, the penholder on the file, which has for the last few years advocated for allowing ASEAN to take the lead on this issue, now appears inclined for the Council to take on a more proactive role.  ASEAN continues to be a key actor, with some ASEAN members apparently playing an instrumental role in persuading China to abstain on resolution 2669. Internal divisions within ASEAN have previously made it difficult for the organisation to take meaningful action on Myanmar. The recent election in Thailand, which saw the progressive Move Forward Party win the highest number of seats, may affect these divisions. (The previous Thai government was involved in organising several rounds of “track 1.5” dialogue between Myanmar military officials and Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, India, Japan, Laos, and Vietnam earlier this year and in late 2022.) While neither a direct neighbour nor a member of ASEAN, Japan has had historically close ties to Myanmar and strong diplomatic and economic links with ASEAN. It has also been involved in efforts to promote dialogue among the different parties. These dynamics are likely to make further Council action on Myanmar difficult.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5Y291bmNpbHJlcG9ydC5vcmcvd2hhdHNpbmJsdWUvMjAyMy8wNS9teWFubWFyLWFycmlhLWZvcm11bGEtbWVldGluZy1vbi10aGUtaHVtYW5pdGFyaWFuLXNpdHVhdGlvbi5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

One of the main areas of concern is the western Rakhine state, where hundreds of thousands of members of the mainly-Muslim Rohingya minority – not recognized by the authorities and persecuted by the army – have been living in particularly precarious settlements for internally displaced persons for years.  “Unrestricted access to affected communities is required to deliver immediate lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Junta restriction of traveling and access to effected areas is a barbaric act,” the self-proclaimed Government of National Unity (NUG), opposed to the military regime that seized power in a coup on Feb. 1, 2021, said on social media.  The regional spokesperson of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Pierre Peron, confirmed to EFE that the authorities continued to maintain restrictions on the entry of international aid on Thursday.  There are “scenes of widespread devastation” in Sittwe and other cities in western Myanmar, where the cyclone made landfall on Sunday, the UN agency said in its latest update.  UN agencies are “ready to start coordinated field missions to gauge the full scope of the humanitarian situation, as soon as access is granted,” it added.  Nonprofit Doctors Without Borders (MSF) told EFE that although geographical and security difficulties already existed before the cyclone, access to the camps for displaced people has worsened after the natural disaster.  “We really need urgent attention on easing access to the affected population,” said the MSF spokesperson, who expressed concern about the lack of drinking water and the health situation after the disaster.  Meanwhile, the US Embassy in Myanmar announced funds for emergency relief activities.  “It is critical that humanitarian organizations be able to access and serve those communities most in need,” it said in a statement on Twitter.  Cyclone Mocha made landfall on Sunday between the southern coast of Bangladesh and the west of neighboring Myanmar, with sustained winds of more than 150 kilometers per hour.  According to UN’s estimates, some 5.4 million people were in the path of Mocha, the biggest storm to hit the Bay of Bengal in more than a decade.  Preliminary data, and in the absence of verification by the opposition NUG, indicates that the cyclone may have left at least 455 people dead, 431 of them in Rakhine.  The military junta said that army ships and helicopters had transported aid to Rakhine and that security forces were engaged in rescue efforts.  It also put the death toll from the catastrophe at 48.

The results, in two words: very bad. After a decade of a consistent trend of improvement, from 2001 to 2011, came a decade of deterioration. The average grade went from 541 to 530 in 2011-2016, and dropped to 510 in 2021.  The biggest plunge came among Hebrew speakers from a strong socioeconomic background, the future generation of the Israeli elite. Their parents are surely educated and they themselves are no doubt programmers already from first grade. But a basic reading comprehension test is beyond their ability.  No, really, the test is so simple it’s embarrassing to quote from it. In the 2016 exam, which is most likely similar to the questions in the last exam, the text is almost entirely punctuated with vowels – for children who should be at least in their fourth year of reading. In the story “The Green Sea Turtles,” students were asked “what are the various sections about,” based on their subtitles, which were, among others, “Coming out of the sand,” “In the open sea” and “The next generation.” How can any child who isn’t cognitively limited make a mistake in answering such a question?  Had the Defense Ministry, whose budget is second only to the Education Ministry’s, presented similar failures, heads would roll. For some reason, when it’s about reading comprehension – such a basic tool for life in the post-medieval world – it seems OK. Another report to be buried at the end of the news edition after the reports about the regime coup and looting the state budget and another promotion for some nonsensical reality show.  One can discuss extensively the reasons for the embarrassing results achieved by the children of the “people of the book,” and Covid will likely star in the post mortem for these results, if any is given. A more central reason is technology’s aggressive entry into their lives (which Covid may have accelerated, but isn’t the sole cause of), yet the ministry, whose gigantic budget is wasted on God knows what, won’t save them. The responsibility is on you, the parents. When was the last time any of your children saw you hold an open book in your hand? And the key to fix this is also in your hands.  Don’t expect the education system to educate your children. A system headed by a man who rewrites the Holocaust for political interests can’t really raise the future generation here and give it the minimum tools for life. Even RAMA‘s own presentation of the students’ results in Hebrew-language knowledge consisted of grammar mistakes. You can’t expect anything from these people.  Homeschooling is still not as common in Israel as in other places, and it’s hard to do in families with working parents. But only a clear statement – for example, don’t send your children to school – may succeed in exerting pressure on the system to improve. If not, this caring public can at least save its own children. The others will have to rely on Arye Dery’s food coupons.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMtMDUtMTkvdHktYXJ0aWNsZS1vcGluaW9uLy5wcmVtaXVtL2lzcmFlbHMtY2hpbGRyZW4tYXJlLWJldHRlci1vZmYtYXQtaG9tZS10aGFuLWluLXNjaG9vbC8wMDAwMDE4OC0zMDEyLWQ4MDUtYTdjOS1mOWRiY2IyNTAwMDDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advertising Read more  The small nation of 2.6 million people, nestled between EU neighbour Romania and war-ravaged Ukraine, will on June 1 hold its first major summit of wider Europe.  That gathering of the European Political Community -- a forum created last year that brings together leaders of all 27 EU countries with 20 neighbours of the bloc -- will be an occasion for Moldova to burnish its candidate credentials.  For Sandu, EU membership is the only guarantee against becoming Russia's next target.  Her country, a former Soviet republic, already has a breakaway region, Transnistria, where Russia has stationed a small number of troops.  ""Of course, nothing compares to what is happening in Ukraine, but we see the risks and we do believe that we can save our democracy only as part of the EU,"" she said.  ""We do believe that Russia will continue to be a big source of instability for the years to come and we need to protect ourselves,"" added Sandu, on the sidelines of a Council of Europe of summit in Iceland that wrapped up on Tuesday.  The 50-year-old leader, in office since 2020, in February accused Russia of fomenting a coup to try to seize power in Moldova.  She has called for Moldovans -- who polls show are overwhelmingly behind joining the European Union -- to hold a pro-EU rally on Sunday.  ""The Ukraine war made things black and white. So it's very clear what the free world means, and what the authoritarian world means, for all of us,"" she said.  'Realistic project'  Russia's war next door suddenly firmed up the prospect of EU membership for Ukraine and Moldova.  Both countries applied last year to join the bloc and in June 2022 became candidate countries, along with Georgia.  ""We do believe that this is a realistic project for us and we are looking forward to see this happening as soon as possible,"" Sandu said.  Membership, however, could take a decade or more to attain, given the long list of requirements candidate countries must meet to be able to sit alongside the other nations in the European single market.  Unlike Ukraine, Moldova is small enough to be able to be integrated into the European Union relatively easily.  But it faces several challenges to bring its democratic standards up to EU levels, notably in terms of fighting corruption.  Its fragile economy, energy security and the issue of Transnistria, with its 30,000 pro-Russian population, all need to be addressed as well.  Transnistria, in the east of Moldova, is not recognised by the international community. The zone sprang up in 1990 after a brief civil war that erupted when the Soviet Union collapsed, and ended up from 1992 as a frozen conflict.  ""We are struggling to have peaceful resolution of the conflict, and we've been calling on Russia to withdraw its illegally stationed troops,"" Sandu said.  ""We need a geopolitical opportunity to be able to solve the conflict.""  The president, who has started the process of taking her country out of the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, added: ""What kind of relations can you have with a regime which kills innocent people in the neighbouring country?""  Moldova was ready to cooperate only with ""democratic countries, with countries which respect the territorial integrity of other countries, which respect the international rules based system,"" she said.  Russia brandished Ukraine's desire to one day join NATO as one of its justifications for invading its neighbour.  For Moldova, that is not a door on which it is about to knock.  Moldova was not rethinking its stance of being a neutral country for now, Sandu said.  ""But there are discussions in our society about whether neutrality protects us and if at some point people will change their view, of course we will reconsider this decision. In the meantime, we are trying to consolidate the defence sector of Moldova and we are counting on our friends.""  For ""friends"" Moldova is leaning heavily on the other participating countries of the European Political Community.  The June 1 summit in Chisnau, Sandu said, ""is important because we see that we are not alone, that we have many friends"".  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTgtbW9sZG92YS1mZWFyaW5nLXJ1c3NpYS13YW50cy10by1qb2luLWV1LWFzLXNvb24tYXMtcG9zc2libGXSAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC5mcmFuY2UyNC5jb20vZW4vbGl2ZS1uZXdzLzIwMjMwNTE4LW1vbGRvdmEtZmVhcmluZy1ydXNzaWEtd2FudHMtdG8tam9pbi1ldS1hcy1zb29uLWFzLXBvc3NpYmxl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Opposition leader made this appeal to the unions during the party’s ‘Hope’ rally on Saturday, May 13 in Georgetown.  The Prime Minister recalled that at the NDP rally, Dr Friday called on civil servants, teachers and the police “to join the NDP to bring down what he called a wicked government.”  Providing a lesson on words and their meanings, Gonsalves said “Bring down means overthrow you know.”  The prime minister however expressed confidence that “the civil servants and the teachers and the police overwhelmingly, they know that this is a government which has worked for them and with them.”  The Prime Minister is of the view that Friday’s recent statements “tell you of the desperation of the NDP.”  “They have moved from lawfare to warfare,” Gonsalves said as he recounted some of the actions of the NDP following the 2015 General Elections in St  Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG).  He reminded the listeners that the party once said no justice no peace.  “The opposite of peace is war,” Gonsalves pointed out.  He charged that Friday was fully articulating warfare on the platform, when he called on the unions to join with his party to bring down the government.  He said the NDP wants to bring down the government at a time when the country is rising amidst many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic.  “At a time when we have more economic activities taking place in St Vincent and the Grenadines.”  He pointed out that “There is no mason, carpenter, tile man, electrician, plumber and general construction worker, who wants work and can’t get work”.  Gonsalves also spoke about the “massive construction boom” which will take place over the next several years and additional employment being provided through expansion in the hotel sector.  The Prime Minister also alerted citizens that “it is not the business of the police force to bring down the government.”  The next general elections in St Vincent and the Grenadines will be constitutionally due in 2025.

A veteran Wall Street executive told CNBC that he has been helping bankroll Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine group and has become an informal advisor to the organization.  Mark Gorton, founder and chairman of high-frequency trading firm Tower Research Capital, said he has given $1 million to the anti-vaccine nonprofit organization called Children's Health Defense since 2021.  Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic and a son of late senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, founded Children's Health Defense. The younger Kennedy was also chairman of the group's board before he launched his run for president as a Democrat in April.  While President Joe Biden is the clear favorite to win the 2024 Democratic nomination, Kennedy has drawn a surprising amount of support, with a recent Fox News survey showing that 19% of the Democratic primary voters surveyed would back him in the primary.  Polls also show that Kennedy's rise in influence coincides with an increase in skepticism about vaccines, despite scientific evidence that the shots are safe. Kennedy has attracted support from some longtime political players, including former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who is running the campaign. Michael Flynn, former President Donald Trump's national security advisor, was reportedly pictured with Kennedy in 2021, according to ABC News.  During an almost 90-minute interview at Cafe Fiorello in New York, Gorton said he is cheering on Kennedy's campaign for president and has repeatedly met with him since he donated to Children's Health Defense.  ""I like him a lot. He's a super smart guy. Again, he's not really a politician. He's a corruption fighter,"" Gorton said, adding that he has Kennedy's cell phone number.  Asked about Gorton's donation, a spokeswoman for the Children's Health Defense said in an email, ""CHD's donor information is confidential and only communicated to the IRS in compliance with their rules/regulations.""  A Kennedy campaign spokesperson did not return requests for comment before publication.  The Associated Press reported that Children's Health Defense played a key role in pushing back on Covid vaccines and helped elevate Kennedy's profile. The nonprofit's most recent publicly available tax documents show that it raised just over $6 million in 2020, the year the Covid pandemic started, more than double what it raised a year earlier.  The organization sent CNBC its tax documents from 2021, which show the group raised just over $15 million that year. It went into 2022 with over $11 million in assets. The documents don't name the group's donors.  Beyond his donation, Gorton said he's been talking to the nonprofit's staff through Zoom calls, and advising the group on its messaging strategy. ""I basically have been working with them to try and develop a strategy to go after the core of the beast which is the pharmaceutical industry,"" he said.  Federal Election Commission records show that Gorton donated $500,000 last year to a super PAC that was then called the People Pharma's Movement and run by other Kennedy allies. That PAC rebranded as American Values 2024 and has spent over $200,000 in print ads backing Kennedy's candidacy, according to FEC records.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJmay1qci1hbnRpLXZhY2NpbmUtZ3JvdXAuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1yZmstanItYW50aS12YWNjaW5lLWdyb3VwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","1980-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:36:46","Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has led Turkey for two decades, first as Prime Minister, then as President, and who has steered the country in an increasingly authoritarian direction, came out ahead, again, in last Sunday’s election, but not by enough to avoid a runoff. Erdoğan, despite trailing in polls, captured 49.5 per cent of the vote, and saw his Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.) win a parliamentary majority; on May 28th, he will face Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the candidate representing a coalition of six opposition parties, who got just under forty-five per cent of Sunday’s vote. Even though the opposition—which includes a range of groups, from Turkish nationalists to the repressed Kurdish community—came closer to defeating Erdoğan than ever before, his ability to maintain a lead in the first round was remarkable, especially considering that he has presided over major economic troubles and a botched response to a catastrophic earthquake earlier this year. (A third candidate, the far-right politician Sinan Oğan, won five per cent of the vote; his support is expected to largely flow to Erdoğan.)  To talk about the results from this first round, I called Kaya Genç, a novelist and essayist from Istanbul. He is the author of the book “The Lion and the Nightingale,” about post-coup Turkey. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how Erdoğan was able to win over voters affected by the earthquake, differing ideas of Turkish nationalism, and what the election results tell us about the state of Turkish society.  Why was Erdoğan able to exceed expectations in the first round, even if it’s the closest election he’s yet faced?  First of all, we have to talk about the control his regime has established over Turkish public life. We don’t just talk about his government. We don’t just talk about his party. We talk about his regime, which has control over the judiciary, over the military, and, crucially, over the media. If you were in Istanbul in the same room with me, and if we turned on the news, we would see pro-Erdoğan propaganda around the clock. That is the autocratic explanation for the votes. But then there is a historical explanation, which is a bit more complex.  It has to do with historical trauma. What did Erdoğan indicate to his voters? That he was their savior, that he was their falcon—and that he was getting old. All the pictures of him and the campaign were of an elderly man looking very melancholy through the eyes: “I’m an old sultan and I want your loyalty, because it is only I who can protect you from our enemies and who can continue the Ottoman tradition that we hold so dear.” But what was the trauma that brought so many of his supporters together?  Historically, it is the trauma of the C.H.P., the Republican People’s Party, whose leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, was defeated in the first round. According to Erdoğan and his followers, the C.H.P. caused them trauma, exactly a century ago, by establishing a republic and by stopping an Islamic way of life. We thought that the historical trauma that has always brought Erdoğan’s followers together would pale in this era of economic collapse because this is the worst period of Erdoğan’s decades-long reign both economically and politically.  After the February 6th earthquakes, we thought the whole façade of the strongman had collapsed. Now people would be able to see through him, that the sultan was not strong, that it’s all rhetoric. But, in a very unnerving outcome, of the ten provinces hit most by the earthquake, seven voted predominantly for Erdoğan. And this leaves us with a hard question: Why did people who were most violently influenced by the outcome of this lethal earthquake vote for the sultan?  Turkey is a country with very stark regional differences in culture, religion, and voting. So was it just where the earthquake hit, or does it go beyond that?  The earthquakes had the opposite effect of what we expected. Erdoğan went to the cities and promised to rebuild people’s houses. He said that the calamity was part of fate’s plan. He maybe said a few words of apology, but in an undertone. And then he said, essentially, “Life goes on. You survived. Sorry for your losses. Now we will build new houses for you in one year. We’ll give you credit. Of course, you’ll have to pay it back because there are no free lunches.”  Then Kılıçdaroğlu, the opposition candidate, went to the same cities, and said, “This is unacceptable. The government was responsible for this. There were no checks on the regulations for two decades. You have to fight for your rights, and we will build those houses for you for free. You won’t pay because this will be our responsibility.”  The reaction was that someone promising to give you something for free is lying. They are romantics. They’re not to be trusted. In this capitalist world of ours, nothing is free. So we will trust the man who wants to build the houses for us with our money. This response has shocked many leftists, like me, who were expecting a different public reaction.  And how do you understand it?  There is an unnerving confluence of religion and capitalism in Turkey. Maybe only literature can explain it to us. And it is a kind of strength in the face of adversity, but a form of strength that strikes us as irrational and difficult to decipher. So, in Turkey, in the seventies, there were strong leftist movements, strong Marxist movements, which captured the imagination of the working class. And those revolutionary movements were crushed by the military coup in 1980, after which a nationalist religious identity for Turkey emerged, imposed by the military. A kind of identity that took its inspiration from Republican America, a “we believe in God, we believe in capitalism” kind of identity.  That became attractive here. And, as the left lost its power, as the leftists were imprisoned or tortured, the Islamists took their place. They established these very close connections with members of the working classes, with the impoverished, with the outcast. They said, “We will help you in the name of Allah. We will form partnerships with other Muslims around the world, in Qatar, in Saudi Arabia. Muslims have money. We will bring together your wallets and their coffers.” The A.K.P. won the heart of the working class. And, with that power, Erdoğan claimed that the C.H.P. was the party of the bourgeoisie, of the Westernizers, of those who frown upon the working class. Sadly, this was an argument that triumphed on Sunday.  The C.H.P. may be leading the opposition, but it is one party in an ideologically diverse coalition uniting to take on Erdoğan. A lot of people who study autocracy and authoritarianism suggest that such coalition-building is the way to take on autocratic forces. What do you think of the opposition’s campaign and how they’ve tried to appeal to Turkish voters?  Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the opposition’s leader, is an Alevi, which is a heterodox Islamic sect that combines elements of Sunni and Shia Islam. It’s part of a religious minority in Turkey. He’s also a minority in the group of politicians in the sense that he’s mild-spoken, he is very civilized, he never raises his voice. He’s a good man and a good strategist. He brought together the former wingmen of Erdoğan: the former economy czar, Ali Babacan, to lead the DEVA party; and his former Prime Minister and foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, to lead another party.  When people accuse him of moving the C.H.P. to the right in order to form this coalition, he said, “Well, the left and the right are eighteenth-century concepts—they’re concepts from the French Revolution. These concepts don’t apply anymore.” He decided to adjust, to form a coalition of Democrats. And much to our delight—much to my delight, let’s say—he announced his support for L.G.B.T.Q. communities, and he announced his support for progressive Kurds, which allowed him to win their vote on Sunday.  But let’s go back to the moment before he was announced as a candidate. Behind closed doors, the nationalist members of the opposition coalition said, “This man is unelectable as a President. We need someone who’s a Sunni like Erdoğan. We need someone who speaks in a loud voice, who is aggressive, who’s basically a Turkish nationalist instead of a Turkish social democrat. We need someone who bangs on the table in order to win. Erdoğan will eat this man alive.” And, for four days in early March, there was a big discussion in the opposition circles and on social media about this topic. And this discussion, I think, led to the diminishment of enthusiasm in the nationalist factions of the opposition.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbmV3cy9xLWFuZC1hL3doeS1lcmRvZ2FuLXByZXZhaWxlZC1pbi1hLWJhdHRsZS1vZi1jb21wZXRpbmctdHVya2lzaC1uYXRpb25hbGlzbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-01","22:00:00","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:13:49","As I’m writing these words, Bryson DeChambeau is the clubhouse leader at the PGA Championship after his first round at Oak Hill.  There’s a thematic similarity here to what we saw at the Masters when Brooks Koepka, who looked downtrodden and resigned for a very long time, re-emerged as a major threat and nearly won the green jacket. Other LIV players, like Phil Mickelson, also made serious runs at Augusta, and early this week the top of the leader board includes names like Thomas Pieters and Dustin Johnson.  This is no surprise—some very good players went to LIV, and it’s not like simply moving to a different tour makes them any less talented. But we’re still living in the hot phase of the PGA Tour vs. LIV Golf war, and because they only meet at majors now, it’s incredibly tempting not just to frame golf’s four biggest events as a tour-on-tour melee, but to speculate about possible results and what it would all mean. Wouldn’t it be a serious coup if a player from LIV won a major? Wouldn’t it give a new level of credibility to the breakaway tour, and drive more audience and attention and money and esteem? Wouldn’t it level the playing field in a fight that the PGA Tour seems to be winning fairly comfortably?  In Australia, LIV is thriving. It’s on the 7 Plus stream of the 7 Network and its LIV Adelaide event was sold out and deemed a huge success. Australians seem to love LIV, and the PGA Tour, and the DP World Tour, and wherever Australia’s male stars are plying their trade.  But in the US, where the divide is a sore subject at times, putting the debate on these terms — the impact would a LIV player winning a major — might be ignoring a hard reality, which is that less than a year into golf’s great schism, the situation may have hardened into something essentially unchangeabe. A period of stasis that nothing, even a LIV major, can shake.  After a few weeks of low and declining ratings among US viewers, reports indicate that LIV has stopped releasing viewership data. Whatever their reasons it doesn’t seem like a great sign. LIV got off to a sparkling start, signed a lot of good players, came up with an interesting new format and even spawned plenty of reactive changes on the PGA Tour … but the numbers never came.  The question is, what could change that? A lot of people want to believe the answer is top finishes in a major, but increasingly that feels like small-scale thinking. LIV golfers performed admirably at the Masters, doing everything but winning a green jacket, but it didn’t change anything for their actual tour. Many viewers came away impressed with the players, but clearly not many felt the urge to actually watch LIV Golf in the aftermath. Would that have been any different if Koepka had won? Maybe for a very brief moment, but the far more likely scenario is that after a minor blip at the next LIV event, things would have settled into the exact same status quo. The reasons aren’t complicated—the PGA Tour is more familiar and more established, there aren’t many slices of pie when it comes to non-major golf in the first place, and for all the panic at the start of the LIV defections, the Tour flexed enough muscle and changed quickly enough to limit the damage and maintain the upper hand. (A predictable result, since it’s ultimately easier to keep power than to seize it.)  It’s too early to say that LIV’s moment has come and gone, even if the project feels a little bit at sea, kept afloat by a war chest of money. There are potential game changers that could appear in this script; signing a new batch of elite players at the end of the 2023 season is the most obvious that comes to mind. But it feels like we’re past the point when Brooks Koepka or Bryson DeChambeau winning a major championship while flying the LIV flag will have any material effect on the desire, at least of American viewers, in particular to tune in to the latest LIV event. It would be a PR victory, but not a practical one. What we’d be left with is a result that’s not particularly surprising—we all know Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka and a handful of others can win a major—and which doesn’t have a long tail.  The losing side in any war can still win battles, but there is a larger momentum—perhaps “inertia” is a better word—that’s harder to reverse. If LIV supporters believe that a victory for one of their own would be a kind of coup, they may be disappointed to find that upon breaking down the palace doors, the throne room is empty and the conquest is immaterial. Simply wanting a triumph to be tangible beyond the individual isn’t enough, and though you can bet the victory would be shouted from the rooftops, even shouts disappear into the greater silence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS5hdS9wZ2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLTIwMjMtYS1saXYtZ29sZmVyLXdpbm5pbmctYS1tYWpvci13b3VsZC1tZWFuLXdlbGwtd2hhdC1leGFjdGx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2020-09-05","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:01:58","Smiles all round: G7 leaders meet at a Nato summit in 2022 © Henry Nicholls/Getty Images  Towards the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis in 2009, the Group of Seven appeared dead as an economic and political bloc. Representing only 35 per cent of the global economy, the then IMF head joked it was the “late G7”.  The plan was for France to perform the coup de grâce when it chaired the G7 and G20 in 2011. From that point on, the G20 would be the “premier forum for international economic co-operation” and decisions of global importance would no longer be taken by a small and unrepresentative club of just seven industrial countries.  The plan never materialised. Through the 2010s, G7 finance ministers of the US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy and Canada met regularly with little consequence. National leaders met at a G8 level until 2014, when Russia was expelled for its annexation of Crimea, part of Ukraine’s sovereign territory. When Donald Trump was US president, the summits were occasionally spectacular failures.  In 2018, he left early, refused to sign up to a communique praising the “rules-based” system of global trade and called the host, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, “dishonest and weak”.  The G7 meeting in 2018 ended in acrimony © Jesco Denzel/Bundesregierung/Getty Images  But the 2020s have been different. President Joe Biden’s administration has taken a shine to the G7 — not as the forum to thrash out global solutions, given it now represents only 30 per cent of global GDP — but as a body of like-minded advanced economies that are able to agree a united front. And this reappraisal has come at a time when the G20’s relevance in economic affairs has dwindled, with the body, including China, Russia and the US, unable to agree on much of substance.  Professor Eswar Prasad at Cornell University says: “In a rapidly fragmenting geopolitical order, the G7 represents a largely unified but now far from dominant block of countries with similar economic and political values”.  “Ironically, the dysfunctionality of the G20 and the open rancour among its members have led to the G7 regaining some of its relevance.”  The first indication of the renewed relevance of the G7 came early in the Biden presidency when his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, decided to cede some ground in some parts of international tax negotiations in order to achieve a US prize of a global minimum corporate tax rate.  She came to London to a G7 finance ministers’ meeting in June 2021 with a proposal to stop a race to the bottom of global corporate tax rates alongside a radical move to allow all countries to collect some tax from foreign multinationals doing business in their countries. Securing what all sides said was a “historic agreement”, the G7’s actions proved to be the catalyst for a later global agreement among 136 countries.  In 2022, the G7 cemented its newfound relevance for western nations by acting as the forum to calibrate and set sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.  By September, the bloc had agreed a price cap on Russian oil — aiming to allow the oil to flow and to keep global prices down, while depriving Moscow of significant revenues from fuel.  This was imposed in December last year at a price of $60 a barrel with subsequent caps on petrol, diesel and other fuel oils effective from February this year. In an assessment of the sanctions, Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says that the G7’s actions, seeking to limit flows of money to Russia from oil exports, were “a smart thing to do” although there were huge incentives for Russia and shipping companies to seek to circumvent the price cap.  Noting the lack of officials or procedures to enforce the cap, Ribakova adds, “it’s novel, but the G7 is trying to implement economic statecraft without an institutional set-up,” suggesting the cap was likely to get increasingly leaky. Those concerns, however, did not invalidate the overall effect of the G7 and EU’s sanctions, she says. Other measures and sanctions would intensify the squeeze on Moscow’s finances: “Russia’s economic challenges will only worsen as the war continues with no end in sight”.  John Kirton, director of the G7 research group at Toronto university, says these actions and others showed that the G7 was able to produce robust conclusions to summits that were useful for the world at a time when “the G20 is missing in action”.  “This year, what we’ve seen so far, empirically, is that the G7 is on the road back to life on everything — on macroeconomics, security, Russia’s war in Ukraine and energy,” Kirton says, adding that his group’s research showed that member states generally implemented and complied with agreements struck at G7 summits.  The Hiroshima summit will take the G7 into a further new area for 2023, though. In finance ministers’ meetings so far this year, the ministers have focused on building economic resilience and security, trying to define a world of “de-risking” from China — reducing dependencies on critical elements of supply chains, rather than “decoupling” and casting the country into the economic wilderness.  The finance ministers concluded in April that, “in this endeavour, we will stand firm to protect our shared values, while preserving economic efficiency by upholding the free, fair and rules-based multilateral system and international co-operation”. That will be a considerable challenge in 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM0N2FiNzA5LTFhNjgtNDRhNS1hYmEzLTA0ODI5M2UzZDFlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2018-07-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:41:08","Thailand’s Election Commission is weighing a last-minute legal challenge to the pro-democracy front-runner in the country’s race for prime minister in a case that could derail the political career of one of the military-backed government’s fiercest critics.  The complaint against Move Forward Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat bears strong echoes of the case that brought down another rising star of Thailand’s gaining pro-democracy movement four years ago and set the stage for a wave of anti-government protests.  In both cases “it’s the same legal provision,” said Jade Donavanik, president of the law faculty at Thailand’s College of Asian Scholars.  That provision bars candidates for public office from holding shares in a mass media company. Days before Sunday's vote to fill Thailand’s House of Representatives, a candidate for the ruling, pro-military Palang Pracharath party filed a case with the commission accusing Pita of holding shares in the inactive broadcaster iTV and of failing to disclose them among his assets.  Pita’s party had been surging in opinion polls heading into Sunday’s vote on a wave of mounting frustration with the government of Prayut Chan-o-cha, an ex-army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup. Move Forward vowed to end military conscription, slash the defense budget and curb royal defamation laws that were landing hundreds of government critics in court or jail. Come election day, it won 152 of the 500 House seats up for grabs, the most of any party.  Joint vote  And while Pita himself has topped opinion polls of whom the public wants for prime minister, the post will be filled, per Thai law, by an upcoming joint vote of the House and military-appointed Senate, which holds another 250 seats. Negotiations are ongoing among the parties that won seats in the House for a coalition that could win that vote.  A decision by the Election Commission against Pita, and a subsequent conviction by the Constitutional Court, would force him out of parliament and out of the running.  Move Forward declined VOA’s request for comment on the complaint, though Pita has previously denied wrongdoing. According to local media reports, he says he inherited the shares when his father died in 2006 and had tried but failed to find a buyer. He also denied failing to declare the shares.  Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a legal scholar at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University, says the case seems to have little legal merit.  He says the fact that iTV has been off the air for years renders moot the law’s intended aim of denying candidates undue influence over public opinion, and that Pita’s holdings, less than 1% of the company’s total shares, fall well short of a controlling stake. Transferring inherited shares in a company going through a legal dispute, he added, as iTV still is, was also “almost impossible” in practice.  Still, Khemthong says the case does hold risk for Pita.  “In a normal circumstance I would say it’s low, but given Thailand’s context I would say moderate,” he said.  “Unfortunately, the [Constitutional] Court and the Election Commission have already lost their credibility so much in Thai society,” he added. “People [have] suspected for years, maybe over a decade, that the court has been compromised, has been politicized and become just a tool for the establishment faction to suppress the masses. And unfortunately, both the Election Commission and the Constitutional Court played into that narrative.”  Khemthong pointed to the case of former lawmaker and Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit as a prime example.  Future Forward had come out of virtually nowhere to score a surprise third-place finish in Thailand’s 2019 elections. Like its successor, Move Forward, it was the loudest and sharpest voice in parliament demanding checks on the political sway of the country’s powerful military and monarchy. As the party’s charismatic young leader, Thanathorn was the beacon of a new generation of voters tired of the status quo.  That November, following a probe by the Election Commission, the Constitutional Court convicted Thanathorn of holding shares in a media company, V-Luck. Though Thanathorn claimed to have transferred the shares to his mother before registering as a candidate, the court said he had failed to offload them in time and stripped him of his seat in the House.  Protests grew  Public protests soon followed, and they swelled the next year as the court prosecuted, and ultimately dissolved, Future Forward itself over an illegal campaign loan, banning Thanathorn and other party leaders from politics for the next decade. It was the third pro-democracy party the court had dissolved in the past 12 years.  The complaint against Pita could potentially ensnare Move Forward as well. It asks the Election Commission to consider whether all the party’s candidates for Sunday’s poll were even eligible to run, given that Pita was the one who, as party leader, legally certified them.  Jade, of the College of Asian Scholars, said the broader case against Move Forward seems weak, and would hinge on whether Pita knew he was unqualified to endorse the candidates, which he added, seemed a stretch.  But he believes the case against Pita himself is more complicated. Pita does seem to be holding the shares in some capacity, Jade said, but whether he was holding them all nominally for his father’s heirs or some for himself could make a difference.  “No one can raise this issue if there is no fact and there is no reality that they really hold on to the shares. If someone raised this issue and the EC said, ‘I don’t care about it,’ then the EC would be under [suspicion] themselves, so they have to do it,” he said, meaning investigate the claims.  That the timing of the case could work in the government’s favor by knocking Pita out of the race for prime minister, Jade added, does not mean it has no merit.  “When the time comes, and when it’s an advantageous step for them, then they can do it. Yes, of course I would also say that it’s quite political, but it’s also legal. They use the legal provision at a time that is politically advantageous for them,” he said.  The Election Commission did not reply to VOA’s request for comment. According to local media, commission Chair Ittiporn Boonpracong told reporters Monday that the claims against Pita had been investigated. He did not say whether the commission had reached a decision, or whether the case would be sent on to the Constitutional Court.  Khemthong believes Move Forward’s election success actually could work in its favor.  If prosecuting Thanathorn and Future Forward while in opposition could set off more than a year of unrest that drew tens of thousands of angry protesters to the streets, he said, any ruling to block Pita or Move Forward while on the cusp of seizing power could do even more.  “The clash, the tension would be much worse. I think that factors ... in the court’s calculation,” he said. “After this election it becomes very clear that the party is hugely popular and to do anything to tamper with the party or its leader has consequence.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvdGhhaS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtZmFjZXMtZGlzcXVhbGlmaWNhdGlvbi1iaWQvNzA5OTMzNC5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3RoYWktcG0tY2FuZGlkYXRlLWZhY2VzLWRpc3F1YWxpZmljYXRpb24tYmlkLzcwOTkzMzQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-04-15","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:05:59","Upper Arlington resident Siema Eljack’s 85-year-old father is trapped in Khartoum.  Eljack, 47, a mental health therapist, told The Dispatch that her father, a university professor, is stuck at home in the Sudanese capital, which has seen fierce fighting since a civil war broke out about a month ago between the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. He takes various medications and has enough medicine for two months, but Eljack worries what will happen after that time has lapsed.  “A lot of people are like that. My aunt has kidney failure, and does dialysis three days a week. There's only one place in Khartoum that does it,” Eljack said.  Eljack is one of more than 1,500 Sudanese and Sudanese Americans in central Ohio, according to community leader Mohamed Jadkarim Salim, who lives in Hilliard. Many have family members affected by the fighting.  The community is largely supportive of the Biden administration’s ongoing efforts, with Saudi Arabia, to broker talks between the warring military factions, but few are optimistic about peace returning soon. Community members are raising funds for humanitarian relief efforts back home, and some are petitioning the U.S. government to give refuge to those fleeing the conflict by using humanitarian parole.  Tarig Mukhtar, president of the nonprofit Sudanese American Community Development Organization (SACDO), said he feels torn between the organization’s local work and the need to support Sudan.  “We have constituents here we need to take care of, but most importantly, we have our fellow Sudanese back home, and their lives are in jeopardy,” said Mukhtar, 52, a Dublin resident and a pharmacist.  How did the conflict start, and why is the humanitarian situation so bad?  Not long ago, many Sudanese people felt optimistic about the country’s future. In 2019, a popular democratic uprising overthrew the 30-year autocratic regime of President Omar al-Bashir. A civilian council then shared power with military leaders ahead of planned elections, but in October 2021 the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took over in a coup — dashing hopes for democracy.  Then, on April 15, fighting broke out between the Sudanese military and the RSF. It is unclear who fired the first shot, but both sides seemed motivated to establish their supremacy amidst a proposed transition to civilian rule, which has since fallen through, according to the International Crisis Group. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, but has also continued in areas like the western Darfur region, where the RSF got its start in the early 2000s as a militia supporting al-Bashir’s bloody effort to suppress a rebellion.  The current conflict is not primarily ethnic, but some fear it could eventually take on ethnic dimensions like the earlier Darfur conflict — for which al-Bashir faces genocide charges at the International Criminal Court.  Malaz Bakhit, 35, is a Sudanese American dentist practicing as a dental assistant who lives in Clintonville and whose parents and quadriplegic brother are stuck in Khartoum. The family's neighborhood in Khartoum was bombed by Sudanese armed forces and overrun by RSF fighters, she said, and her family recently fled to another part of the city, where they venture out only to find essentials like food and water.  Bakhit said the leaders of the military and of the RSF — Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, respectively — are both motivated by personal ambitions.  “They’re the same to me. Both of them are not good,” Bakhit said.  Nearly 700 people have been killed and a million people across Sudan have fled their homes since mid-April, including 200,000 people who went to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. The lack of a cease-fire has made it difficult for civilians caught in the crossfire to find basics such as food, water and medicine, and has hindered the efforts of professional humanitarian groups, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The fighting has also affected 1.1 million refugees from South Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia who were living in Sudan, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. Refugees in Sudan have been targeted by robbers and kidnappers amidst the conflict, according to Mulugeta Gebresilasie, a refugee resettlement worker with Community Refugee and Immigration Services on Columbus’ Northwest Side, who is originally from Eritrea.  The U.S. government recommended Americans there leave the country because of the deteriorating situation. On April 23, U.S. forces evacuated the American Embassy, although several thousand Americans — primarily Sudanese-American dual citizens — may be left in the country.  What is Sudan’s strategic importance?  Besides humanitarian arguments, there are strategic reasons why Americans should be concerned about Sudan, according to Joseph Campbell, 38, a lecturer at Ohio State University and Bakhit’s husband.  “From the geopolitical (side) it's extremely important that Sudan remains a stable place with some level of freedom, because if it moves towards parties that are hostile towards the United States, that's a major blow to global security,” he said.  Sudan controls part of the Nile River, which is essential to life in much of Egypt downstream. Sudan also has a strategic location along the Red Sea, where Russia is seeking to build a military base to match the U.S. base in nearby Djibouti.  U.S. officials have accused Russia of supporting the RSF in the current conflict. The RSF is also seen as close to the United Arab Emirates, whereas the Sudanese military has ties to the military regime in Egypt.  Salim, the local community leader, said the U.S. should not get involved in helping either the military or the RSF, since neither are dedicated to democracy.  What efforts does the local community support?  Salim and Tarig say they want the U.S. to continue its diplomatic efforts with Saudi Arabia to broker a peace, but in the meantime, more effort is needed to bring essential humanitarian supplies to people in Sudan and refugees in neighboring countries.  Tarig’s Sudanese American nonprofit, SACDO, is holding a bake sale fundraiser on Friday after prayers at the Noor Islamic Cultural Center, 5001 Wilcox Road, Hilliard. Donations will support the Sudanese American Physicians Association, a Texas-based nonprofit that is providing medical care to displaced people in Sudan, as well as Sudan NextGen, another nonprofit providing humanitarian aid, according to Tarig. Sumia Mohamed, 46, a Sudanese American environmental consultant and Ohio State University lecturer, has also been helping to raise funds for Sudan NextGen in Upper Arlington.  Separately, other organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee are also collecting donations for Sudan.  Another group of Sudanese Americans have started an online petition calling on the Biden administration to admit Sudanese people who have American relatives into the U.S. using humanitarian parole — a temporary status that was given to many Afghans and Ukrainians, and which was recently expanded to include Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.  Eljack, the mental health therapist from Upper Arlington, said humanitarian parole is the right thing to do.  “Look at what the U.S. and other countries have done for Ukraine over the past year … it’s double standards,” Eljack said. “It is just a basic humanitarian call to action that we are asking (for).”  Peter Gill covers immigration, New American communities and religion for the Dispatch in partnership with Report for America.

"coup","2011-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Damascus"", ""Damascus"", ""Syria""}","Thu 18 May 2023 11:16:11","Who is Rifaat Al Assad?  Known by various titles such as the “Saraya al-Difaa General”, “Butcher of Hama,” and “Plunderer of the Syrian Central Bank,” Rifaat al-Assad is a controversial figure. In the 1980s, Hafez al-Assad exiled his brother Rifaat to France after the latter attempted a coup against him.  Rifaat Ali Sulayman al-Assad was born on August 27, 1937, in Al-Qardaha, Latakia. He is Hafez’s younger brother. When the Baath Party came to power in March 1963, Rifaat had already been a graduate from the military academy. In 1967, he became the commander of the 569th Brigade, also known as “Saraya al-Difaa” or the “Defence Troops.”  Saraya al-Difaa was established after the 1963 coup, and Rifaat was appointed its commander in 1964. Saraya al-Difaa was active in the “February 23 Movement,” a conflict between Baathist officers, which ended with ousting President Amin al-Hafez.  Saraya al-Difaa’s mission was to attack the National Guard building in Damascus. Under Rifaat’s leadership, Saraya al-Difaa also participated in the 1970 coup called the “Corrective Movement,” which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.  According to Samer al-Mousa, a researcher in contemporary Syrian history, Saraya al-Difaa became a formidable force and the best-trained, equipped, and paid army unit.  He added: “Its members received two salaries, one from the army and the other from the unit, thanks to the Saudi financial support granted by Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz.” Furthermore, al-Mousa indicated that Saraya al-Difaa participated in quelching the Juhayman al-Otaibi movement in the Masjid al-Haram in 1979 alongside French special forces.  Saraya al-Difaa emerged as a military force that nominally followed the Chief of Staff while directly managed by Rifaat. At the time, Rifaat gave himself the title “the Leader.” He also established special housing for those forces known as the “Sumerian Housing,” named after his son Sumer.  Nowadays, one of the neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Damascus still bears the name “Mezzeh 86.” The name is derived from the 555th Brigade, which represented the command centre for Saraya al-Difaa.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZmFuYWNrLmNvbS9mYWNlcy9mZWF0dXJlcy1pbnNpZ2h0cy9yaWZhYXQtYWwtYXNzYWQtZmFtaWxpYWwtcGxlZGdlLW9mLWFsbGVnaWFuY2Utd2l0aC1iaWctc21pbGVzfjI2MTI5NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:00:00","The U.S. men's national team has had its share of victories when it comes to recruiting dual nationals. Right-back Sergino Dest and midfielder Yunus Musah both saw extensive playing time at the 2022 World Cup after making the difficult choice of which country to represent.  The USMNT's biggest recruiting coup of all might have happened on Tuesday, though.  Striker Folarin Balogun, on loan at Ligue 1 side Stade de Reims from Premier League giants Arsenal, pledged his international future to the U.S. by filing one-time switch with FIFA. He could have played for Nigeria or England, the latter of which he represented at youth level. (Balogun also logged minutes for the U.S. U18 team under then-U.S. U20 manager Tab Ramos.)  What makes Balogun such a prize catch is the position he plays and the form he's in. While in recent years the U.S. has increased its quality at positions like defender, central midfield and on the wing, the center-forward position has been a glaring hole in the depth chart.  Right now the position is manned by solid, but not spectacular options such as Norwich City 's Josh Sargent, Ricardo Pepi, who just finished a loan spell at Dutch side Groningen, Antalyaspor's Haji Wright and FC Dallas' Jesus Ferreira. The lackluster play of Wright and Ferreira, in particular, at the World Cup revealed just how much of a weakness the position is for the USMNT.  - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)  Balogun could change all of that. He has enjoyed a scintillating club season on loan, scoring 19 goals in league play, which is tied for fifth in Ligue 1. Along the way he has shown immense skill in terms of finishing, taking players on and linking up with teammates, combined with the ability to ride challenges from opposition defenders. And there's more.  ""I think in terms of being on the field, obviously [Balogun] makes great runs,"" Ramos told ESPN. ""He sacrifices for the team, so he will pressure the ball. He will do all of the things that a team environment requires on and off the field, so I think he's a full package.""  That skill set -- one that is more complete than any other forward in the USMNT pool -- could have a knock-on effect for teammates like Christian Pulisic and Giovanni Reyna. That duo, as well as other wingers like Brenden Aaronson and Timothy Weah, are often the target of persistent fouling from opponents. The respect level from opposition defenders toward Balogun could create a bit more space for U.S. wingers and central midfielders to maneuver.  And what of the existing complement of forwards? At the least it would demand that they raise their respective games.  Pepi is just 21, and has his career on an upward trajectory again after scoring 12 goals for Groningen, this after struggling with Bundesliga side FC Augsburg, who still hold his contract. There is still time for him to hone his game further. Sargent recaptured some goal-scoring form in the English Championship with 13 goals, although he did spend considerable time as a winger with license to tuck inside. Ferreira and Wright, despite their club successes, would appear to be the odd players out.  Granted, Balogun's arrival isn't a guarantee of anything. The U.S. Soccer Federation still has to hire a coach after all, and it remains to be seen how Balogun would fit in the new manager's system. The onus is still on his teammates to get him the ball in dangerous spots, something the U.S. struggled with at the World Cup.  The more dangerous players a team has on the field, though, the better off it will be. Balogun's arrival does precisely that. -- Jeff Carlisle.  Folarin Balogun has scored 19 goals in Ligue 1 this season. USSF/Getty Images for USSF  The view from France  The only reason why Balogun was not nominated for Ligue 1's Best Young Player of the Season award is because he turns 22 in two months' time. The Arsenal loanee is slightly too old for the prize -- Lyon's Bradley Barcola and Rayan Cherki, Monaco's Eliesse Ben Seghir, Montpellier's Elyi Wahi and PSG's Nuno Mendes are 20 or under.  However, there is an argument that he could have been part of the senior Ligue 1 Player of the Season race, alongside PSG's Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi, Lens' Lois Openda and Seko Fofana and Lille's Jonathan David. With 19 goals and two assists in 34 league games (31 starts), Balogun has been Reims' best player, Ligue 1's revelation of the season, and one of the best players in the league, period.  To say that we saw it coming would be a lie. Even at Reims, no one could have predicted a season like this. He arrived in the Champagne region on loan from Arsenal (without an option to sign permanently) at the start of August, having not had a preseason with his new teammates. Yet, under then-Reims manager Oscar Garcia, he adapted quickly and scored in his first game, away at Marseille on Aug. 7, off the bench.  The following game, against Clermont, he started, scored again and never looked back. He scored against Marseille (both home and away), Lens (home and away), PSG, Monaco and managed a hat trick against Lorient in January.  More than the goals and his finishing ability, the most impressive attribute Balogun shows is his maturity. His intelligence and awareness is great, his first touch always has a purpose, while his runs are smart and well-timed.  This season in Ligue 1 has proved, if needed, what a talent he is. He deserves a chance to shine internationally too. -- Julien Laurens.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvZm9vdGJhbGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY3NTczOS93aGF0LWFyc2VuYWwtc3RyaWtlci1mb2xhcmluLWJhbG9ndW4tYnJpbmctdXNtbnTSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvLnVrL2Zvb3RiYWxsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2NzU3Mzkvd2hhdC1hcnNlbmFsLXN0cmlrZXItZm9sYXJpbi1iYWxvZ3VuLWJyaW5nLXVzbW50P3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This would be the start of a special bond between him and his skipper, the one and only Ange Postecoglou.  When I decided to write a piece on the relationship between the two, I’d done a bit of research into the club and it was a fascinating insight. Not just on the bond between the two men, but the history and traditions of the club. It has many similarities with our own football club.

Marcos briefly mentioned the speakership battle during his speech at the 4th General Assembly of the League of Provinces of the Philippines in Clark, Pampanga.  ADVERTISEMENT  Speaker Martin Romualdez, his cousin, had introduced him, and he thanked him for doing so.  “Thank you very much to our Speaker of the House of Representatives. I won’t make any comments about the Speakership as of yet,” Marcos said.  Speculations of a rift in the administration and another ouster plot being hatched in the House rose after lawmakers seemed to have demoted former President and Pampanga 2nd District Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from senior deputy speaker to deputy speaker.  Arroyo, whom the President described as his “secret weapon,” was replaced by her fellow Kapampangan, 3rd District Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr.  House Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe said the move was to “unburden” Arroyo of the “heavy load of the position.”  Some House leaders then released statements declaring their loyalty and support to Romualdez and the President.  Following Arroyo’s demotion, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who is Marcos’ running mate in the 2022 polls, announced her resignation from the political party Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD), where Arroyo was chairman emeritus and Romualdez is President.  The Vice President did not give a categorical reason for her resignation from the party.  Duterte is a known close ally of Arroyo, who was said to have played a key role in the election of the Pampanga lawmaker as House Speaker in 2018, after the ouster of then House leader Pantaleon Alvarez.  For her part, Arroyo, a known close ally of the Vice President, denied speculations of her plotting a coup, saying her actions may have been “misconstrued.”  RELATED STORIES:  APL/abc  Your subscription could not be saved.

He is certainly one of the best at doing this. If he is not going after President Trump, he is busy spinning reality to glorify the failing Biden administration.  He recently accused Trump supporters of being cultists. Give me a break. The true cultists are the Democratic senators and congressmen all voting in lockstep with whatever Pelosi and Schumer order.  If Robert wants to write the truth without having to put spin on it, he might consider some of the following suggestions for future columns:  The Obama administration with the help of the FBI spied on candidate Trumps campaign.  The Russian Collusion hoax was started by Hillary Clinton with the help of the FBI and mainstream media in order to take the heat off of the private email server containing classified documents found at her home.  The FBI allowed the Mueller Special Counsel to be formed knowing that the whole Russian Collusion saga was a complete hoax.  The Biden campaign working with Big Tech and the government alphabet agencies suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story. Studies have shown that this suppression by itself was enough to swing the election and resulted in the current president. Fifty-one former security ""experts"" prostituted themselves claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.  Joe Biden waived executive privilege for former President Trump to allow the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago in order to coverup his own classified document violations.  Hillary Clinton and the DNC bought and paid for the fabricated/fake document known as the ""Steele Dossier,"" thereby kicking off the Russian Collusion hoax. The FBI knew it was fake but used it as grounds to start the attempted coup against President Trump.  The Merrick Garland justice department had the Hunter Biden laptop way back in 2019. To protect the Joe Biden campaign, they just sat on it without prosecution.  All of the above are far worse than Watergate but the mainstream media still has no interest and, in fact, were complicit in promoting the false narratives for the Democrats.  Joe Biden has announced that he is running for reelection to ""finish the job"" that he started. Heaven help us if that happens. He should never be allowed to finish the destruction of this once great nation. The economy is in the tank, energy independence is in the tank, our borders are wide open, inflation is in orbit, crime is in orbit, national debt is in orbit, the military is more concerned about ""wokeness"" than being combat ready, men in lady’s bathrooms, men in lady’s locker rooms, men competing in women’s sports.

"coup","1975-03-18","Not Discerned","{""Antofagasta"", ""Antofagasta"", ""Chile""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:16:01","By Sebastian Silva  Santiago, May 18 (EFE).- Jorge Silva Huerta won’t ever forget the day in March 1975 when henchmen of Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s regime took him to a seaside vacation camp-turned torture center south of the Chilean port city of San Antonio.  Only 22 on the occasion of his second arrest since the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled socialist President Salvador Allende and ushered in 17 years of military rule, Silva was targeted for his membership in the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR).  He was bundled into a Chevrolet C10 pick-up truck and taken to the Rocas de Santo Domingo site, one of 16 vacation spots built by the Allende government to serve the needs of working-class people.  Soon after seizing power, Pinochet put the workers’ resorts at the disposal of DINA, the secret police, and Rocas de Santo Domingo became a clandestine prison under the auspices of the army’s Tejas Verdes Regiment.  Silva would spend 34 days at the site, subjected to torture and marathon interrogations about a weapon he says he never had.  “From here we could emerge free or dead,” he tells EFE sitting on the foundations of one of the old holiday bungalows. “We will remember this all our lives, today we are happy to recover this place.”  The Chilean government formally took possession of Rocas de Santo Domingo this week as part of President Gabriel Boric’s Historical Memory initiative.  “This is a milestone of recovery of this property that was administered for many years by the army. A site where horrific things happened, a center of detention, torture, and experimentation in the violation of human rights,” the minister of the national patrimony, Javiera Toro, said.  As was the case with another Pinochet-era dungeon in the northern region of Antofagasta, the Santo Domingo facility will become a memorial to the victims with an educational mission.  “When we remember, not only do we pay a debt to the past, the victims, and survivors, but also to society,” Toro said. “Today we face new threats to democracy, in Chile and in the world, and to say ‘never again’ and promote human rights is also to give back to current and future generations the rights to construct their own future.”  Ana Becerra, another MIR member who was held prisoner at Santo Domingo and is now a prominent human rights advocate, will be part of the transformation of the former jail into a place of learning.  Arrested at 17, Becerra spent a month at Santo Domingo before being transferred to the regime’s most famous torture center, Villa Grimaldi in Santiago.  “This site will be converted into a school of human rights, that is our dream and that is what will be,” she said on accepting from Toro the concession for the San Antonio Memory Foundation to manage the facility.  “This is not only death. This is a site that had joy. It had its dark part, but will be reborn with the two parts together: the history of the site and the laughter of the young people in the school of human rights,” Becerra said to applause.

U Banyar, the Director of the Karenni Human Rights Group (KnHRG), confirmed that the fighting has now extended to Bawlakhe, a military town. He described the current situation, ""The Military Council itself has completely sealed off the town, restricting any movement in or out. They have closed all town roads leading to Hpasawng, Loikaw, and Demoso in an effort to prevent people from leaving. Despite these efforts, it appears that some individuals have managed to find a means of escape. However there are also residents who remain trapped within the neighborhoods of the town. It is my understanding that all education, healthcare, and administrative systems in  Bawlakhe have come to a halt. Additionally, we have received reports of administrators who never joined the CDM movement, seeking refuge in Loikaw”.  In the aftermath of the coup, the townships of Demoso, Mese, Shadaw, and Hpruso in Karenni State have become battlegrounds for the Military Council and resistance forces. The conflict has been intense, with the military losing control over most of the territory in these areas.  On May 1st, the People Defense Force (PDF) in Bawlakhe launched attacks on the veterans' office, immigration office, police station, and television station, all of which were occupied by the Military Council troops.  These attacks resulted in the death of seven Military Council soldiers, with an additional 20 troops sustaining injuries, while weapons and ammunition were also seized from the Military Council, Bawlakhe-PDF announced. Following the infiltration of PDFs into the town, the Military Council responded by shelling the neighborhoods in Bawlakhe and utilizing drones to drop bombs.  As chaos began to engulf Bawlakhe, there were reports of non-CDM staff attempting to evacuate to Loikaw using helicopters, with unverified rumors circulating that the cost of such rides could be as high as 25,0000 kyats per person, although independent verification by the Than Lwin Times was not possible.  Khu Nye Reh, Interior Minister of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), told the Than Lwin Times that the Military Council has imposed a blockade on all entrances and exits of Bawlakhe, preventing residents from leaving the town and reinforcing troops in the area.  ""A Tactical Operation Command along with three battalions are all stationed in Bawlakhe.  Air force transportation is operating, in fairly good condition, allowing for easy transportation of weapons and ammunition to the area. With an existing strong military presence, their efforts are underway to reinforce additional troops and establish a formidable military stronghold in Bawlakhe”, he said.  Bawlakhe accommodates the 377th, 340th, and 429th Light Infantry Battalions of the Military Council, alongside the 66th Brigade of the Loikaw Regional Tactical Operation Command, and various other military units.  Prior to 2023, the Military Council held strong administrative authority over Loikaw, Bawlakhe, and Shadaw townships in Karenni State, but now only Loikaw remains under the full control of the Military Council, resistance forces claimed.  The Military Council declared martial law on February 2nd in Demoso, Hpruso, and Shadaw townships, where the rebellion had gained significant momentum.  Over 200,000 people out of a population of roughly 300,000 in Karenni State have been displaced due to the ongoing conflict between the Military Council and the resistance forces.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuaW9ubGluZS5uZXQvZW4vbmV3cy9rYXJlbm5pLXJlc2lzdGFuY2UtYWR2YW5jZXMtdG93YXJkcy1iYXdsYWtoZS10b3duLXNlYWxlZC1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9ycy1mbGVlLWxvaWthdy1rYXJlbm5p0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Air strikes by the army targeting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were heard across several residential neighbourhoods in southern Khartoum, including near the Taiba camp, while a police reserve force aligned with the army battled the RSF on the ground, the witnesses said.  The army has mainly used air power and heavy artillery as it tries to drive back the RSF, which spread out across large areas of Khartoum and its adjoining cities of Bahri and Omdurman across the Nile after fighting erupted on April 15.  “The bombardment and the clashes don’t stop and there’s no way to flee from our homes. All our money is gone,” said Salah el-Din Othman, a 35-year-old resident of Khartoum.  “Even if we leave our houses again we’re afraid that gangs will loot everything in the house … we are living a nightmare of fear and poverty.”  Violence has also flared in Darfur in western Sudan and in North Kordofan State, and other parts of the country, but the power struggle has been focused on the capital.  Both army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, are thought to have remained in Khartoum throughout the fighting.  On Wednesday the army released a video showing Burhan dressed in army fatigues greeting troops at what appeared to be the army headquarters in central Khartoum.  AID SUPPLIES LOOTED  According to latest estimates, more than 840,000 people have been displaced within Sudan and over 220,000 have fled to neighbouring countries.  The U.N. World Food Programme said it was ramping up its operations across at least six states in Sudan to assist 4.9 million vulnerable people, as well as assisting those fleeing to Chad, Egypt and South Sudan.  “The fighting in Sudan is devastating lives and livelihoods and forcing people to flee their homes with nothing but the clothes they are wearing,” WFP East Africa director Michael Dunford said in a statement.  The U.N. said on Wednesday that more than half of Sudan’s 46 million population needed humanitarian assistance and protection, launching a $3 billion aid appeal. It also said it had received reports of “horrific gender-based violence” in Sudan.  The aid effort has been hampered by the deaths of some humanitarian workers early in the conflict and repeated cases of looting.  Medical aid agency MSF said that on Tuesday armed men had broken into its warehouse in Khartoum and taken two cars filled with supplies.  Burhan and Hemedti took the top positions on Sudan’s ruling council following the 2019 overthrow of strongman Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising. They staged a coup two years later as a deadline to hand power to civilians approached and they began to mobilise their respective forces.  The latest conflict broke out after disputes over plans for the RSF to join the army and over the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal for a political transition towards civilian rule.  Talks mediated by the United States and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah have so far failed to secure a ceasefire.

"coup","1973-09-11","11:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 16:45:48","Santiago, Chile – September 5, 1972. The day before, nearly 8% of Chile’s 10 million citizens had celebrated the second anniversary of President Salvador Allende’s election victory. On this day, the Communist Youth of Chile (JJCC) was kicking off its seventh annual congress in the old parliament building in downtown Santiago with delegations from 38 countries. The JJCC’s central committee had been recently expanded to 80 members, and now included composer Isabel Parra (daughter of Violeta, also a composer); Eduardo Carrasco (of the Quilapayún musical group); and singer-songwriter Víctor Jara, who had just released his La población [The People] album with the Dicap label (established in 1968 by the JJCC).  Jara had been a communist activist since the late 1950s, when he was taking acting classes at the University of Chile’s Experimental Theater and playing with the Cuncumén folk group. Many of Chile’s leading intellectuals had flocked to the communist party at the time: poets Pablo Neruda and Juvencio Valle; novelist Francisco Coloane; symphony conductor Armando Carvajal; soprano Blanca Hauser; actors Roberto Parada and María Maluenda; choreographer Patricio Bunster; and theater director Pedro de la Barra.  Only once did Jara publicly explain his political convictions. In a 1971 interview with El Musiquero magazine, Jara said: “I always identified with political activism. When I listened to speeches about the people’s struggles, I identified with them. I was raised in a humble home, an experience that enabled me to appreciate injustice and misery, and helped me understand who I am.” Born in Santiago de Chile on September 28, 1932, Víctor was the fourth of six children born to Manuel Jara and Amanda Martínez. Soon after his birth, the family left the city to work in almost feudal servitude as landless peasants in Quiriquina, near Chillán (central Chile). Jara grew up in poverty as the family moved around the country and eventually settled on the outskirts of Santiago de Chile in 1943. “When we ate meat, it was a party. But I didn’t know why until much later,” he told Paula magazine in 1971.  In early 1970, his politics led him to quit a steady job as a theater director at the University of Chile, where he had earned some renown for directing plays written by his friend, Alejandro Sieveking (Ánimas de día claro and La remolienda); The Invaders by Egon Wolff; and The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertolt Brecht. But his success as a solo singer-songwriter led him to pursue a career in music. Songs like El cigarrito, El aparecido and Pongo en tus manos abiertas became very popular, and he won the first Festival of the New Chilean Song in 1969 for Plegaria a un labrador. When Salvador Allende launched his campaign in 1970 as the Popular Unity movement’s (UP) presidential candidate in 1970, Jara used his guitar and songs to rally support for the UP. He composed Venceremos [We Will Triumph] with composer Sergio Ortega and others, a song that became an anthem of global leftist movements.  “What would you have done when Allende won that night?” he wrote on September 23, 1970, to his friend Rubén Ortiz, a Mexican musician. “I’m sure the same thing we all did — cry, jump, run, sing, shout, and experience the greatest joy Santiago had ever seen. Little brother, so many years of delay, misery and deceit. That night, I was standing next to some Popular Unity leaders, and they couldn’t believe it was true — we had defeated the reactionaries and the Americans...”  For the next three years, Víctor Jara supported Allende as a creator and communist activist, as the UP movement built a socialist government that respected political pluralism, human rights and democratic values. He performed throughout Latin America — Mexico, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Panama, Cuba and Peru — and in the USSR and United Kingdom. His concerts inspired a global groundswell of support for the UP, while his tribute to Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese people, El derecho de vivir en paz [The right to live in peace], fueled anti-war sentiment around the world. His popular song aimed at all the political fence-sitters (Ni chicha ni limoná) again revealed his activist heart, and his most universal song, Te recuerdo, Amanda, spoke to all the strong mothers who raised children on their own.  Chile’s widening polarization after 1972 brought out pessimistic and melancholic tones in his correspondence and songs. “Will we live to see the achievements of socialism?” he wrote in a letter to Peruvian poet Arturo Corcuera on June 2, 1972. In his 1973 song, Cuando voy al trabajo, Jara sings, “I’m writing the beginning of a story / without knowing how it ends.”  Early on September 11, 1973, Jara heard the news of the coup d’état led by General Augusto Pinochet. When President Allende spoke from La Moneda Palace and exhorted the Chilean people to gather in protest at their workplaces, Jara headed to the public university (Universidad Técnica del Estado) where he worked in an extension department, passing the Communist Youth of Chile headquarters on the way. Jara and 1,000 others stayed at the university all day and night until the army stormed the campus at dawn. He and other “prisoners of war” were taken to the Estadio Chile sports complex, where they were interrogated and beaten.  On September 15, a hungry, thirsty and injured Jara sat on the bleachers of the sports complex that was later named after him, and began writing a long and moving poem. He handed the unfinished poem to some friends before soldiers took him and a friend, Littré Quiroga, to a locker room and shot them. A year later, his exiled widow, Joan Jara, released a posthumous album that included Manifiesto, a song composed weeks before the coup that amply illustrated Victor’s ethical, aesthetic and political convictions: “I sing this song from the scaffolding we built to reach the stars...”  Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy0wNS0xOC9zb25ncy1mb3ItdGhlLXJldm9sdXRpb24tdmljdG9yLWphcmEtYW5kLWhpcy11bml2ZXJzYWwtbGVnYWN5Lmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMtMDUtMTgvc29uZ3MtZm9yLXRoZS1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLXZpY3Rvci1qYXJhLWFuZC1oaXMtdW5pdmVyc2FsLWxlZ2FjeS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-01","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:00:48","There is a dangerous confrontation playing out on the streets of Pakistan. The country’s most popular politician is locked in a battle with its most powerful institution. Last week, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was dramatically snatched by scores of paramilitary forces from an Islamabad courthouse. Supporters rampaged through Pakistan’s streets in protest, torching buildings, ransacking the official residence of a senior military commander, and even storming into the Army’s headquarters. Khan was released on bail three days later and has since escalated the confrontation— accusing the Army chief, Gen. Asim Munir, of targeting him.  There is a dangerous confrontation playing out on the streets of Pakistan. The country’s most popular politician is locked in a battle with its most powerful institution. Last week, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was dramatically snatched by scores of paramilitary forces from an Islamabad courthouse. Supporters rampaged through Pakistan’s streets in protest, torching buildings, ransacking the official residence of a senior military commander, and even storming into the Army’s headquarters. Khan was released on bail three days later and has since escalated the confrontation—accusing the Army chief, Gen. Asim Munir, of targeting him.  A political crisis is the last thing that Pakistan needs. The country’s economy is skidding fast off a cliff. It is close to defaulting on its international debt. There has barely been a recovery since last year’s epic floods, which submerged a third of the country and displaced millions. Inflation has soared to 35 percent, while the rupee has plunged to record lows. And the threat of terrorism, which had abated over recent years, has resurfaced.  Pakistan desperately needs a reset. The unyielding confrontation between military authorities and Khan’s party threatens to tear apart the Muslim world’s second-most-populous country and sole nuclear power. There is an opportunity, later this year, when elections are due. The only way forward is for Pakistan’s generals to finally relinquish their hold on the country and let a democratic process run its course. A peaceful, free, and fair election won’t solve Pakistan’s many problems, but it could deliver a measure of much-needed stability—and make a decisive break with the past.  In many ways, the current crisis is depressingly familiar. Pakistan’s military has ruled the 75-year-old country directly for three decades and kept a grip on nominally democratic governments for the rest. No civilian prime minister has survived a full term to face the electorate again. They have been forced out of office through a variety of means and even, in one case, assassinated. The military has cynically worked backstage to help opposition leaders take their place—before they, too, suffered the same fate, in an endless cycle of dysfunction.  At first, Khan, a former star cricketeer who rose to power on a populist platform, was close to the military. When the generals thrust Khan into office, in 2018, he was more pliable than most politicians. The two sides openly shared power, inaugurating what became known as a “hybrid regime.” Decisions were taken at military headquarters and dutifully signed off on in the prime minister’s office. The intelligence agencies acted as enforcers, locking up opponents, muzzling journalists, disappearing critics, leaning on judges, and whipping parliamentary votes. The generals liked the former cricket legend’s charisma, his nationalism, and his self-styled crusade against corruption. It was all going well for the men in uniform—until he overstepped.  Pakistan’s military jealously guards its chain of command, where the top general maintains a firm sense of authority, and when Khan tried to insert his own voice, the top brass turned on him. It pulled its support, leaving Khan vulnerable to a vote of no confidence last April. By any measure, if he had been allowed to complete a full term in office, Khan would have struggled to get reelected. His politics were divisive, his policies ineffective. But now he has become a magnet for sympathy, skillfully casting himself as an embattled hero fighting for his people’s “real independence.”  Khan was ostensibly arrested on corruption charges. In total, he says he is facing 148 cases, including allegations of “terrorism,” “sedition,” and “blasphemy.” But the motivation behind these cases has little to do with notions of transparency or accountability. This is an attempt to eliminate him from contention in this year’s general election. Leaders of Khan’s party have been arrested and, allegedly, in some cases, tortured. More have been arrested at more junior levels, and even peaceful protests led by Khan’s supporters have been crushed by the police. The military is now threatening to prosecute the suspected rioters in its own courts, in brazen violation of international law. Anyone involved in inciting or carrying out violence should be held accountable, but through fair trials in civilian courts.  By pursuing its vendetta against Khan, the military is putting its own standing at risk. His supporters aren’t found in remote rural areas. They are concentrated in Pakistan’s main towns and cities. They include members of the elite and the assertive and social media-savvy middle classes, with vast numbers of people whose relatives are serving in the military or have done before. Rarely has hostility toward the military seeped so deep into its own heartlands. There is even open talk of splits among the Army’s own high command.  The generals may not realize it now, but a permanent withdrawal from politics would be in their best interests. Their hybrid experiment didn’t just fail—it disastrously backfired. The military can only assert its will now through force, shedding support in the process. By stepping aside, much of the hostile attention would fade. They would also have space to heal internal rifts and rebuild their much-damaged public image.  There are only two plausible alternatives to a free and fair election in Pakistan this year: a tainted one, or a military coup. If Khan isn’t allowed to take part, the elections will lack legitimacy in the eyes of many Pakistanis. The results won’t be accepted, and the crisis will endure. Moreover, any government that emerges from such a process will be weak and constantly vulnerable to the manipulations of the military—much like the current coalition government. It could be swept aside at any moment, triggering a fresh crisis.  A military coup is unlikely, but not impossible. But if the generals grab power for themselves, they won’t deliver stability. Instead, they will plunge Pakistan deep into the abyss—it will be isolated globally and ruined economically.  The choice between the military and Khan isn’t an appealing one. There are fears that if Khan wins the coming election, he may leverage his popularity to build a civilian autocracy around him. He is vain and erratic. He doesn’t like to play by the rules. But eliminating him and his party through sheer repression isn’t the answer. Crucially, an election that sees him voted in could also be followed by an election that sees him voted out.  The important thing is that the Pakistani voters finally get to make those decisions—not the men in uniform.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9pbXJhbmtoYW4tcGFraXN0YW4tbWlsaXRhcnktZWxlY3Rpb25zLz90cGNjPW9uYm9hcmRpbmdfdHJlbmRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-03-23","Not Discerned","{""Sudan"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:10:00","KHARTOUM –  Potential disruptions to the supply chain of gum arabic*, as fallout from the Sudan conflict, is causing alarm among international manufacturers. As about 70 per cent of the world’s supply comes from acacia trees in Sudan, the ongoing impact on the economy has led to stockpiling efforts by companies, and disruptions in trade.  There are reports that international companies that depend on a reliable supply of gum arabic, such as major soft drink producers, have been stockpiling supplies to mitigate potential shortages.  Exporters and suppliers have reported a halt in trade due to the breakdown in logistics, particularly in the capital Khartoum, and to port operations in Red Sea state which have prioritised civilian evacuations over commercial activities.  The impact this year is more significant than previous conflicts, which were typically localised in remote areas like Darfur, so that current stockpiles may only last about five to six months.  This could impact the Sudan economy in the longer term as the cosmetics and printing industries seek alternatives, however there is no such alternative for gum arabic as an emulsifier in fizzy drinks, where it is used to prevent the ingredients from separating.  The significance of gum arabic to the consumer goods industry is evident from its exemption from US sanctions** against Sudan since 1997. This exemption was granted due to its critical nature and the fear of creating an informal market.  In 2021, Sudan received a €10 million grant from the EU to restructure its gum Arabic sector and in 2020, the Netherlands agreed to support and facilitate the establishment of gum processing factories.  * Gum arabic is an emulsifier and a stabiliser made from resin from the acacia Senegal tree. Apart from shoe polish and ink, the food industry uses the stabiliser in chocolate and sweets, and, most importantly, in soft drinks, as it binds the sugar to the drink.  Sudan is the world’s foremost producer at an estimated 88,000 tons a year. Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria, produce 95 per cent of gum Arabic exported to the world market.  The gum Arabic belt covers about one fifth of the country. North Kordofan and North Darfur are the largest producers, followed by the states of Blue Nile, White Nile, and El Gedaref.  In the past years, Sudanese economists reported a decline in the export of gum Arabic. They have urged Khartoum to step up the production of gum Arabic to bridge the economic crisis in the country while at the same time meeting the growing demands in the world.  ** USA-Sudan relations  After a distinct thaw in US-Sudan relations following the overthrow of the Al Bashir regime and a movement toward democratic transition, relations between Washington and Khartoum have been strained following the subsequent military coup d’état of October 25, 2021.  The USA suspended all aid to Sudan following the coup, stating that “the USA is pausing assistance from the $700 million in emergency assistance appropriations of Economic Support Funds for Sudan. Those funds were intended to support the country’s democratic transition as we evaluate the next step for Sudan programming.”  In 2022, the US Senate confirmed John Godfrey as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the USA to Sudan. Sudan had been served by a deputy ambassador, making Ambassador Godfrey the first fully ranked US ambassador to Sudan in 25 years.  On May 11, the US Senate passed a draft resolution “to condemn the military coup in Sudan and support the Sudanese people,” and the UK House of Commons also unanimously passed the non-binding resolution with a quick vote without any objections.  On March 23, the US Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved a draft resolution condemning the military coup in Sudan and calling on the US administration to impose sanctions on those responsible for the coup.  The draft resolution came two days after the US Treasury imposed sanctions on the paramilitary Central Reserve Forces (popularly called Abu Teira) that stand under the command of the police, in accordance with the Global Magnitsky Act on serious violations of human rights.  The Treasury listed the excessively violent repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests by the security forces as the main reason.  There have been wide calls for targeted US sanctions on the Chairman of Sudan’s Sovereignty Council Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan and deputy Chairman Mohamed ‘Hemeti’ Dagalo for their involvement in serious human rights abuses following the coup.  In March, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions on the Sudan Central Reserve Police (CRP, popularly known as Abu Tira) for serious human rights abuse yesterday. The Treasury listed the excessively violent repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests by the security forces as the main reason.  Last week, OFAC announced sanctions against ‘Sudan companies with links to Hamas‘, with one financier, Hisham Younis Yahia Qafisheh, allegedly “operating and managing at least two Sudan-based companies, Agrogate Holding and Al Rowad Real Estate Development, in order to generate revenue for the Palestinian group.”  Bilateral agreement  In November 2020, Sudan and the US signed a bilateral claims settlement to resolve “default judgements and claims based on allegations that Sudan’s prior regime supported acts of terrorism”. According to the agreement, Sudan had to pay $335 million, on top of approximately $72 million already paid, for distribution to victims of terrorism.  Sudan’s removal from the SST list, decreed in the dying days of the Donald Trump administration, was conditional on a bilateral claims settlement signed in November 2020 to resolve “default judgements and claims based on allegations that Sudan’s prior regime supported acts of terrorism”. Sudan had to pay $335 million, on top of approximately $72 million already paid, for distribution to victims of terrorism.  In exchange, after payment of compensation to the families of the victims of the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, and the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Dar El Salaam in Tanzania and Nairobi in Kenya, the default judgments and claims against Sudan in US courts would be dismissed, and Sudan’s sovereign immunities under US law would be restored to those enjoyed by countries that have never been designated by the US as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhYmFuZ2FzdWRhbi5vcmcvZW4vYWxsLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9zdWRhbi1jb25mbGljdC1hbGFybXMtd29ybGQtZ3VtLWFyYWJpYy1tYXJrZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2020-07-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:45:27","After shocking Thailand’s military-backed elite with a historic election breakthrough, the Move Forward Party now wants to take on the nation’s biggest political taboo — laws on insulting the monarchy.  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat’s determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy’s status, with some protesters calling for the king’s power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday’s election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  – Tough laws –  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges — at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  “We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,” he said.  “We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.”  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister’s job the coalition needs a majority across both houses — including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate — monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut’s junta — are threatening to block Pita’s bid for the job.  “I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,” Senator Jadet Inswang said.  “I will not accept Pita as a PM because he… has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can’t accept.”  – Cycle of unrest –  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  “I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,” Napon told AFP.  “This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.”  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  “This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics — the status quo has been demolished,” Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.  by Alexis HONTANG    ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY2F1YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RoYWlsYW5kcy1tb3ZlLWZvcndhcmQtcGFydHktdGFrZXMtb24tYmlnZ2VzdC1wb2xpdGljYWwtdGFib28v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Myanmar’s junta has revoked the licenses of three private hospitals in Mandalay for employing striking medics.  Monday‘s leaked junta order stated that the business licenses of Kant Kaw, City and Palace hospitals have been revoked as they failed to follow Article 19(a) of licensing rules for private healthcare services.  Sources said the hospitals, which collectively employ about 800 staff, had been targeted because they hired and helped striking medics who joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM).  Hundreds of medics from Yangon and Mandalay initiated the CDM on February 3, 2021, by refusing to work under the regime, two days after the coup.  A CDM doctor in Mandalay said closing private hospitals would block income for striking medics. The junta has taken no action to care for the three hospitals’ patients.  Plainclothes junta personnel arrested Dr Win Khaing and two colleagues in December while he was treating patients at Palace Hospital in Chanayethazan Township.  The urology and renal surgeon joined the CDM after the coup.  In October and November, at least 30 doctors and nurses were detained in Mandalay. Among them was Daw Poe Thandar Aung, a striking nurse who was accused of sending medicines to resistance groups, who died at an interrogation center.  Following the arrests, the junta temporarily closed five private hospitals, including Kant Kaw, City and Palace, in Mandalay. The status of the other two hospitals remains unknown, according to sources.  A Mandalay resident said the junta has been frequently targeting private hospitals and schools to seize CDM participants and stop the public from relying on private healthcare and education.  “People with a little disposable income use private schools and hospitals as the public hospitals no longer have enough staff, equipment and medicines since the coup,” said the resident.

"coup","2021-10-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 03:40:55","I. Introduction  1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 2636 (2022) by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS) until 3 June 2023 and requested the Secretary-General to report every 90 days on its implementation. The report covers developments in the Sudan from 19 February to 6 May 2023 and contains an update on the implementation of the Mission’s mandate, with gender considerations integrated throughout as a cross-cutting issue.  II. Significant developments  A. Political situation  2. The situation in the Sudan deteriorated dramatically. While some progress was being made in the political process during the early part of the reporting period, large-scale fighting erupted on 15 April between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces, engulfing the country in conflict.  3. Early in the reporting period, military leaders expressed diverging views on the military coup of 25 October 2021 and the issue of the integration of the Rapid Support Forces into one national army. While the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, referred to the events of 25 October 2021 as a “coup” for the first time in a speech in River Nile State on 18 February, he also maintained that it was intended to “correct the situation” in the country. In a televised address on 19 February, the Deputy Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and head of the Rapid Support Forces, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, stated that his participation in the “military coup” was a “mistake” that had led to the reinstatement of elements of the former regime, accusing the latter of creating rifts between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces.  4. Prior to the outbreak of fighting, there had been limited progress in the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement. On 4 and 5 March, in Khartoum, the Sudan Peace Commission convened a national workshop for government officials to discuss the updated implementation matrix of the Juba Peace Agreement that was signed on 20 February in Juba. The national workshop identified ministries and institutions in charge of implementing specific actions outlined in the updated matrix. During this part of the reporting period, the trilateral mechanism also continued to engage with the non-signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement. On 21 March, UNITAMS, with support from the United Nations country team, secured the release of 11 Sudanese men in the custody of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction.  5. In parallel, efforts to move the political process towards finalization continued. From 16 to 20 March, the trilateral mechanism consisting of the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in collaboration with the National High Committee for Transitional Justice (composed of signatory parties to the framework agreement, national experts and the Civil Coalition for Transitional Justice) convened a national conference on justice and transitional justice in Khartoum. The conference brought together around 800 participants from across the Sudan (30 per cent of whom were women), including victims of human rights violations, victims’ families and national and international experts. Participants recommended promoting a transitional justice model that would help to end the culture of impunity in the Sudan. This was the fourth of five workshops held to expand consultations among the Sudanese as part of the political framework agreement. This national conference was preceded by regional consultations held in Blue Nile State, Darfur, South Kordofan State and Khartoum from 12 to 14 March. Consultations planned in eastern and northern Sudan did not proceed, owing to the absence of authorization from local authorities.  6. On 19 March, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan and Lieutenant General Dagalo convened a meeting during which the signatories of the framework agreement agreed to complete the final political agreement by 1 April, finalize the transitional constitution by 6 April and begin the formation of the transitional institutions by 11 April. On the same day, at the request of the signatories to the framework agreement, the trilateral mechanism convened a preparatory meeting during which they agreed to form a drafting committee to prepare a draft final agreement and a committee to continue outreach to the non-signatories.  7. The signatory parties to the framework agreement, in coordination with the trilateral mechanism, convened a workshop on military and security sector reform from 26 to 29 March, which concluded the consultations. Some 260 people participated (20 per cent of whom were women), including representatives of various State security agencies, civil society and signatories and non-signatories to the framework agreement, as well as national and international experts. In their remarks at the opening session, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan and Lieutenant General Dagalo expressed their commitment to military and security sector reform. Participants were unable to agree on recommendations at the conclusion of the workshop, as differences remained over timelines for the integration of the Rapid Support Forces into one unified national army and for establishing a unified command structure.  8. On 1 April, the signatory parties to the framework agreement agreed to revise the initial timeline for the completion of the final agreement to allow more time to overcome differences, particularly on military and security sector reform. The drafting committee finalized the draft agreement on 4 April. However, on 5 April, the signatory parties announced their intention to delay the signing of the agreement until the remaining differences between the military leaders had been addressed.  9. Amid growing tensions between the military leaders, the mobilization of troops and a military build-up of both forces, particularly in Khartoum, Darfur and the northern region of the Sudan, were widely reported since early March, creating fears among the population of potential clashes. In a televised statement on 12 April, the spokesperson of the Sudanese Armed Forces accused the Rapid Support Forces of deploying troops in Khartoum, Marawi and elsewhere in the country without the approval of, or coordination with, the Sudanese Armed Forces. The latter reportedly gave the Rapid Support Forces 24 hours to withdraw from Marawi airport in northern Sudan. In a statement later the same day, the Rapid Support Forces noted that the deployment of troops had been carried out in line with its national mandate and in coordination with the Sudanese Armed Forces. The Sudanese Armed Forces rejected the claims by the Rapid Support Forces of coordination and accused them of creating “terror among citizens”.  10. Concerned with the escalatory rhetoric around the build-up of forces, national and international actors, including the trilateral mechanism, increased engagement with the military leaders to defuse tensions. A national mediation committee was formed by Gibril Ibrahim, the Minister of Finance and leader of the Justice and Equality Movement; Sovereign Council member Malik Agar, who leads the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) Malik Agar faction; and Minni Minawi, the Governor of the Darfur Region and leader of the Sudan Liberation Army – Minni Minawi (SLA/MM) faction. Civilian signatory parties to the framework agreement also established a mechanism led by Sovereign Council member El Hadi Idris, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council (SLM-TC), to engage with Lieutenant General Al-Burhan and Lieutenant General Dagalo in an attempt to prevent further escalation. On 11 April, the Special Representative convened a meeting of the diplomatic community to provide an update on the situation and explore opportunities for coordinated action to defuse tensions. UNITAMS, together with its trilateral mechanism partners, subsequently engaged with both parties, calling for restraint and the peaceful settlement of differences. On 13 April, France, Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Union issued a joint statement calling on Sudanese military and civilian leaders to take active steps to reduce tensions and engage constructively to resolve outstanding issues related to security sector reform.  11. Despite calls from national and international actors, on 15 April, heavy fighting broke out between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Khartoum and Merowe. The clashes rapidly expanded geographically with numerous confrontations in Darfur and North Kordofan. The spokesperson for the Sudanese Armed Forces described the situation as a “conspiracy and aggression” by the Rapid Support Forces, accusing them of “rebelling against the State”. Meanwhile, the Rapid Support Forces described the clashes as a “cowardly act” and a “treacherous attack” by the Sudanese Armed Forces. Fighting continued in Khartoum on 15 and 16 April. Significant fighting was also reported in El Fasher in North Darfur, El Obeid in North Kordofan, Nyala in South Darfur and Kassala in Kassala State. The insecurity resulting from the fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces led Gedaref, Kassala, White Nile, Al-Gazira, River Nile and Red Sea States to declare a state of emergency.  12. Fighting, including the use of air strikes, continued the following days in various parts of Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. On 17 April, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release announcing a formal decision taken by Lieutenant General Al-Burhan to dissolve the Rapid Support Forces. The United Nations, with the support of Member States, negotiated partial humanitarian pauses on 16 and 17 April. The parties did not, however, meaningfully adhere to them. On 20 April, a three-day humanitarian pause over Eid al-Fitr was brokered by the United Nations in close coordination with Sudanese and international and regional partners. While this resulted in a reduction in the level of fighting, clashes and air strikes continued, including in Khartoum, Darfur and North Kordofan. Many foreign embassies, international organizations and humanitarian aid organizations evacuated their personnel from Khartoum over several days, starting on 20 April. Many Sudanese civilians also fled Khartoum to safer areas, including to neighbouring countries.  13. On 24 April, the United States brokered a 72-hour ceasefire and secured the agreement of the warring parties on the establishment of a mechanism to oversee the negotiation, conclusion and implementation of a permanent cessation of hostilities and humanitarian arrangements. Each party appointed focal points. The ceasefire was only partially upheld. The two parties announced the extension of the 72-hour ceasefire twice further, on 27 and 30 April, following discussions with the trilateral mechanism and the Quadrilateral comprising the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States. Both parties, however, continued to accuse each other of violating the ceasefire. On 2 May, South Sudan announced that Lieutenant General Al-Burhan and Lieutenant General Dagalo had agreed, in principle, in telephone calls with the President, Salva Kiir Mayardit, to a seven-day ceasefire from 4 to 11 May.  14. In Darfur, the fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces was concentrated in North, South, Central and West Darfur. In East Darfur, the situation remained more stable, although skirmishes were reported. In North Darfur, on 20 April, the state governors – assisted by native administration and religious leaders, armed signatory movements of the Juba Peace Agreement and the Darfur Permanent Ceasefire Committee chaired by UNITAMS – negotiated a three-day local ceasefire for Eid al-Fitr, which contributed to significantly decreasing the violence. This truce was renewed indefinitely after the Eid al-Fitr period, contributing to relative calm. In West Darfur, fighting in El Geneina, near the Chadian border, that initially began on 15 April resumed on 25 April, along with reports of communities arming themselves and joining the fight. In Central Darfur, following initial clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in Zalingei, on 25 April a committee formed of community leaders announced a permanent ceasefire agreement between the parties and called upon the population to return to their homes. The situation there remains tense but stable. Heavy fighting was also experienced in North Kordofan State, particularly around El Obeid airport, resulting in civilian casualties as well as in displacements and the destruction of infrastructure.  15. In Eastern Sudan, fighting broke out on 15 April but quickly de-escalated. Calm gradually returned across the region, which is controlled mainly by the Sudanese Armed Forces. Port Sudan in Red Sea State became a main relocation and evacuation point for Member States and their nationals, the staff of international organizations and Sudanese nationals. This influx of people increased the challenges faced by the city in terms of accommodation and provision of basic services and the increased prices of commodities. Kassala and Gedaref States welcomed many internally displaced persons, mainly from Khartoum.  16. The outbreak of fighting in the Sudan was widely condemned. The Secretary-General and several world leaders urgently engaged with Lieutenant General Al-Burhan and Lieutenant General Dagalo, calling for an end to the violence. Throughout the remainder of the reporting period, the Secretary-General continued reaching out to the military leaders of the Sudan and worked closely with Member States and regional organizations to advocate for an immediate end to the fighting.  17. On 16 April, IGAD convened an extraordinary assembly of its heads of State and government, where it was agreed that the Presidents of Djibouti, Kenya and South Sudan would be dispatched to Khartoum. However, the ongoing fighting prevented their visit. On the same day, the League of Arab States held an emergency meeting, expressing its readiness to exert efforts to help the Sudan to end the crisis. The Peace and Security Council of the African Union also met on 16 April and called for an immediate ceasefire without conditions and decided to undertake a field mission to the Sudan to engage with the stakeholders. On 20 April, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission convened a virtual ministerial-level meeting, bringing together leaders of the United Nations, IGAD, the European Union, the League of Arab States and representatives of Member States. In the communiqué issued following the meeting, participants called upon the parties to end the violence, resume dialogue and establish “humanitarian corridors”. Participants also agreed to coordinate their respective initiatives. The African Union Commission convened a follow-up meeting on 2 May in Addis Ababa to further assess the situation and coordinate efforts. On 3 May in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the Executive Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held an emergency meeting, calling upon Sudanese parties to cease military escalation and return to dialogue.  18. At the national level, on 15 April, civilian signatory parties to the framework agreement called on the military leaders to immediately cease hostilities and prevent the country from a “total collapse”. Across Sudanese society, political figures and parties, business leaders, women’s rights groups, civil society and Sudanese citizens living abroad quickly joined the calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian support. Many resistance committees mobilized to provide urgent humanitarian support to civilians trapped in homes, injured or in need of food and water. On 27 April, a new civilian coalition composed of political parties, resistance committees, trade unions, women’s rights groups and 130 prominent public figures called for an end to the fighting and the restoration of democracy. They advocated for the complete withdrawal of the military institutions from politics, for security and military reform and for mitigating the attempts of the former regime to return to power. On 3 May, several Juba Peace Agreement signatories, including Minni Minawi, Gibril Ibrahim and Malik Agar, formed a “peace bloc”, affirming their opposition to the war. They called for the reintegration of the Rapid Support Forces and all armed movements into the Sudanese Armed Forces. They also advocated for the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement, including its security arrangements.  19. On 6 May, Saudi Arabia and the United States announced the start of “pre-negotiation talks” between representatives of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The two Member States urged both parties to actively engage in the talks towards a ceasefire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3JlbGllZndlYi5pbnQvcmVwb3J0L3N1ZGFuL3NpdHVhdGlvbi1zdWRhbi1hbmQtYWN0aXZpdGllcy11bml0ZWQtbmF0aW9ucy1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLXRyYW5zaXRpb24tYXNzaXN0YW5jZS1taXNzaW9uLXN1ZGFuLXJlcG9ydC1zZWNyZXRhcnktZ2VuZXJhbC1zMjAyMzM1NS1lbmFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Borussia Dortmund have managed to add yet another young talent to the club with the signing of 15 year old winger Ousmane Diallo. The youngster is set to sign for Dortmund’s U-19 side, which will significantly increase the talent pool in Dortmund’s youth ranks. Diallo is currently with Deportivo Alavés, but will look to join the German side in what will be another coup for Die Schwarzgelben.  Diallo was sought after by clubs such as Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, but according to Ruhr Nachrichten, Dortmund have won the proverbial tug of war over the U-16 Spanish international. Earlier reports had suggested that Bayern were in the pole position to sign the highly rated talent, but the tide has clearly swung in favor of their title-rivals.  Diallo, as a player, is renowned for his ability in one on one scenarios, dribbling and the pace he exhibits on the pitch. The player is considered a huge talent so Dortmund will have brought him in with a clear path to the first team in mind. He will quite possibly follow in the footsteps of the likes of Jadon Sancho, Youssoufa Moukoko and Jamie-Bynoe Gittens to become one of Dortmund’s lethal attacking options.  If Borussia Dortmund’s track record is anything it go by, Diallo could certainly become part of the first team setup within the next couple of years. With the market as inflated as it is, long term investments in youth players will become more and more important for BVB and other clubs to maintain a sustainable recruitment model.  Of course, Borussia Dortmund have been slowly moving away from just molding young, talented gems and focusing on bringing in more established players as well, but having a strong pool of youth to choose from will help the team sprinkle both vibrance and creative flair amongst the more established players they continue to target. This will ensure that Dortmund will hopefully have a far more balanced squad in the coming years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYnZiYnV6ei5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9ib3J1c3NpYS1kb3J0bXVuZC1zZXQtdG8tc2lnbi10YWxlbnRlZC1zcGFuaXNoLXdpbmdlci1vdXNtYW5lLWRpYWxsby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1976-03-24","Not Discerned","{""LaPlata"", ""BuenosAires"", ""Argentina""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:48:37","The Federal Court Number 1 of La Plata will begin a new trial today against 19 military and police officers, as well as a former Buenos Aires province minister, for crimes against humanity involving some 200 victims committed at two detention centers located on police dependencies during the 1976-1983 dictatorship.  The two centers operated at the Infantry Corps of the Buenos Aires Province Police, and the 8th Precinct, both located in La Plata. All the people on trial are accused of illegal imprisonment, torture, and sexual abuse committed against 210 victims, the majority of whom survived and are expected to testify.  One of the victims was construction worker and Peronist activist Julio López, who disappeared for a second time in 2006 after he testified against Miguel Etchecolatz, a former police officer who at the time was on trial for crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship. He remains unaccounted for until this day.  “This is a very important trial. In a way, these two procedures close the circle of the repression operation that took place in this jurisdiction,” said Juan Martín Nogueira, assistant district attorney of the Prosecutors Unit, to Télam.  “These two sites were an important part of the system of concentration camps of those years.”  The Infantry Corps was in fact operational even before the 1976 coup, a place that saw the early rise of certain repressive tactics that would later evolve into the kidnapping and disappearance of political militants, union members, and random victims.  “It started operating as a detention center immediately after March 24, 1976, when the dictatorship began, and remained operational until December of that year,” says the indictment presented to the court. Detainees could spend a considerable amount of time there until their fate was decided.  “Following the coup, numerous people that had been previously identified were detained. In the early morning hours of March 24 and the days that followed, people who had been labeled ‘dangerous’ were kidnapped by military forces and sent to the Infantry Corps,” according to the indictment.  Detainees included employees and union leaders from companies like YPF, Río Santiago Shipyard, and Swift Refrigerating Plant, among others.  The 8th Precinct, on the other hand, was an epicenter of a different stage of the dictatorship. It was known as a center where people who had been kidnapped and kept at other locations were sent to, either to be released or imprisoned at a formal jail.  They were moved there during the night, usually in army trucks or unidentified vehicles that belonged to the military. The precinct stands out as a singular location, as it functioned as a place where victims were brought out of clandestine imprisonments and subjected to formal procedures.

Youssef Chelbi and Dhia Nsir were arrested on Wednesday after posting a clip on Tik Tok and Facebook showing them laughing and singing a sarcastic song upbraiding the police over treatment of detainees and a drugs law.  Their arrest on charges of insulting others through social networks alarmed rights activists and bloggers, who republished the song to show solidarity with them. They said freedoms in Tunisia were under siege and that it has become a large prison.  Saied, in a video posted on the presidency's Facebook page, said he was ""deeply surprised"" by the arrests as it was ""totally unacceptable to arrest two young men who were just singing a song"", and he urged the judiciary to its duty and release them.  Dozens of journalists and activists protested on Thursday against restrictions of freedoms and trials targeting journalists and bloggers. Some Tunisians posted other satirical songs criticising the police on social media.  Freedom of speech and media were key gains for Tunisians after the 2011 revolution that ousted autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered the Arab Spring protests.  Saied himself has drawn accusations of oppression since he shut down parliament in 2021 and seized all powers in moves that his opponents call a coup. He pledged to protect ordinary rights and freedoms and vowed not to be a dictator.  But activists and journalists say freedom of speech faces a serious threat under Saied's rule.  ""These are dark times..Freedom of speech is increasingly hit. About 20 journalists and bloggers are being pursued because of posts or positions against authorities,"" journalists' union chief Mahdi Jlassi said.

"coup","2023-07-01","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:18:54","Germany’s arrests of two Turkish journalists from Sabah, a sister newspaper of Daily Sabah, has demonstrated the European country’s double standard regarding press freedom. Often critical of Türkiye for arrests and conviction of terror suspects also working as journalists, Germany found itself in hot water after Ismail Erel and Cemil Albay were detained in a dawn raid in Frankfurt on Wednesday.  Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu hit out at Berlin over arrests at a news conference yesterday. Referring to the German ambassador’s reply to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanju Bilgiç after the former was summoned to the ministry, Çavuşoğlu slammed the double standards of Germany over press freedom. “(The ambassador) said press freedom had limits. Those who highlighted press freedom when Türkiye investigated journalists for support to the PKK terrorist group and those involved in the coup plot (by the Gülenist Terror Group, or FETÖ) raided Sabah over a complaint of FETÖ members,” he said. Çavuşoğlu said Germany’s real intent was to intimidate those who were arrested, “because they published articles shedding light on FETÖ and supporters of the PKK. This incident laid bare the double standard of Germany, which attempts to teach freedom of press and expression to the world,” he said.  Erel and Albay were released after several hours in detention as police raided their homes, seizing their phones, laptops and electronic storage devices. After their release, the duo said they would seek legal rights over “being treated like terrorists.” Erel said their arrest stemmed from “a false complaint” and said they would file a lawsuit against those who filed that complaint for slander. Cevheri Güven, a fugitive member of FETÖ, was behind the complaints against journalists.  Erel said he discovered the raid when his frightened daughter alerted him. “I looked out the window and about 20-30 policemen were standing below. When I turned around, I saw the cops entering our bedroom.” He said although he told the police that they could not enter his house like this and that a journalist could keep its sources confidential, they confiscated every mobile phone, digital media and tablet computer they found. “The search lasted three and half hours. Then we were taken to the police headquarters in Darmstadt,” he said. “I stayed there for about four and half hours.”  Albay also said that his house was raided simultaneously after the “false” complaint by Cevheri Güven. Noting that the search lasted four and a half hours, he said dogs were used in the search. Albay said everything digital, including his mobile phone, computers, external disks and memories, was confiscated during the investigation. “They also towed my vehicle to the police headquarters, and they searched it,” he said. “We were held at the police headquarters for about five hours.” Describing the way he was detained was similar to “a terrorist, an agent,"" Albay said: “After we were taken to the police headquarters, our fingerprints, palm prints, our photos were taken. In other words, we were treated like a terrorist.”  The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the arrests, calling them “heinous.”  “The detention of Frankfurt Bureau representatives of Sabah newspaper by the German police today without justification is an act of harassment and intimidation against the Turkish press. We strongly condemn this heinous act,” the ministry said.  Abdurrahman Şimşek, the news coordinator for the Sabah newspaper, said Wednesday that they also lost contact with some 30 freelancer journalists working for them in Germany in the aftermath of the arrests and they did not know their whereabouts. The newspaper is known for its investigative reporting on members of FETÖ, which is behind a 2016 coup attempt in Türkiye. It traced several members of the terrorist group in Germany in the past. Ankara often complains that Berlin gives a safe haven for FETÖ and the PKK. However, it is believed that hundreds of FETÖ members received asylum from Germany after the coup attempt.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3R1cmtpeWUtZGVjcmllcy1zby1jYWxsZWQtZ2VybWFuLXByZXNzLWZyZWVkb20tYXMtam91cm5vcy1hcnJlc3RlZC9uZXdz0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlzYWJhaC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvdHVya2l5ZS1kZWNyaWVzLXNvLWNhbGxlZC1nZXJtYW4tcHJlc3MtZnJlZWRvbS1hcy1qb3Vybm9zLWFycmVzdGVkL25ld3MvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-01","17:00:00","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:09:00","You’ve probably heard the phrase, ‘It’s a make or miss league.’  There are many situations for it, and it’s used by just about everyone. Players. Coaches. Fans. Media. It’s a factual statement, sure. Some shots go in, some don’t. Not exactly a novel observation. The words, however, are not the meaning. The meaning comes from the when and where and how it is applied – the why is almost always to explain away the unexplainable. A verbal shrug.  “How did that guy score so many points down the stretch?”  “Sometimes, it’s a make or miss league.”  More need not be said after that. It’s understood that something special must have occurred, something beyond schematics and strategy and adjustments. Something magical.  Time and time again over the past month, the exploits of the Miami HEAT have been best, and perhaps only, explained by that phrase. How did they, the No. 25 ranked team in Offensive Rating this year, put up one of the best postseason shotmaking games of the past decade – literally the fifth best at 19.6 percent shooting over expectations, per Second Spectrum’s tracking data – in Game 1 against one of the best defenses in the league in Milwaukee? It’s a make or miss league. How did they follow up a regular season in which they shot 34.4 percent from three, fourth-worst, by shooting 45 percent across five games – something they did not do across any five-game stretch all season – to knock off the No. 1 seeded Bucks? Make or miss league. Bring up small sample sizes all you want, but every other team is working within the same small samples and they aren’t doing this.  How, then, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston, did Miami put up its second game of this posteason over 50 percent from three? How did they shoot an effective field-goal percentage of 75.5 on their 49 jumpers, the third-best postseason performance of the past 10 seasons? How did they win despite one of the worst Shot Quality games of any team in these playoffs – sixth-worst of 152 games – while Boston posted one of the best?  How did they score a franchise-postseason best 46 points in the third quarter?  It’s a make or miss league.  Drilling down on make or miss qualities is a bit like trying to explain Movie Magic. That thing you know when you see it, when you feel it, when you’re transported to another plane of experience by it but you can’t quite put your finger right on what it is. It’s there when Victor Laszlo leads a rendition of La Marseillaise at Rick’s Café. It’s there as Jesse watches Celine dance to Nina Simone. It’s everywhere as Max Rockatansky watches a sandstorm sweep up the war boys’ convoy, or as Indiana Jones chases down the Lost Ark on horseback.  What is it, exactly? Forget it, it’s magic. But that magic is the product of work – of blood, sweat and tears poured into a project over years by people in different departments with different skillsets. It’s work coming together to create something beautiful.  In so much as there is beauty in a shot going through the net – and there damn sure is – Miami isn’t so different. They’re making their own movie, albeit one being recorded live, the results free of post-production. The magic of it all may be unexplainable, but the work isn’t. Part of enjoying a little luck is preparing yourself for the possibility of it.  The work builds confidence in isolation, but it comes from your environment, too. From encouragement. This was always going to be a series about Jimmy Butler – tying his season-high with six mid-range jumpers – and Bam Adebayo. Boston switches as well as any team, on and off the ball, and eventually switches are going to dig your offense a deep enough hole that only one-on-one scoring can pull you out of. Butler and Adebayo – his bursts of aggressiveness in the first and third quarters, attacking both Al Horford and Robert Williams, offering stability in times of need – producing 26 points on 21 combined isolations – was as much a reason for Miami taking a 1-0 lead in this series as any other. They also give just as much if not more than they take, creating opportunities for everyone around them and telling them to shoot, demanding that they shoot, regardless of make or miss.  “Huge, huge credit to our guys who are playmaking for us. [Butler, Lowry], Bam is getting doubled, you see he’s making plays off the double teams. Guys are getting us open looks, we have to do our job and knock them down,” Caleb Martin says. “We just have to be ready when we get the ball. No overthinking stuff, no second-guessing stuff, just be confident in your craft.”  Adebayo has been seeing extra defenders crowd his catches all season, a byproduct of Spoelstra refocusing the offense around him and defenses making the requisite adjustments. Now those reps are paying dividends.  Celtics Game 1: Bam Double Assist  Max Strus wasn’t second guessing himself, either. This is going to come off as the most minute of minutiae, but during that explosive third quarter Strus hit just the third three of his career – first in a playoff game – off four or more dribbles. Five minutes later he hit another, this one after seven dribbles.  Those are not shots Strus is taking, much less making, without being afforded the freedom and confidence to do so.  “We got two guys, our stars, that give us all the confidence that we need,” says Kyle Lowry, whose 13 points in the second quarter prevented a Boston lead from getting out of hand. “I'm dead serious. Jimmy and Bam and these guys and our coaching staff, and we know the work that we put in. When you have guys that are so unselfish and give us the confidence to do it, we are going to do it. We don't want to let them down.  “Even if we miss shots, they are still like, ‘Shoot it again’. That gives us all the confidence that we need.”  Preparation, from coaching, helps, too. Against the Bucks and their mostly conservative, paint-protecting drop coverage, players knew where and when they could get a shot. A couple dribbles off a screen and there would be space to pull up. Boston’s scheme is more complicated than that, and it will evolve from here, but many of the shots earned in Game 1 were far from surprising. Preparation builds expectations.  Celtics Game 1: Caleb Martin Corner Help Threes  “They were kind of expected,” Martin said of the shots the team was getting. “The way we got them today, they’re coming to double, they’re overhelping from corners.”  It’s a testament to the quality of their opponent that Miami didn’t win this one going away. The Celtics were determined to get into the paint in the first half and there wasn’t much the HEAT could do about it. Just as in Game 1 against the Knicks, 40 points in the paint were surrendered in the first half. And just as in that game, an honest assessment begat results.  “We have a great video group, and they put up all the stats at half,” Adebayo said. “[They] basically showed us where we were wrong and how we can improve in the second half. So after watching it and talking to the coaches, we are honest with one another, look each other in the eye and say how we feel and what we need to get done.”  Boston proceeded to score 22 in the paint in the second half – about the same number of drives, only less efficient drives. There was no cure-all adjustment. Butler denied Jayson Tatum the ball when he could. Miami did a better job forcing turnovers, Tatum and Brown combining for 10 of their team’s 15 evoking some of the HEAT’s best moments of last year’s series. They also just did what they do, shrinking the floor and defending with physicality, and did it better.  “It’s just a mentality,” Gabe Vincent said. “Sometimes you have to get punched in the mouth to wake up a little bit.”  Even with all that, with the shots pouring in to silence yet another raucous crowd and the defense once again righting itself mid-game, Miami had to win in the small, fleeting moments. They had to win in the margins, in Butler recovering off his own drive to crash the glass and earn an and-one, or recovering his own deflected miss at the rim to extend a possession which led to a three. They needed Malcolm Brogdon, helping off the strong-side corner, to close out to Cody Zeller at the three-point line rather than Strus mere feet away. The needed Al Horford to chase his own missed three from the slot, leading to a Kevin Love transition triple, or for Marcus Smart to hold his follow through and watch his own shot as Strus leaked out for a touchdown pass. They needed Williams to save a rebound under Boston’s basket for Love to lay up for an easy two.  They needed all those things for perhaps the single best offensive quarter in franchise playoff history, and it was only enough for a five-point lead with two minutes to play. That’s how small the margin for error is in this series, how many win conditions need to converge for an actual victory.  None of that will matter to this team. They don’t care what had to happen for them to win, only that they win. Whether that is a rational approach or not as each game is picked apart in the hours after the final buzzer, it doesn’t matter. They got here by finding a way, but not always the same way. Why should they care what way it is?  We can all sit back and say what is or isn’t sustainable. Logically, it can all make sense. Mathematically, it can check out, even when dealing with small sample sizes. A shot profile doesn’t matter much when you make all your shots, but Boston has reasons to feel good about this game, too. They can take their own solace in sustainability. Some things just can’t continue.  But try telling all that to Milwaukee.  TIDBITS  -The HEAT are now one of 16 teams to have two games in a single postseason of 50 percent shooting on at least 25 tree-point attempts. Cleveland, in 2015-16, has the record with four. Teams are now 19-1 when shooting that well in a Conference Finals or Finals game, with the lone loss coming from Orlando in 1995. Miami notably shot that well in their title-clinching Game 5 of the 2012 Finals against Oklahoma City, otherwise known as The Mike Miller Game.  -NBA teams are now 135-3 when posting an effective field-goal percentage of .635 or better in a postseason game. One of those three losses came from Boston in their Game 1 loss to Philadelphia.  -Miami used zone for six possessions in Game 1, against which Boston scored 1.50 points-per.  -Butler’s eight made jumpers are tied for the second most he’s made in any game in a HEAT uniform, matched by his Game 6 performance against Boston last season. The best jumper game of his Miami career, when he made 11, came in his 56-point masterpiece against Milwaukee in Game 4 this year.  -Boston’s 29 threes were the second fewest they’ve attempted in the postseason. They took 26 threes in their Game 1 loss to Philadelphia.  -Boston scored 1.24 points-per direct pick-and-roll, on 64 picks, while the HEAT produced 1.06. Miami actually switched more screens, 27 to Boston’s 21, and while the Celtics were more efficient when they attacked their switches both teams wound up scoring 1.33 points-per across all possessions which featured a switch (but were not necessarily used by the player drawing the initial switch).  -Adebayo’s five post-ups, producing nine points, were a postseason high.  -The last time Kyle Lowry scored 13 points in a postseason quarter was Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors in 2019. The highest scoring quarter of his playoff career is 18 points back in 2016.  -Representative of the shifts Spoelstra made to his offense this season, which were largely in response to how Miami’s offense struggled against the Celtics, Miami ran just 15.6 handoffs per 100 possessions in Game 1, at 0.80 points-per. In last year’s Eastern Conference Finals, they used 28 per 100, but those handoffs produced just 0.68 points-per.  -A little perspective from Boston’s side when it comes to that game-turning third quarter:  “The only thing we need to adjust to is picking up our physicality and playing some damn defense,” Marcus Smart said. “That's the only thing they switched. They didn't change anything from the first half that they weren't doing, they just upped their physicality and that's it. There's nothing tactical, X's and O's, it's just come out and guard your yard.”  That phrase, ‘Guard your yard’, has been one of Adebayo’s favorites over the years, but it tends to come up especially in the context of Boston matchups.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vaGVhdC9uZXdzL2NvdXAtY2VsdGljcy1nYW1lLTEtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtZW5lcmd5LWppbW15LWJ1dGxlci1oZWF0LW1ha2Utb3ItbWlzc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:38:30","Like any draft, New York's display at the 2023 NFL Draft was a collaborative affair. It's the culmination of countless hours of film study and in-person scouting from a number of people across the organization, and then it's up to the top brass to take in all that information and finalize their board.  With the Giants, they were faced with a situation where the top two players remaining on their board were still to be had as they neared their next selection at No. 57 overall. A video released by the team showed the moments that closed in on that pick, which revealed conversations between GM Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll where they two were down to either center John Michael Schmitz or wide receiver Jalin Hyatt.  New York's draft room watched as the Chicago Bears traded up in front of them, which led to them figuring they'd swoop in and take one of those two players. Instead, the Bears selected Miami corner Tyrique Stevenson and the Giants followed up by taking Schmitz. While they passed on Hyatt at that spot, the Tennessee wideout was still on the board as the draft turned to the third round. It was around that stage of the draft that Daboll picked up his phone, leaned over to Shoen and said, ""Let me text [Sean] McVay."" The two then brokered a deal with Los Angeles to move up to No. 73 overall through the text channel between the head coaches.  ""You're going to execute your first trade, Dabes,"" Schoen said to Daboll as the video showed them in the war room hammering out the deal.  New York settled on sending the No. 89th overall pick and their fourth rounder (No. 128) to the Rams in exchange for the 73rd pick to go up and select Hyatt.  ""Daboll's first trade,"" Schoen said to the room while patting his head coach on the back after officially executing the trade-up.  In a rather remarkable move, the Giants were able to come away with both players they would have been thrilled to take in the second round, which is a major coup for the front office. As it relates to Hyatt -- a selection that earned a B+ from CBS Sports NFL Draft analyst Chris Trapasso -- New York gets a speedster that Daboll can now utilize to help stretch the field in 2023 and beyond.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzL2hvdy1icmlhbi1kYWJvbGwtaGVscGVkLWZhY2lsaXRhdGUtZ2lhbnRzLXRyYWRpbmctdXAtaW4tbmZsLWRyYWZ0LXRvLXNlbGVjdC1yZWNlaXZlci1qYWxpbi1oeWF0dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(AP Photo/Armando Franca, File)  The Vatican has recalled a postage stamp promoting this year’s World Youth Day in Portugal following complaints that it celebrated Portugal’s colonial empire and the nationalist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar  ROME -- The Vatican has recalled a postage stamp promoting this year’s World Youth Day in Portugal following complaints that it celebrated Portugal’s colonial empire and the nationalist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar at a time when the Holy See has been atoning for colonial-era abuses.  The stamp, which was still available for purchase online Thursday, features Pope Francis leading a group of children up Lisbon’s Monument to the Discoveries. The giant stone and concrete monument was built in 1960 to mark the 500th anniversary of the death of Henry the Navigator, one of the masterminds of Portugal's maritime expansion in the 15th century.  The monument, which is located on the north bank of the Tagus River in Lisbon, is repudiated by some in Portugal because it was built by and during the Salazar dictatorship as part the government’s push to promote national identity and feats such as the country’s colonial expansion in Africa.  The postage stamp, which features the World Youth Day logo and retails for 3.10 euros ($3.30), was issued last week by the Vatican’s numismatic and philatelic office. The office is a major contributor to the Vatican City State’s budget through its in-person and online sales of commemorative coins, medallions and stamps, which are often sought-after collectors' items.  The city state administration, however, said in a statement late Wednesday that it was withdrawing the stamp “and is in the process of providing a new stamp as a replacement.”  The controversy is particularly acute given the Vatican only in March formally repudiated the “Doctrine of Discovery,” the theories backed by 15th-century “papal bulls” that legitimized Spain and Portugal’s colonial-era conquests and seizures of lands in Africa and the Americas.  Francis, history’s first Latin American pope, has apologized repeatedly to Native peoples for colonial-era crimes and abuses committed by Catholic missionaries.  Italian media quoted a Vatican-based Portuguese bishop, Carlos Azevedo, as saying the stamp was in “poor taste” and not reflective of Francis’ message of brotherhood.  “Certainly Pope Francis doesn’t identify with this nationalist image that contradicts universal fraternity as well as his magisterium,” Azevedo was quoted as saying.  Francis is due to travel to Lisbon in August to close out World Youth Day, the weeklong youth rally that St. John Paul II launched to energize young Catholics in their faith. The event, which usually occurs every three years, was postponed for a year due to the pandemic.  Salazar governed Portugal from the 1930s to 1968 and died in 1970. A 1974 military coup toppled the dictatorship, opening the way for Portugal to pull out of unpopular wars in its African colonies and grant them independence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvdmF0aWNhbi1yZWNhbGxzLXN0YW1wLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLXBvcnR1Z2Fscy1jb2xvbmlhbC1lbXBpcmUtYWZ0ZXItOTk0MjkyNzjSAX1odHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dpcmVTdG9yeS92YXRpY2FuLXJlY2FsbHMtc3RhbXAtY2VsZWJyYXRpbmctcG9ydHVnYWxzLWNvbG9uaWFsLWVtcGlyZS1hZnRlci05OTQyOTI3OA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-09-14","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:24:00","Welcome to the Liberty’s superteam era.  After a dramatic offseason in which the Liberty completed an ambitious blueprint by bringing three superstar targets to Brooklyn, they vaulted to status as WNBA co-favorites alongside the defending champion Las Vegas Aces.  Now, beginning with Friday night’s regular-season opener in Washington against the Mystics, they’re carrying the hopes of delivering the original WNBA franchise’s first championship — which would be New York City’s first pro basketball title in 50 years.  “To have those expectations, that means we’ve earned them, right?” Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said. “That’s from this offseason and we embrace those expectations, but we know what comes with them.”  The Liberty’s aggressive offseason tipped in January, when they acquired 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones in a blockbuster three-team trade.  Jones, a four-time All-Star forward, requested to be traded to New York with one year left on a two-year deal in Connecticut, where she had led two Sun teams to the finals, including last season.  Former No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu signed a contract extension with the Liberty this week. Noah K. Murray-NY Post  The Liberty also added valuable forward Kayla Thornton from Dallas in the deal.  Then came the monumental signing of Breanna Stewart, the WNBA’s most sought-after free agent — perhaps the biggest free agent in the history of a league that only in recent years empowered players to choose their destinations — following a multi-year, cross-continental courtship.  Stewart, the 2018 MVP and a two-time champion with the Seattle Storm, previously met with the Liberty as a free agent before the 2022 season.  This time around, as a Liberty contingent led by co-owner Clara Wu Tsai flew to Istanbul for a meeting with Stewart, the 28–year-old all-world forward teased fans for weeks with emoji-filled tweets that hinted at her next career move.  Courtney Vandersloot, one of the top point guards in league history, topped off the Liberty’s coup by signing a few days after Stewart, as a package deal, after spending 12 seasons with the Chicago Sky, with whom she won a title in 2021.  Stewart and Vandersloot each took well south of their maximum salaries to fit under the salary cap with the Liberty — Stewart on a one-year deal, Vandersloot on a two-year deal.  Courtney Vandersloot and Breanna Stewart came aboard in a massive offseason coup for the Liberty.  They join the team’s most prominent holdover, 2020 No. 1 pick and 2022 All-Star guard Sabrina Ionescu, who this week agreed to a two-year contract extension to stay with the team through 2025.  “We have a very talented roster and now it’s just about how we can play together,” Stewart said. “And with the facilities and staff and everyone around us — everyone wants to be great. So, when you’re surrounded by greatness, it’s a lot easier for you to be like ‘All right, I’m gonna do my best today.’ ”  The battle lines already have been drawn between these new-look Liberty and the Aces, who had an eventful offseason of their own.  The Aces added the legendary Candace Parker on a bargain contract to a core that features two-time MVP A’ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and Chelsea Gray.  They also were embroiled in a controversy over head coach Becky Hammon’s alleged bullying comments to former player Dearica Hamby.  Sabrina Ionescu and Breanna Stewart.  The high expectations and Aces rivalry talk that marked the offseason have not been lost on the Liberty.  “Coming into this market, you already know you have a huge target on your back,” Stewart said. “But now because everyone is talking about all these narratives and the biggest free agency and whatever, people want to beat us the moment we walk in the gym.”  But it’s also befitting a megawatt roster that bears little resemblance to the Liberty teams that went 2-20 as recently as 2020 and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs the past two years.  The Liberty have not made it to the second round since 2017, the semifinal round since 2015 and the WNBA Finals since 2002, the franchise’s fourth runner-up finish in the league’s first six years.  “We want to win,” said head coach Sandy Brondello, in her second year with the team. “We’ve got all these great players. Winning a championship, that’s the ultimate goal. But … we don’t win championships in the preseason. We don’t win them in the start of the season, we win them at the end.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2xpYmVydHktZW50ZXItc2Vhc29uLXdpdGgtbWFzc2l2ZS13bmJhLXRpdGxlLWhvcGVzL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2xpYmVydHktZW50ZXItc2Vhc29uLXdpdGgtbWFzc2l2ZS13bmJhLXRpdGxlLWhvcGVzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Myanmar’s junta is threatening stiff prison terms and even the death penalty under a law regulating weapons ownership that analysts say aims to instill fear in supporters of the armed resistance.  The new Weapons Law, enacted on May 11, comes at a time when armed resistance to the military government, which took over in a 2021 coup, is spreading throughout the country.  “It appears to have been released with the intention of targeting urban guerrillas,” said Saya Kyaung, a spokesman for the Yangon UG Association, a rebel group. “This is simply an attempt to try to weaken the revolution.""  The law details restrictions on the right to bear, transfer and hold weapons, including the selling, production, distribution, import and export of firearms.  It states that a person who has purchased or is in possession of a weapon with an intent to commit treason – meaning fighting junta forces – can be sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.  It also states that stealing, destroying, selling or transferring state-owned weapons or the ammunition of government personnel is punishable by 10 years to life imprisonment, or a maximum penalty of a death sentence.

But it is also facing the threat of those weapons getting in the possession of the revolutionary PDF forces,” he said.  That’s why the law is a threat to the people of Myanmar, said Kyaw Zaw, spokesman for the president’s office of the shadow National Unity Government.  “The military council itself is an illegal entity. Therefore, they have no right to enact any law in Myanmar,” he said. “Since they are a bunch of criminals, they have absolutely no legal authority to declare a law or enact it. That’s why I first want to say that the law they have created is entirely illegal which is just mainly designed to scare the people.”  Translated by Myo Min Aung.

"coup","2023-09-17","12:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 07:42:24","Residents tell Al Jazeera of widespread destruction from the cyclone’s ferocious winds and say they have yet to receive assistance.  On Saturday, as “extremely severe” Cyclone Mocha gathered speed in the Indian Ocean and tracked a straight course for Myanmar’s northwestern Rakhine coast, Hla Tun made a critical decision.  While the vast majority of the residents of the seaside city of Sittwe, including his wife and daughter, headed inland or to higher ground, he instead taped up his windows, stocked up on food, and braced for the cyclone along with 11 neighbours who had taken shelter in his home.  “If I stay here, maybe I can save some people if the flooding or something serious happens,” he told Al Jazeera to explain his decision.  Less than 5 kilometres (3 miles) away, in a camp where ethnic Rohingya have been confined since fleeing clashes with the state’s majority Rakhine population in 2012, Si Thu also considered his options.  His low-lying camp, overcrowded with bamboo shelters, was unlikely to withstand heavy wind and flooding, so he and his family decided to go and stay with relatives in the nearby Rohingya village of Thae Chaung.  The next day at about noon, Cyclone Mocha swept across the Rakhine coast with wind speeds of up to 250kmph (155mph). Five hours later, it had left what the United Nations described as a “trail of devastation” in its wake, particularly in Sittwe.  “It is like a broken city,” said Hla Tun, who estimated that 95 percent of the houses in the Rakhine state capital had been damaged.  Setting out on his motorbike for the town of Kyauktaw, 100km (62 miles) inland, to find his family, he encountered collapsed bridges, destroyed farms and homes, and the body of a drowned Rohingya woman washed up in a pile of mud and debris.  He worried not only about the immediate days ahead but about how communities would survive the coming year.  “Many vulnerable households will not be able to build their houses again,” he said. “This is the farming season, but it is gone.”  From the Rohingya camp of Thet Kae Pyin, Si Thu told Al Jazeera that about 95 percent of the shelters had been obliterated and that at least 400 Rohingya were believed to have lost their lives.  Survivors, he said, were now facing a dramatic increase in the price of food and basic goods, as well as urgent medical and sanitation needs.  “A lot of people were hit by different kinds of materials,” he said. “Many people have died, but there is no one to clean it, and almost every toilet in the camp was totally destroyed.”  Hla Tun and Si Thu are using pseudonyms given the risk in Myanmar of speaking to the media.  While the full extent of the cyclone’s damage is still being assessed, initial reports indicate that it was the worst natural disaster to hit Myanmar since Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The UN reported that nearly 3.2 million people were likely to have humanitarian needs as a result of the storm, which in addition to Rakhine state, severely damaged homes, infrastructure and farms in parts of Chin state, Magway and Sagaing regions.  Many people in the affected regions live in areas with an active presence of armed groups who are opposed to the military, which seized power in a February 2021 coup and has since blocked humanitarian aid to areas harbouring armed resistance, according to numerous human rights and media reports.  The UN and its partners are waiting for permission to begin formally assessing needs in six priority townships in Rakhine state and to deliver initial distribution of emergency supplies. More in @ochamyanmar‘s latest #CycloneMocha update. 🌀https://t.co/5Y2YNt1JXI — Ben Small (@benjaminsmall) May 17, 2023  Even in places controlled by the military administration, including Sittwe, relief access remains uncertain. As of Thursday, humanitarian responders, including UN agencies and international aid groups, were still waiting for the military’s permission for them to go into six townships identified as the worst affected in Rakhine state or to begin distributing emergency supplies.  Many now fear a repeat of 2008, when Cyclone Nargis devastated the country’s Ayeyarwady Delta and more than 130,000 people died amid what Human Rights Watch described as the “brutal indifference of Burma’s military government to the welfare of its people”, using the old name of Myanmar.  “This is the most challenging time in my life,” said a Rakhine humanitarian worker with more than a decade of experience in the international aid sector speaking on the condition of anonymity due to concern about repercussions from his employer. “We have a lot of issues … a natural disaster [in areas affected by] armed conflict, intercommunal conflict … and where international communities are struggling to do their work effectively. We are in hell.”  ‘Pushed to the brink’  Twelve interviews conducted for this report indicate massive community needs as well as significant obstacles to the response in areas racked by war and underdevelopment. In hard-hit Rakhine, the situation appears to be particularly fraught.  The people of Rakhine are no stranger to hardship.  Intercommunal violence in 2012 resulted in more than 140,000 people displaced to camps, most of them Rohingya whose freedom of movement has since been severely restricted. Then a military campaign against the Rohingya in the state’s northern townships sent more than 740,000 fleeing to Bangladesh, in what is now being investigated as genocide.  Not long after, fighting flared between the military and Arakan Army, forcing tens of thousands of mostly Rakhine people from their homes over the next two years.  And then there was the February 2021 military coup, which on top of the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted what the UN described in January as an “unprecedented political, socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis” across the country.  An international peacebuilding specialist focusing on Rakhine, speaking on condition of anonymity out of concern for the safety of her colleagues in the country, told Al Jazeera that the cyclone was likely to deplete people’s savings and have severe long-lasting effects. “The scale leaves me breathless when I think about the worst-case scenario,” she said. “With this additional layer of suffering and vulnerability to hit communities this hard … it will push people to take more risks just to survive because they were already pushed to the brink.”      Particularly vulnerable are the 200,000 people who were already living in camps before the cyclone, including 140,000 Rohingya and other smaller minority groups.  Most of the ethnic Rakhine internally displaced people (IDPs) living in high-risk areas were moved to safety beforehand, but the vast majority of Rohingya were left behind – a factor which probably contributed to the deaths in the Sittwe area.  The military, which administers Sittwe through its State Administration Council, claimed on the state media to have evacuated more than 85,000 people in Rakhine state, including 62,000 from IDP camps, to safer ground in the days leading up to the storm – a number which could not be independently verified by Al Jazeera.  Interviews with six people on the ground in Rakhine, including four in Sittwe, in the days leading up to and after the cyclone, indicate that while independent volunteer groups were actively involved in the evacuation process in areas under military control, including for IDP populations, most of these evacuations were done through existing community networks and referrals, and did not include the Rohingya.  As the death toll continues to rise, some are now questioning whether international aid groups could have done more in the days before the cyclone.  “In Rakhine, there are over 30 INGOs including UN agencies, and several context analysts including disaster, but I will frankly say that they are very weak in preparedness and response,” said the Rakhine humanitarian worker. “The international aid community had time to respond before the cyclone, but they didn’t do enough.”  A UN press release published the day after the storm said preparations had been made.  “Authorities and humanitarian aid agencies launched a massive evacuation plan” before the storm, it said, without going into further detail.  The cyclone-affected areas of Chin, Sagaing and Magway face additional challenges.  Since the coup, the areas have seen the emergence of numerous armed resistance groups and have endured intense military attacks, leading to widespread civilian displacement which continued even during the cyclone.  Salai Tun, a member of an armed resistance group in Chin state’s southern Paletwa township who has been granted a pseudonym due to political sensitivities, told Al Jazeera that many local people were afraid to participate in cyclone preparation or relief efforts because of the risk of being exposed to military scrutiny. “If we volunteer or do social work … the SAC doesn’t like it and watches us with a slanted view,” he said, using an abbreviation for the State Administration Council, the formal name of the military administration. “We have become weak in social work.”  48 townships are still facing military-imposed shutdowns. There is significant overlap between the shutdown areas and the cyclone path, which is a major concern,as it’s hindering efforts to reach people with warnings and coordinate relief efforts. #CycloneMocha #KeepItOn #Myanmar pic.twitter.com/A3C9y4Uaqt — Htaike Htaike Aung (@barnyar) May 14, 2023  The UN has also repeatedly warned that landmines may have shifted during the cyclone due to heavy flooding. In 2022, 390 people were victims of landmines and unexploded ordnance in Myanmar, according to data compiled by the organisation.  “It will be very difficult to help people because we would have to go through the mountains and jungle,” said Salai Tun. “Because of exploding landmines … we can’t even try going to those places.”  Additionally, the township is one of 48 in the country, many in cyclone-affected areas, where the military has shut down the internet.  ‘Nobody came yet’  Military curbs on humanitarian access are not new. For years, its restrictions on travel authorisations have posed significant obstacles for aid organisations to reach vulnerable people in Rakhine.  Since the coup, the military has also obstructed aid across the country through means including arresting and attacking humanitarian workers, hindering road access, destroying relief supplies, and shutting down telecommunications services, according to rights groups and media reports.  In October, the military tightened its regulations on the aid sector, including by requiring international and local organisations to register with it and forbidding registered groups from providing aid in areas outside of its control or to those opposed to its rule.  “Organisations have since the time of the coup been operating with their hands tied, with a lot of suspicion from the military administration, a lot of interference, restrictions,” said the peacebuilding specialist. “Now all of that is going to come back and define how these organisations are going to be able to respond to the needs of cyclone-affected communities.”  The issue not only delays the relief response, but adds to pressure on UN agencies and international humanitarian organisations, which have come under heavy criticism since the coup for their continued engagement with the military.  While these organisations have generally justified this approach as necessary to maintain a presence in the country and reach those who need help, critics have argued that it serves to legitimise the military, and is ineffective when the military is losing control over vast swaths of the country.  Resistance groups, meanwhile, say they are open to international support for cyclone relief. On Monday, the United League of Arakan, which serves as the administrative arm of the Arakan Army and claims to control more than two-thirds of the state, released a statement calling for “immediate help and assistance” from overseas. A statement from its Humanitarian and Development Coordination Office also emphasised that the current situation required “global effort and international help”.  The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s publicly-supported administration vying for international recognition as the country’s legitimate government, also released a plea for international assistance in cyclone-hit areas under its jurisdiction.  The Rakhine humanitarian worker said he would like to see new approaches to aid.  “The international community must accept the real situation on the ground. SAC is not controlling the ground, especially in the rural areas and risk areas, these are mostly controlled by local [resistance] authorities,” he said. “Both the international and local community need to find a way to work with them.”  In a message sent to Al Jazeera on Thursday morning, a Myanmar-based staff member of an international organisation, speaking on the condition of anonymity for the protection of their organisation and office’s access, expressed concern that the military was “delaying first line humanitarian assistance until it felt it could organise and portray itself as a competent and authoritative first responder” as it did back in 2008.  While international relief groups wait for formal permission from the military, said the aid worker, some were attempting to deliver aid through local organisations and charities.  “There is an internal will to deliver humanitarian aid while also considering the potential repercussions from the junta,” they said.  Back in Sittwe, Si Thu is among thousands still waiting.  “We want international communities to help us as soon as possible because, after the cyclone, we are facing all kinds of difficulties,” he said. “Until now, there is no one to help us. Nobody came yet.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTgvc3Vydml2b3JzLXdhaXQtaW4taGVsbC1hZnRlci1jeWNsb25lLW1vY2hhLXB1bW1lbHMtbXlhbm1hctIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE4L3N1cnZpdm9ycy13YWl0LWluLWhlbGwtYWZ0ZXItY3ljbG9uZS1tb2NoYS1wdW1tZWxzLW15YW5tYXI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2017-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Amsterdam"", ""NoordHolland"", ""Netherlands""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:51:08","West Ham United manager David Moyes returns to AZ Alkmaar on Thursday night in hope of repeating his victory here in 2007, when his Everton side became the first team to ever inflict a European home loss on the Dutch side.  AZ had gone 32 games unbeaten at home in Europe, over a period spanning three decades, before their meeting with Moyes in 2007, when Everton won 3-2 in the UEFA Cup.  The Dutch team have remained formidable at home ever since, with Arsenal and Manchester United among the clubs who have failed to win at the AFAS Stadion in recent seasons, and they are unbeaten in their last 25 European home games.  Moyes said he has fond memories of that night in 2007 as he looks to guide his West Ham team past AZ and into the final of the Europa Conference League. West Ham lead 2-1 following last week’s first leg at the London Stadium.  “I have been here and won before,” said Moyes. “I remember it well. I have to try to do that again tomorrow night. That’s the job. I remember it because I have so much respect for Louis van Gaal and he was the [AZ] coach at that time. I was still a very young coach learning my way.  “I have always enjoyed coming to the Netherlands, I have always enjoyed coming here to play in youth tournaments, to be around watching football. I remember that night quite well.”  West Ham were knocked out at the semi-final stage of last season’s Europa League, when they were defeated by Eintracht Frankfurt, and will look to use that loss as motivation on Thursday night.  Asked about the loss to Frankfurt a year ago, midfielder Tomas Soucek said: “I have not watched the game [back] because I was so disappointed for many days and even months. Even now. We want to give our fans this chance to get to the final. I think we are even more motivated than last year.  “We are very happy that it is in our hands, but we don’t want to come here and defend the result. We want to play our way.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9mb290YmFsbC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2F6LWFsa21hYXItdnMtd2VzdC1oYW0tbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1jb25mZXJlbmNlLWxlYWd1ZS11cGRhdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1973-09-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:27:49","“Return, with a withered forehead,  the snowflakes of time gave me silvery temples!  To feel that life is but a short breath,  that 20 years is nothing!…”  “Volver” (Return), A tango. By Carlos Gardel & Alfredo Lepera  I grew up in the South of the American continent. “Volver” (Return) a tango sung by the famous Argentinian crooner Carlos Gardel, accompanied me more than the other “Volver, Volver,” of the also iconic Mexican singer Vicente Fernández.  My parents sang that tango all the time. They did it very well. Since I was a little boy, I heard that “20 years is nothing!” and the phrase twirled inside my brain. How could that be true? “How can it be that 20 years is nothing?” I asked myself. My question made sense. At 8 years of age, life seems infinite. If we are lucky, life will regale us with a countless myriad of emotions and places to discover. 20 years, when you are a child, is a long space. An eternity.  As we go on living, new experiences regale us with new perspectives.  Sept. 11 of this year 2023 will mark 50 years since the Military Coup in Chile. 50 years!  It truly seems an eternity. Today, I can sing the verses of Gardel’s “Volver” and really feel that 20 years is nothing. Especially if we sing the remembrances of that fateful Sept. 11. Alive, still burning in our brains. “Our little Sept. 11,” many Chileans say, with more than a bit of irony, comparing it to “the Other Sept. 11,” the one that occurred in the USA in 2001.  All over the world, Chileans and people from all nations prepare to commemorate that “Little Sept. 11,” which ushered 17 years of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Today, that dictatorship has been replaced by a fragile and puzzling democracy, not as representative as it could be.  From Europe, a Chilean exile asked me to write about “a thing” which I hid when the military Coup happened. Something which I simply could not abandon. Books, music, photos, weapons?  Of course, I hid things! I believe that many of us, people forced to disguise, rapidly and radically, whichever we think or are because Death hovers all around us, still might take the time to safeguard a significant something.  Illustration: Bruno Ferreira  Before any mentions of objects, I think that we must first remember people, those human beings who also had to hide. Or disguise. Because they had to leave the country, or because they chose to keep on fighting in Chile in a militant secrecy…or simply to survive the untied fascism. Fascism capable of killing anyone for the mere sin of having a beard, or long hair, or because they might possess “a dangerous book.” A book on “The Art of Cubism” (CUBA!), long hair, a beard, or “a foreign accent”, caused the death of many people. I know, personally, of a few examples.  When Sept. 11, 1973 happened I was in my mid-twenties and living in Chile. At that fateful time, I discovered how precarious was the situation for those of us who defended the government of Salvador Allende.  On the second night of the military-mandated curfew, when the time to stay off the streets was getting close and death was the likely penalty for wandering after 10 p.m., various persons knocked on the door of my house. That night — and for straight 3 weeks — many young leftists, men and women, some of them well-known leaders in their respective parties, came to my house for temporary asylum. I never learned how “the word” was spread that I was a trustworthy “helper.” Three weeks later, for reasons that I also ignored, the knocks on my door ceased.  A great reason for the problems that the Left has had (and keeps on having), not just in Chile but worldwide, is the lack of mutual trust, the absence of open communication, and sectarianism. During those three weeks after Sept. 11., when my house was mysteriously designated “a safety house,” extremely compelling conversations took place. My temporary guests engaged each other eagerly. Those exchanges should have happened earlier and more often. They are still necessary. In the precarious safety of that 1973 house, the passionate arguments happened sotto voce: the neighbor — a retired Army colonel — supported the new regime.  I am sorry to say that some of those friends who came to briefly hide in my house, later lost their lives. Some were cruelly murdered, and others fought until the bitter end, trapped in very unequal confrontations with the military and police forces of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.  When “The Coup” took place we learned right away that saving a life is more important than saving anything. Houses, cars, books, everything was abandoned with neither doubt nor repentance.  Nevertheless, I did not only hide people. I also helped to hide books, paintings and even weapons. In this last category, I recall a night when one of the members of our dance/theater group came to my house with her elderly mother. They wanted to hide some old weapons, two pistols, used in the Spanish Civil War of 1936. That family of exiled “Republicanos,” losers of the war, had treasured those pistols for many years. Although already useless, they were beloved relics from another event that had forced people to abandon everything, except life.  While burying those weapons, we felt more sadness than fear. We experienced a deeply felt “Farewell to Arms,” like the title of the book by Ernest Hemingway.  Many of us were able to survive and restart our lives — inside or outside of Chile. 50 years after that terrible date, as we remember those cruel events, the lesson remains clear: nothing is worth more than life itself!

"coup","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:01:41","Guillermo Lasso, Ecuador's banker-president, has used Article 148 of the Constitution – known as the “muerte cruzada” or “mutual death” – to shut down the National Congress just two hours before the vote on his impeachment trial for corruption was due to begin. Elections must now be called within six months to renew both the executive (the president) and the legislature (the Congress), but in the interim, the president remains in office and rules by decree without parliamentary oversight. It is therefore a power grab or, as some have described it, an autogolpe (a self-coup).  [Read the original in Spanish here]  It is no coincidence that Lasso has deployed soldiers around Congress and the Presidential Palace. The army leadership, complicit in the decision, has come out in support of the muerte cruzada decree.  The leadership of the mass indigenous and peasant movement CONAIE has rightly come out to reject the measure, which its leader Leonidas Iza has described as a self-coup. CONAIE has called for vigilance, rank-and-file assemblies and the creation of a broad National Assembly of Popular and Plurinational Power. A national plenary of the organisation was called to organise possible mobilisations against Lasso's coup d'état.  However, it is necessary to point out that the CONAIE communiqué asks for a ruling by the Constitutional Court on the legality of Lasso’s move. We must warn that it is a grave error to try to combat a bourgeois coup with appeals to bourgeois legality. Lasso's decree, which is technically legal since it is laid out in the Constitution, is a coup because it is a manoeuvre to evade the democratic vote of the Congress representatives, which he knew would be unfavourable to him.  The mass indigenous and peasant movement CONAIE has rightly come out to reject the measure / Image: Asamblea Nacional del Ecuador, Flickr  The most scandalous thing is that while the president dissolves the Congress, at the same time he reserves powers to govern by decree for six months “on urgent economic matters”. Already the cabinet has announced a series of decrees that it wants to implement by decree, the first being a tax reform and the second a labour reform. Obviously both of these are favourable to businessmen and contrary to the interests of the working class.  As we have explained in past articles, the Lasso government was a very weak government, which only managed to get elected in the second round due to the null vote of the indigenous Pachakutik party. What little popularity the government might have had, it lost during the national strike of June 2022, when it responded to the demands of the workers and peasants with brutal repression. In the local elections in February this year, his coalition was heavily defeated; and the referendum proposed by Lasso himself was a failure, being defeated on eight different questions. The president's approval rating stands at a paltry 13 percent, with 51 percent rating his performance as bad and 32 percent as very bad.  The economic and social situation has only worsened. CONAIE's communiqué gave the glaring figures: 70 percent of the population is unemployed, underemployed or in precarious conditions, more than six million families live in poverty or extreme poverty, more than 200,000 Ecuadorians have been forced to leave the country in what is the second biggest migration crisis in the last 40 years, more than 130,000 young people have not been able to enter university. To all this must be added the crisis of violence linked to drug gangs operating with impunity.  Fearing a movement of the masses from below, even the political representatives of the ruling class had decided to bring down Lasso, in a movement from above, thus creating a majority in favour of impeachment. The impeachment process was opened on Tuesday, 16 May, and its final vote was to take place on Saturday, 20 May.  Lasso's decree also demonstrates the disgusting hypocrisy of US imperialism / Image: Casa de América, Flickr  Lasso's decree also demonstrates the disgusting hypocrisy of US imperialism and its lackeys in the capitalist oligarchies of Latin America. When Peruvian President Castillo decided to dissolve Congress and call early elections, using a procedure analogous to Lasso's, the bourgeois military, business and political leadership immediately staged a coup d'état. They feared that Castillo's decision (and his intention to call a Constituent Assembly) could awaken the movement of the masses on the streets. In the case of Peru, Washington was quick to recognise the coup against the democratically elected president, a coup about which the US embassy was already informed.    But in the case of Ecuador, when the same procedure is carried out by a banker president, a lackey of imperialism, whose intention is not to implement the popular mandate, but precisely to evade it and rule by decree for the benefit of capitalists and multinationals, then the US rushes to support Lasso's self-coup. In a statement within hours of the muerte cruzada decree, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel announced that “our bilateral relationship with the Government of Ecuador... remains strong” and added that President Biden was “aware” of Lasso's decision. Lasso clearly had consulted with his master in the White House before taking any decision. Without blushing, the US spokesman offered his support for “Ecuador's democratic institutions and processes”, just when democracy is being violated. He expressed his respect for “the will of the Ecuadorian government and people”, when these are clearly in contradiction.  Lasso clearly had consulted with his master in the White House before taking any decision / Image: Presidencia de la República del Ecuador, Flickr  We are facing a move by the ruling class, with the support of US imperialism, to keep in power a banker who no longer even has parliamentary support, so that he can apply urgent economic measures against the working class and in favour of the oligarchy. The only possible response on the part of the workers, peasants and the youth of Ecuador is to take to the streets to prevent this manoeuvre.  The struggle against Lasso's self-coup must not be limited to the question of democracy, but must be linked to a plan of demands that respond to the most immediate needs of the masses. For the people to have health, education, housing and work, the capitalists must be made to pay for the crisis, starting with repudiating the onerous foreign debt and expropriating the oligarchy.  The problem is not that “the neoliberal model has failed”, as both Correa and Iza claim, but that neoliberalism is the reflection of the crisis of capitalism in a country dominated by imperialism and the attempt of the capitalist oligarchy to make the masses of workers and peasants pay for this crisis. It is therefore capitalism that has failed.  In the last 25 years it has been shown time and again that the Ecuadorian people, the workers and poor peasants, when they are on the move, are capable of courageously defending their interests and overthrowing those who rule against the majority.  it has been shown time and again that the Ecuadorian people are capable of courageously defending their interests / Image: CONFENIAE  It is imperative to draw lessons from recent movements. On the last two occasions, in the October 2019 insurrection and in June 2022, what was missing was a leadership of the movement with a clear perspective of taking power. The promises made in both cases by the government (in 2019 by Moreno, in 2022 by Lasso), to appease the movement and get the masses off the streets, were never fulfilled. It is not a question of changing one government for another, but of overthrowing the capitalist oligarchy, so that the working class can rule for the benefit of the majority and not the private interests of a parasitic minority beholden to imperialism.  It is necessary to build a revolutionary leadership, based on the ideas of Marxism, with the perspective of the socialist transformation of society, in Ecuador, in Latin America and in the whole world.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnhpc3QuY29tL2VjdWFkb3ItYmFua2VyLXByZXNpZGVudC1sYXNzby1jYXJyaWVzLW91dC1wb3dlci1ncmFiLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Having made the playoffs for the first time, lifted the Hero Super Cup and qualified for the main round of AFC Cup, Odisha have started the process of team building.  Just the other day, they signed a contract extension with dependable goalkeeper Amrinder Singh. And on Wednesday, Odisha FC pulled off a coup of sorts by appointing Spaniard Sergio Lobera as their head coach on a two-year deal.  In his four previous seasons in India, Lobera left an indelible mark on Indian football during his three-season stint with FC Goa and then one season in charge of Mumbai City FC. The 46-year-old coach helped FC Goa advance to the playoff stage all three times, with icing on the cake in 2019-20 when his boys topped the ISL standings to lift the League Winners’ Shield.  He then took on Mumbai City FC’s offer and coached them to the double of ISL League winners’ Shield and the ISL winners’ trophy in 2020-21.  Lobera’s next destination was China, to coach League One side Sichuan Jiuniu. However, the Chinese honeymoon lasted just a year.  When it became known that he was open to the idea of returning to India, Lobera was a man in big demand. East Bengal, in fact, were learnt to be very close to inking a contract with the master tactician. A handful of other clubs were also keen on getting him on board.  But it was Odisha FC who stolr others’ thunder, and got his signature.  “When we reached out to him, there was uncertainty whether he would even consider Odisha. But once we started speaking and presented our project, he knew what we aim to achieve,” Odisha FC president Raj Athwal was quoted as saying by The Times of India.  “We want to truly build a sustainable club and I’ve got to praise general manager (Abhik Chatterjee) for making more of an effort rather than wait for things to happen,” Athwal said, adding that Lobera made average players good and good players excellent.  The Bhubaneswar-based club’s management believes that Lobera is the right man to lead Odisha FC to greater heights by instilling a winning mentality among is players.  “We are delighted to welcome Sergio to the OFC family. His appointment is an important moment for the club which signifies the direction and aspiration we want to head towards and the club would like to welcome Sergio and wish him the very best for the upcoming season,” said Athwal.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2Rpc2hhYnl0ZXMuY29tL2hvdy1vZGlzaGEtZmMtcHVsbGVkLW9mZi10aGUtc2VyZ2lvLWxvYmVyYS1jb3VwLWJlYXRpbmctb2ZmLXN0cm9uZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Throughout this period, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, week after week, and declared: “It stops here.” Everything is open to discussion, but only as long as it stays within the rules of the game. Changing those rules is not and cannot be part of the discussion; it would be the effective liquidation of Israeli democracy.  As time went on, the government provided many additional reasons for frustration and anger, first and foremost the enormous budget allocations to the Haredim and the religious Zionists, as well as the issue of Haredi conscription and the rising cost of living. But for all the nausea these other issues arouse, we must not forget that the destruction of the judiciary is the key that would enable the government to pass all of those laws and allocations in an irresponsible manner and without any judicial oversight.

After MK Meir Porush (United Torah Judaism) demanded to receive “his money” – pocket money of a quarter of a billion shekels ($69 million) – Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich explained that the money had not been transferred because “there are actors with veto power because the judicial reform was not passed.” In other words, the true purpose of this “reform” is to enable robbery and discrimination without the High Court of Justice being able to prevent it.  The negotiations at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem over a compromise on the judicial overhaul, including the reports of emerging understandings, should not affect the motivation of the protesters or the force of the protest. After all, the leaders of the coup themselves admit that the so-called reform is still on the agenda. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs wrote explicitly that the cabinet will appoint two members of the Judicial Appointments Committee, with or without agreements.  The chair of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, MK Simcha Rothman (Religious Zionism), said that even if no agreement is reached, “we will in any case move forward with what the public voted for,” adding that “without fixing the judiciary,” the governing coalition “will not survive.” And Justice Minister Yariv Levin was quoted as admitting that “the moment of decision for the reform is immediately after the budget is approved,” adding that the government must enact “at least something from the reform” during the current Knesset session.  We must not capitulate to the Netanyahu government’s distractions or spin. The protest must go one and even intensify. The goal is not to postpone the government coup, but rather to bring about the decisive end of the “reform” and maintain the independence of the judiciary.

Thailand's election winner Move Forward Party on Thursday announced an 8-party coalition that its leader declared will become a ""democratic government of the people. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)  BANGKOK (AP) — The leader of the progressive opposition party that won a stunning victory in Thailand’s national election said Thursday that eight parties have agreed to form a coalition government with him as prime minister, despite fears among supporters that his military-aligned opponents may use the unelected Senate to block them.  Move Forward Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat said at a news conference that the proposed coalition would have a total of 313 seats in the House of Representatives, a solid majority of its 500 members.  But under Thailand’s Constitution, drafted under military rule after a 2014 coup, the lower house and the 250-seat Senate must vote together to select a new prime minister. All of the senators were appointed by the military junta that took power after the coup.  Because of the joint vote, Sunday’s election victor is not certain to take power.  “The key message of today’s news conference is to assure the public that my coalition is firmly taking shape,” said Pita, a Harvard-educated businessman. “There’s momentum, there’s progress and we also a have very clear roadmap from today until the day I become prime minister.”  He said the plans include teams to work out any differences among the parties and to “make sure there is a continuation of power, minimizing risk as well as reducing destabilizing factors that could damage the country or the economy or the financial markets.”  Move Forward’s progressive agenda resonated with a public weary of nine years of military-steered rule under Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup as army chief.  It enjoyed a surge in support before last Sunday’s poll, driving it to become the largest party with 151 seats. Prayuth’s United Thai Nation Party captured only 23 House seats.  Move Forward edged out another opposition party, Pheu Thai, aligned with popular former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in an earlier 2007 military coup.  Pheu Thai leader Cholanan Srikaew pledged unequivocal support for Pita as prime minister and for Move Forward’s bid to form a new government.  Young voters were particularly attracted by Move Forward’s policies, including a proposed amendment of Thailand’s harsh lese majeste law, under which criticizing the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment. Critics say the law is frequently misused to punish critics of the government, while conservatives who consider the royal institution sacrosanct strongly oppose any amendment.  All senators voted for Prayuth as prime minister after the last election in 2019, allowing him to remain in office despite a Pheu Thai victory in those polls. Some senators have already said they will not support Pita as prime minister because they oppose any change to the lese majeste law.  The law, known as Article 112, is also a sensitive subject within Pita’s coalition.  “I confirm we want to protect the monarchy but also not allow 112 to be used to harm other people,” said Sudarat Keyuraphan, leader of the Thai Sang Thai Party and a former public health minister.  She said each party in the coalition has a different stance on the law. “We have to talk about this article, as well as all the other policies,” she said.  Pita said the parties will sign a memorandum of understanding next week to create a common understanding of how they will work together as a government.  ___  Associated Press video journalist Jerry Harmer contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9jN2JiNjQ2M2NlOTgyNDg3NjdmZTAwODU4NzI4NTdhM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Flemington"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:53:12","Hall of Fame trainer John Hawkes can mastermind a form resurgence, play the role of giant-killer and preserve an unbeaten record with his stable runners in crucial races across three states on Saturday.  Hawkes has a number of starters at his home track of Rosehill Gardens including topweight Mount Popa in the Listed $160,000 Lord Mayor's Cup (2000m).  The talented Team Hawkes-trained Zeyrek is one of the main chances to upset hot favourite Zaaki in the Group 1 $1m Doomben Cup (2000m)  And boom, unbeaten English import Altivo can showcase his spring carnival credentials when he lines up for the In Memory of Dean Holland Handicap (1800m) at Flemington.  SIGN UP TO RACENET IQ FOR EXCLUSIVE TIPS AND ANALYSIS  The riders of Mount Popa, Zeyrek and Altivo will wear owner Rupert Legh's familiar racing colours of navy blue, gold lightning bolt, gold and white armbands and gold cap that were synonymous with his former champion, Chautauqua.  Hawkes, one of only six trainers to prepare 100 or more Group 1 winners on Australian racetracks, maintains Mount Popa is going better than his form reads for the Lord Mayor's Cup.  Mount Popa, a multiple stakes winner who was third in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth Stakes to Think It Over last year, has been unplaced in all three starts this campaign.  But there were encouraging signs when Mount Popa ran on from near last on the turn to finish a close fifth behind Esti Feny in the Gosford Gold Cup last start.  ""Mount Popa is going well but it's been frustrating to watch with the barrier barriers he has drawn every race this time,'' Hawkes said.  ""When you draw wide, it usually means you have to give them (rivals) all a start and it's hard to win races doing that.  ""We have to try and come from wide barrier (19) but he's back to a track and distance that he likes. He is going to need a lot of luck.''  Zeyrek takes on Zaaki in the Doomben Cup on Saturday. Picture: Jeremy Ng-Getty Images  Mount Popa is likely to go for a spell after the Lord Mayor's Cup with the rising nine-year-old gelding at generous odds of $17 with TAB.  Hawkes is chasing his third win in the Lord Mayor's Cup with Mount Popa after previous successes with Grampians (2002) and Zephyron (2014).  But the Doomben Cup is one of the few majors to elude the champion trainer with Zeyrek at $16 to win the feature race.  Rising seven-year-old Zeyrek boasts some of world racing's best bloodlines.  He is by English champion Sea The Stars, winner of six Group 1 races in succession including the English Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe during his unbeaten 2009 three-year-old season.  Zeyrek's dam is the Aga Khan's broodmare, Zerkaza, herself a daughter of mighty mare Zarkava, who was unbeaten in seven starts including the French 1000 Guineas-Oaks double and the 2008 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.  Zeyrek has raced in career-best form this preparation but is confronted by a sizeable obstacle in weight-for-age superstar Zaaki, the $1.90 favourite.  Hawkes didn't pull any punches when asked about his confidence levels with Zeyrek for the Doomben Cup.  ""Zaaki is going to be very hard to beat, he's a good horse and tough to beat at weight-for-age,'' Hawkes said.  ""But Zeyrek has had a great preparation and he's drawn a good gate. We are a chance but it needs to work out well for him.''  Unbeaten galloper Altivo will be striving for a fifth win on Saturday at Flemington. Picture: Racing Photos via Getty Images  Zeyrek won the Group 3 Neville Sellwood Stakes brilliantly earlier this campaign and last start was beaten only a half-length when third to Zaaki and Huetor in the Hollindale Stakes at the Sunshine Coast.  The Hollindale placegetters, all imported gallopers, clash again in the Doomben Cup.  Altivo, hot favourite at $1.90 for his Flemington race, is another talented import for the Hawkes-Legh combination.  Unbeaten in four starts, Altivo who was bred in the northern hemisphere and only turned four by birth date in March, is on the quick back-up after powering home to win over 1800m at Flemington last Saturday.  ""We have decided Altivo will go to the paddock after this race,'' Hawkes said.  ""It was always the plan just to give him two or three runs this time in to teach him then give him a break as he will come back a better horse next season.  ""I think he is a nice horse who attacks the line strongly in his races. He's been working his way through the grades well and he came through last week's run in good shape.''  The Hawkes stable also has competitive chances on their home track at Rosehill with Mars Mission ($8) in the TAB Handicap (1200m), two-year-old Galano ($15) makes his debut in the Schweppes Handicap (1200m) and Newly Wed ($16) who is fitter for recent racing and lines up in the Toyota Forklifts Handicap (1500m).  Mars Mission, an impressive Rosehill winner back in spring, did not have any lucky when eighth to Flag Honour at Gosford last start but has drawn to advantage on Saturday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yYWNlbmV0LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2pvaG4taGF3a2VzLXBsb3R0aW5nLXRocmVlc3RhdGUtY291cC13aXRoLW1vdW50LXBvcGEtemV5cmVrLWFuZC1hbHRpdm8tZm9yLW93bmVyLXJ1cGVydC1sZWdoLTIwMjMwNTE50gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2VuZXQuY29tLmF1L2FtcC9uZXdzL2pvaG4taGF3a2VzLXBsb3R0aW5nLXRocmVlc3RhdGUtY291cC13aXRoLW1vdW50LXBvcGEtemV5cmVrLWFuZC1hbHRpdm8tZm9yLW93bmVyLXJ1cGVydC1sZWdoLTIwMjMwNTE5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pita Limjaroenrat, Move Forward Party (MFP), together with Pheu Thai leader Cholnan Srikaew, Thai Sang Thai Party leader Sudarat Keyuraphan, Prachachat Party leader Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, Seri Ruam Thai (Thai Liberal) Party leader Sereepisuth Temeeyaves and Fair Party leader Pitipong Temcharoen, held a press conference on the formation of the government at the Okura Prestige Hotel, Bangkok on May 18.  Other 2 political parties attended the event: 1st Chaowarit Khajohnpongkirati, leader of the New Social Power Party and 2nd Wasawat Poungponsri, leader of Peu Thai Rumphalang Party. This means that the Move Forward Party is now assured 313 seats to form a government.  Pita said that all political parties want to form a democratic government that belongs to the people and should be the government for the Thai people. He added 3 main points:  1. All parties have agreed to support Pita Linjaroenrat, leader of the Move Forward Party, as the 30th Prime Minister of Thailand.  2. All parties will sign a MOU to form a government and show the government’s agenda to the public. The ceremony will be held on 22 May 2023 and will be announced to the people. The government will solve problems in politics, the economy and social issues.  3. All parties will form a working team during a transition period to ensure that the new government can smoothly continue from the last government.  On the amendment of section 112, which concerns the royal family and which is the main factor behind this new formation of the government, Pita said that this was not the right place to talk about the issue as all parties had already stated their position since the election campaign period.  MFP general secretary Chaithawat Tulathon said that there are several issues that need to be discussed during the formation of the government. He added that not all issues can be included in the MOU. Therefore, the negotiations will focus on mutual principles to reach an agreement before 22 May. He stressed that all parties consider May 22 as a good day.  Asked about the concerns on senators and their right to vote for the prime minister, Chaithawat said the talk would help create mutual understanding as the senators were mature and had goodwill towards the country. He added that some senators may not have received the right information in the past, but the face-to-face conversation will bridge the gap of misunderstanding. He added that the momentum on the part of some senators is good.  Asked about the ‘secret deal’ that could replace the Move Forward- led government, Chaithawa said all parties had agreed to form a government together, so trust was important, as was respect. He added that if the party only cared about the secret deal, the work could not be done.  “Pheu Thai has repeatedly stressed that the party supports Pita as Thailand’s next prime minister. The success of the government formation will undeniably depend on Move Forward and Pheu Thai,” said Chaithawat.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvOC1wYXJ0aWVzLXRvLXNpZ24tdGhlLW1vdS1vbi1tYXktMjItdGhlLTIwMTQtY291cC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raGFvc29kZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE4LzgtcGFydGllcy10by1zaWduLXRoZS1tb3Utb24tbWF5LTIyLXRoZS0yMDE0LWNvdXAtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-09-05","Not Discerned","{""Colombia"", ""LasTunas"", ""Cuba""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:29:00","It was a daunting moment last Thursday in Colombia, South America’s longest-running democracy, when retired Colonel John Marulanda, ex-president of the Andean country’s powerful Retired Officers Association (ACORE – Spanish initials), threatened to depose (Spanish) Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro. In a statement directed at Petro, Marulanda said they are going to “defenestrate a guy who was a guerrilla."" Those comments came a day after hundreds of Colombia’s military veterans protested against Petro in Bogota. Since taking office on August 7, 2022, the relationship between former socialist guerrilla Petro, who is Colombia’s first ever leftwing president, and the public forces, which have experienced substantial resignations, has been particularly strained. Since then, fears have emerged that Colombia’s armed forces, a politically influential body with close ties to former hard-right President Alvaro Uribe, will not accept a former socialist guerrilla as president.    The political intrigues and conflict playing out in Bogota, long a focal point for clashes between the extreme left and right, are being fanned by considerable unease in the upper socioeconomic levels of Colombian society over a one-time leftwing revolutionary holding the office of president. As a young man, Petro joined the socialist M19 guerrilla movement, founded after the disputed and allegedly fraudulent 1970 presidential election. During his time with the M19 Petro was imprisoned and according to him tortured. After the group disbanded as part of the March 1990 peace deal - where Petro was a negotiator - struck with the government of President Virgilio Barco, he held various government appointments. Petro then went on to become a congressional representative in 2002 and a senator in 2006. After two earlier failed attempts to win Colombia’s presidency, in 2010 and 2018, Petro finally succeeded during the 2022 election.    Tensions are further heightened in Colombia because of the impact of the fallout from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with the Andean country struggling to recover from spiraling poverty, crime, and violence. By the end of 2021, nearly 40% of Colombians were living in poverty (Spanish) compared to 36% in 2019, while 12% of the population was living in extreme poverty against just under 10% 2 years earlier. Petro’s predecessor President Ivan Duque ignited a tinderbox of simmering community resentment in April 2021 when he announced plans to hike taxes subsequently triggering Colombia-wide violent anti-government protests.    After emerging victorious during the July 2022 presidential run-off, Petro announced his ambitious yet what increasingly appears to be an unachievable plan for total peace. This focuses on obliging the state policy to seek peace with the disparate illegal armed groups engaged in Colombia’s decades-long bloody civil conflict that has claimed 262,000 lives, the vast majority of whom were civilians. It is this low-level asymmetric war which is responsible for much of the violence occurring in the strife-torn country, notably in remote rural regions. As part of that plan, Petro prematurely declared a ceasefire at the start of 2023, but it was not recognized by the numerous illegal armed groups operating in Colombia which continued attacking crucial infrastructure, civilians, and the armed forces. That only heightened tensions with the military and police which have borne much of the brunt of the uptick in violence.    Petro, to the displeasure of the hard-right and many within the armed forces, resumed peace talks with the last remaining leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish initials ELN. His predecessor Duque suspended negotiations (Spanish) with the guerrillas after their January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy claimed 21 lives. The ELN, which was founded in 1964, is believed to have as many as 2,500 combatants making it the second largest illegal armed group in Colombia after the Gulf Clan, a neo-paramilitary group that has an estimated 5,000 fighters. The Gulf Clan emerged in 2006 when senior paramilitary leader Vincente Castaño broke away from the demobilization process of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC – Spanish initials) and rearmed a paramilitary group. After clashing with a variety of other illegal armed groups the Gulf Clan emerged as Colombia’s most powerful criminal organization. There are also various bands of combatants from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) who didn’t accept the 2016 peace accord with Bogota.    There have been frequent scandals and allegations concerning Colombia’s police and army’s involvement in human rights abuses, illegal detention, torture, extrajudicial killings, and rampant corruption over the last two decades. The most severe instances occurred during the 2021 national strike where thousands of Colombians took to the streets to protest against President Duque’s proposed tax hikes, soaring corruption, and economic mismanagement. The crisis of impunity among Colombia’s public forces is so severe that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR – Spanish initials) expressed concerns over endemic police violence in Colombia in 2021. Petro’s desire to secure peace, eliminate corruption, and end the impunity enjoyed by Colombia’s armed forces and police when it comes to human rights abuses saw him appoint controversial prominent anti-corruption investigator Iván Velásquez as Minister of Defense. That further inflamed tensions with Colombia’s armed forces.    This is all occurring at a time when there is considerable rumor and innuendo about a rightwing campaign by various former senior security officials as well as business leaders and supporters of former President Uribe to undermine Petro’s presidency. While Petro has been able to maintain an overall semblance of a functional relationship with Colombia’s Armed Forces despite evident tensions, his relationship with retired members of the military has been strained and antagonistic. Regardless of the issues discussed, Colombia’s active military has, thus far, shown no interest in Marulanda’s comments. Petro ridiculed the statement and warned the Colombian people of the threat writing via Twitter “Why are they conspiring for a coup d’état? Because they are terrified that we will put an end to impunity.” Indeed, the retired colonel later walked back his comments claiming that he was referring to the President of Peru Pedro Castillo, who was ousted from office during the first week of December 2022 to be later arrested and detained.    While a coup certainly appears unlikely with Marulanda’s comments appearing to amount to nothing more than saber rattling, Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office has opened an investigation (Spanish) to determine whether a crime has been committed. They have also inflamed tensions at a crucial time for Petro whose controversial health reforms, aimed at establishing a centralized government-monitored payment system to reduce corruption and improve care, were rejected. After the clashes over his health reform proposals, the president replaced seven ministers in his cabinet who were seen by many as moderates. There are also accusations that retired military members protested to create a distraction from the explosive testimony from paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. That includes claims of close ties between paramilitary forces, the Army, and police as well as their participation in extrajudicial killings.

"coup","1987-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:07:57","Fiji's PM, Sitiveni Rabuka, has apologised for leading the 1987 coup overthrowing then PM Timoci Bavadra, the first Indo-Fijian leader.  “I make this confession on my own behalf and on behalf of all those who took part with me in the military coup on the 14th of May, 1987. We confess our wrongdoings, and we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of the Indo-Fijian community of the time and among them sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of those who were indentured as labourers from India between 1879 and 1916,” Rabuka said in the country’s capital, Suva, on 14 May.  The fear of indigenous Fijians losing political power to economically dominant Indo-Fijians drove this first of several military coups in Fiji.  Rabuka's action impacted Fiji and its relationship with India, bringing about long-term consequences.  The coup had occurred just over a month after the National Federation Party-Labour Party alliance won the election.  The victory had led to the creation of a cabinet led by ethnic Indians, marking the first time since Fiji gained independence from Britain in 1970.  Lt Col Rabuka declared the formation of a new constitution a day after his takeover. The constitution would prevent an Indian-dominated government. He argued that he was only representing the Fijians' interests.  On 19 May 1987, riots occurred in Fiji that targeted Indians and Indian-owned shops. At least 50 Indians were injured in the attacks.  After an interim government arrangement was made in July, Rabuka staged a second coup on 25 September that year, declaring Fiji a republic and proclaiming himself head of the state, replacing the Queen.  The international community condemned his actions, and India imposed trade sanctions on Fiji, leaving the country isolated.  Rabuka resigned under pressure as head of state on 6 December 1987.  The recent apology made by Rabuka, who served as PM in 1992 and then again last year, for the 1987 coups was not his first.  In 2008, on the twenty-first anniversary of the takeover, Rabuka publicly admitted that he was wrong and the coup was a mistake. He said staging a coup is not a heroic act and no one should be proud of it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL2luc3RhL2ZpamktcG0tYXBvbG9naXNlcy10by1pbmRpYW4tZmlqaWFucy1mb3ItMTk4Ny1jb3VwLXRoYXQtaHVydC10aGUtY29tbXVuaXR50gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9zd2FyYWp5YW1hZy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2luc3RhJTJGZmlqaS1wbS1hcG9sb2dpc2VzLXRvLWluZGlhbi1maWppYW5zLWZvci0xOTg3LWNvdXAtdGhhdC1odXJ0LXRoZS1jb21tdW5pdHk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Griffith University professor Charles Sampford told the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into supporting democracy in our region that counter strategies can prevent coups in smaller countries.  “The coup d’etat is a disease of the modern state, but it’s a disease that can be prevented, especially in democracies,” said Sampford, who is the director of the university’s Institute for Ethics, Governance and Law.  “I’ve argued for many years for a range of counter-coup strategies to be built in. The earlier that they’re built in, the more effective they’re likely to be.  “All of these things Australia can both bottle, in what it does, and assist other countries with.”  Sampford, who has consulted on global governance issues for governments around the world, said there are fundamental principles at the heart of developing counter strategies for democracies that Australia assists.  “Partly it’s about military training and recognising the civilian supremacy of democratic institutions and partly it’s about military law and military ethics, which we should adhere to ourselves and extend to the many others that we train,” Sampford said.  One of the ways the discussion about making a democracy resilient and resistant to coups, according to Sampford, is for any discussions with countries to be had in the context of their different political and religious traditions.  Sampford said most traditions have elements that support good governance.  “So it is an invaluable part of this that we have dialogues on government values between different traditions so that those who are defending democracy and democratic values in these countries are not being told: ‘This is a Western idea about how we should govern ourselves; we should reject that because we are different because we are Hindus’ — or Muslims or Buddhists, as is the case in Myanmar,” Sampford said.  “It is valuable generally, not just for this, to have dialogues and governance values where we recognise that each tradition has both good governance and bad governance traditions.”  READ MORE:  Wong on Australia’s new foreign paradigm: Our diplomats and military can’t do it alone","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hbmRhcmluLmNvbS5hdS8yMjA2NzYtY291bnRlci1jb3VwLXN0cmF0ZWdpZXMtdml0YWwtdG8tbWFpbnRhaW5pbmctcmVnaW9uYWwtcGVhY2Utc2F5cy1leHBlcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2007-07-22","21:00:00","{""Manila"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:10:00","MANILA, Philippines — Former president and incumbent Pampanga 2nd District Rep. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo broke her silence on her replacement as a senior deputy speaker, saying that her actions may have been misconstrued leading to claims that she was staging a coup.  ADVERTISEMENT  Arroyo, in a statement, refuted the allegation, saying that it is no longer her goal to be elected as speaker of the House of Representatives.  “When I learned that there were reports that I was suspected of plotting a ‘coup’ against Speaker Romualdez, I decided I must speak out to clarify my political position. Indeed, some of my actions may have been misconstrued, such as my recent trip with a delegation of Congressmen to Korea for some official meetings,” she said.  “To be clear, my political objectives are three: First, to represent the 2nd district of Pampanga. Second, to support the legislative agenda of Speaker Romualdez and President Marcos. Third, to use whatever experience I have as a former President to help out when I am called upon to do so,” she added.  Arroyo admitted that when Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos was elected president last year, she wanted to aspire for the speakership, but realized the wisdom in having Leyte 1st District Rep. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez as the speaker instead.  “When President Marcos won, I wanted to aspire for the Speakership of the House. But it soon became apparent that he was most comfortable with then Congressman Martin Romualdez as Speaker. I quickly realized the wisdom embedded in that sentiment,” she said.  “In the Philippines, the House leadership has traditionally been closely associated with the sitting President, and this relationship of deep trust between speaker and President has been beneficial in smoothly enacting the legislative agenda of the President. I think this is acceptable, because in the Philippines, the check and balance needed in any democracy has traditionally been well-provided by the Senate,” she added.  During Wednesday’s session, the House approved changes in the leadership, with Pampanga 3rd District Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr. being elected as the senior deputy speaker.  Arroyo then replaced Gonzales as deputy speaker.  In separate statements on Thursday, several lawmakers congratulated Gonzales after the latter was elected.  ADVERTISEMENT  PDP-Laban — which Gonzales is a part of — meanwhile said that the move to elevate Gonzales is a recognition of their party-mates’ contribution to the legislative body.  Initially, Arroyo said that the move was the prerogative of the House of Representatives.  “It’s the prerogative of the House,” Arroyo said in a short statement sent by her office to reporters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2luZm8uaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzE3NzEyNTUvYXJyb3lvLWJyZWFrcy1zaWxlbmNlLW15LWFjdGlvbnMtd2VyZS1taXNjb25zdHJ1ZWQtaS13YXMtYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1zdGFnaW5nLWEtY291cNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2luZm8uaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzE3NzEyNTUvYXJyb3lvLWJyZWFrcy1zaWxlbmNlLW15LWFjdGlvbnMtd2VyZS1taXNjb25zdHJ1ZWQtaS13YXMtYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1zdGFnaW5nLWEtY291cC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2020-09-19","Not Discerned","{""Singapore"", ""Singapore"", ""Singapore""}","Thu 18 May 2023 08:54:16","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion worth of weapons and related material from Russia, China and other countries since its February 2021 coup, some of which it has used to carry out atrocities against civilians, according to a U.N. report released Wednesday.  The weapons continue to flow to the military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for the atrocities, including some that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, said Tom Andrews, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar.  As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help. He said at least 160 people were killed, including many children.  In addition, the machine guns and bombs used in the attacks included parts and materials from companies located in Singapore, China and Thailand, he said.  Myanmar is mired in strife because of a political crisis unleashed when the military took power. Its takeover prompted widespread peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with deadly force, triggering armed resistance throughout the country that the army has been unable to quell. Andrews said at least 22,000 political prisoners have been detained since the coup, at least 3.500 civilians have been killed and 1.5 million people have been forcibly displaced.  The report documents over 12,500 purchases that were shipped directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working for the military from Feb. 1, 2021, when the military ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, until December 2022, Andrews said at a news conference.  He said the volume and diversity of equipment the military received was “staggering,” ranging from fighter jets and attack helicopters and drones to advanced missile systems, tank upgrades, sophisticated communications equipment, radar complexes and components for naval ships.  Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine , said he had received “highly credible and detailed information from confidential sources” identifying the major networks and companies involved in the arms trade with Myanmar.  The report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council identifies $406 million in weapons and material that went to the Myanmar military from Russia, $267 million from China, $254 million from Singapore, $51 million from India and $28 million from Thailand.  Since the coup, the report said, 28 Russian private and state-owned companies have transferred fighter jets and their spare parts, advanced missile systems, reconnaissance and attack drones, attack helicopters and other systems to the junta.  The report identified 41 private and state-owned companies registered in China and Hong Kong that supplied the Myanmar military with an extensive array of arms, equipment and raw materials between October 2021 and December 2022, including advanced trainer jets, light attack aircraft, tank upgrades and repairs for Chinese fighter jets, which make up the Myanmar Air Force fleet, the report said.  They also supplied aluminum, copper, steel, rubber and lubricants for use in Myanmar’s domestic weapons manufacturing, it said.  Unlike with Russia and China, and to a lesser extent India, Andrews said he received no information indicating that the governments of Singapore or Thailand approved or transferred arms to the Myanmar military.  He said companies in Singapore are of critical importance to the junta, having supplied spare parts, raw materials and manufacturing equipment, especially for Myanmar’s KaPaSa weapons factories. Thai companies have done the same, the report said.  Twelve Thai companies were established after the coup, many by sanctioned arms networks already operating in Singapore, which suggests arms dealers may be looking at Thailand as an alternative route to avoid scrutiny, the report said.  Andrews said Singapore has a policy prohibiting the transfer of arms to Myanmar, and he reported his detailed findings to the government, which he said expressed appreciation for the information and indicated it was reviewing the effectiveness of its export controls.  If the Singapore government stopped all arms shipments to the Myanmar military, he said, the impact on the ability of the junta to manufacture arms “would be significant.”  Andrews said China and Russia both criticized the report, saying it went beyond his human rights mandate, and accused him of “vilifying legitimate arms trade.” He countered that “identifying the sources of gross human rights violations and atrocities, including crimes against humanity and war crimes, is within my mandate and in my moral obligation.”  Andrews said India responded to the report’s findings that 22 state-owned and private firms shipped a coastal surveillance system, a remote-controlled weapons system, components from an ammunition and missile manufacturer, and 122 mm howitzer barrels by saying these involved contracts with the previous civilian government.  A U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted on June 18, 2021, calls upon all member states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar, but unlike a Security Council resolution it is not legally binding. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Switzerland have imposed sanctions on arms dealers providing support to the military.  Andrews said the sanctions weren’t coordinated and have been largely ineffective. He called for countries to impose coordinated sanctions that target the networks that procure weapons and also the junta’s finances.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvdW4tZXhwZXJ0LW15YW5tYXItbWlsaXRhcnktaW1wb3J0ZWQtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluLXdlYXBvbnMtc2luY2UtMjAyMS1jb3VwL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvdW4tZXhwZXJ0LW15YW5tYXItbWlsaXRhcnktaW1wb3J0ZWQtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluLXdlYXBvbnMtc2luY2UtMjAyMS1jb3VwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","{""Tauranga"", ""BayOfPlenty"", ""NewZealand""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:39:18","Tom Rutherford says he is prepared to “fight” to win the right to represent the Bay of Plenty as its MP.  On Wednesday night, local National Party delegates chose the 26-year-old Mount Maunganui communications executive as their electorate candidate, with Bay of Plenty MP Todd Muller retiring from politics.  Rutherford told the Bay of Plenty Times the selection experience was “really humbling”.  “The local party members have selected me and it’s [incredible] to have their support. I’m not going to let them down.”  “I feel really privileged. I’m really, really happy.”  Last week, horticulturalist and trust director Pare Taikato was selected as the Labour Party’s candidate for the Bay of Plenty seat after MP Angie Warren-Clark announced she was standing for election in Whangārei.  Rutherford most recently worked for Rotorua mayor Tania Tapsell, a former National Party East Coast candidate, at Rotorua Lakes Council.  Asked what he most wanted people to know him, Rutherford said “an empathetic and hard-working local MP who’s passionate for the Bay of Plenty and ensuring we have the best possible services”.  He would pick the baton up from Muller, who fought for key projects such as a 24/7 medical centre for Pāpāmoa.  Local transport such as the Takitimu North Link was also “really important to me”, Rutherford said.  Bay of Plenty MP Todd Muller. Photo / Mark Mitchell  “I’m going to be the strongest advocate for the electorate to ensure the transport projects we need are signed off.  “I’m going to be learning. I’m going to be listening, taking everything on board.”  Rutherford confirmed he lived in the electorate, and said he wanted people to feel they could reach out to him for support and advice.  He was one of four men shortlisted last year to become National’s Tauranga MP after Simon Bridges resigned.  The shortlist drew commentary at the time for its lack of diversity. Sam Uffindell was selected.  Rutherford said he would “stick up for every community member that calls this place home”.  “I’m going to be getting out and about to listen to people and understand the issues that [they have].  Rutherford said that included the cost of living crisis.  “Families are wondering where they are going to fund hundreds of dollars a week to pay the mortgage. That’s before we get to paying groceries.”  He named former Bay of Plenty MP and Minister of Health Tony Ryall, who retired in 2014 after 24 years in Parliament, as the New Zealand politician he was most inspired by.  Muller followed Ryall in the seat, which has been held by National since it was re-established in 1996, and for several decades in its previous iteration.  Muller announced in March this year he would not seek re-election, telling the Bay of Plenty Times at the time there wasn’t enough fire in the belly to continue.  It followed a rollercoaster few years that saw him spearhead a coup against Simon Bridges and lead National for 53 days before a mental health breakdown forced him out of the role, get demoted under Judith Collins’ leadership, resign, then change his mind when Christopher Luxon became leader.  Rutherford paid tribute to Muller and said he was looking forward to the chance of taking on his role as MP.  “You need to be prepared to stand up and fight for your community and bring their issues to the fore and get an electorate the things they deserve,” Rutherford said.  “I’ve got the skills to be the best possible advocate for the Bay of Plenty.  “I will earn the right to be MP.”  - Additional reporting Luke Kirkness","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9iYXktb2YtcGxlbnR5LXRpbWVzL25ld3MvdG9tLXJ1dGhlcmZvcmQtbmFtZWQtbmF0aW9uYWwtcGFydHktY2FuZGlkYXRlLWZvci1iYXktb2YtcGxlbnR5L1pITFpBRUZLTEJHVkpCVDdaWDRZUE4yRlNVL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2018-09-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 03:15:00","The small group of economists who've been maintaining that the US can avoid a recession, despite the most aggressive Federal Reserve tightening in decades, is starting to breathe easier.  Many of their peers had expected surging interest rates—up 5% points in just over a year—would've put a more material dent in hiring and personal consumption by now. Instead, the unemployment rate is hovering at a more-than-five-decade low, consumers are still spending, and the housing market is beginning to stabilise.  At the same time, inflation has slowed appreciably. That combination is reviving hopes among the true believers, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for a ""soft landing"" scenario in which price pressures dissipate without massive job losses or an economic downturn.  It's still an out-of-consensus call. Of the 27 forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg in early May, only five said they didn't expect the US economy to slip into a recession sometime over the next year. Still, the starting point keeps getting pushed back, as a robust labour market keeps wage growth elevated and excess savings accumulated during the pandemic continue to boost the spending power of American households.  ""We all hate that term, 'This time is different,' but we have not seen this dynamic before,"" says Ellen Zentner, chief US economist for Morgan Stanley. ""This is unique.""  Zentner, one of the few optimists on Wall Street, is quick to point out the headwinds facing an economy she describes as ""flying dangerously low to the ground."" The failure of several regional lenders that buckled under the weight of soaring interest rates continues to reverberate, and data revisions—especially to jobs numbers—could yet change the outlook.  That's similar to the message Powell offered reporters earlier this month, after the central bank raised its benchmark rate above 5% for the first time since 2007. ""It's possible that this time is really different,"" he said. But he also said, ""There are no promises in this.""  Lately, the data support the optimists.  Hiring picked up in April, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.4%. Labour force participation, too, has been rising—especially among the cohort age 25 to 54 that economists like to refer to as ""prime working age."" It hit a 15-year high last month, alleviating some of the supply-side constraints that have been plaguing the labour market, while a falling number of job openings points to a gradual cooling in demand for workers.  Moreover, auto sales surged in April to the highest level in almost two years, suggesting consumers are still more than willing to buy big-ticket items as supply-chain issues ease. Retail sales more broadly posted gains last month, and factory production picked up.  And on the inflation front, services prices excluding energy and housing rose in April at the slowest pace in nine months. Given that Fed officials have been particularly worried about pressures in that part of the economy, the moderation in that metric reduces the chances of additional rate hikes.  David Mericle, the chief US economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is another among the few who've stuck to a no-recession call. It's been a lonely ride, but it's starting pay off, he says.  ""We did a lot of good research and came up with a lot of non-obvious things that people missed that informed that view,"" Mericle says. ""We were on the optimistic end of this debate, and in some respects things have gone even better than I would have dreamed.""  The vast majority of forecasters still see a recession as highly likely. But the recent run of good data is causing some to rethink the timing.  Wells Fargo & Co economists said last week that they now expect the recession to start in the fourth quarter of this year, instead of the third quarter. Jean-François Perrault, Scotiabank's chief economist, says that while his team expects the economy to fall into recession in the current quarter, they ""may be pushing that out"" to the third quarter in the next forecast. Kathy Bostjancic at Nationwide, who sees a recession beginning in the third quarter, says continued resilience in the labour market could delay the start to later in the year.  ""The consensus forecast for at least a year running has been that we're three months away from a recession, and it just keeps getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back,"" says Stephen Stanley, the chief US economist at Santander US Capital Markets LLC. ""A big part of the reason is that consumer spending continues to grow.""  While a tight labour market remains a key support to spending, momentum is beginning to cool. And household balance sheets—while still padded by savings accumulated in the early part of the pandemic—are starting to show early signs of strain. This could make next year more ""touch and go,"" Stanley says, as the full weight of the Fed's tightening hits the economy.  He and Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, also warned about the flip side of resilient consumer spending: It might keep inflation too high for the Fed's liking. ""Ultimately, we'll need to see a pullback in demand to get inflation under control, making a recession still seem fairly inevitable,"" House says.  A third view is that the economy is experiencing a ""rolling recession,"" a term Ed Yardeni says he first used in the 1980s when Texas was hit hard by an oil slump but the rest of the country held up. It's a similar picture today with pockets of pain—merchandise trade has been under pressure, and commercial real estate is teetering—but aggregate growth figures are unlikely to show a technical recession, according to Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc.  ""That's the story so far, and that's my ongoing forecast,"" he says.  While the final judgment on the post-pandemic business cycle may not be written for years to come, views will probably continue to morph as new data accumulate and expectations change.  ""The recession narrative has been a somewhat inconsistent one over time,"" says Goldman's Mericle. ""I think we are on to Version 3 at this point.""

"coup","2018-07-03","Not Discerned","{""BeneBeraq"", ""Hamerkaz"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:29:00","An Israeli pharmacy chain has caused an uproar by placing stickers on women's photos on its products in a largely ultra-Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb.  Sources told TheMarker, the business newspaper in Haaretz's Hebrew edition, that the job was done by a paid “kashrut supervisor.” Kashrut normally refers to adherence to Jewish dietary laws.  Executives at the chain, Be, said the move was the result of pressure at one store by local rabbis, who threatened to call a boycott on the branch in the town of Bnei Brak.  More stickers at the branch.  The move marks the latest effort by some segments of the ultra-Orthodox community to cover images of women's faces in a bid to decrease contact between the sexes.  The executives said they were frustrated by the demand but had to comply. “Do you want us not to open stores in ultra-Orthodox cities?” one executive asked. “Or should we resist the residents’ demands and have them protesting in front of our stores all day?”  Photos of the purple stickers went viral on Tuesday; a resident of a nearby town who was shopping at the branch was the first to upload a picture. The purple on the stickers is the same color the chain uses in its marketing.  The effort caused a stir Tuesday, though a tweet posted nearly three years ago also shows stickers covering women’s faces.  The woman who uploaded the first photo Tuesday, whose first name is Galit, said she wanted to avoid an altercation so she did not talk to anyone in the store.  A post lampooning the move by referring to the declaring of Israel's independence in 1948.  “Anyway, what would they say?” Galit said. “But I think it’s crazy. What are they thinking – that a man is aroused by a woman's face? And what’s the message they're sending to girls who come to the store? That they should cover their faces?”  The women's group Bonot Alternativa has launched an online campaign against the pharmacy's actions.  “When we started with 'The Handmaid’s Tale' performances, we never imagined that women would be hidden in the public sphere so soon and so blatantly. Our warnings are already becoming a reality,” said Moran Zer Katzenstein, who founded Bonot Alternativa.  Be is owned by Shufersal, Israel's largest supermarket chain.  “Shufersal’s conscious decision to act as it did reinforces the tangible danger of unfathomable extremism and distortion, and paves the way for even more via the judicial coup,” Zer Katzenstein added, referring to the hard-right government's attempt to weaken the judicial system.  The pharmacy chain added: “We respect all segments of the Israeli population. The picture at issue was taken at a store in Bnei Brak serving the ultra-Orthodox community. Please note that this involves only that store.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTE3L3R5LWFydGljbGUvLnByZW1pdW0vaXNyYWVsaS1waGFybWFjeS1jaGFpbnMta2FzaHJ1dC1zdXBlcnZpc29ycy1wdXQtc3RpY2tlcnMtb24tcHJvZHVjdHMtc2hvd2luZy13b21lbi8wMDAwMDE4OC0yOWFjLWRiMzctYWZlYy1iZGZjYjIxYzAwMDDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2018-07-22","10:00:00","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Thu 18 May 2023 03:29:00","(Bloomberg) -- The bid of Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of Thailand’s opposition group Move Forward, to form a coalition government hit a setback when a key political party said it won’t back a prime minister who wants to relax the law against criticizing the monarchy.  Most Read from Bloomberg  The Bhumjaithai Party, which came in third in Sunday’s vote with about 70 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, said Wednesday night that it would rather stand in the opposition than be part of a coalition led by a party that wants to amend Article 112. That’s Thailand’s “lese majeste” law that can put offenders in jail for as many as 15 years if convicted of royal insults.  “This is Bhumjaithai’s core principle that cannot be changed or negotiated,” the party said in a statement posted on Facebook. “Bhumjaithai cannot vote for a prime minister candidate of a party that has a proposal to amend or abolish Article 112.”  The issue is proving to be a roadblock in Move Forward’s bid to form a government after it stunned the nation by winning Sunday’s parliamentary election. Earlier this week, Thaksin Shinawatra also sought to distance his family from the push of Pita’s party to “lese majeste” even as Pheu Thai party which the former premier backs had agreed to join hands with Move Forward.  The 42-year-old Harvard-educated Pita is seeking 376 votes in the lower house to bypass the military-appointed senate for him to become Thailand’s 30th premier. The coalition said it has secured about 310 seats so far, which means the 70 held by Bhumjaithai could prove pivotal.  Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader and prime minister candidate of Bhumjaithai, played kingmaker after the 2019 election before eventually siding with the military-backed Palang Pracharath and securing ministry positions for his party.  Story continues  The decision of Anutin’s party not to back Pita for prime minister means Move Forward will now need to look to pro-royalist senators and the conservative Democrat Party for support after previously ruling out any alliance with military backed groups.  The push to directly change laws affecting the monarchy breaks a longstanding taboo in Thailand, where in years past, even the suggestion of disloyalty to the palace had been grounds for the military to stage a coup.  Move Forward vowed to press ahead with the reform after the election. Pita has since said preliminary talks about government formation are going well and the bloc will hold a briefing Thursday in Bangkok to reveal details about a memorandum of understanding between the parties.  --With assistance from Suttinee Yuvejwattana.

Authorities are holding women and girls in incommunicado detention, sometimes for years, partly in an attempt to obtain information on male relatives suspected of links to Sinai Province, the local branch of the Islamic State group.  Many of the women were themselves victims of abuse at the hands of militants, according to the report by Human Rights Watch and the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR).  “Egyptian authorities have been abusing many women and children in North Sinai to extract information about their suspected ISIS affiliate relatives or pressure these suspects to turn themselves in,” said Ahmed Salem, executive director of the Sinai Foundation, using a different acronym for IS.  “The authorities should immediately free all women and girls held merely for being related to or associated with male suspects, and investigate torture and other ill-treatment against them.”  Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  The rights groups documented cases involving 19 women and two girls between 2017 and 2022, interviewing relatives, lawyers, and current and former female detainees.  Relatives of three detainees said Egyptian authorities beat and used electric shocks on the women, while others were slapped, blindfolded and verbally abused.  Several of the women were abused by Sinai Province militants, including being raped and forced into marriage, sources said. But in all cases reviewed by the rights groups, detainees were not treated as potential victims of crime by Egyptian authorities.  In six cases, security forces detained women and girls who had escaped the IS-affiliated group and sought protection via state authorities. Several of them were charged with joining and providing logistical support to a terrorist group.  'Intolerable abuses'  “Many women and girls in North Sinai have already suffered intolerable abuse at the hands of ISIS-linked members,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.  “The Egyptian government should be protecting them, not locking them up and torturing them.”  The rights groups called on Egypt's international partners to urge authorities to end security forces' abuses, and on the United Nations to address deteriorating human rights in the country.  'The Egyptian government should be protecting [women and girls], not locking them up and torturing them' - Adam Coogle, HRW  Egypt declared war on IS following the military coup led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, when the former army general ousted his democratically elected civilian predecessor, Mohamed Morsi.  Years of military operations in North Sinai between the Egyptian armed forces and the local branch of the Islamic State group have taken a heavy toll on civilians and soldiers.  Human Rights Watch believes that over 100,000 of the region’s 450,000 residents have been displaced or have left the region since 2013.  Death tolls in the conflict are not publicly available, but according to a count compiled by independent researchers who maintain anonymity for their safety, more than 1,500 military personnel were killed between 2011 and June 2018.  Middle East Eye reported last month that the Egyptian army “unnecessarily"" destroyed schools in the Sinai Peninsula in its war against militants, forcing a generation of pupils out of school.

In December, Universal announced a new interactive attraction, llumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast, would be joining the already popular Despicable Me Minion Mayhem attraction as part of a new Minion Land.  “As soon as guests enter the land, they’ll be greeted by a fun, photo-worthy ‘Minion Land’ marquee featuring 22 Minions before embarking on the mischief that awaits along Illumination Ave.,” the resort revealed Tuesday along with fresh details about the upcoming Minion Cafe, several themed eateries and new meet-and-greet opportunities featuring Illuminations characters.  Here’s what guests can expect when Minion Land opens at Universal Studios Florida.  HHN 2023:Everything we know about Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights  5 mistakes I made at Universal OrlandoHow to save more time, money than me  What is the Villain-Con Minion Blast attraction?  “This will truly be a one-of-a-kind, interactive blaster game experience that will immerse guests in the world of Illumination’s Minions franchise as they compete to see if they have what it takes to be the next supervillain,” Thierry Coup, then-Senior Vice President of Universal Creative, told USA TODAY in December.  Fans will remember Villian-Con, the villain convention, from “Minions: The Rise of Gru.” Guests exiting Villain-Con Minion Blast will go through an all-new retail location called Evil Stuff, which will sell both Villain-Con and Minions merchandise.  The new attraction will be located on Illumination Avenue, where Shrek 4-D used to be, directly across from Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.  Can you meet the Minions in person?  Guests can meet Minions and other characters from their franchise like Gru, Margo, Edith and Agnes at an outdoor “Illumination Theater facade.”  And new to Universal Orlando, guests will also get to meet Rosita, Gunter and Johnny from the “Sing” films. Other Illumination characters may be seen in murals and photo opportunities around Minion Land.  Heading to Super Nintendo World?Tips for your first Universal Studios Hollywood visit  What’s cooking at Minion Cafe?  Minion Cafe will feature an entirely new menu, different from Universal Studios Hollywood’s Minion Cafe, Universal Orlando exclusively told USA TODAY.  There will be nearly 20 new dishes, including Otto’s Noodle Bowl, the Steak & “Cheese Ray” Sandwich and Carl’s Crispy Cauliflower, which will be vegan.  The sit-down eatery will feature three themed seating areas, the resort said in a news release:  ""The Kitchen – where guests will get a glimpse of the equipment and gear the Minions have used to whip up the cafe’s menu; the Breakroom – where guests can dine in the Minions’ break space that includes everything from ‘Office Safety Tips’ to a vending machine stocked with mischievous items; and the Dining Room – a vibrant space adorned with colorful artwork courtesy of the Minions and more.""  There will also be a walk-up express window, with a limited menu, for guests who don’t want to dine in.  What food do Minions eat?  Minions famously love bananas.  Guests will find banana (and regular) flavored popcorn at the new Pop-a-nana kiosk, which will also sell Minion popcorn buckets. For something even sweeter, guests can pop by Bake My Day, a bakery and retail shop with Minion-themed treats like cupcakes and macarons, or Freeze Ray Pops, a walk-up window with themed popsicles and cold drinks.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZXhwZXJpZW5jZS90aGVtZS1wYXJrcy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L21pbmlvbi1sYW5kLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1zdHVkaW9zLWZsb3JpZGEvNzAyMjk1MzUwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Trevor Jackson (Grown-ish, Superfly) will co-star. Myriad Pictures is shopping the project to buyers here in Cannes this week.  Mace is the harrowing story of two very different types of cops – a veteran officer Mace (LaBeouf), dangerous and corrupt, and Virgil Woods (Jackson), a young rookie who believes that he can change the system that fosters cops like Mace from within. It’s inspired by the recent racial injustice on the streets of America and Woods refuses to be bullied and pits his principles against the amoral Mac. Woods risks everything he believes to stop Mace from destroying the city when Mace unleashes a gang war to cover up his crimes. Everyone around Mace is in danger as Mace plays his game and tries to conceal his tracks, no matter the cost.  The Meyers Media Group production is projected to start later this year in New Jersey with additional casting underway. Lawrence Steven Meyers, John Evangelides, Randy Dannenberg and Robert Maclean will produce. Brendan McDonald and Kirk D’Amico will serve as exec producers. Tribune Pictures is onboard to co-produce and co-finance the film.  LaBeouf can next be seen in Francis Ford Coppola’s highly anticipated Megalopolis and he’s just joined the cast of David Mamet’s Assassination. He most recently wrapped production on Abel Ferarra’s Padre Pio which follows the life of the now saint during his time as a monk in Puglia, Italy.  Amiel is an award-winning director, writer and producer who garnered international acclaim for The Singing Detective and followed that with Queen of Hearts, which premiered in Cannes. His further credits include Tune in Tomorrow, with Keanu Reeves and Peter Falk, Copycat with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter and Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Myriad Pictures’ D’Amico said, “We are delighted that Shia LaBeouf will head up the cast for this film which explores the underbelly of a police precinct in contemporary New Jersey. We think that with Jon Amiel at the helm and Shia in the title role that the result will be extraordinary and exciting.”  Meyers added, “We are really excited to have assembled such a package. With the amazing screenplay, Jon at the helm, and Shia joining Trevor as the lead actors, it is an irresistible creative coup for us. Thankfully, the investment from Robert’s Tribune Pictures enabled us to greenlight the film in time for Myriad to bring it to the Cannes Market.”  Shia LaBeouf is represented by John Crosby Management and attorney Matt Saver.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi10by1zdGFyLWluLWFjdGlvbi10aHJpbGxlci1tYWNlLWZyb20tZGlyZWN0b3Itam9uLWFtaWVsLW15cmlhZC1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW5uZXMtbWFya2V0LTEyMzUzNjk3ODgv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc2hpYS1sYWJlb3VmLXRvLXN0YXItaW4tYWN0aW9uLXRocmlsbGVyLW1hY2UtZnJvbS1kaXJlY3Rvci1qb24tYW1pZWwtbXlyaWFkLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbm5lcy1tYXJrZXQtMTIzNTM2OTc4OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-04-16","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:20:24","The Horn’s geopolitics are increasingly shaped by rich Gulf hegemons who view the region as a theatre for their competing interests.  On 16 April, a day after the fighting broke out in Khartoum, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), held an emergency Heads of State summit. It was attended virtually by the presidents of South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Djibouti. At the Summit, convened by IGAD’s executive secretary, the leaders called for a cessation of hostilities, opening of humanitarian corridors and a ceasefire to allow Sudanese citizens to peacefully observe the holy month of Ramadan.  In December last year, IGAD – alongside the other members of a Tripartite Mechanism constituted in June 2022, namely the UN and the African Union – brokered the Political Framework Agreement. The FA, as it is known, is the roadmap meant to take Sudan to civilian rule. It is a deal in which the generals agreed to relinquish power to civilians. According to the FA, a civilian government was to be formed by 11 April 2023. This didn’t happen. Four days later, the SAF and RSF were aiming guns at each other.  Formed in 1986 to tackle drought and desertification, twin preoccupations of the region’s developmentalist states, IGAD is composed of eight member states drawn from the Nile Valley, the Great Lakes and the Horn. Revitalised in 1996 with a specific mediation mandate, IGAD has been, for better or worse, the Horn’s conflict arbiter and its peace and security enforcer.  A difficult job in a tough neighbourhood, IGAD’s core strengths are its proximity to the region’s theatres of conflict – its conflict early warning mechanism, CEWARN, was designed to enhance this capability – and its accessibility to belligerents. But accessibility sometimes leads to paralysis, the most glaring example of which is the war in Tigray.  Peace-building in a tough neighbourhood  When IGAD has mediated successfully, it has done so because of the commitment of its dominant members – Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda – to stay the course: in Somalia over two decades, and in the Sudans, first midwifing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Omar al-Bashir’s NCP government and John Garang’s SPLM in 2004, and then intervening in South Sudan’s civil war between 2013 and 2018. And now in Khartoum, since the second coup in October 2019.  In Tigray, IGAD’s strengths became its major drawbacks. Bullied by Addis Ababa, it could not act without the approval of the Ethiopian state – a state of paralysis it shared with the Addis Ababa-headquartered African Union. In the end, secret arms deals between Gulf States and the Ahmed Abiy regime changed the course of the war. It was drones supplied by the Abiy’s Emirati and Turk friends that strafed the overstretched Tigrayan Defence Forces column advancing towards Addis Ababa, forcing them back into Tigray where a year-long siege forced them to the negotiating table in Pretoria.  The peace deal was eventually crafted under US tutelage, marginalising IGAD’s role in resolving the conflict. The same rings true for Somalia, where Qatar, Turkiye, the UAE, the US and the UK hold the most leverage over Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud, the current president.  Similarly, IGAD’s mediation of the civil war in South Sudan (2013-2018) came with the added complication of balancing the region’s oscillating positions, which were often influenced by Washington behind the scenes, or other members of the Troika (that is, Norway and the United Kingdom), against those of the dominant regional powers, who were themselves often interested in cutting backroom deals with individual members of the troika to advance their own narrow interests. However, it was ultimately IGAD’s commitment to the peace process that delivered the breakthrough agreement in September 2018.  A history of competing cartographies  But the Horn’s geopolitics are now increasingly shaped by rich Gulf hegemons for whom the region is a theatre for their competing commercial interests and ideological positions. In the ongoing conflict in Sudan, Saudi-Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) appear to hold the most leverage over the feuding generals, alongside Washington and London – the so-called ‘Quad’. More than anything, it is the growing influence of the larger Muslim world on the Horn of Africa that has become a determining factor in conflicts in the region.  Separated from the Middle East by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden by as little as 60km, the colonial, cultural, religious and kinship ties between the old Ottoman Empire and the Horn of Africa are often overlooked, obscured by more recent readings of the Muslim world that privilege the colonial cartography of France and Britain. Consequently, while old-fashioned geopolitical analysis remains preoccupied with China’s growing influence in the region – as a counterweight, usually presented as problematic, to the West – Middle Eastern countries, especially the axis of Saudi-Arabia and the UAE on one side, and Qatar and Turkiye on the other, still operate below the radar of serious analysis.  Over the past two decades, however, Middle Eastern countries have been quietly building their influence in the Horn through bilateral military support and public infrastructure projects. In countries such as Somalia, Muslim states’ investments far outweigh Chinese capital. In the Horn, the UAE-based port logistics company, Dubai Ports World, has not only won 30-year concessions to develop and operate ports at Berbera in Somaliland and Bosaaso in Somalia’s semi-autonomous, federal state of Puntland, but it is negotiating a similar deal at the port of Kismayo in southern Somalia. A potential deal with Kenya to run the port of Mombasa leaked in 2022, causing a public outcry. The UAE government also has plans to establish military bases across the Horn. In sum, the Middle Eastern print in countries such as Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan is widening, with important consequences.  In Sudan, Saudi-Arabia and the UAE have long sought to shape events, seeing the transition from the disastrous three-decades long rule of Omar Ahmad al-Bashir as a way to roll back Islamist influence and stabilise the region. Investors from both Saudi-Arabia and the UAE have a range of interests in Sudan, from agricultural enterprises to an airline and strategic ports on the Red Sea coast. In this way, both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have maintained a relationship with the feuding generals since they took power in 2021.  The return of al-Bashir’s Islamist crew  It is now known that the recent public appearance of Ali Karti, former foreign minister in the Bashir regime and currently the Secretary-General of the Islamic Movement, who has close relations with Islamists in SAF, irked both Saudi-Arabia and the UAE. Qatar, another rich Gulf state with geopolitical ambitions in the Horn of Africa, is known to be supportive of Islamist movements across the region. On learning that Bashir-era Islamists may be rising again under the SAF, the RSF, supported by Saudi-Arabia and the UAE, increased its deployments in Khartoum, intensifying tensions between al-Burhan and Hemedti.  Egypt, one of the few African countries holding some influence in Sudan, especially with Al-Burhan, successfully negotiated a ceasefire during the first week of the conflict, but only so that it could evacuate its 177 troops, based mostly in the northern town of Merowe, after which fighting resumed. At its southern border with Sudan, through which many civilians are fleeing the intensifying conflict, Egyptian officials seem reluctant to let in refugees, causing a serious humanitarian crisis at the border.  Libya, the other African country seemingly involved in the conflict, has denied its role in fanning the rift between the SAF and RSF. While Hemedti has accused Egypt of supporting Al-Burhan by sending soldiers and fighter jets to help the SAF – allegations that Egypt has denied – Libyan warlord, Khalifa Haftar, has reportedly sent military supplies to Hemedti’s RSF, which he also denies. Russia’s Wagner Group, suspected of supporting Hemedti, has denied that it is involved in Sudan. The US, the other instrumental actor in Sudan, has focussed most of its attention on evacuating its citizens, a request granted by Al-Burhan a few days after the fighting began.  Strange bedfellows  South Sudan, which exports its oil outputs of 170, 000 barrels per day via a 1,600-km pipeline through Sudan, its northern neighbour, has reported a disruption of logistics and transport links between its oilfields and Port Sudan. Its diplomats and military generals have offered to negotiate a truce between Al-Burhan and Hemedti, but this request, coming from an IGAD member that has itself endured conflict for several years, was derided in some quarters.  But it would be a mistake to ignore its significance, not least because of the history between Khartoum and Juba and a strong sense of reciprocity. Both Al-Burhan and Hemedti helped negotiate the 2018 peace deal between South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir Mayardit and its current first vice-president, Riek Machar Teny. When Al-Bashir was ousted in 2019, South Sudan staged the Juba Agreement for Peace in Sudan, between the Transitional Government of Sudan, headed by then Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, Al-Burhan and other rebel movements in Sudan.  The Juba Peace Agreement considered various transitional justice issues, including the structure of government of a future Sudan and the parameters of absorption of the various armed movements into government forces. It was overtaken by the 25 October 2021 coup. Universal condemnation of the coup, including a suspension of Sudan from the AU, opened room for the beginning of the Tripartite Mechanism.  The FA sought to remove any formal role for the military in Sudan’s politics. The Tripartite mechanism that facilitated the FA also involved more than 40 civilian entities in the deliberations, including the Forces of Freedom and Change-Central Council (FFC-CC) – the only one of the three factions of the splintered 2019 protest movement willing to negotiate with the military – and a number of political parties and CSOs, notably including the Call for Sudan’s People Initiative, and former armed movements, all allied to the military.  The rise of the Quad, and IGAD’s retreat  But it is perhaps the ‘Quad’, consisting of Saudi-Arabia and the UAE, alongside the US and the UK, that holds the most influence over Al-Burhan and Hemedti. When contentious issues, especially regarding the place of the RSF in the future of Sudan persisted after the signing of the FA, and tensions between the two generals emerged, it is the Quad that negotiated a truce on 11 March. It didn’t hold.  Unlike its predecessor, the AU at its formation granted itself the power to intervene in the internal affairs of a member-state to restore peace and stability, to prevent widespread atrocities and genocide. In the aftermath of the Rwanda genocide, the AU was keen to spell out that the right to intervene in a member state’s territory would be shared between the UN Security Council, the AU itself and/or other regional blocs across the continent.  This experiment was first put to the test in Burundi and Sudan’s Darfur region, when the AU deployed peacekeepers. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) used the same template in 2007.  A major drawback for an interventionist AU was its reliance on external funding, which often force it to bow to the dictates of the West, particularly the US, UK and the EU, despite its direct mandate to protect the continent’s people.  IGAD’s mediating authority is further undermined by its member states, themselves facing multiple domestic challenges, worsened by a global economic recession. Take Kenya, which, as chair of the UN Security Council in 2021, led the UN’s mediation efforts in Tigray, is a major guarantor of state-building efforts in Somalia, and leads the East African Community Regional Force in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, not only has the Kenyan state found itself locked in a protracted democratic transition at home, but its reputation as a haven of regional economic stability is being seriously threatened by a crippling debt crisis.  The Horn’s perennial dilemma  Ethiopia, the other IGAD member with a history as regional power-broker, is struggling to lift itself up from the Tigray war, whose tenuous resolution could be upset anytime by Eritrea. While both Kenya and Ethiopia are expected to rise to the occasion in resolving the conflict in Sudan, care must also be taken not to create competition between the two countries as regional peace builders. In the final analysis, any revamp plan for IGAD will most certainly require foreign funding, in this case, the EU, putting the question, again, over who has the leverage in resolving the region’s conflicts.  A case in point is a meeting on 27 April by the Heads of State of Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) under the African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) held in Entebbe, Uganda, which expressed concern over what they described as inadequate, unsustainable and unpredictable funding. Some ATMIS (formerly AMISOM) troops haven’t been paid for months, at a time when the mission is supposed to round-up its operations in Somalia and hand-over the security responsibilities to the Federal Government.  In Sudan, the asymmetry between competing external actors and regional blocs increasingly reliant on the same hegemons for individual and collective financial support, presents us with that perennial dilemma so characteristic of three decades of conflict in the Horn: the imperative to strike a deal, however transient, between the men with guns establishes a lopsided peace. How can a lasting peace be organised in which the democratic demands of the civilian forces are not merely an afterthought?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhbmFyZ3VtZW50cy5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS9zdWRhbi10aGUtcXVpZXQtc2NyYW1ibGUtdG8tYnJva2VyLXRoZS1wZWFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Boris Titov, head of the Russian delegation of the Cuban-Russian Business Committee, told a forum of Russian entrepreneurs in Havana that Cuba had decisively opened the door to Russian investment.  ""They are giving us preferential treatment,"" Titov told the packed forum in Havana´s Hotel Nacional. ""The path is clear.""  Titov said Cuba had offered Russian businesses the right to make use of Cuban land for 30 year-terms, an unusual concession to foreign firms in the communist-run country.  He said Cuba would also exempt Russian companies from import tariffs on certain technology, and would allow Russian firms to repatriate their profits, a benefit in Cuba´s state-dominated economy.  The two countries, on opposite sides of the globe, are also considering ways to fast-track shipping between them, Titov said.  ""In Soviet times there was a direct port and maritime link,"" Titov told the forum. ""We are analyzing this possibility with the owners of Cuban ships.""  Cuba in recent months has sought to woo investors from Russia and other politically allied nations in a bid to shore up its devastated economy, ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, harsh U.S. sanctions and rampant inefficiencies.  Russia, also reeling from Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, has in recent months moved to strengthen economic ties with Cuba and other Latin American countries opposed to what it calls U.S. hegemony.  Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba´s minister of foreign commerce told reporters on the sidelines of the forum that the economic ties between Russia and Cuba would only grow stronger.  ""Nothing and no one can stop it,"" Cabrisas said.  Bilateral trade between Cuba and Russia reached $450 million in 2022, three times that of 2021, according to Sergei Baldin, Russia´s trade representative in Cuba.  Baldin said 90% of that trade was comprised of sales of petroleum products and soy oil.

"coup","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:42:00","Rutgers junior quarterback Gavin Wimsatt has a new weapon sitting in Dave Brock’s wide receiver room after personally recruiting one of the biggest prizes in the transfer portal this spring.  Simultaneously, Greg Schiano may have found a new No. 1 wide receiver in the aforementioned JaQuae Jackson, who caught 77 passes for almost 1,200 yards and 15 scores as a Division-II All-American wide receiver for the California University of Pennsylvania Vulcans last fall.  A 6-foot-3, 180-pound senior, Jackson took official visits to the University of Miami, Texas A&M, Colorado and Pitt, but chose Rutgers which he officially visited in April with his mother and uncle flanked by his side.  A dynamic wide receiver who can play outside or cause matchup problems inside, Jackson could change the trajectory of Rutgers’ offense with his final year of college eligibility beginning on Sept. 2 when Rutgers hosts the Northwestern Wildcats at SHI Stadium on opening night.  A Pittsburgh native who played for Serra Catholic high school, Jackson was named first-team all-state at defensive back and second-team as an athlete in 2017, before joining the local Vulcans. He was drawn five-and-a-half hours east to Schiano, Dave Brock, offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca, and their NFL backgrounds, which Jackson feels can help him reach the NFL himself.  Offensive line coach Pat Flaherty, who coached offensive linemen or tight ends for the New York Giants, 49ers, Redskins, Bears, Jaguars and Dolphins, add to Rutgers’ pro ties, which Jackson prioritized after spending five years at a small school.  Rutgers’ quarterback heading into the fall, Wimsatt completed just 44.8% of his passes for 757 yards while throwing five touchdowns and seven interceptions last season. He said improving his mechanics comes down to “more consistency”.  “Just being intentional with your work,” Wimsatt said when asked what goes into that consistency. “Whenever you’re doing any drill just be intentional about it. Every rep counts.”  Adding a player with the tools that Jackson brings can bolster an offense that moved with more intention this spring.  Jackson was hosted on his Rutgers official visit by junior wide receiver Chris Long, who alongside Wimsatt, spent the weekend tethered to Jackson’s hip. The visit consisted mostly of football meetings and schematic and developmental details.  It was topped off by lounging and fine dining in New York City with coaches and veteran players, including junior safety Max Melton, a likely early-round NFL Draft pick.  Senior Naseim Brantley will return from injury this summer while Long and sophomore Rashad Rochelle — another speedster — round into top targets, joining senior Isaiah Washington, from Jacksonville, Fla., on Wimsatt’s receiver route tree next fall.

The iconic dark ride, which also operates at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, US, first opened at Universal Studios Japan on January 23, 2004.    Offering the same experience as its Orlando counterpart, the Spider-Man dark ride takes guests on a high-paced adventure with Spider-Man, as he tries to prevent the Sinister Syndicate - a supervillain criminal organisation made up of Doctor Octopus, Scream, Hydro-Man, Hobgoblin and Electro - from stealing the Statue of Liberty.    Combining an Omnimover system with both 3D and 4D elements, the ride was developed by an A-list of attractions industry veterans, including former senior VP and chief creative officer at Universal Creative Thierry Coup; Scott Trowbridge, portfolio creative executive at Walt Disney Imagineering; and Philip Hettema, president and creative director of The Hettema Group.    The ride came as part of a major expansion of Universal Studios Japan - the first since the park first opened to the public in 2001. It will close on January 22, 2024, just one day shy of its twentieth anniversary, as Marvel's 20-year licensing agreement with Universal for the Japanese rights expires.    While the licensing agreement with Marvel is expiring in Japan, it's unlikely that the Orlando version of the attraction will suffer the same fate, as Universal's rights agreement with Marvel for the region continues indefinitely.    This closure follows the recent shutdown of the nearby Terminator 2 3D attraction. Universal has not yet announced replacements for either attraction, leading to speculation that a permanent Pokémon land could be planned for the park.    To commemorate the ride's closing, Universal Studios Japan will launch The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man final campaign ride experience, available from July, which includes a special sticker celebrating the ride.

"coup","2016-07-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:00:00","Failed  There is no coup brewing over proposals to reconfigure the pension system for military and uniformed personnel (MUP). What is happening is potentially worse.  According to military and police officials, the possibility of the MUP pension system being reformed creates the possibility of wholesale early retirement in the security and public order agencies. If this happens in any significant scale, we could see our military and police agencies seriously decimated.  Choosing early retirement is a right – even if the possibility of dislocation is great. It will take years to train replacements for personnel choosing early retirement. That might not happen quickly enough. In the meantime, we will have to try and cope with gutted services.  We are told that the proposal to reform the MUP pension system is now causing serious demoralization in the ranks. But not undertaking the reform has become unsustainable.  The MUP pension system is a textbook case of myopic policymaking – in this case animated by the desire to curry political favor with the uniformed sector. This sector has been allowed a separate pension system where member contributions are minimal and benefits are generous.  This is an unsustainable system. It can only be kept afloat through humongous subsidies. Government now coughs up hundreds of billions to support this badly designed pension system. If left unattended, the subsidy will run into the trillions.  It seems this system was designed for popularity points in complete disregard of actuarial science. This is, unfortunately, how many of our policies are shaped.  This is a benefits-driven system, a way of rewarding the loyalty of our uniformed personnel without the transparency of a wage schedule. No one in the policy- and law-making process gave a thought about sustainability. It is as if government coffers are there for the looting.  A benefit, once granted, is very difficult to withdraw. We see that in the angry protest actions going on in France over the thoroughly sane proposal to raise the retirement age from the present 62 to 64. Even after adjustment, the French retirement age is still lower than what prevails elsewhere. And even after that adjustment, the pension system is still not sustainable, considering the aging population.  In our case, the faulty actuarial design of the MUP pension system is aggravated by the fact that our soldiers are made to retire at 56 – a waste, considering all the money spent on their training. After that, they begin receiving pensions. Soldiers who retire tend to live longer lives. That means they could be receiving pensions for more years than they actually served.  Add to this the survivorship clauses that allow spouses to continue collecting from the pension system. That extends the payout period even more.  Under the MUP, a retired officer could expect to receive P40,000 monthly for the rest of his life. That is much higher than what SSS and GSIS retirees get – even if, during their active service, MUPs contributed a much smaller share of their pay than those in the other two pension systems.  Government cannot continue funding the MUP pension fund without raising taxes dramatically across the board – or by wanton borrowing. It will be very hard to qualify borrowing to support a badly designed pension fund. Therefore, the borrowing is likely to cost more.  The GSIS and the SSS have both been criticized for having short actuarial lives. There is real danger that younger Filipinos in the workforce might be unable to collect pensions by the time they retire.  By comparison, the MUP pension system has no actuarial life to speak of. It already depends on subsidies to cover their payouts.  Much has been said about the irresponsible borrowing that brought us to a severe debt crisis in the eighties. Not enough has been said, however, about the fact that much of the borrowing prior to the debt crisis went to the Napocor and the MWSS. Government subsidized electricity and water to placate the people. A large portion of the debt we continue to pay to this day went to electricity and water consumers.  Today, unless the MUP pension system is dramatically reformed, we will be in danger of piling up our debt stock even more to subsidize an actuarially unsustainable setup. Those who enjoy the sumptuous benefits from the failed MUP system – and those who will try to lock in their benefits by retiring early – must be reminded that the payouts are made possible only by large public subsidies.  There is catastrophe lying in wait down the road. The MUP pension system has failed. The GSIS and SSS could fail in due time if contributions are not increased. Government will have a financing problem in the trillions if all pension systems are not corrected today.  But reconfiguring the pension system will be a political challenge. We have seen how everyone reflexively opposes any effort to raise contributions to the pension funds. Meanwhile, we all expect the SSS and the GSIS to suspend loan collections for communities hit by calamity. Our political system is not the most financially literate in the world.  In the particular case of the MUP pensions system, government will have to muster political will in heroic proportions to get the reforms done. The community of uniformed personnel is a powerful lobby group in our system. This community will definitely exert pressure for government to abandon pension reforms.  In they are unable to block the reforms, many will opt for early retirement. They will take the money and run. Patriotism will not hold them back.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvMjI2NzEwMS9mYWlsZWTSAT9odHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi8yMDIzLzA1LzE4LzIyNjcxMDEvZmFpbGVkL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-01-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:45:37","Defense Minister José Múcio Monteiro’s own words came back to haunt him at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Wednesday, although lawmakers seemed not to notice.  Speaking about the Supreme Court’s ongoing efforts to accept charges against hundreds of January 8 rioters, Mr. Múcio said: “If we have relatives, friends, colleagues, soldiers, sailors, pilots who committed irresponsibilities, they [should be] punished.”  Of the 1,390 people charged in connection with the January 8 riots — when hordes of pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators stormed and ransacked the buildings that house Brazil’s three branches of government — several are retired military officers or their relatives.  Hundreds of the demonstrators joined the riots after leaving a pro-Bolsonaro putschist camp — set up shortly after Jair Bolsonaro’s defeat in the October election — outside the Army’s headquarters in Brasília.  On January 2, shortly after taking office and days before the riots, the defense minister said that he himself had relatives in the protest camps, but argued that they were simply a “manifestation of democracy.” He added that he believed the camps would “fade away” and refused to use his authority to dismantle them.  In late 2022, local Brasília police tried to dismantle the putschist camp, but they were prevented from doing so by the Army, which has jurisdiction over military areas. After President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was sworn in on January 1, his Defense Ministry and government as a whole took no further action against the camp until after the riots. The camp was dismantled on the morning of January 9, and hundreds of people were arrested.  A report by the Justice Ministry later found that the protest camp was “central” to the unrest.  In addition to the retired military members who took part in the riots, the role of some active-duty officers is under investigation. Lula last month fired General Gonçalves Dias, his top security official, after leaked surveillance footage showed him to be inside the presidential palace on January 8.  Today’s public hearing was also a preview of the upcoming joint select committee on the January 8 riots. Two far-right lawmakers, Ricardo Salles and Marcel van Hattem, criticized the Armed Forces — a move that would have been unthinkable coming from them during the Bolsonaro administration.  Mr. van Hattem said that “what happened on January 8 ruined the credibility of the Armed Forces for a large part of the Brazilian population.” The strategy is clearly aimed at blaming the military for failing to stop the riots and whitewashing then-President Jair Bolsonaro’s very public efforts to threaten a coup and incite his voters to reject the election results.  Congressman van Hattem persisted in his putschist discourse, asking Army Commander Tomás Paiva: “What are the Armed Forces doing to reverse this [situation]? Because every day you salute a crook [a reference to Lula], the situation gets worse.” Other lawmakers fired back, stating that Mr. van Hattem has refused to accept Mr. Bolsonaro’s electoral defeat.  General Paiva politely replied that the military is “fulfilling its constitutional mission.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYnJhemlsaWFuLnJlcG9ydC9saXZlYmxvZy9wb2xpdGljcy1pbnNpZGVyLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvZGVmZW5zZS1tdWNpby1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5nL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vYnJhemlsaWFuLnJlcG9ydC9saXZlYmxvZy9wb2xpdGljcy1pbnNpZGVyLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvZGVmZW5zZS1tdWNpby1ob3VzZS1oZWFyaW5nL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2021-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:29:59","Experts say arrests are part of a broader campaign by the army to consolidate control over aid relief.  Sudanese security forces have arrested three activists from the country’s pro-democracy movement, according to a family member, their peers and local media reports.  Mohamad “Tupac” Adam, Mohamad al-Fattah and Mohamad al-Bushra were arrested while convening a meeting at a primary school to discuss how to aid internally displaced people on Tuesday morning in Madani, a city in northern Jazeera state, Adam’s mother told Al Jazeera.  Adam and al-Fattah often distributed food and aid to people arriving in the city after fleeing the conflict in the capital Khartoum, activists and residents said.  They added that the young men were detained by the Central Reserve Police Force, which is aligned with the Sudanese army in its fight against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).  “I’m very scared and I don’t know what to do now,” Adam’s mother, Nidal Arbab Suliman, told Al Jazeera from her home in the capital Khartoum. “I’m afraid that if anyone else in our family leaves the house, they will be beaten up or arrested.”  It was not immediately clear why the men were arrested. Al Jazeera has contacted Sudan’s army spokesman Nabil Abdullah for comment.      Activists and analysts say the arrests on Tuesday are part of a broader campaign by the army and allied forces to crack down on well-known personalities from the pro-democracy movement and consolidate control over aid relief.  Since the conflict erupted on April 15, medics, journalists and politicians have been smeared, threatened and attacked. Members of the resistance committees – neighbourhood groups leading calls for democracy and providing vital provisions to civilians caught in the fighting – are also being targeted.  On May 7, the army detained two men from a resistance committee for escorting wounded RSF fighters to a hospital, before publishing a statement that justified the arrests by equating the activists with enemy combatants.  The two were released the following day after a public outcry.  “One narrative the army has tried to portray is that because resistance committees are engaged in humanitarian work, they are somehow supporting the RSF,” Hamid Murtada, a Sudanese analyst and a member of a resistance committee, told Al Jazeera from Cairo in Egypt, where he recently arrived after fleeing Khartoum.  “That gives the [army] an excuse to target them, kidnap them and even kill them.”  Torture and maltreatment  Adam and al-Fattah were among hundreds of prisoners who escaped last month after the RSF attacked prisons in Khartoum.  Adam was previously detained by security forces two months after the October 2021 military coup that derailed the country’s transition to democracy, after taking part in anti-coup protests. He and two other people were accused of killing a police officer. Adam’s lawyers said he was denied due process and was tortured.  His case became a rallying cry of the pro-democracy movement, prompting rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to advocate for a fair trial and humane treatment.  But as the conflict in Sudan escalates, there is increasing domestic and international focus on allegations of human rights abuses but less attention on the treatment of prisoners. Rights groups have documented accounts of sexual abuse and rape, allegations of arbitrary arrests and abductions and damage to medical facilities.  The lack of monitoring means that the de facto authorities have little reason to fear repercussions for subjecting prisoners to maltreatment, according to Emma DiNapoli, an expert in international law who has followed Adam and al-Fattah’s cases.  “Even before the conflict … prisons were overcrowded, detainees were routinely subjected to torture and ill-treatment and the judiciary was not up to the task of safeguarding rights. Tupac and al-Fattah’s experiences in prison bear this out,” she told Al Jazeera.  “Now, given the situation in Sudan, we can only expect a deterioration in conditions in detention centres, with very high risks of torture or deprivation of food and water and only limited ability by lawyers to monitor conditions and advocate for detainees.”  Competing for legitimacy  Military intelligence arrested three more resistance committee members from Khartoum North on Tuesday, the area’s resistance committee tweeted.  It said in a statement that the activists were taken from their homes without explanation.  Murtada said he believes that the army and its allies are attempting to disrupt and punish resistance committees for assuming the role of service provision in order to consolidate control over the humanitarian response.  Since the conflict started, the committees have procured fuel to power hospitals, managed food and medicine distributions and set up clinics across the capital.      “[The arrests of activists] manifested in how the [army] is trying to control the international assistance coming in,” Murtada said.  Last week, Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on international aid organisations to coordinate relief distribution with the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a government agency.  “Unfortunately, the international community isn’t saying no to [cooperating with the army] despite knowing how the entities of the Sudanese Armed Forces like HAC can’t be trusted to deliver humanitarian assistance,” Murtada told Al Jazeera. “The army is using [aid] for political gain.”  Additional reporting by Hiba Saleh Abdel Azeem","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvdGhyZWUtcHJvLWRlbW9jcmFjeS1hY3RpdmlzdHMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtaW4tc3VkYW7SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy90aHJlZS1wcm8tZGVtb2NyYWN5LWFjdGl2aXN0cy1hcnJlc3RlZC1pbi1zdWRhbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Sydney"", ""NewSouthWales"", ""Australia""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:31:00","These criticisms are overblown, overwrought and, in some cases, simply wrong.  Of course, it’s a shame that President Biden isn’t visiting next week. The image of the leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia assembling at the Sydney Opera House would have been a coup for Anthony Albanese and a show of solidarity by four democracies in the face of China’s challenging behaviour.  Biden’s speech to the Australian parliament would have been a notable moment in the history of the alliance.  More significantly, his visit to Port Moresby would have been the first by a sitting president to a Pacific Island country and a chance to finalise the new US-PNG security agreement.  So, Washington has missed an opportunity this week. But let’s keep things in perspective.  In America’s messy and disaggregated political system, the executive doesn’t control the legislature. Biden’s top priority in the coming week is to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt, which would cause global financial instability and undercut American economic leadership. Biden judged that his presence in Washington was required to avoid that outcome. Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?  Advertisement  Americans need to take care that their domestic problems don’t spill over into foreign policy. But Biden’s cancellation is not a symptom of post-imperial decline. Bill Clinton cancelled a trip to APEC to avoid a government shutdown in 1995, when America was in the full flush of its unipolar moment.  Neither is it a sign of presidential “frailty”. Biden is a serious political figure and a potent foreign policy president.  Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?  In 2020, Biden did America’s allies a great service by marching the appalling and dangerous Donald Trump out of the White House.  His administration has responded to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine with strength and subtlety. It has brought consistency to the US relationship with China. Last week, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spent two days in Vienna talking sense to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.  The White House’s decision does not “raise questions about the reliability of the United States as a regional ally”, as political editor of The Australian Financial Review Phillip Coorey reported on Thursday.  Advertisement  On the contrary, Biden has restored America’s regional alliances after the trauma of the Trump years. He has deepened diplomatic and defence links with Japan.  Last month, he closed a deal with the president of South Korea to counter the nuclear threat from Pyongyang and prevent Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear deterrent.  This month, Biden hosted Ferdinand Marcos jnr – the first Philippines president to visit the Oval Office in a decade – and reinvigorated US-Filipino military ties.  It was Biden who first convened the Quad countries at the leaders’ level. Hopefully, the four leaders will now meet in Hiroshima and advance the Quad’s agenda.  What about Australia? As part of AUKUS, Biden agreed to share one of America’s most advanced technologies – its naval nuclear propulsion system – to enable us to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.  This is a “big bet” on Australia, Jake Sullivan told the Lowy Institute in 2021. “We trust you, we believe in you. And we believe even more importantly in our collective combined capacity to produce greater stability, security and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region.”  Advertisement  Some commentators seem to have a case of nerves. They should take their lead instead from the Australian public.  Over the course of nearly two decades of Lowy Institute polling – and even at the depths of the misbegotten Iraq war – strong majorities of Australians have seen the US alliance as “very” or “fairly” important for Australia’s security. In the 2023 Lowy Institute Poll, which will be released next month, eight in 10 (82 per cent) continue to see the alliance as important to our security. One presidential no-show won’t change that long-held view.  The US presence in Asia gives structure to the region, which would otherwise be dominated by one giant authoritarian power. Through our active diplomacy in South-East Asia and the Pacific, as well as through the alliance, AUKUS and the Quad, Australia is contributing to a stable balance of power.  Nothing has changed this week. The sky remains in place.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcG9saWN5L2ZvcmVpZ24tYWZmYWlycy9jYW5jZWwtdGhlLW5vLXNob3ctb3ZlcnJlYWN0aW9uLXRvLWEtcG90ZW50LWZvcmVpZ24tcG9saWN5LXByZXNpZGVudC0yMDIzMDUxNi1wNWQ4cXrSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Pacific island nation saw its first change of leader in 16 years at a tightly fought national election in December, where Fiji First, which won 42% of the vote, was defeated by a coalition of three parties.  Four Fiji political parties were suspended for 30 days on Wednesday for not submitting audited accounts, local media reported.

Led by Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and several right-leaning Christian advocacy groups, the backlash spurred the Dodgers to announce on Twitter that the team had rescinded the invitation, saying the Sisters’ inclusion was simply too controversial.  “In the spirit of unity, the Los Angeles Dodgers are proud to host our 10th annual LGBTQ+ Pride Night on June 16th,” the tweet said. “Given the strong feelings of people who have been offended by the sisters’ inclusion in our evening, and in an effort not to distract from the great benefits that we have seen over the years of Pride Night, we are deciding to remove them from this year’s group of honorees.”  “The ‘sisters’ are men who dress in lewd imitation of Roman Catholic nuns,” Rubio wrote in a letter to Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. “The group’s motto, ‘Go and sin some more,’ is a perversion of Jesus’s command to ‘Go, and sin no more.’”  In San Francisco, where the kabuki-makeup-wearing Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was founded in 1979, the group is known for producing the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary contests on Easter Sunday in Dolores Park and for collecting donations at the gates to the Folsom Street Fair.  Sister Roma, the “most photographed nun in the world,” was unsparing in her criticism.  “In two short hours, we went from celebrating the fact that they were giving us the Amazing Heroes Awards to basically caving to these pseudo-Christian media outlets and far-right conservative bigots like Marco Rubio,” Roma told The Standard. “It’s just insane to me that, here in California, the Dodgers would so quickly cave to this obvious bullshit rhetoric and hate.”  The fact that it happened in progressive California should send a signal to LGBTQ+ Americans that the reaction against queer visibility is not confined to red states like Florida, she said.  “This doesn’t bode well for the future for anyone who’s queer, trans, has an alternative lifestyle, for women,” Roma added. “People need to realize that these fascists are planning a coup of our entire country.”  San Francisco Pride has worked with the San Francisco Giants to produce large-scale events at Oracle Park. Executive Director Suzanne Ford, a trans woman, defended the Sisters’ work.  “I would like to highlight that they’re excluding a group that has helped countless people in the LGBTQ community in their fundraising efforts,” Ford said. “They’ve fed and housed people for years. That shouldn't get lost in all this.”  In the years since workplace protections were codified and marriage equality became legal nationwide, many LGBTQ+ rights organizations have seen professional sports as one of the few remaining domains of American life where institutional homophobia and LGBTQ+ exclusion remain the norm.  Although Pride Night has increasingly been a staple at American stadiums in June, homophobic incidents are not uncommon. In 2020, an announcer for the Cincinnati Reds was suspended for using an anti-gay slur. And the backlash against transgender athletes in sports has become part of a pretext for a wider crusade against LGBTQ+ visibility more generally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZzdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5L2xvcy1hbmdlbGVzLWRvZGdlcnMtZGlzaW52aXRlLWZhbW91cy1kcmFnLW51bnMtZnJvbS1wcmlkZS1uaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This was followed by an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management, one of the most prestigious MBAs in the world—MIT came fourth in the US News & World Report 2023 Ranking, 11th in the Financial Times MBA Ranking 2023 and is one of the elite M7 business schools.  After graduating from MIT before his 25th birthday, Limjoroenrat was forced to begin his career in business after the death of his father. Taking over the running of his late father's rice bran oil company for several years, he later worked as an executive director for the Singapore-based ride and delivery app, Grab Thailand.  Alongside this strong business pedigree is a highly political background. His father was an adviser to the Thai agriculture ministry, while his uncle worked as an aide to Thai Thaksin Shinawatra—the billionaire telecoms tycoon and populist former premier who was unseated in a coup in 2006.  Limjoroenrat entered the political landscape in 2019, elected as the leader of the progressive Future Forward party which was controversially forced to disband after winning an unprecedented amount of votes in election polls that year.  The party was reincarnated as Move Forward, which was formed on the back of a series of anti-monarchy protests led by young and urban voters in 2020, who were frustrated by the endless cycle of military coups and crackdowns.  As the party’s charismatic leader, Limjoroenrat has since increased his popularity by posting viral social media campaign videos, showcasing him talking to street vendors while accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter.  Although he has not yet secured the premiership, following the general election results Limjoroenrat declared on Monday that he is “ready to be the next prime minister.”  Limjoroenrat is not the only MIT Sloan MBA to make waves after graduation. The highly academic degree is known for developing principled, innovative leaders including former Microsoft chairman, John W Thompson, and HubSpot co-founder Brian Halligan.

The U.N. humanitarian agency said it needs $2.6 billion to help those still within Sudan, saying 25 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid and protection.  Ramesh Rajasingham, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva and director of the Coordination Division, said the fighting in Sudan has been a “cruel blow to the people of Sudan.”  Rajasingham said the conflict has left at least 676 dead, with the true toll likely much higher.  Another $400 million of the appeal came from the U.N. refugee agency to help those who have fled to neighboring countries to escape the fighting in Sudan.  SEE ALSO: A related video by Henry Wilkins  Mervat Shelbaya, chief of the interagency support branch for U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva, said at a briefing Wednesday the fighting has forced more than 950,000 people from their homes and also forced 220,000 into neighboring countries.  “If we are to scale up our response and reach all those in need, we and the people of Sudan need the generous support of the international community,” Shelbaya said.  The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.  The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.  Tensions between the generals have been growing over disagreements about how the Rapid Support Forces should be integrated in the army and who should oversee that process. The restructuring of the military was part of an effort to restore the country to civilian rule and end the political crisis sparked by the 2021 military coup.

PHOTO: AFP  Pakistan’s friends are increasingly growing concerned over the increasing political instability in the country and conveying discreet messages seeking a resolution of the crisis through negotiations.  Diplomatic sources familiar with the development told The Express Tribune that China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in particular were worried over the deteriorating political stability in Pakistan.  When Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang recently undertook his maiden trip to Pakistan, he publicly expressed concerns over the current political situation and stressed the need for reaching a consensus to deal with the crisis.  The Chinese foreign minister was in Pakistan on May 5 and 6 on his first visit to Islamabad.  Read US expert raises concerns over political instability after Imran's arrest  At a news conference with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the top Chinese diplomat expressed his worries about Pakistan’s increasing instability, telling the country to overcome political differences to pave the way for economic progress.  “We sincerely hope the political forces in Pakistan will build consensus, uphold stability and more effectively address domestic [as well as] external challenges so it can focus on growing the economy,” Qin said.  This was unusual on the part of China, which usually works behind the scenes to convey its concerns on any issue.  There were reports that the UAE president in a telephonic conversation with the Pakistani army chief called for unity in the country, a subtle message to resolve issues through talks.  It is believed that Saudi Arabia is also keen to seek some semblance of political stability returning to Pakistan.  Although there was no official confirmation, the visit of the deputy interior minister of Saudi Arabia was also seen in the context of efforts by Pakistan’s friends to defuse the ongoing political tensions.  Read more US, UK back ‘rule of law’ after Imran’s arrest  Saudi Arabia and the UAE played a role in defusing the political tensions in Pakistan in the past as well.  The most prominent role Saudi Arabia played was after the 1999 coup when Riyadh managed to secure the release of former premier Nawaz Sharif as part of a deal with then military ruler General Pervez Musharraf.  Some observers believe that Pakistan’s friends may be concerned over the political stability in the country but none of them was willing to directly become involved.  “Yes, our friends indirectly do keep on passing messages to all sides to put our house in order,” said a source.  However, the source added that the current political situation in Pakistan was so toxic that no country could take the risk of directly interfering in its internal matters. “But the discreet messaging will continue,” the source continued.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjQxNzI4MC9wb2xpdGljYWwtY3Jpc2lzLXVubmVydmVzLWZyaWVuZGx5LWNvdW50cmllc9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjQxNzI4MC9wb2xpdGljYWwtY3Jpc2lzLXVubmVydmVzLWZyaWVuZGx5LWNvdW50cmllcz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Partners Relief and Development/Handout via REUTERS  Hundreds of people, including Rohingya Muslims, were feared dead after a cyclone struck Myanmar at the weekend, residents and aid groups said on Tuesday, with rescue efforts hampered by damage to infrastructure.  Myanmar's impoverished Rakhine State bore the brunt of Cyclone Mocha, during which winds of up to 210 kph (130 mph) ripped roofs off homes and brought a storm surge that inundated the state capital Sittwe.  The region has a large population of Rohingya Muslims, a persecuted minority that successive Myanmar governments have refused to recognise. More than a million live in sprawling camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, having fled military crackdowns in recent years.  Myanmar has been gripped by political and economic chaos since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. Since then, fighting has raged across the country between the military and pro-democracy or allied ethnic armed groups.  Residents of Rakhine State said at least 100 people had been killed and many more were missing and feared dead, adding that aid had yet to arrive. Bangladesh faced its worst power cuts in over seven months.  Reuters was not able to independently verify the death toll.  A resident in the area, who declined to be identified over concerns for his safety, told Reuters more than 100 Rohingya were killed, based on assessments from multiple villages he said he had visited in the aftermath.  Two other residents contacted by Reuters also said a large number of people had been killed, as did a diplomatic source briefed on the situation, who did not provide details.  News portal Myanmar Now reported hundreds were feared dead, while aid groups said there were a ""significant number of deaths"".  Myanmar's state media said three people were killed.  A spokesperson for the pro-democracy shadow National Unity Government told Reuters: ""We received confirmation of about 400 Rohingya deaths, mainly around Sittwe area"".  The storm was one of the worst since Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of southern Myanmar killing nearly 140,000 people in 2008.  'NIGHTMARE SCENARIO'  A United Nations official said 5.4 million people were expected to have been in the storm's path, the majority of whom were considered vulnerable.  ""It's really a nightmare scenario for the cyclone to hit areas with such deep pre-existing needs,"" said Ramanathan Balakrishnan at the UN's Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Shelter, water, sanitation, and relief items were early priorities, he said.  Storm damage to communications and road infrastructure and ongoing restrictions by Myanmar's military government was making it difficult to get information from and deliver aid to the affected area, non-governmental organisations said.  ""It's difficult to obtain accurate or up to date information, which also makes responding to the crisis adequately even more difficult,"" said Manny Maung of Human Rights Watch.  Non-governmental relief organisation Partners said on Twitter: ""We are scaling up our response effort to provide critical relief supplies like rice and tarps to Rohingya communities affected by Cyclone Mocha as we are able.""  Myanmar's state media on Tuesday said junta chief Min Aung Hlaing had visited Sittwe to assess the damage, donate money and give instructions on the response.  Before the storm made landfall on Sunday about 400,000 people were evacuated in Myanmar and Bangladesh.  The U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said about 6 million people in the region were already in need of humanitarian assistance before the storm, among them 1.2 million people internally displaced by ethnic conflict.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkL2h1bmRyZWRzLWZlYXJlZC1kZWFkLWFmdGVyLWN5Y2xvbmUtaGl0cy13ZXN0ZXJuLW15YW5tYXItNjMzNzIy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGJzbmV3cy5uZXQvd29ybGQvaHVuZHJlZHMtZmVhcmVkLWRlYWQtYWZ0ZXItY3ljbG9uZS1oaXRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tbXlhbm1hci02MzM3MjI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eighty-eight-year-old Nebraskan Beverly Deepe Keever knows that war better than most Americans. She was America’s longest-serving Vietnam War correspondent.  Born in Hebron, Nebraska, Beverly Deepe Keever earned her journalism degree from University of Nebraska and a master’s from New York’s Columbia University. At age 26, she bought a one-way ticket to Asia to teach English and sell freelance stories to the Associated Press.  “I went into journalism because I wanted to understand people and culture in other countries,” Deepe Keever said.  Author, journalist and scholar Brooke Kroeger said Deepe Keever had something special as a reporter.  ""This is someone who's got a halo, you know,” he said. “There's something really marvelous about her in her sense of herself, even coming from a small Nebraska town.”  A year after arriving in Asia, Deepe Keever came to Saigon as fighting began heating up between South Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong guerrillas backed by Communist North Vietnam. The U.S. government sent 500 military advisors to help South Vietnam, and more U.S. troops began pouring in. In 1962, Deepe Keever sent a letter to her friend in Nebraska describing her experience.  “I am undergoing a shock treatment here,” she wrote. “All those professional and personal ideals which had never been shattered until I reached here seem to be under constant bombardment. The things that happen in the country would be a bombshell to the American public.”  Friends and family read Deepe Keever’s newspaper reports about all the fighting in Vietnam from 8,600 miles away.  “Paul would call up Dad,” she said. “’Get that girl out of there.

"coup","1973-09-11","11:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:31:00","Top Chilean fiction house Parox, producer of “Invisible Heroes,” has kick-started principal photography on international co-production “Los mil días de Allende” (“Allende, the Thousand Days”), a historical drama mini-series about the last three years in the life of Chilean President Salvador Allende.  Alfredo Castro – one of Latin America’s most respected actors and a Pablo Larraín regular, star of films such as “Karnawal” and “El Club” – leads the mini-series cast as Allende; Benjamín Vicuña (“Besieged,” “Locked Up”) plays Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  The four-episode, 55-minute fiction drama shoot is taking place entirely in Chile, lensing from May 15 for two months, under “Besieged” and “Inés of My Soul” director Nicolás Acuña.  Leonora González and Sergio Gándara, Parox co-founders, are respectively the mini-series’ showrunner and producer.  A Chile-Spain-Argentina co-production, “Allende, the Thousand Days” teams Spain’s Mediterráneo Media Entertainment and Argentine companies Aleph, Mente Colectiva and HD Argentina.  Chilean public broadcaster TVN, Spanish nationwide group RTVE and Argentina’s Canal 9 are also backing the project.  “The Spanish part brings to the table talent and financing; Argentina puts talent, services and financing,” Gándara explained.  Written by Carla Stagno (“Sayen”), Cristián Jiménez (“Bonsai,” “Family Life”), Paco Mateo (“Inés of My Soul”) and Pablo Manzi, “Allende, the Thousand Days” tells the story of the last three years of the Chilean president and the experience in government of his Unidad Popular party, narrated by Manuel Ruiz, a 25-year-old Spaniard who becomes a close adviser to the president.  A fictional character, Ruiz is inspired by Spanish lawyer and political scientist Joan Garcés and played by Barcelona-born thesp Pablo Capuz (“Merlí. Sapere Aude”).  Allende died during the Sept. 11, 1973 coup d’etat of General Augusto Pinochet, whose troops shelled the Chilean government headquarters, in La Moneda Palace.  In the series, Ruiz accompanies Allende in La Moneda. He’s ready for anything, but minutes before the bombing, Allende tells him that he has to survive to tell the world what he saw in Chile.  “Allende is mainly known for his political decision to commit suicide in La Moneda while the government palace was bombed by the armed forces that had to protect the Chilean constitution,” showrunner Leonora González argued, calling his death a “tragic and symbolic act meaning that his name is in squares, streets, schools, hospitals in many countries around the world.”  “We want to go further to show the president in his complexity, in his feats, difficulties and contradictions, so that the audience can travel with Allende and the characters who accompany him, get emotional and suffer with them,” she noted.  The references for “Allende, the Thousand Days’” production come from series such as “Borgen” and “The West Wing” and movies such as “Darkest Hour” and “Argentina, 1985.”  “Despite the tragic final act of Allende’s death, we also want to show the light, joy, and hope that lay behind the project led by him,” González said.  She added: “Finally, [we want] to tell the story of a politician who, in a Cold War context, thought it was possible to make a unique social and economic transformation project a reality, without aligning himself with one of the two great powers: a left wing project, democratic, peaceful and with political and press freedoms.”  On the 50th anniversary of the coup d’etat, “the mini-series aims to be a programming event, which will be broadcast on the same dates by TVN, RTVE and Canal 9, during September 2023,” Gándara said.  “We are evaluating several alternative sales agents and platforms that would launch the series after its free-to-air release,” he added.  Launched in 2001 by Gándara and Gónzález, Parox has become one of Chile’s foremost TV companies, having produced fiction series such as TVN’s sci-fi thriller “Gen Mishima” and “Invisible Heroes,” a thriller-drama set during the 1973 military coup, co-produced with Finnish public broadcaster YLE and broadcast by Chilevisión.  Further Parox standout productions take in TVN’s “El reemplazante” and “Los archivos del Cardenal,” plus local adaptations of both HBO’s “In Treatment” for 3TV and Juan José Campanella Argentine comedy “El hombre de tu vida” for Canal 13.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9nbG9iYWwvcGFyb3gtYWxsZW5kZS1ydHZlLWFsZnJlZG8tY2FzdHJvLTEyMzU2MTYyNjkv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL3R2L2dsb2JhbC9wYXJveC1hbGxlbmRlLXJ0dmUtYWxmcmVkby1jYXN0cm8tMTIzNTYxNjI2OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Keir Starmer with Andy Burnham in parliament last year.  Andy Burnham has accused Keir Starmer’s advisers of briefing against him instead of “pulling together for a Labour majority government”.  In a furious attack, the mayor of Greater Manchester blamed “unelected people in their 20s or 30s who think they know it all”.  He said he was the victim of anonymous attacks every time he tried to highlight the work he is doing in Manchester.  He told Times Radio: “Whenever I go out there with something positive, the negative Westminster briefing machine somehow flicks into gear.  “All that I’d say is leave me alone.”  Burnham, who served in government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when he was a Labour MP, added: “I honestly don’t know what purpose they think it serves. It would be nice to have some support from a national level.”  Burnham is a divisive figure among his former parliamentary colleagues after he refused to join the coup attempt against Jeremy Corbyn's leadership in 2016.  He has also angered many Labour MPs by repeatedly criticising Westminster, despite being a former special adviser, an MP for 17 years and a cabinet minister in three different departments.  Burnham insisted he did not blame Starmer or members of the shadow cabinet personally for the negative briefings.  He said: “I know who they are and you know who they are, the kind of people who, you know, the unelected people in their 20s or 30s who think they know it all and they’re the kind of bee’s knees. And they go around sort of briefing against elected politicians.”  Drawing parallels with the last time Labour came to power in 1997, Burnham said: “These anonymous briefers need to sort of go back to [1997] and learn from that, and make sure that as we kind of build from here we’ve got all sides of the party involved, respected and pulling together for a Labour majority government.”  Related...","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW5keS1idXJuaGFtLWxhdW5jaGVzLWZ1cmlvdXMtYXR0YWNrLTExMTM1ODU2MS5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2FuZHktYnVybmhhbS1sYXVuY2hlcy1mdXJpb3VzLWF0dGFjay0xMTEzNTg1NjEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is a completely different proposition to see that machine spring to life. When everything is clicking on a baseball team, it is a beautiful thing to behold.  The Texas Rangers made some marquee acquisitions in the off season, placing their focus squarely on the bullpen, signing Jacob deGrom, Andrew Heaney, Nathan Eovaldi, Jake Odorizzi, and re-signing Martin Pérez on a qualifying offer.  When the dust settled on free agency, the frisson in the air around Arlington was around the coup of getting former Cy Young winner deGrom. Eovaldi felt like a nice addition, rounding out the rotation, but nobody was expecting more than solid, workmanlike pitching from the former Red Sox starter.  How wrong we were.  Nathan Eovaldi has turned out to be a revelation for Texas. And in Fenway, while Xander Bogaerts’ exit was the focus of much chagrin, it may turn out to be Eovaldi as “the one that got away.”  Nathan Eovaldi has thrown 28.2 straight scoreless innings, including a near complete game with a career-high 12 strikeouts tonight pic.twitter.com/duJal4mm0w — Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) May 12, 2023  While his season got off to a slow start, the last month has seen Eovaldi come to life, the gears of the machine grinding into an awe-inspiring symphony of sparks, magic, and sometimes even flames. He is currently on a run of throwing 28.2 consecutive scoreless innings, which includes three straight scoreless outings throwing eight or more innings.  Along that run, Eovaldi threw a complete game shutout against the Yankees on April 29, and he came within one out of doing the same to Oakland. In that game, the Texan notched up a career-high 12 strikeouts over 8.2 innings.  But it isn’t just the lack of scoring that is eyebrow-raising, but the manner in which they have been achieved. In eight starts this season, Eovaldi has struck out 56 batters while only walking eight. Over the last three starts he has walked just three, which puts him into an elite, albeit esoteric, club of only six players in the modern era to throw over 25 scoreless innings, while chalking up 25-plus strikeouts and allowing 3 or fewer walks over a 3-start span. Yes, that is a stat just chock-full of qualifications, but the names are what should grab your eye.

Fans in Arlington are warming to the idea that the real coup of the off season may have been Eovaldi, while fans in Fenway are perhaps slapping their foreheads in frustration.  Having spent more than half of last season on the injured list in Boston, there is an undercurrent of concern in Bruce Bochy’s clubhouse. Eovaldi needs to be ring fenced, perhaps even protected, especially now that deGrom is out until June and on Tommy John watch.  Due to start on Wednesday against the Atlanta Braves, Nathan Eovaldi may extend that scoreless streak even further. But even if he doesn’t, he is already proving to be the key to the Texas Rangers three game lead in the AL West. As the Astros keep grinding out wins and the fortunes of the Angels fluctuate, one thing is certain in Texas: Nate Eovaldi is a keeper.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL21sYi9uYXRoYW4tZW92YWxkaS1yZWQtaG90LWFzLXRleGFzLXJhbmdlcnMtc3RyZXRjaC10aGVpci1sZWFkLWluLXRoZS1hbC13ZXN0LW4vP29tbmlsPXJlc3JlbHJlY29tdtIBcWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL21sYi9uYXRoYW4tZW92YWxkaS1yZWQtaG90LWFzLXRleGFzLXJhbmdlcnMtc3RyZXRjaC10aGVpci1sZWFkLWluLXRoZS1hbC13ZXN0LW4vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is flown and maintained by the RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and will now be gracing the skies above Ryde.

"coup","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Montevideo"", ""Montevideo"", ""Uruguay""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:22:42","A Marcelo Bielsa press conference is invariably fertile ground for fans of deadpan, slightly surreal quips. On Wednesday, the man known as ‘El Loco’ did not disappoint, enchanting listeners as he was introduced as the new coach of the Uruguay national team.  More than 300 journalists were present in Montevideo to hear what Bielsa had to say about his first job since leaving Leeds United a year ago. He had a sobering message to deliver. “I think the expectations here are out of proportion,” he warned, while at the same time noting that Uruguay “can fantasise [about winning the World Cup] and have enough about them to feed that fantasy.” He also expounded upon his deep admiration for Uruguay, pointing to the time he arrived in the nation's capital to spend a romantic weekend away with his wife and ended up staying two months. A positive start, then, and if he can keep it up both on and off the pitch there is no reason why Bielsa cannot join the great José ‘Pepe’ Mujica as Uruguay's most beloved eccentric, somewhat grouchy old men.  The appointment of the Rosario native is clearly a coup for the Celeste, who are looking to overhaul a team long on talent but which has let itself down through timid play across the last decade under Óscar Tábarez and Diego Alonso. The World Cup in Qatar demonstrated the Uruguay with eloquence: equipped with the players to unveil an expansive, intense attacking game the nation instead retreated back into its spiky shell, relying on the myth of the hard-tackling Garra Charrúa and crashing out with a whimper in the first round.  Bielsa at least has the knowledge and personality to drag Uruguay into this century, though it remains to be seen how he takes to international coaching a full 13 years after bringing an end to his extremely fruitful partnership with Chile. On a wider note, his appointment continues a startling domination of CONMEBOL benches on the part of the reigning World Cup champions. No fewer than seven of the confederation's 10 members boast an Argentine as head coach, a number that could be even higher had Gustavo Alfaro and Ricardo Gareca not walked out on Ecuador and Peru respectively towards the end of 2022. And there is still one job open: could Brazil take the plunge on a neighbour and make it a crazy eight?  A foot in both camps  Indeed, ignoring Argentine dominance of the world game just keeps getting harder. Saturday sees Javier Mascherano begin his do-over at the Under-20 helm as they kick off the World Cup in Santiago del Estero against mysterious Uzbekistan, the start of three weeks of elite youth football across the nation.  Only slightly older, Lautaro Martínez and Julián Álvarez are also flying the flag. Both World Cup winners found the net midweek to send Inter and Manchester City through to the Champions League final, to be played next month in Istanbul. And because absolutely everything here is black and white, debate has begun in earnest over which brilliant young striker is more brilliant than the other. Julián has proved a sparkling addition to City's already shining all-star team, adapting with ease to the English and European game; while so important has Lautaro been to Inter's fortunes that it is hard to see them anywhere near this showpiece game without his all-round talents and (notoriously absent in Qatar but now back with a vengeance) knack for finding the net.  In summary, this column holds both aces in the highest esteem and, rear end planted firmly on the fence, hopes they can both impress in Istanbul – while the real winner is none other than Lionel Scaloni and his embarrassment of riches at centre-forward.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYmF0aW1lcy5jb20uYXIvbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvYmllbHNhLWFwcG9pbnRtZW50LWlzLWEtY291cC1mb3ItdGhlLXVydWd1YXktY2FuLWhlLWRyYWctdGhlbS1pbnRvLXRoaXMtY2VudHVyeS5waHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vYmF0aW1lcy5jb20uYXIvbmV3cy9hbXAvc3BvcnRzL2JpZWxzYS1hcHBvaW50bWVudC1pcy1hLWNvdXAtZm9yLXRoZS11cnVndWF5LWNhbi1oZS1kcmFnLXRoZW0taW50by10aGlzLWNlbnR1cnkucGh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight War engulfed the African nation April 14 and shows little sign of abating after more than 1 million people fled their homes. Both the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have repeatedly pledged to respect cease-fires and humanitarian law, only to break those promises within minutes. Each side blames the other for sparking and continuing hostilities.  Many Sudanese resist calling the conflict a civil war, pointing out that neither side enjoys wide public support. Instead, they describe it as a naked power struggle between the two men who jointly directed a 2021 coup against a civilian-military government. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan is the head of the military and the de facto head of state, and Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo — known as Hemedti — commands the powerful RSF.  In the country’s capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere, the RSF has taken up positions inside civilian homes, hospitals and even churches. Residents blame the RSF for widespread looting, several rapes and forced evictions into streets under crossfire. Social media is alight with images of military airstrikes pummeling the capital and accounts of families pulverized by heavy weapons.  Advertisement  As bombs rained down on hospitals and aid workers fled, civilians revived the neighborhood resistance committees that helped force a dictator from power in 2019 and ensured that the civilians had a place in the government. The committees document attacks, set up rudimentary clinics and try to pool resources such as water and safe housing for those fleeing the fighting. Now those activists are being targeted, some residents said.  Three days ago, the military arrested three activists from the resistance committee in Bahri, the town just north of Khartoum, said Mustafa Makki, who worked alongside them. All three are young: Saddam Juma is 29, while Amer Abboud and Mujahid Anwar are both 27, he said.  The reason for their arrests is unclear, but all were taken from their homes May 14 by uniformed military forces in marked vehicles, he said. They are being held in the Kadro area, north of Bahri, now the site of a major firefight, Makki said.  Advertisement  “We don’t know why they were arrested,” he said. “We don’t support either side, not the military or the RSF.” A second member of the committee confirmed his account.  It was the second time that activists from the Bahri committee have been targeted. Last week, the military arrested two other activists from Bahri and held them for 48 hours. The military’s spokesman was unreachable for comment.  The neighborhood is largely under the control of the RSF, but fierce battles have raged there every day. Its industrial area houses a munitions factory and is the target of frequent battles and airstrikes.  Doctors at Bahri’s Globe Hospital and Hag al-Safi Hospital have also been repeatedly taken against their will and forced to treat RSF fighters, Makki said. Only about 16 percent of the capital’s hospitals are still functioning; many have lost power or water, run out of supplies or been hit by shelling.  Advertisement  “The RSF come, and the doctors say: ‘We have wounded civilians here. Let us treat them first,’” Makki said. “But the RSF said no, we must be first.”  A member of the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she and the other doctors on the committee have received death threats. Many fled, and others stopped going to work, changed their numbers and went into hiding, she said. At least 11 doctors have been killed; one was stabbed, and others were killed in crossfire or when their homes were hit.  She said the threats appeared to come from people connected to former president Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was forced out of office in 2019 following massive street protests. The doctor told The Washington Post, “The purpose of this threat is to end all the tools of the revolution, including resistance committees and trade unions, so that they do not continue their civil struggle.”  Advertisement  On Wednesday, the U.N. humanitarian office in Geneva said 25 million people, more than half of Sudan’s population, need help. That is 10 million more than before the fighting started and the highest number ever recorded for the country. The office called for $2.6 billion in aid from the international community.  The rival sides are holding talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, with little apparent progress. They have issued statements saying they will protect civilians and allow aid to move, but no details have been given, and the fighting has continued unabated.  On Monday, the Professional Pharmacists Association of Sudan accused the RSF of hijacking a convoy of medical supplies headed to regional hospitals, which have also been hit hard by the fighting.  The group’s statement called the theft of supplies “a death sentence for the residents of the regions,” noting that 95 percent of all pharmaceutical production takes place in the capital. About 830,000 people fleeing the fighting have gone to other towns within Sudan and about 220,000 to neighboring countries, the United Nations said Wednesday.  Community leaders have also been targeted in the city of Geneina in the western region of Darfur, said an activist there, who listed their names in a message: Mahamed Badwi, an engineer, activist and writer; Motaz Abujalli, a journalist and human rights activist; and Adam Taiar, an activist and member of the medical committee. All were killed April 24, he said, by militias aligned with the RSF that went to their homes. The activist spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.  Advertisement  The activist said the militias — referred to locally as the Janjaweed, or “devils on horseback” — were carrying out ethnic killings and have also looted and burned the palace of the sultan of the Masalit tribe. The Janjaweed are ethnically Arab militias; the Masalit are a local African tribe that fought the central government and the Janjaweed for nearly 20 years until a peace deal three years ago.  “Janjaweed militia and RSF are using [gunmen] to shoot people who have influence like leaders, intellectuals and professionals,” the activist wrote, saying it was too dangerous to go home. The phone network was too weak to support calls, so he texted quick answers to questions. “No way to get out of the town … two days I haven’t met my family … even my young brother injured today … most of my friends were killed … I have no doubt I will be killed by them.”  The death toll in the town as of this past Friday was 556, he said, citing a list kept by clinics. On Tuesday, seven members of one family were killed when the RSF fired heavy weapons into a civilian area.  Lt. Gen. Khamis Abdullah Abkar, the governor of West Darfur, confirmed that more than 500 people have been killed in Geneina since the fighting erupted and that militia members were going house to house in some areas looking for individuals. The hospital was not functioning, and hundreds of wounded people needed urgent medical care, but there was no way to take them to help, he said.

Alemany has made a big U-turn on his future and has decided to stay at the club, according to ESPN. The Catalan giants had announced his departure earlier this month, with Alemany expected to move to Aston Villa, but the club's transfer guru has now changed his mind after visiting Birmingham, according to Gerard Romero. Alemany has since held further talks with Barcelona and decided to remain at Camp Nou and continue in his current role.  THE BIGGER PICTURE: The news will be a boost for Barcelona, particularly as the club have also announced Jordi Cruyff will depart in the summer. Alemany has overseen the club's transfer business since joining the club in 2021 and will be needed ahead of what promises to be a complicated summer. The Catalans hope to bring Lionel Messi back to the club from PSG but also need to register new contracts for key players such as Ronald Araujo and Gavi. Barca also need to cut costs to comply with Financial Fair Play but have seen an initial feasibility plan rejected by La Liga ahead of the opening of the transfer window.  AND WHAT'S MORE: Alemany's decision will also be a setback for Villa who looked to have pulled off something of a coup by landing the Barca chief.

"coup","2024-07-15","16:00:00","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Thu 18 May 2023 01:31:51","Planet A  Australia’s 2023–24 budget allocates $4 billion to combat the impacts of climate change and turn Australia into a ‘renewable energy superpower’. The commitments include $2 billion in incentives to accelerate the manufacture and export of renewable hydrogen gas and $80.5 million in program support to attract and monitor foreign investment in Australia’s diversifying critical minerals sector. These measures highlight the importance of striking the right balance between industry growth and international engagement.  The budget has been criticised for its lack of further funding for climate support in the Pacific. The Australian Defence Force will share in a $1.4 billion package to bolster cooperation with Pacific island countries on security infrastructure, maritime security, law enforcement and criminal justice. Only modest amounts will be spent on improving regional architecture and humanitarian relief and disaster preparedness. This suggests that there’s more work to be done as Australia looks to increase its international energy competitiveness and address the threats posed by climate change and other emerging security issues.  Democracy watch  Thailand’s election produced a strong expression of voter discontent reflecting a widespread yearning for change and raising questions about the willingness of the military-backed establishment to embrace the sentiment. The election outcome was a political earthquake as prodemocracy parties triumphed over their military-backed counterparts, with the progressive Move Forward party leading the pack. The party campaigned on the once-taboo topic of monarchy reform, a bold move in a country with a strict lèse-majesté law.  Given the military’s substantial influence and historical involvement in political affairs, including coups, any interference carries the risk of street violence and instability. The election outcome was a blow to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former coup leader whose popularity has declined.  Despite Move Forward’s clear majority, the presence of military-appointed senators in the electoral process could hinder the formation of a coalition government. The opposition is confronted with multiple challenges, including the undemocratic framing of the constitution, the need to form a democratic coalition, and the looming possibility of legal action to invalidate the election results.  Information operations  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a 14-second clip during a rally to accuse his rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, of colluding with Kurdish militants. The video purportedly showed Kilicdaroglu rallying his supporters alongside apparent members of the banned PKK. However, it was later revealed that the video was a skilfully edited montage, part of the disinformation campaign that has plagued this crucial election. In response, Kilicdaroglu, running closely with Erdogan, claimed that foreign hackers recruited by Erdogan’s team were preparing deepfakes and manipulated videos to discredit adversaries before the election.  This election has witnessed the weaponisation of misinformation propagated on social media platforms and counterfeit campaign materials. While the country has enacted legislation criminalising the dissemination of fake news, the government hasn’t enforced it during the electoral process. The disinformation campaign has intensified polarisation but it is considered unlikely to significantly sway the outcome. The extent of international involvement in spreading disinformation remains uncertain, with local political factions primarily responsible.  Follow the money  China and Pakistan have agreed to extend the Belt and Road initiative to Afghanistan. The decision to include Afghanistan in the multibillion-dollar project and to extend the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor to it, was included in broader commitments to expand trilateral contribution to boost Afghanistan’s reconstruction.  The BRI’s extension is a win for the Taliban, who have expressed their wish to be included, as they struggle to govern a cash-strapped nation and meet its infrastructure needs. Afghanistan’s central bank’s reserves of US$9 billion have been frozen since 2021. Meanwhile, the UN has estimated that US$4.6 billion is needed to alleviate the dire humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the nation.  As other countries continue to debate whether to engage with the Taliban, China is swiftly moving to fill a gap left by nations once heavily involved in Afghanistan’s reconstruction. Earlier this year, the Taliban signed an oil-extraction contract with a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation, and other Chinese firms have expressed an interest in investing in the country’s mineral resources, worth an estimated US$1 trillion.  Terror byte  France’s parliament has unanimously passed a non-binding resolution intended to encourage the European Union to register Russia’s Wagner Group on its list of terrorist organisations. In a speech to parliament last week supporting the resolution, MP Benjamin Haddad argued that Wagner wasn’t driven by financial motivations and instead followed ‘a broad strategy, from Mali to Ukraine, of supporting the aggressive policies of President [Vladimir] Putin’s regime’.  The EU’s terrorist list, which is approved by leaders of member countries at regular meetings, comprises 13 people and 21 groups or entities including al-Qaeda and Islamic State. The addition of Wagner Group to the list would allow EU countries to freeze its assets and those of its members. European countries and their citizens would be barred from dealing with the group. Aside from France, the parliaments of Lithuania and Estonia have similarly labelled Wagner a terrorist organisation, and the British government is reportedly planning to follow suit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGlzdHJhdGVnaXN0Lm9yZy5hdS90aGUtdGhyZWF0LXNwZWN0cnVtLTQ4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2021-02-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 15:15:00","By Simon Lewis  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion in arms and other material since it staged a coup in February 2021, a UN expert said on Wednesday in a new report that calls out Russia and China for aiding the junta's deadly campaign to crush its opposition.  Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.  Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.  In a single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11, two bombs dropped from a Yak-130 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.  Myanmar’s military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists.""  “The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate,” Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to “step up and stop the flow of arms” with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmar’s military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.  The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmar’s domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.  State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.  Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscow’s state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.  Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.  “Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar,” the report said.  The UN missions of the five countries mentioned in the report as sources of arms and material did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  At a news conference in New York, Andrews said Chinese officials had earlier criticized his reporting, saying he was vilifying legitimate trade in arms and operating outside his mandate by conducting analysis. Russian officials had expressed a similar response, Andrews said.

Not just last week but over the past 20 years, how is it that we have been destroying and killing without changing the power relations between the sides?  They also needed to ask: How is it that the citizens of a modern country have to go down into shelters once a year in submission, in resignation, without complaint, as if it is self-evident that life is a long war with cease-fires in between? How were we sold on the idea that there is “no solution”? How does the world’s most moral army always succeed in killing women and children? It’s not just that these trivial questions aren’t answered, they’re never asked.  In the face of this silence, the protest movement arose. The “judicial coup” was the straw that broke the camel’s back. It alone was not the straw, nor was it the war in Gaza, nor the millions to the Haredi parasites, nor the rising prices, but the convergence of all these and the lies they brought along.  The lies are the bad cholesterol that accumulates on the walls of the blood vessels, they are the fat cells that clog the arteries. The Haredi, ultranationalist and criminal cells – all of them are related, the occupation to the corruption and the corruption to the extreme nationalism. Eliminate one and others develop. The lying cells never die, they just keep multiplying.  When the lies keep accumulating, the arteries become blocked, perspiration increases and breath becomes short. These are lies that were told to us and that we told ourselves. The lie that “we can manage the conflict,” the lie that “the Haredim will be integrated,” the lie that “the people should choose their judges,” the lie of a “united Jerusalem” and the lie that “if we talk we’ll reach an agreement.” We won’t. Agreements can only be reached with solidarity. But our solidarity has disintegrated into loathing and disgust, each of us with our brand of disgust – with the occupation, with the Haredim, with the Ashkenazim/Mizrahim. Only the feeling that everything stinks is what unites us – along with the idea that what was will never be again.  Even if there was once a strong sense of solidarity here, it will never return. Without it, there will be no equality – not in the army, not in the economy and not in education. There is no “partial justice” and no “judicial balance.” The divisive genie that wiped out solidarity cannot be put back in the bottle. The greedy, lying leader who took him out cannot be returned to Caesarea. The division of Israel into sectors and tribes is a fact. The property tax fund suits the kind of society that no longer exists here.  A divided society had to find a way to live together with the recognition that it is made up of differing components. We can’t live apart, but we can learn to live side by side. The government must provide basic services to all, nothing more. The secular will no longer fund the ultra-Orthodox, the left will no longer defend the settlers. The Haredim won’t “kosher” electricity? Then they can pay for it. Rockets fall on Sderot? That’s their problem. Rockets fall on Tel Aviv? That’s our problem. The mayor of Sderot longs for the days of Operation Protective Edge? Let him find the 74 young people who paid with their lives in defense of his city.  The protests emerged because the sense of revulsion had reached its limit. We are fed up with the situation, with the corrupt government, with an opposition that is out of touch. We are likewise tired of the self-righteous protest movement that takes upon itself, instead of the government, the responsibility for the safety of the demonstrators. We are tired of a movement that in its effort to ensure diversity and inclusion does not know what they want, or does know but is afraid to admit it – that it wants to get Bibi out of our lives.

Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.

Youssef Chelbi and Dhia Nsir had posted a clip on Tik Tok and Facebook this week showing them laughing and singing a sarcastic song criticizing the police's treatment of detainees and a drugs law.  Lawyer Imen Souissi said they are facing charges of insulting others through social networks and they could face up to a year in prison if the court finds them guilty. Police and the interior ministry were not immediately available for comment.  The arrest of the two men drew concern from activists and bloggers, who republished the song to show solidarity with them. Activists said that freedoms has become besieged and that Tunisia has become a large prison.  Freedom of speech and media was a key gain for Tunisians after the 2011 revolution that ended the rule of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered the Arab Spring protests.  Saied, who shut down parliament in 2021, and seized all powers, pledged to protect rights and freedoms and said he would not be a dictator.  But his opponents, who described his moves as a coup, said that he had established one-man rule, imprisoned his opponents, and suppressed critical voices.  On Tuesday, an appeals court sentenced a radio journalist to five years in prison for disclosing information about the security services.  The main journalists union criticized the ruling and said that it is the most severe sentence against a journalist in Tunisia history and did not happen even during the most dictatorial periods in Tunisia. The verdict was a message to silence journalists, it said.  This year, police have arrested several prominent opposition leaders on charges of plotting against state security, a move the opposition described as consolidating a dictatorial regime.  Saeid rejected the criticism, saying that they are criminals and terrorists. A judge on Monday sentenced opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison on charges of incitement.

"coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:56:31","The outbreak of war in Sudan illustrates the perilous trajectories facing “hybrid” regimes around the world. Just a few years ago, Sudan was considered a hybrid regime — a country that holds elections yet has strong autocratic characteristics. As recently as 2018, both Sudan and Zambia were hybrid regimes (although Sudan was certainly more authoritarian than Zambia), but the two countries took very different paths. In Sudan, under former President Omar al-Bashir, elections were not a legitimate avenue for the expression of the will of the people, and change only came through revolution. Even then, hopes for reform were dashed though a subsequent military coup, a troubled transition, and now the outbreak of war. In Zambia, by contrast, elections in 2021 provided an avenue for reform and democratic consolidation. Sudan, now a closed autocracy, holds little prospect for democratic reform. Zambia, now considered as having the potential to be a bright spot in democratic advancement, illustrates the hope that reform is possible in mixed democratic-autocratic systems.  Hybrid regimes, also known as “electoral autocracies,” are governments that endeavor to be seen as democracies but lack the fundamentals to warrant such a label. They hold elections but the playing field is rarely level, as ruling parties utilize a diversified portfolio of election manipulation tactics to secure power, including corrupted voter registration systems, intentional logistical delays, targeted violence, strategic results tampering, and compromised electoral management bodies.  Hybrid regimes pose a thorny policy challenge to the United States. In 2022, almost one-half of countries globally (72 in total) met the definition of “hybrid” or “electoral autocracy” and were present in every geographic region. Examples include Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Mexico, El Salvador, Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.  Unfortunately, since these governments hold elections and display other trappings of democracy, some policymakers give them a pass on their democratic track record -– especially if the country is relevant to other American interests.  This is short-sighted and counterproductive, even –- and especially — for U.S. national security. Consider the case of Egypt: despite receiving billions in U.S. security assistance, the Egyptian government has been offering to sell arms to Russia to aid the Kremlin’s illegal war in Ukraine, in direct conflict with American policies. It is also exceedingly difficult, if not dangerous, for U.S. companies to invest in or access the markets of hybrid regimes. The opaque and compromised nature of institutions common to these States often results in unclear or biased regulation. For example, while Nigeria has the fastest-growing population in Africa and a market ripe for U.S. exports, corruption and biased regulation make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate there.  Failing to address the democratic deficiencies of hybrid regimes sets up the United States for long-term strategic failure and hinders American economic prosperity. To avoid these outcomes, the United States must carve out a new path forward that preserves near-term U.S. interests while also pressing these States to make democratic progress. After all, there is hope for hybrid regimes. As a recent study notes, “In the face of the global wave of autocratization, data shows that no less than eight countries are bouncing back and making U-turns … Cases like these raise some hope for a future reversal of the last 20 years’ downward trend towards autocratization.”  Thwarting US Interests  Hybrid regimes are less likely to uphold the interests of the United States and its democratic allies on the world stage. Of the 72 hybrid regimes, only 20 voted to remove Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in April 2022 over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Of the countries who joined with the United States in a U.N. General Assembly committee to condemn China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang in October 2022, only four were hybrid regimes.  Hybrid regimes also are more prone to internal conflict and instability because they often lack legitimacy among politically marginalized groups (and sometimes large swaths of the population). They are ill-equipped to effectively handle security challenges –- often resorting to heavy-handed tactics that inflame violence –- and have weak institutions that are unable to challenge abuses of executive power.  The susceptibility of hybrid regimes to political violence and instability is perhaps most acute in sub-Saharan Africa. According to an analysis of 2022 data, hybrid regimes experienced almost three times as many conflict incidents and five times as many conflict fatalities compared to stronger democracies. Analysis of data for the past decade shows that hybrid regimes in sub-Saharan Africa are seven times as likely to experience a coup or attempted coup compared to democracies.  The Flawed Approach to Hybrid Regimes  As the United States increasingly engages in strategic competition with China and its authoritarian model, it must remember that it is free people and democratic societies who are its most valuable allies on the global stage. Premature acceptance of sub-standard elections and willful ignorance of democratic backsliding may provide short-term bilateral gains, but in the long term serves to further separate the people in these countries from the United States, eroding affinity between our peoples, and increasing risks of conflict and instability that weaken current and future allies.  It’s important to note the distinctions between hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes, which do not hold plausibly competitive elections (if they hold elections at all) for the chief executive and the legislature and where institutions have little-to-no ability to check the power of the executive. This distinction enables the international community to minimize the democratic failures of hybrid regimes.  An example is the tendency to judge elections in hybrid regimes as “good enough” unless the fraud and violence are egregiously obvious. In February, the U.S. State Department rushed to congratulate the declared winner of Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election, even though the election was widely criticized by observers for targeted violence, lack of transparency, significant voter disenfranchisement, and outright vote manipulation in some states.  The United States has applied this low bar in other recent elections. Angola’s August 2022 presidential election saw the half-century rule of the MPLA party extended by another five years, in an election where the ruling party controlled the media and courts, imposed worrying changes to the vote-tabulation process, and heavily obstructed efforts to observe the election. Despite these red flags, the U.S. Embassy quickly congratulated the declared winner and commended “the millions of Angolan voters who cast their ballots in this election, and in doing so demonstrated their commitment to strengthening democracy.” Following Tunisia’s December 2022 parliamentary elections, which some international observers labeled a “sham,” the State Department issued a vanilla statement, noting low turnout and the need for greater political inclusion, but failing to cite any other major issues that impeded the credibility of the process, such as barriers to political party participation and egregious restrictions on the press.  Such omissions have immediate and direct consequences for U.S. security and economic interests. For instance, in Nigeria, the widely disputed election results and the high levels of regional disenfranchisement of voters will likely compound regional and sectarian grievances, fueling increased conflict and destabilization, and diverting even more resources and attention of the United States and like-minded partners to combat instability. And in Angola, the extension of MPLA rule under questionable circumstances could lead to continued democratic backsliding and undermine prospects for economic reform, harming U.S. economic interests, including trade (already in significant decline), and could make the country more vulnerable to the malign influence of Russia and China.  Sadly, hybrid regimes most often result from democratic backsliding, rather than autocracies moving toward democratic reform. Of today’s 72 hybrid regimes, 20 were considered stronger democracies 20 years ago, while eight were considered closed autocracies.  Democratic backsliding is usually a gradual process. The international community’s muted response to closing space in hybrid regimes tends to facilitate continued backsliding. Over the past five years, there has been a worrying global increase in the number of authoritarian regimes. This suggests that early action to address the democratic deficiencies of hybrid regimes is critical to forestalling autocratic consolidation.  Failing to make the distinction between hybrid regimes and democracies, and failure to comprehend trajectories of democratic backsliding, undermines the intent of democratic initiatives like the Biden administration’s Summit for Democracy. At the most recent summit, countries that have been experiencing years of democratic backsliding and refuse to publicize their commitments to democracy (such as Nigeria and Philippines) are given equal standing with countries that are actively and transparently consolidating democracy. Of the 120 countries invited to participate in the 2023 Summit for Democracy, 25 were hybrid regimes. Only about half of these countries publicized their commitments from the summit. And of the stronger democracies invited, almost 40 are countries that experienced notable democratic backsliding over the past five years and are at increasing risk of becoming hybrid regimes this decade.  Democracies are not only more stable than hybrid regimes, but they also enjoy better economic growth, equality, and educational achievement. The failure to adequately differentiate hybrid regimes from stronger democracies fuels the counterproductive perception that “democracy fails to deliver,” when it is in fact the failure to achieve meaningful democracy that prevents so much of the world from enjoying its dividends.  Walking and Chewing Gum at the Same Time  The United States and allies must balance their cooperation with hybrid regimes, when it is necessary at all, with a push for those governments to reform and realize broader democratic progress. These aims are not contradictory, but complementary and central to advancing U.S. objectives. Achieving this balance will require prioritizing respect for democratic practices, institutions, and norms when determining how to engage hybrid regimes. Democracy will not always trump other factors, but it should be moved up the rank order of priorities.  There are practical steps the United States and like-minded allies can take -– using diplomacy and foreign assistance -– to advance near-term pressing issues while targeting democratic deficiencies that make hybrid regimes problematic for American interests.  For instance, the United States and G7 allies should make clear they will not welcome with open arms leaders chosen through dubious, sub-standard elections. From Washington to London, leaders should get serious about issuing public sanctions, including asset freezes and visa bans, for malfeasance during elections. On the flip side, the U.S. and allies should make better use of high-level diplomatic engagement, such as leveraging the legitimacy conferred by Cabinet-level visits, to incentivize governments to make changes and adhere to international democratic best practices.  These steps can be impactful while not undercutting cooperation on pressing matters. In Nigeria, for instance, the United States can engage the government to achieve priorities via the U.S. Ambassador and U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission (BNC), a forum established in 2010 to discuss a range of interests. The Secretary of State need not make plans to visit Abuja to meet newly elected President Bola Tinubu while key court decisions -– and a potential independent audit -– are pending on the results of the recent election.  The United States and G7 allies should pay more rigorous attention to elections in general. Rather than accepting elections as a continuation of the status quo, the West should view electoral processes as critical moments to correct or continue countries’ democratic trajectories, and apply commensurate attention, pressure, and incentives. One step in the right direction would be to more explicitly and publicly link future foreign aid funding used to support elections in such countries to recipient governments agreeing to abide by established electoral standards, including enforcement of election law, equitable access to voting, and transparency in reporting election results and election data. Failure to link foreign assistance to meaningful reforms results not only in sub-par elections and wasted U.S. taxpayer dollars, but also provides diplomatic cover for election malpractice and malfeasance.  Foreign aid has an important role to play in advancing U.S. interests in hybrid regimes by helping cultivate and reinforce democratic practices and norms outside a government in power. The United States is therefore smart to invest in civil society-led advocacy campaigns that hold leaders accountable and in efforts to strengthen political parties that can contest elections and offer an alternative to the status quo. Yet the United States can do more to couple such capacity building via foreign aid with creating the political will for reform. While building democratic capacity can incentivize and enable the will to reform, capacity should not be viewed as an end in itself; this is a convenient, but short-sighted and counterproductive, approach. Diplomacy and foreign assistance can help enable this political will through a combination of incentives, pressure, and advocacy campaigns, as well as identifying and equipping rising political stars unafraid to push for change.  Looking Forward  As the U.S. and allies navigate relations with hybrid regimes, they should approach evaluating a country’s democratic performance as science and not art. Objective third-party evaluations of democratic performance are widely available but largely ignored in U.S. policymaking. Robust and credible civil society organizations proliferate in many hybrid regimes; yet despite many of these organizations receiving assistance from the United States, their warnings about democratic backsliding are regularly disregarded. The United States should pair support to these organizations with listening to their perspectives -– to the extent they reflect the people’s perceptions and expectations of democracy -– and account for their views in the policymaking process.  U.S. officials must resist the convenient but inaccurate narrative that the hybrid regimes of the world are slowly but surely moving in the right direction. Evidence of backsliding in the past 10 years has shown that is far from certain. A narrative of wishful thinking only results in misleading analysis and poorly targeted foreign assistance and diplomacy, serving to reinforce one-party rule and compound public grievances around the world. Using rigorous metrics can help make progress in this area.  Major policy initiatives like the Summit for Democracy should require concrete commitments from all participants and demonstrable democratic progress against these commitments. These initiatives should include public accountability for democratic backsliding and for failure to achieve reform objectives. At minimum, governments on prior Summit invite lists who go on to enable backsliding should not be included moving forward.  Ideally, the United States should reward allies that make tangible democratic advances with tangible benefits. For example, the United States should consider re-initiating free-trade agreement discussions with Ecuador if President Guillermo Lasso’s government makes progress on anti-corruption and continues to consolidate democracy. Doing so would reward a key ally in the region and one of the remaining democratic bright spots with tangible changes that benefit the Ecuadorian people and U.S. interests. Similar carrots could be held out for progress in a range of other contexts as well. Participants should also commit to stand with democracy against autocracy on the world stage. Mitigating democratic backsliding and combatting authoritarianism requires the concerted efforts of a global community.  With major elections coming up in several hybrid regimes this year and next — including Turkey’s planned runoff election on May 28, as well as balloting in DRC, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Mexico, and El Salvador — the United States must think carefully about how it will assess and react to these elections, and whether perceived short-term bilateral gains will truly be worth the long-term costs.  Going forward, while it is important for the United States to shore up its alliances with the Philippines and other partners to thwart China’s malign influence and kinetic threat, U.S. leaders also must be acutely aware of the democratic backsliding that is occurring in these hybrid regimes and use American leverage to counter it. Without such clear accountability and seriousness in upholding of democratic values, the United States can expect to have “allies” and “partners” that are not only less free and stable, but also distinctly unreliable.

"coup","2017-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:56:00","              May 17 (Reuters) - The private sector will fund three quarters of Zimbabwe's wheat crop this year, playing a growing role in agriculture as the government opens the sector to boost food security, a commodity contractors' body said.  Graeme Murdoch, chairman of the Food Crop Contractors Association (FCCA), made up of commodity traders, offtakers and millers who have been funding the production of crops since 2020, told Reuters private traders would increase their activity.  ""The reality is that as the environment becomes more liberalised, and the government makes every effort to essentially crowd in the private sector, which they have done more and more both in terms of the financing and regulation, we see more and more involvement of the private sector in primary agriculture,"" he said in an interview.  About 76% of the planned 2023 wheat hectarage would be funded by the private sector, including the country's biggest bank CBZ Holdings (CBZ.ZI) and the state-owned AFC Commercial Bank, Murdoch said.  The balance will be funded directly by the government through its various input support schemes as well as some self-financing farmers.  Zimbabwe has frequently struggled to feed itself since 2000, when then-president Robert Mugabe championed the seizure of white-owned farms to resettle landless Blacks.  Food production plummeted due to the exodus of skilled farmers and a lack of funding for those newly resettled. The conversion of most farms into state land left the cash-strapped government struggling as the biggest funder of food crops.  President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe in a 2017 coup, has gradually opened the door for the private sector, including banks, to fund the production of staples such as maize, wheat and soyabeans.  The government has also ended the monopoly of the state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) as the sole purchaser of maize and wheat.  After a record-breaking harvest of 375,131 tonnes of wheat in 2022, the government is targeting 408,000 tonnes this year.  Private firms under the FCCA spent $62.7 million to fund the production of 209,138 tonnes of maize, about 9% of this year's total maize harvest of 2.3 million tonnes, according to government data. Zimbabwe's 2023 maize harvest is a 58% increase on the previous season's haul.

A “treasonous charade,” former President Donald Trump declared. “Who should go to jail?” demanded Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.  A report by special counsel John Durham on the origins of the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s work with Russia recommended no further prosecutions, produced no startling revelations and declined to suggest any “wholesale changes” to FBI rules for politically sensitive investigations.  ADVERTISING  Durham’s prosecutorial powers led to two minor criminal cases, both of which ended in acquittal. A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty to altering an email to help prepare a wiretap application.  Yet the former president and his allies in the conservative media bubble and in Congress found in Durham’s 306-page report what they needed. In their view, the contents amplify a long-held position that the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, known as Crossfire Hurricane — and the Trump campaign’s active or passive abetting of it — was a political vendetta concocted by Hillary Rodham Clinton and her willing accomplices in federal law enforcement.  No court cases or indictments will advance such claims. But the Republican interpretation of the final Durham report will feed a narrative of “deep state” corruption that is fueling not only Trump’s quest for the White House in 2024 but also that of many of his rivals for the Republican nomination. The vilification of federal bureaucracy was already an emerging theme in the fight to be the Republican standard-bearer. Regardless of Durham’s actual conclusions, his report appears to serve that theme.  Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Trump’s closest competitor in the still-early Republican primary race, promised Monday “to clean house” at “weaponized federal agencies,” which he said had “manufactured a false conspiracy theory.”  “Heads need to roll,” said another competitor, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.  Trump had termed the Russia investigation “the crime of the century,” and with no one doing time for that crime, the Durham report could still prove to be Exhibit A in how the American right seems to be living in its own universe — and how Trump still dictates the parameters of that separate reality.  On his Truth Social website, Trump said the special prosecutor had concluded that “the FBI should never have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!”  In fact, Durham said he agreed that the FBI should have opened a preliminary investigation.  “I, and much more importantly, the American public have been victims of this long-running and treasonous charade started by the Democrats — started by Comey,” Trump told Fox News Digital. “There must be a heavy price to pay for putting our country through this.”  Repeated fundraising emails from Trump were headlined “I WAS FRAMED.”  The conservative website The Federalist picked up the cudgel, attacking The New York Times’ initial coverage of contacts between Russian intelligence officials and associates of Trump, reporting that earned the Times a Pulitzer Prize.  And on Twitter, Trump’s most reliable allies in Congress framed the final report as explosive and groundbreaking, the opposite conclusion of mainstream media outlets. Durham may have pursued no major prosecutions, but Republicans demanded them.  “Democrats attempted a coup against President Trump with their ‘Russia Russia Russia’ hoax,” wrote Greene.  Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., urged her supporters to “get active” and “fight to make things better.”  “Let this be your wake-up call: they’re trying to take our country away from us,” she wrote on Twitter.  Others who piled on included Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chair; commentator Ben Shapiro; and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. Conservative media outlets such as The New York Post and Breitbart weighed in, implicating Clinton, President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and a vast cast of Democrats in what Breitbart called the “collusion hoax.”  “Shut down the FBI,” said entrepreneur and Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who has made castigation of the “administrative state” central to his campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaXRyaWJ1bmUtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L29waW5pb24vdGhlLWR1cmhhbS1yZXBvcnQtb2ZmZXJlZC1mZXctY29uY2x1c2lvbnMtdGhlLXJpZ2h0LWRyZXctaXRzLW93bi_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXdhaWl0cmlidW5lLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9vcGluaW9uL3RoZS1kdXJoYW0tcmVwb3J0LW9mZmVyZWQtZmV3LWNvbmNsdXNpb25zLXRoZS1yaWdodC1kcmV3LWl0cy1vd24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2019-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:57:20","Authorities in Thailand have charged a 16-year-old girl with defaming the monarchy for messages she allegedly posted on Facebook two years ago  BANGKOK -- Authorities in Thailand have charged a 16-year-old girl with defaming the monarchy for two messages she allegedly posted on Facebook two years ago, adding to an increasingly active debate over whether the law allowing her arrest should be reformed.  Police charged the girl in the northern province of Phitsanulok on Monday with violating the lese majeste law and the Computer Crime Act, according to a statement from Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group. It said on Wednesday that police originally summoned her in 2021 when she was 14 years old, which appears to make her the youngest person in Thailand to face the charge.  The lese majeste law, also known as Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code, makes insulting the monarch, his immediate family and the regent punishable by three to 15 years in prison.  It has long been controversial, especially because anyone, not just the royal family, can file a complaint with police. Critics say the law is often used as a tool to quash political dissent, and point to the many arrests of pro-democracy protesters by the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.  The subject became an issue in Sunday's general election, in which the two top opposition vote-getting parties had acknowledged the need to consider changes to the law. Conservative-leaning parties, which have ruled Thailand since a 2014 coup, are in favor of maintaining it.  The top-ranked Move Forward Party, which has been more forthright in calling for reforms, has proposed an amendment to reduce the punishment. Its stand is seen by conservatives as radical, and may jeopardize its chances of forming a government when Parliament meets in July to select a new prime minister.  Devotion to the monarchy has long been a pillar of Thai society, and until recent years, the institution was considered untouchable. But sharp political schisms that began appearing two decades ago affected its reputation, particularly among young people seeking change.  The girl charged Monday denied all charges and was granted bail by the provincial juvenile court, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. It said the police initially decided not to press charges against her, but were later instructed to do so by the local prosecutors. The Associated Press is not naming her because she's a minor.  At least 244 people have been charged with lese majeste in 264 cases since November 2020, when Prayuth’s government was facing street protests by student-led groups seeking greater democracy, including reforms of the monarchy.  At least 19 minors have been accused of the offense in that period, including four who were younger than 15 years, the lawyers group said.  In March, a 15-year-old girl was arrested in Bangkok and charged with lese majeste. She was detained by police as she was observing the arrest of an artist who spray-painted a message on the wall of Bangkok’s Grand Palace.  She was charged with lese majeste for participating in a political rally last year calling for an abolishment of the law when she was 14 years old, and has since been detained at a juvenile detention center in Nakhon Pathom province, west of Bangkok.  The arrest and prolonged detention of the girl drew widespread criticism from human rights groups both domestic and international. Human Rights Watch last month called for authorities to immediately drop charges and release her.  “By arresting a 15-year-old girl, the Thai government is sending the spine-chilling message that even children aren’t safe from being harshly punished for expressing their opinions,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.  The Central Juvenile and Family Court in Bangkok released a statement last week saying her arrest and detention was lawful.  The girl remains locked up despite concerns that she would be forced to drop out from her school, which started a new semester on Tuesday.  ——-  Associated Press writer Grant Peck contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvdGhhaS1wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LTJuZC10ZWVuYWdlci1kZWZhbWluZy1tb25hcmNoeS1hbWlkLTk5Mzg2ODYy0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvdGhhaS1wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LTJuZC10ZWVuYWdlci1kZWZhbWluZy1tb25hcmNoeS1hbWlkLTk5Mzg2ODYy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2019-05-10","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:49:44","During his CNN town hall TV appearance on May 10, Donald Trump repeated the same lies and insults he’s been spewing since he lost the 2020 presidential election. In the 75 minutes given to the twice impeached president, now the target of multiple criminal investigations, Trump encouraged Republicans to default on the nation’s debt, celebrated the failed Jan. 6 coup attempt he incited as a “beautiful day,” promised to pardon Jan. 6 rioters and yet again defamed E. Jean Carroll just one day after a jury awarded her $5 million for Trump’s sexual abuse and defamation. All this took place before a New Hampshire audience hand-picked by CNN that enthusiastically applauded and cheered every Trump lie and slur.  As Trump and several other long-shot Republican candidates vie for their party’s presidential nomination, GOP-controlled states are proposing and passing public policy measures that either target specific groups of Americans for repression and stigmatization or attack the very foundations of democracy and personal liberty. The authoritarian and fascist underpinnings of these initiatives are seen in laws that suppress the vote of people of color, gerrymander voting maps, criminalize abortion, ban books, censor public school teaching of America’s history of slavery and institutional racism, stigmatize LGBTQ and trans youth, impose fines on journalists with whom politicians disagree, repeal child labor laws, remove elected office holders who refuse to carry out oppressive policies, overturn election results and majority-supported referendums and much more.  Between The Lines’ Scott Harris spoke with Jason Stanley, Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of “How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.” Here, Stanley examines the Republican party’s war against democratic accountability and governance as they work to impose minority rule.  JASON STANLEY: Isn’t it wild how there are so many different things happening at the same time? To understand that you need to step back and look. How are these different things related? These different things are related because they’re all attacks on freedom. Freedom to choose, for a woman. Freedom to have a same-sex relationship be normal. Freedom to vote.  They’re all attacks on kinds of freedom and the structure of the attacks, the ideology that links these together that goes after that, elevates the white Christian nationalism at the heart of our Jim Crow past. That elevates the white Christian nationalism in education and voting. In all of these areas, the concept one needs here is fascism. The U.S. fascism took this racial fascist form, anti-immigration, the panics over immigration, the structure of Great Replacement Theory that immigrants are coming to replace real Americans and vote instead of us.  Trump, in his speech, went back to the old themes targeting black majority are cities with large black populations as the sources of voter fraud. That’s the supposed justification between these absolutely absurd voter suppression moves. Florida just outdoes itself each month, it seems, with these voter suppression tactics of electoral police to tackle a non-existent problem of voter fraud.  So it’s an attack of democracy, an attack on education, an attack on LGBT, and they’re all happening together. It’s the same people. And they’re not stopping at high school education. They’re going after universities. They’re going after academic freedom. At each stage, the minimizers say, “Oh, they’re just targeting, you know, elementary schools.” So then they target high schools for education about LGBT issues. Then people say they’re not targeting universities and then they move to universities that make it illegal to talk about critical race theory or LGBT issues.  So they eliminate tenure (for professors). They target academic freedom. We’ve seen this before. It’s the rollback of democracy, authoritarianism, attacking education, attacking democracy. Fascism explains the violent militias. It also harkens back to U.S. history. Of course, the Confederacy, i.e. the Jim Crow era in particular, where some of these structures were laid down. So there’s a kind of familiarity about this, but we’ve let authoritarianism happen in state after state.  Look at Wisconsin. The governor voted in was a Democrat and the legislature met in a night session to remove all the powers from the governor. We’ve let all this happen. We’ve what we’ve let states that are 50-50 divided becomes dominated by Republican supermajority and legislatures. None of that is democratic. It’s like having a bunch of Hungary’s in the middle of the United States and then they venerate Hungary’s autocratic neo-fascist leader as the model.  So that’s the situation we face.  SCOTT HARRIS: You know, I did want to ask you to comment on one feature of this crisis we’re facing. The recent CNN town hall meeting with Donald Trump was really, in the view of many people, a 90-minute platform for this twice impeached president who incited a violent insurrection at the Capitol January 6, you know, was just convicted of sexual assault and defamation to spew his long list of lies and insults, further arousing hatred and fear in his base.  Has CNN and other media outlets normalized Trump and the GOP’s fascist agenda after all we’ve been through? And I would ask you to comment further on how you think our mainstream media can more responsibly cover Trump as he runs for president next year.  JASON STANLEY: The first question you asked was rhetorical. I mean, of course it was a normalization and of course it was repeating all the worst mistakes of 2016 and then some. So where they breathlessly covered every move of Trump like it was giving him billions in free media, like covering his rallies: “What will he do now?”  So as far as Trump’s speech, he brilliantly echoed these fascist themes. The Jan. 6 becomes a great patriotic moment, a heroic moment like the Beer Hall Putsch, Germany (coup attempt) in 1923. Ashli Babbitt becomes a Horst Wessel, the (German) storm trooper who was killed, supposedly by communists, who became this hero of Nazi propaganda that they sang about in the “Horst-Wessel-Lied.”  And Ashli Babbitt was shot by a black police officer. So if you look at what Trump said, he said, “The thug who killed Ashli Babbitt.” So it’s a clear reference to race. He’s setting up Ashli Babbitt as a pure martyr for his cause. It’s you know, it’s almost like he wrote a history book. But the main number one indicator of damage or severe democratic backsliding or loss of democracy is a coup that goes on punished.

"coup","2023-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Melbourne"", ""Victoria"", ""Australia""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:00:06","Western United’s rebuild is underway for the 2023-24 Isuzu UTE A-League season, signing star midfielder Angus Thurgate – who was once nicknamed the ‘Port Macquarie Pele’.  Thurgate is Western’s first major signing on a three-year contract after they failed to reach the 2022-23 Finals Series.  Western’s unsuccessful title defence has prompted a shake-up of the playing squad, with Leo Lacroix, Jamie Young, Neil Kilkenny, Tongo Doumbia and James Troisi among the departures, while foundation player Dylan Pierias has also farewelled the 2021-22 champions.  Now, Thurgate arrives after six seasons at Newcastle Jets and kick-starts a new era for John Aloisi’s side.  ISUZU UTE A-LEAGUE: 2023-24 Ins & outs  “I’m buzzing to start a new challenge with Western United, I’m really looking forward to creating some history for this club and getting to work,” the 23-year-old said.  “Speaking with John (Aloisi) and Mal (Impiombato) and listening to the vision and plans for the  coming seasons really enticed me to want to join and add some more success to this club.  “I’m really excited to get down to Melbourne and get to work with the lads.”  READ MORE ON KEEPUP  ISUZU UTE A-LEAGUE SEMI FINAL SECOND LEGS: Everything you need to know  PODCAST VIEW: Adelaide urged to make ‘blockbuster’ Irankunda call to answer ‘massive, massive question’  TILIO GOES VIRAL: ‘Jesus… I’ve never seen that!’ Secret to incredible finals moment  THE MAKING OF MARINERS BOSS: The Zoo, ‘people stealing cars’ & Premier League ‘ambition’  TALBOT: An Olyroo’s ‘unreal’ transfer took 3 attempts: This is why he ‘couldn’t really say no’  Thurgate debuted for the Jets as a 17-year-old in 2018, and has since gone on to amass 116 Isuzu UTE A-League appearances, scoring 11 goals.  In 2019, then-Jets boss Ernie Merrick said: “He gets embarrassed because he’s from Port Macquarie and they call him the ‘Port Macquarie Pele’ which is a slight exaggeration.”  An Olyroo in 2021 and last year’s Isuzu UTE A-League Young Player of the Year, he scored two goals in 26 matches as the Jets finished six points short of the top six, while Western were three points outside the finals positions.  “We are extremely pleased to be able to bring a player of Angus’ calibre to our squad and to our club,” Aloisi said.  “Angus has been a regular first-team player from a young age and he will add significant quality into our midfield with his physicality, intelligence and his ability on the ball.  “As well as his talent, Angus has a fantastic character and will fit seamlessly into the culture of our club. I’m looking forward to seeing him join up with the squad as we strive to meet our goals next season.”  How did Newcastle react to losing Thurgate?  When Thurgate’s departure was confirmed on May 6, Newcastle Jets executive chairman Shane Mattiske expressed his disappointment, claiming an offer was tabled to the central midfielder which would have seen him become “one of the club’s highest earners.”  “Having worked hard to ensure he stays at this club,” Mattiske said.  “We felt that we made a very strong offer to Angus to stay here at the Jets. Our offer would have seen him become one of the club’s highest earners, however, we understand that his focus is on international opportunities, and if these don’t come in the short term, the ability to experience living in one of Australia’s big cities.  “Ultimately, we have to respect his decision.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8va2VlcHVwLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2FuZ3VzLXRodXJnYXRlLXdlc3Rlcm4tdW5pdGVkLXRyYW5zZmVyLW5ld3MtYS1sZWFndWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 20:15:00","May 18, 2023  MANILA – The rule of law has prevailed,” declared Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla shortly after the acquittal of former senator Leila de Lima from yet another baseless charge under the previous administration. On her part, De Lima, among the bravest opposition leaders in recent memory, exclaimed: “This is the beginning of my vindication. Answered prayers.”  As I have argued in the past, one should have expected a “whiff of change” under President Rodrigo Duterte’s successor. After all, the former commander in chief was so demagogically callous and amateur scattershot that some kind of “reboot” was inevitable, even under a supposed political ally.  Others would even go so far as arguing that since Ferdinand Marcos Sr. effectively broke the country—impoverishing a once-promising nation with unsustainable crony debt and one-of-a-kind decadent dictatorship—then maybe hope that Marcos Jr. will fix it. After all, not much changed for the vast majority of Filipinos in the four decades that separated his father’s tenure from his own.  De Lima’s acquittal can’t be separated from broader shifts in the political landscape, especially as the incumbent seeks better relations with traditional allies, which have been lobbying for a more modern and humane form of democratic governance in the country.  Dear reader: Anyone with a basic familiarity with facts on the ground, however, knows that “rule of law” is still an aspiration rather than a full-fledged reality in the country. Only sustained political struggle and effective mobilization by progressive forces can bring about genuine democracy.  And this brings us to the two most consequential elections of the year, which have demonstrated the power of progressive politics in even more illiberal-authoritarian contexts than in the Philippines. In neighboring Thailand, nothing less than an electoral revolt took place. Over the weekend, countless young voters propelled a progressive party to the center of Thai politics, thus effectively ending the binary struggle between the so-called “red shirt” faction, namely supporters of populist ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the “yellow shirt” faction, namely supporters of the monarchy and urban middle class.  Barely years after resurrecting from the ashes of its predecessor, Future Forward Party, which was founded by young tycoon Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, and the Move Forward (MF) Party led by young technocrat Pita Limjaroenrat, defied all odds by topping all other major parties, including Thaksin’s, in this year’s elections.  Not long ago, the youthful and youth-driven party, broadly social democratic in ideological orientation, was seen as a tad too radical for the general Thai electorate. After all, this was a party that not only questioned mandatory military conscription and lèse-majesté, effectively challenging the two pillars of conservative power in Thailand, but also advocated for a massive increase in minimum wages as well as the legalization of same-sex marriage.  Over the weekend, Pita insisted that there would be no compromise on his party’s key policy agenda, though it remains unclear how he could assume power without forming a coalition with not only Thaksin’s Pheu Thai Party but also, at least, one faction of the pro-military establishment, most notably that of Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan. Nevertheless, MF’s electoral success under the shadow of a pro-military establishment, not to mention the threat of yet another coup, underscores the importance of authentically progressive and tirelessly charismatic leadership.  Meanwhile, Turkey has experienced its tightest elections in recent memory, with the strongman populist incumbent going neck and neck with the opposition. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is arguably one of the most successful politicians of the 21st century. Politically savvy, he is also a classic survivor, having overcome, in a span of a decade, a judicial coup (by secular rivals) as well as a military coup (by traditionalist allies) on the way to consolidating his grip on the country.  But by leveraging a unified opposition, and drawing on his well-established credentials as a capable and compassionate technocrat, Kemal Kilicdaroglu has come closer than anyone to defeating Erdogan in general elections. In both Thailand and Turkey, the progressive opposition has managed to pull off massive electoral gains and mobilize broad-based support groups even under the most intimidating conditions, which dwarf structural challenges in the Philippines. In both countries, charismatic, capable, and uncompromising leaders unified disparate civil society groups and fearlessly advocated for progressive reform against the tide of authoritarian populism.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5ld3MubmV0d29yay90aGFpLXR1cmtpc2gtcG9sbHMtbGVzc29ucy1mb3Itb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In addition to casting Halle Bailey as a black Ariel, the new live-action remake of Disney’s 1989 animated classic will find the mermaid heroine having a “more grown-up and mature” relationship with Prince Eric, according to his portrayer Jonah Hauer-King.  That includes an update of Alan Menken’s “Kiss the Girl” lyrics so that it wouldn’t seem as if Eric was forcing himself on Ariel.  “My understanding is that there were some feelings around consent and asking to kiss someone, which makes total sense to me,” Hauer-King, 27, told the Hollywood Reporter.  Having witnessed the racist backlash that Bailey faced for playing Ariel, the London native said he does “not really understand what to make of it.”  “Rob [Marshall, the director] and the producers and Disney didn’t approach this film and this casting with any kind of agenda — they just wanted to cast the person who was best for the role,” said Hauer-King.

Hauer-King — whose credits include the 2019 film “A Dog’s Way Home” and the BBC drama “World on Fire” — initially auditioned for “The Little Mermaid” as just a “fun experience.”  But after seven months of auditions, he scored his own casting coup, beating out none other than Harry Styles for the coveted role.

"coup","2021-01-01","02:00:00","{""Rangoon"", ""Rangoon"", ""Myanmar""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:42:48","Resistance forces have stepped up attacks on the military’s power supply, sometimes affecting ordinary civilians’ lives, though the data shows the regime is responsible for the vast majority of blackouts.  By FRONTIER  With temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius for much of April, nationwide power shortages were keenly felt across Myanmar as the military regime tightly rationed electricity. The junta’s inability to keep the lights on has caused hardship for business owners, some of whom need constant electricity.  “When I operate my press, it needs to run continuously for eight hours,” said the owner of a printing press in Yangon’s downtown Pazundaung Township, who now relies on an expensive generator to avoid disruptions.  A rice mill owner in Ayeyarwady Region’s Maubin Township, meanwhile, told Frontier he had to shut down his business entirely.  As usual, the military regime has sought to blame those opposed to its rule, saying resistance forces conducted 229 attacks on electricity infrastructure since the 2021 coup. On April 6 state media accused “terrorists” of “intentionally attacking against the infrastructures related to the electric power generation, transmission and distribution to the public”.  But the National Unity Government, appointed by elected lawmakers deposed in the coup, and resistance forces say they are cutting off a vital source of military power while taking measures to avoid overly inconveniencing the general public.  “The military council needs electricity to run its war machine, like the production of weapons and ammunition. So, it’s important for us to cut the power supply,” U Naing Htoo Aung, permanent secretary of the NUG’s defence ministry, told Frontier.  The coup and subsequent violent crackdown on peaceful protests sparked a grassroots uprising against military rule, with armed resistance groups known as People’s Defence Forces emerging across the country.  While not lacking in courage or manpower, the PDFs are severely outgunned. The military receives sophisticated weapons from Russia and China, including aircraft, but resistance forces rely on the extortionate black market and homemade guns. Some have therefore turned their attention to levelling the playing field – by sabotaging the military’s weapons factories.  “We will attack and destroy anything that supports the military council’s production of arms and ammunition and its propaganda networks,” said Ko Wai Yan, spokesperson for the Bago Region PDF, which is under the NUG’s chain of command.  “We have instructed our forces to minimise as much as possible the effect on the people,” added Naing Htoo Aung.  But because of how Myanmar’s electricity grid operates, with virtually all nodes connected in a single network, taking any of them offline can temporarily disrupt the overall flow of electricity, which can result in knock-on power cuts in residential areas. This, however, is true both for targeted resistance assaults on infrastructure and more indiscriminate military attacks like village burnings and airstrikes.  Who’s to blame?  All of the civilians interviewed for this article blamed the power outages on the junta, but most also appealed to resistance forces to take measures to avoid making ordinary people’s lives more difficult.  “Under the National League for Democracy, there were times in the [March to May] hot season when power was only available part-time,” said a woman who lives in Yangon’s North Okkalapa Township, referring to the overthrown elected government.  She said under the junta, power is rationed even more severely, and frequently isn’t available even during scheduled times.  “The military council blames the power failures on this or that and it can say what it likes, but this situation is due to its mismanagement,” she said.  However, she said PDFs should take care to minimise the impact of sabotage attacks on the public.  “I only want attacks that will affect the military council. I can understand why the PDFs need to carry out such attacks, but as transmission lines deliver power from one place to another, we don’t want attacks that will harm the people,” she said.  But Mr Guillaume de Langre, a former advisor to the civilian government on energy policy, said while resistance attacks “occasionally disrupt the stability of the grid, most power cuts are the result of bad policy, economic chaos and loss of investor confidence in the junta”.  According to de Langre’s data, in this year’s second quarter, Myanmar is producing 2,444 megawatts less electricity than was projected before the coup. Most of the lost power – 1,418 MW – is because planned projects have been cancelled or left in limbo, while another 800 MW has been lost from power plants shutting down since the coup.  Chart showing the causes of the power shortage in Myanmar based on pre-coup projections of energy available in this year’s second quarter. (Guillaume de Langre)  A Yangon Electricity Supply Corporation official told the pro-military Popular News Journal in April that 1,500 MW was being distributed nationally, down from 3,200 MW before the coup. Repeated attempts by Frontier to seek comment from YESC chief executive officer U Kyaw Thu were unsuccessful.  “Investors lost trust in Myanmar, so dozens of power plants were either shut down or cancelled,” de Langre explained.  For example, 26 proposed solar power plants were reportedly cancelled last year after Chinese companies postponed signing power purchase agreements that were agreed on before the coup.  Another 226 MW, or around 9 percent of the lost energy, is a result of resistance attacks on power lines, de Langre’s data shows. In February, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force said it blew up nine electricity towers in southern Shan State’s Pekon Township supplying power to the capital Nay Pyi Taw.  A spokesperson for the armed group, which was founded after the coup and primarily operates in Kayah and southern Shan states, said the KNDF only targeted transmission lines “that are to be used against us”.  But while Nay Pyi Taw may be the power centre of the regime, there are hundreds and thousands of ordinary civilians living there too. And besides increased hardship for affected communities, there has also been some cost in human lives.  In December, the junta claimed 19 electricity workers had been killed in resistance attacks on infrastructure since 2021, with another 56 injured.  Naing Htoo Aung said the NUG’s policy is to “act in accordance with international conventions”, but while they are considered civilians under international law, civil servants and local officials working for the regime have been targeted by resistance forces on an almost daily basis.  “What we want is for people better than Min Aung Hlaing to rule us. It’s true we support the NUG, but we don’t support anything that would hurt people,” said a woman from Nay Pyi Taw’s Zabuthiri Township, who criticised resistance attacks that have killed or injured civilians.  Nay Pyi Taw PDF spokesperson Bo Ngwe Soe admitted to setting off “warning bombs” to deter electricity workers from collecting unpaid bills from those participating in a boycott, but did not say whether his group had killed or injured any of the workers.  An electricity worker in Magway Region’s Chauk Township, an area with strong resistance activity, said he lives in fear.  “We’re worried we could be attacked at work or even while we’re off duty, because these things are happening and we don’t have any weapons,” he said.  He said a PDF once planted explosives near power lines in Chauk, and one of his friends and colleagues was briefly abducted last year in Shan State.  “I don’t know why they arrested him, but after 10 days in custody he was released,” he said.  Looking ahead  Contrary to de Langre’s data, the junta claimed in the state-run Myanma Alinn in December last year that sabotage attacks on the national power grid had reduced supply by about 160MW.  “It always lies, and it will continue to lie, and the people know that,” the NUG’s Naing Htoo Aung said.  A woman in Yangon’s Hlaing Township said the electricity shortages are evidence of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s shortcomings and called for the dictator to step down.  “I support what the PDF is doing, including the sabotage attacks on transmission towers. I want the revolution to succeed as quickly as possible,” she said.  The printing press owner agreed.  “They are ruling the country, so it’s their responsibility,” he said.  The December article in Myanma Alinn also said it had not been possible to carry out necessary repair work in some areas.  “Attacks on infrastructure are low risk/high impact, and they can happen anywhere,” said de Langre. “For the junta, it’s very expensive to keep repairing the lines. High voltage lines cost tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix.”  Political analyst U Than Soe Naing said the junta’s priorities were clear from its budget allocations. For the 2023-24 fiscal year, the regime allocated more than K5.6 trillion to defence spending, up nearly K2 trillion compared to the previous year. By contrast, it granted only K680 billion to the electricity sector, which is heavily subsidised, and has experienced a collapse and only partial recovery in bill collection since the coup.  “We can assume that the military council will escalate military operations and will not solve the problems of the people in education, health and electricity supply. The reason for the chaos in electricity supply is the mismanagement of the military council,” he said.  De Langre said he expects these attacks to continue, and to become “more frequent and sophisticated”.  The woman from North Okkalapa said she would continue supporting the PDFs and called for others to do the same.  “They need to take great care not to hurt the people, but sometimes inconveniences might happen unexpectedly,” she said. “People should understand that PDFs are fighting for the people. So, I for one would support any attack they deem necessary.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyb250aWVybXlhbm1hci5uZXQvZW4vcG93ZXItcGxheS1wZGZzLXRhcmdldC1taWxpdGFyeXMtZWxlY3RyaWNpdHktc3VwcGx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2021-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 20:52:00","Election of new Karen National Union leaders will likely to lead to more fighting, experts say.  The Karen National Union’s leadership is seen at the 75th anniversary of the group’s founding held at KNU headquarters in eastern Myanmar's Kayin state on the Thai-Myanmar border, Feb. 5, 2022.  The Karen National Union, Myanmar’s oldest ethnic armed group that has allied itself with the anti-junta People's Defense Forces and the shadow government made up of junta opponents, has rejected peace talks offered by Myanmar’s military regime that rules the country.  The junta made the proposal on May 9 after a leadership reshuffle during the 17th Congress of the Karen group, which has been engaged in an armed struggle for a federal democracy against the Myanmar military for more than 70 years.  The KNU held the conference online on April 24-May 4 at its headquarters on the Thai-Myanmar border in mountainous Kayin state. The group and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army, operates mostly in Kayin and Mon states and the Bago and Tanintharyi regions.  KNU leaders decided that the organization and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army, would join forces with other armed groups that have revolted against the junta and work towards the establishment of a federal democratic system in the country.  During the conference, the KNU named several newly elected officials to the organization’s leadership, including Padoh Saw Kwe Htoo Win, who served as vice president in the last term, as its new chair.  He was deeply involved in former peace talks between the KNU and successive Myanmar regimes, but after the February 2021 coup that brought the military to power, he was closely associated with and supported the armed resistance, according to KNU sources.  As the first ethnic armed group to publicly denounce the coup, the KNU paid dearly for its action, suffering heavy airstrikes and ground offensives after the KNLA captured a Myanmar military base and a later escalation of fighting when junta troops bombarded a site for internally displaced persons.  The KNLA also increased attacks on junta troops, sheltered protesters and trained local anti-coup forces.  Six members of the central executive committee were not re-elected, including KNU President General Saw Mutu Say Poe, who opposed armed resistance against the coup and called for a dialogue.  Rejects cease-fire  The KNU said it would fight against the military dictatorship and cooperate with other ethnic armed organizations, democratic forces and people who have been struggling for the establishment of a federal democratic union and for democracy, equality and autonomy.  KNU Central Committee member Padoh Saw Thamein Tun told RFA that it was impossible to talk with the Military Administration Council, the formal name of the junta regime, in accordance with the nationwide cease-fire agreement, or NCA.  The KNU was one of eight armed ethnic groups that signed the NCA with the national military in 2015, but its legitimacy wavered because of Myanmar military incursions into KNU-controlled areas.  “Now we can’t work under the NCA,” he told Radio Free Asia.  “What is happening now is that [ethnic-majority Bamar] chauvinism and military dictatorship prevail,” he said. “We will fight these and then establish a federal democracy.”  Trainees take part in military exercises with Karen National Union Brigade 6 in eastern Myanmar’s Kayin state, May 9, 2021. Credit: AFP  After the congress, the junta’s National Solidarity and Peacemaking Negotiation Committee issued a statement criticizing the KNU’s decision, saying it went against the terms of the NCA and would lead to confrontation. The committee also said holding talks would be the best way to work towards a solution for long-term peace.  KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Kler Say told local media outlets that the union did not accept the military council’s peace offer. RFA could not reach him by phone for comment.  The shadow National Unity Government said it hoped to cooperate with the new KNU leaders to speed up armed resistance to the junta this year, according to Kyaw Zaw, spokesman for the president’s office.  “We hope to work together with all the ethnic armed groups, including the KNU, to attack the common enemy, the military dictatorship, right away, and accelerate cooperation between us to topple the military dictatorship,” he said.  More fierce fighting likely  Political and military analysts said the KNU’s rejection of talks could intensify military offensives in areas it controls.  Thein Tun Oo, executive director of the Thayninga Strategic Studies Institute, a group of former Burmese military officers, believes that war will come about because the new KNU leaders are hardliners who have supported armed resistance against the national military.  “They prioritize the armed struggle rather than holding a dialogue,” he said. “If the other side chooses the hard way, the military side will respond the same way.”  Political analyst Ye Tun agreed that new KNU leaders are more inclined to fight than previous ones.  “Now, we have to say that the path of armed struggle has gained the upper hand,” he said.

TOKYO (AP) — Leaders of seven of the world’s most powerful democracies will gather this weekend for the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, the location of the world’s first atomic attack at the end of World War II. From the emergence of crucial developing countries to security worries, including growing aggression from China, North Korea and Russia, here’s a look at the G-7, who will attend and some of the key issues: ___ WHAT IS THE G-7 SUMMIT? The Group of Seven is an informal group of leading industrialized nations. It consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  G-7 leaders likely to focus on the war in Ukraine and tensions in Asia at summit in Hiroshima  HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) — The symbolism will be palpable when leaders of the world’s rich democracies sit down in Hiroshima, a city whose name evokes the tragedy of war, to tackle a host of challenges including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions in Asia. The attention on the war in Europe comes just days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy completed a whirlwind trip to meet many of the Group of Seven leaders now heading to Japan for the summit starting Friday. That tour was aimed at adding to his country’s weapons stockpile and building political support ahead of a widely anticipated counteroffensive to reclaim lands occupied by Moscow’s forces.  UN expert: Myanmar military imported $1 billion in weapons since 2021 coup  UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion worth of weapons and related material from Russia, China and other countries since its February 2021 coup, some of which it has used to carry out atrocities against civilians, according to a U.N. report released Wednesday. The weapons continue to flow to the military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for the atrocities, including some that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, said Tom Andrews, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar. As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help.  Biden says there’s ‘work to do’ on global stage as he heads to Japan; US debt limit standoff looms  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said there’s “work to do” on the global stage as he headed to Japan on Wednesday to consult with allies on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s assertiveness in the Pacific at the same time that a debt limit standoff looms at home. With high-stakes talks to head off a federal default underway in Washington, Biden pledged to remain in “constant contact” with negotiators in the capital city while he conducts international diplomacy. The president departed Washington aboard Air Force One a day after scrapping plans for a historic stop in Papua New Guinea and a key visit to Australia amid the showdown with House Republicans over raising the federal debt limit.  Ukraine’s foreign minister and visiting Chinese envoy discuss peace, but next steps unclear  KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s foreign minister met with a visiting Chinese mediator to discuss how to end Russia’s war, but no details were disclosed Wednesday and the next steps were unclear. Over two days, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba discussed with envoy Li Hui “ways to stop Russian aggression,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kuleba briefed Li, a former Chinese ambassador to Moscow, “about the principles of restoring a stable and just peace based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Kuleba, according to the statement, repeated his government’s position that Ukraine wouldn’t accept any proposal involving the loss of its territories or the “freezing of the conflict.” There was no word on how Li responded to Kuleba.  Chinese envoy asks Australia to increase search for 39 aboard capsized fishing boat in Indian Ocean  CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A Chinese envoy asked Australian authorities Thursday to increase efforts to find survivors in an Indian Ocean search for 39 missing from a capsized Chinese fishing boat. Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said the Australian authority had already sent four airplanes and three ships to the search area, which is in the center of the Indian Ocean. No survivors or life rafts have been spotted. Xiao said China wanted to coordinate with “friendly countries,” including Australia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, on the search and rescue effort following the capsizing Tuesday. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the search coordinator, said the upturned hull was spotted Tuesday from a cargo ship 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) northwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth.  China asks embassies to avoid ‘propaganda’ in apparent reference to pro-Ukrainian displays  BEIJING (AP) — Foreign embassies in Beijing have been asked by the Chinese government to avoid displaying “propaganda” in an apparent response to shows of support for Ukraine. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government says it is neutral in Moscow’s 15-month-old invasion of Ukraine but has repeated Russian justifications for the attack, accusing the U.S. and NATO of provoking Moscow. Beijing was due to send an envoy this week to Ukraine and Russia to discuss a possible “political settlement,” but the effort is thought unlikely to make progress given China’s rhetorical, diplomatic and economic support for Moscow. A spokesperson for the European Union said the Protocol Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry circulated a note on May 8 to all diplomatic missions to the effect that they should “respect Chinese laws and regulations” and “not to use the external walls of embassies to carry out politicized propaganda to avoid causing disputes between countries.” The note does not specify what might constitute “politicized propaganda”, nor communicates further on the matter, said the spokesperson, Nabila Massrali, adding that the EU Delegation in Beijing “has not changed any items displayed at its front wall.” Another European diplomat who asked not to be identified further due to the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed Massrali’s account, saying embassies had been asked by the Foreign Ministry not to use their outer walls for “political propaganda.” He also said his government doesn’t “see any reason to change” its display.  New Zealand budget plan offers modest financial relief ahead of election  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Months before an election, New Zealand’s government on Thursday offered some modest financial relief to many people by making most prescription medicines free and increasing subsidies for child care and public transportation. But the government’s annual budget plan was notable for its lack of big new initiatives. Since taking office earlier this year, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has promised a back-to-basics approach and axed many of the more ambitious — and contentious — plans of his predecessor, Jacinda Ardern. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the budget was all about doing the basics well. “It’s pragmatic and it’s practical and it’s the right budget for these times,” Robertson said.  Thailand’s Move Forward Party in talks with 5 other parties in attempt to form coalition government  BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s progressive Move Forward Party on Wednesday held its first face-to-face discussions with five other parties in an attempt to form a coalition government, three days after scoring a stunning national election victory. A new government will be formed in July when the House of Representatives and the appointed Senate select a new prime minister. Because of the joint vote, Sunday’s election victor is not assured of taking power. Representatives of the five parties, mostly members of the opposition to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s conservative government, met for several hours Wednesday. Afterward they emerged smiling and posed for photos with hands linked in a sign of unity.  Japan’s leader welcomes investment, exchanges to strengthen computer chip supply chain  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stressed that investment and international exchanges to strengthen the computer chip supply chain were welcome, as he met with the leaders of top computer chips makers Thursday. A recent shortage of chips was a sore point for Japan’s manufacturing powerhouses like Toyota Motor Corp., when social restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic crimped supplies, serving as a wake-up call that solid access to production must be ensured. Computer chips are used in vehicles, mobile phones and an array of other products, and next-generation chips are going to be crucial for artificial intelligence, automated driving systems and other advanced technology.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FzaWEtMWI3OWZkNmJiOTVjYzA1OTM4M2ZjNDViMzI2NGNiMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1987-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Suva"", ""Central"", ""Fiji""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:47:35","“Fiji, the way the world should be!” was the proud slogan of Fiji islands when Fiji worked out a social contract between native Fijians and Fiji Indians under a constitution in 1970 which balanced the two races by reserving an equal number of seats for them in the Parliament and giving a small number of seats for “others”.  Fiji Indians, who were a majority, did not insist on the “one man, one vote” principle. It was understood that the Fijians will be in power with the support of “others” and the Indians will take care of the economy based on cane cultivation and tourism.  Ratu Mara, the hereditary Chief of Fiji, became the Prime Minister and remained so for 17 years. This happy situation turned sour when some educated Fijians joined with the Indians to form a Labour Party and came to power in the elections in 1987. The Fijian chiefs revolted against the Labour government and instigated a bloodless military coup by Sitiveni Rabuka, the third-ranking military officer in the Fiji army. Colonel Rabuka overthrew the elected government and installed a regime mostly of Fijians and brought in a constitution which virtually disenfranchised the Indian Fijians. Rabuka happened to be an alumnus of India’s Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, Tamil Nadu.  Former Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka with TP Sreenivasan. Photo: Special arrangement  After three more coups and changes of government, Sitiveni Rabuka, the coup leader won the recent election and became Prime Minister with the support of the Fiji Indians.  Reconciliation efforts  Moreover, in a surprise move, Prime Minister Rabuka made a public apology in May 2023 for his role in the 1987 coup which overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra. In his apology, Rabuka expressed his regret for the actions taken in the coup, stating, ""I make this confession on my own behalf and on behalf of all those who took part with me in the military coup on the 14th of May, 1987. We confess our wrongdoings, and we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of the Indo-Fijian community.”  ""Rabuka admitted in a tweet that ""you have every right to blame us for the difficulties you went through, we do not blame you for being angry with us or even hate us, you are justified in your anger and your hate. I stand here to confess and to ask for your forgiveness.""  Rabuka's apology came at a time when India is seeking to deepen its engagement with the Pacific Islands. The third Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) summit is being held in May in Papua New Guinea, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is expected to announce several initiatives for cooperation with the island states.  The apology by Rabuka is also seen as a significant step towards reconciliation between the indigenous Fijian and Indian communities, and it is hoped that it will help to heal the wounds caused by the coup. It also sends a positive message to India and other countries in the region that Fiji is committed to democracy and good governance.  Some of the island nations of the South Pacific, which had traditionally maintained a pro-western policy under the influence of Australia and New Zealand have entered into strategic relations with China. The West is increasingly depending on Fiji to counter China and Prime Minister Rabuka may have found links with India extremely important at this time.  Rabuka over the years  Rabuka has been quite mercurial in the last 36 years. During his days in the Staff College, he was very popular as a soldier and a socialite. An admiral’s wife, who met him in Wellington, felt that the Fiji Indians might have been responsible for turning the “Steve” she knew into a dictator. He played golf with me and he was prim and proper in every way. A day before the coup he told me that he would be busy for the next few days and would not be able to play. He was ruthless in handling the coup and claimed that he and his soldiers who entered the parliament were fully armed, but he made sure that there was no bloodshed. He claimed throughout that he was acting on his own, but when I met him in 2014 in Suva, when neither of us had any official position, he said that both he and I had acted under instructions and, therefore, we should have no animosity with each other. He is the only coup leader in history who played himself in a movie on the coup.  With the unconditional apology Rabuka has made, Fiji has come full circle and it appears that Fiji is once again the world as it should be. But Rabuka should remain firm in his commitment to racial amity and good relations to regain the lost paradise.

"coup","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:15:30","It was a chilly early morning in the Marcos Paz penitentiary when Jorge Rafael Videla, the infamous dictator, was found dead in his cell at age 87. He had died of a cardiac arrest.  News traveled quickly across the world: one of the faces of Argentina’s cruelest dictatorship, dead in the cell of a common prison.  The human rights organizations and survivors of the dictatorship era fought long and hard for the dictators to be tried and sentenced to jail. They asked for them to go through a process their victims never had: being properly investigated and judged.  To this day many questions and gaps about Videla’s role during those dark years of Argentine history remain unsolved. As he died, he took with him the truth about many of his victims’ fates.  The first five years of horror  On March 24, 1976, Videla sat before six microphones and a camera to read a 45-minute statement announcing the military coup against Isabel Perón’s government and the start of what he called a “national reorganization process”.  “Our country is undergoing one of the hardest phases in its history, the intervention of the armed forces is the only alternative,” he said  He was proclaimed president by the military junta that led the coup, and stayed in charge for five years.  Originally from Mercedes, a town in Buenos Aires province, Jorge Rafael Videla was a military man who built a long career between 1944 and 1975. He held various roles during the Argentine Revolution, a dictatorship that lasted from 1966 to 1973, and was, by 1976, the head of the armed forces. His designation in 1975 was announced by Antonio Cafiero, a member of Perón’s government at the time. He described Videla as “an apolitical, absolutely professional man, who could never carry out a coup.”  Although Videla was considered part of the “soft” wing of the junta, reportedly pushing for a quick transition back to democracy, those five years were the cruelest of the military dictatorship. They were tainted by an orchestrated and silent annihilation system against those labeled “subversive”: of the 30,000 kidnapped, tortured, murdered and disappeared, most were abducted during the Videla years.  Over 500 babies born in captivity were stolen by the military, some of whom have not recovered their true histories and identities to this day. A network of clandestine detention centers was set up across the country. There was a climate of terror that kept many from speaking out, while thousands fled the country in order to avoid being kidnapped.  It was also in 1976 that the Operation Condor, a scheme hatched by the armies of eight South American countries to capture and kill leftist militants, had Argentina as its epicenter.  During his years as de facto president, and those that came after, Videla insisted that the disappeareances, tortures, murders, rapes and abductions carried out by the armed forces during those years were the result of defending the interests of the country.  In a Casa Rosada press conference in 1979, Videla made one of his most notorious public statements when asked about claims of human rights violations in Argentina.  “We Argentines should not be ashamed, because what happened was a defense of human rights, threatened by terrorism,” he said. “The disappeared are an incognita (…) as long as they remain disappeared, they can’t have special treatment, for they are disappeared; they’ve no entity, they’re neither dead nor alive, they’re disappeared: we can’t do anything about it.”  During a TV interview in 1980, he said that the so-called “war” had “left an amount of dead, prisoners and disappeared that was painful,” but that he felt proud that the armed forces had “won”, because “today, the country enjoys peace, freedom, respect.”  “It came at a high cost,” he said, “but the people agreed that we had to do it in order to achieve peace.”  The military junta referred to the crimes against humanity perpetrated during the dictatorship as the “dirty war”, implying that its atrocities were a necessary evil to win a war between foes of equal standing. Today, it is considered an offensive and denialist term by Argentina’s human rights movement because it portrays victims of state terrorism as combatants.  At that point, the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, alongside other human rights organizations, were working incessantly to find information about the fate of their loved ones. Videla and his associates targeted them as “crazy”.  After the return of democracy in 1983, a growing number of victims summoned the strength to speak out about what had happened to them.  Videla was tried in the historic Trial of the Juntas (portrayed recently in the film Argentina, 1985 by Santiago Mitre), where he was sentenced to life in prison for 469 crimes against humanity.  He was later pardoned in 1990 by President Carlos Menem alongside other Junta members and guerrilla activists, in what the president considered an attempt to “reconcile” the military with those who had fought against it.  Videla went back to prison briefly in 1998 when a Federal Judge ordered his pre-trial detention for the crime of child appropriation. After 38 days, he was placed under house arrest until 2008, when Federal Judge Norberto Oyarbide ordered his detention due to the gravity of his crimes. He spent the last five years of his life in prison.  With time, Videla would be convicted twice more: to another life sentence in 2010 for the killing of 29 political prisoners in San Martín in 1976, and to 50 years in prison in 2012 for the systematic plan that led to the abduction of twenty children under the age of 10.  In a document called “The dimension of impunity”, the Public Prosecution Ministry organized information about Videla’s court cases, showing that he was accused in 24 cases that encompassed more than 1,200 victims. He died before being tried for many of his crimes, including those under Operation Condor.  Jorge Rafael Videla never revealed the fate of those who remain missing, nor what happened to the babies abducted in captivity, among other questions. The victims’ families are still searching for answers to this day.  The Herald’s archive  On September 5, 1977, Videla traveled to the United States to take part in the signing of the Panama Canal Agreement at the OAS. During his weeklong trip, he held meetings with U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter expressed concern over human rights violations in Argentina, but Videla stood by his administration’s actions.  Several other Latin American leaders traveled to Washington those days – including dictators Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.  The Herald reported at the time that “when the two touched on the sensitive human rights issue, Carter expressed his concern for the number of people who are jailed in Argentina, the need for them to be quickly brought to trial, and the need for Argentina to let the rest of the world know the situation of the prisoners.”  Simultaneously, the Herald published an editorial by Robert Cox that said that, as Videla was in the US making commitments to improve the transparency of the detentions, Alfredo Bravo, the founder of the Education Workers’ Confederation (CTERA), had been kidnapped. “This incident,” wrote Cox, “calls for just the kind of action that President Videla has been promising in Washington. Unless the words that have, apparently, won over President Carter are followed by action, the country’s unfortunate image will become even blacker in foreign eyes – and with justice.”  As with the Deutsch’s family case in Córdoba, Cox’s views and the Herald’s coverage would become, once again, bold and necessary. Bravo would spend 10 days captive, being tortured by Miguel Etchecolatz, one of the dictatorship’s most violent repressors. His testimony before the US embassy’s officials in 1978 would become the grounds for a memorandum in which the U.S. government’s Latin America advisor Robert Pastor would recommend working on “a new strategy with Argentina.”  President Carter’s comments did not, however, alter the course of Videla and the Junta’s actions. Videla would be replaced as dictator by Roberto Viola in 1981. After being tried and pardoned, he spent most of the nineties avoiding the public eye. He was seen occasionally going to church and in a small number of media appearances.  Every day for the last 47 years, the families of the victims of his coup, civil society and human rights advocates across the world have worked to register, testify and tell the stories of the years when Videla and the Junta suspended Argentine democracy and inaugurated some of the darkest years in the country´s history. Videla is remembered in Argentina today not as a monster, but as the result of what authoritarianism, violence, and hatred can provoke.  Thanks to the efforts of those who sought truth and justice from the very beginning, he is also remembered as a dictator that underwent due trial, was sentenced, and died in a common prison cell ten years ago today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYnVlbm9zYWlyZXNoZXJhbGQuY29tL2h1bWFuLXJpZ2h0cy9qb3JnZS1yYWZhZWwtdmlkZWxhLXRoZS1kaWN0YXRvci13aG8tZGllZC1pbi1qYWls0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dozens of academics and public figures have signed an open letter calling for the release of jailed Tunisian opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, who was arrested late last month, pending a trial.  Ghannouchi, who was the speaker of parliament before it was suspended by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied in July 2021, was jailed on suspicion of plotting against state security.  According to his lawyer, the 81-year-old was sentenced in absentia this week to a year in prison.  The 150 signatories in Wednesday’s open letter said Ghannouchi was arrested for a public statement in which he “criticised Tunisian President Kais Saied’s coup against democracy”.  They said his arrest is part of a wide-ranging “politically motivated witch hunt”.  “Mr Ghannouchi is recognised as one of the most prominent advocates of democracy in the Arab world,” the signatories, from 18 countries across North America and Europe, wrote.  “His consensus-building approach and consistent calls for dialogue and unity across political, intellectual and ideological lines are needed in Tunisia, the wider region and beyond more than ever.”  Saied has been conducting a continuing crackdown against the country’s opposition since he suspended parliament. Several opposition figures have been detained in recent months, many of them from the prominent Ennahdha Party.      He gave himself powers to rule and legislate by decree and seized control of the judiciary in what rivals saw as a blow to democracy in the birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.  “Tunisian democrats have not remained silent. Dozens are in prison for bravely defending their hard won rights and freedoms, and faced trumped up charges of ‘conspiring against the state’,” the letter read.  The signatories further expressed their “support and solidarity for all political prisoners”.  “We call on the Tunisian authorities to release all political prisoners and to restore freedoms and human rights in Tunisia.”  In October 2011, Ennahdha emerged as the largest party in the country’s first parliamentary elections since the removal of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, winning 37 percent of the vote.  Over the last several weeks, authorities in Tunisia have arrested at least 17 other Ennahdha party members, prompting rights groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the Tunisian government.  The US-based rights group has warned that the government was “moving to neutralize the country’s largest political party”.  HRW said last week the total number of arrests of opposition figures considered critical of Saied stood at 30.  Other critics have said Saied has moved the country, which also faces a grinding economic crisis, down a dangerous path back towards autocracy.  Saied maintains that Tunisia needs a strong presidency to enable the officeholder to act quickly and decisively.  Those targeted in the latest crackdown included political activists and lawyers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvdHVuaXNpYS1kb3plbnMtb2YtYWNhZGVtaWNzLWNhbGwtZm9yLWdoYW5ub3VjaGlzLXJlbGVhc2XSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy90dW5pc2lhLWRvemVucy1vZi1hY2FkZW1pY3MtY2FsbC1mb3ItZ2hhbm5vdWNoaXMtcmVsZWFzZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The demonstration was not welcomed, however, by pro-civilian rule activists and political leaders, who regard the protesters as lending support and legitimacy to a military that has committed abuses, including the 2021 coup.  Residents of the city, meanwhile, urged all sides to calm the situation in Port Sudan, which has become an important haven for hundreds of thousands of people in the war-torn country, not to mention a commercial lifeline.  Led by the same people who have previously shut down Sudan’s chief port to place political pressure on opponents, there are fears that the rally could escalate at a time when stability and prosperity in Port Sudan are needed more than ever.

Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  The Beja, many of whom follow the prominent traditional leader, Mohamed al-Amin Tirik, described Perthes as representative of “new colonialism” and an enemy to the Sudanese people.  They demanded that he leave the country within 72 hours, accusing him of malignly intervening in domestic issues and politics.  Perthes was a key player in negotiations for the framework agreement to bring a transitional political system in place following the October 2021 military coup, which was led by the military and RSF and removed Sudan’s civilian government.  Sudan’s Darfur draws neighbours back into a war that never ended Read More »  Beja leaders contributed to the instability ahead of the coup by shutting down the port, where 90 percent of Sudan’s foreign trade passes through.  The framework agreement negotiated this year to resume a civilian and democratic path for Sudanese rule was then rejected by Beja leaders, who felt their community’s concerns were not met. Meanwhile, the agreement’s plans to fold the RSF into the army broke into violence on 15 April, which a month later has claimed over 800 lives.  The Beja crowd chanted for Tirik, as well as shouting ""Volker get out"" and ""Sudan is a free country"".  Tirik addressed the crowd from the Red Sea state municipality building, saying no one will leave unless the special envoy is expelled soon.  “We can rule our country without these interventions. This is our priority and political path, then we can sit as an army, national political parties and communities to solve our problems and see how we can support the transitional path and the civilian democratic ruling,” Tirik told the rally.  “We have submitted a memo to the head of the army including our demands and we will see. If they adopt it that’s OK, but if not we will be back here to stay,” he added, claiming the UN envoy’s continuing presence would only bring instability to eastern Sudan.  Calls for calm  Activists from the Resistance Committees pro-democracy network and leading members of the Forces for Freedom and Change political alliance (FFC) from the Red Sea state denounced the Beja rally as “propaganda”, and suggested they had ties to the government under former autocrat, Omar al-Bashir.  “This is a part of the army’s propaganda that we know very well. These groups were part of the old regime and they are basically supporting the army and they previously closed the port and made a lot of economic troubles and paved the way for the military to make the coup and hinder the transition,” one activist told MEE, speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons.  “Instead of playing these politics and adopting the agenda of the old regime, it’s better for those leaders to at least stand against the violations that are being committed by the two warring parties,” another said.

With Sudan’s already threadbare infrastructure shredded by the war, Port Sudan has become a lifeline for everything from aid to commerce to evacuations.  Most Sudanese ministries and international organisations are currently operating out of the city after Khartoum was engulfed in fighting.  “We are not with the RSF or SAF [Sudanese armed forces]. We want peace and we want Port Sudan to continue helping those who fled the war from different parts of the country, including Khartoum,” Isam Hassan, a 34-year-old resident, told MEE in Port Sudan’s market.  “We don’t like this polarisation reaching here.

The Pacific island nation saw its first change of leader in 16 years at a tightly fought national election in December, where Fiji First, which won 42% of the vote, was defeated by a coalition of three parties.  Four Fiji political parties were suspended for 30 days on Wednesday for not submitting audited accounts, local media reported.  In a statement, the parliamentary speaker's office said it had been notified by the Acting Registrar of Political Parties of the suspension.  ""In light of the suspension of the registration of the Fiji First Party, all twenty-four members are not entitled to take part in the proceedings of Parliament or any committee of Parliament for the duration of the suspension,"" it said.  They would also not receive any payment from parliament during the suspension, it added.  Fiji First could not be reached for comment, and its social media accounts were offline.  The island nation experienced four military coups between 1987 and 2006, when former prime minister Frank Bainimarama took power before forming Fiji First in 2014.

The public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt said police had searched the private apartments of two journalists aged 46 and 51 in the western town of Moerfelden-Walldorf on suspicion of dangerous dissemination of personal data.  Investigators confiscated electronic storage media and other devices, the office said, adding that police had detained the two men but later released them.

Advertising Read more  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy's status, with some protesters calling for the king's power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday's election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  - Tough laws -  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges -- at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  ""We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,"" he said.  ""We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.""  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate -- monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut's junta -- are threatening to block Pita's bid for the job.  ""I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said.  ""I will not accept Pita as a PM because he... has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can't accept.""  Cycle of unrest  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  ""I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,"" Napon told AFP.  ""This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.""  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  ""This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics -- the status quo has been demolished,"" Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTgtdGhhaWxhbmQtcy1tb3ZlLWZvcndhcmQtcGFydHktdGFrZXMtb24tYmlnZ2VzdC1wb2xpdGljYWwtdGFib2_SAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC5mcmFuY2UyNC5jb20vZW4vbGl2ZS1uZXdzLzIwMjMwNTE4LXRoYWlsYW5kLXMtbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJkLXBhcnR5LXRha2VzLW9uLWJpZ2dlc3QtcG9saXRpY2FsLXRhYm9v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At the same time, the right-wing group Mateh 64 organized a counter-protest march in support of the Haredi community. Ahead of the main march, which departed from Ramat Gan's Ayalon Mall, police closed roads in the area.  ""The ultra-Orthodox leadership is cooperating with the dictatorship with one hand, and the other hand is in the till,"" the organizers of the protest said in an apparent reference to the government's judicial plans. The Netanyahu government has agreed to provide 13.7 billion shekels ($3.8 billion) to meet the funding demands of its coalition's parties, including 230 million shekels for independent ultra-Orthodox educational institutions and a 150 million shekel increase in funding for food vouchers sought by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.  The budget hikes for ultra-Orthodox community needs was initially penned in the coalition agreements that the two ultra-Orthodox parties struck to join the current government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back in November.  Since the eruption of the mass protests against the government's plans to undermine the independence of the judiciary, there have been several protests targeting Bnei Brak. About two months ago, dozens of protesters demonstrated in front of the home of Moshe Gafni, the United Torah Judaism lawmaker who is chairman of the Knesset's Finance Committee. Residents shot firecrackers at the demonstrators and clashed with police. Four residents were arrested on suspicion of attacking protesters.  As the largest ultra-Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb, Bnei Brak has been the target of protest not only over increased government funding for Israel's ultra-Orthodox population but also due to the exemption of draft-aged ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students from compulsory military service. Israel's high court has ruled that the exemption is a violation of the principle of equality before the law, but legislation changing the law has yet to be passed.  Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have sought the passage of a Basic Law, with constitutional standing, that would enshrine Torah study as a fundamental value in its own right.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTE3L3R5LWFydGljbGUvLnByZW1pdW0vanVkaWNpYWwtY291cC1vcHBvbmVudHMtbWFyY2gtYWdhaW5zdC1idWRnZXQtaGlrZXMtcHJvbWlzZWQtdG8tdWx0cmEtb3J0aG9kb3gtcGFydGllcy8wMDAwMDE4OC0yOWViLWRiMzctYWZlYy1iZGZiNGVmNDAwMDDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The statement said that Ruhollah Akhundzadeh and his son Al-Morsel Akhundzadeh, in collaboration with the Iranian special services, plotted ""to forcefully change the constitutional structure of the Republic of Azerbaijan and orchestrate armed rebellions with the objective to establish the ""Karima"" state, and to organize assassination attempts on prominent personalities and senior officials,"" the statement reads.  The two men formed clandestine groups on WhatsApp, Telegram and other instant messaging systems, and provided members of the group with a list of government officials and prominent figures, along with their residential and workplace addresses, in order to organize their assassinations.  Azerbaijani media reported that Akhundzadeh intended to send members of the group to Iran, under the guise of religious education, to receive military training.  Last month, Azerbaijani news agencies reported the alleged arrest of the leaders of a group called ""Hosseiniun"" in the Iranian city of Qom.  Tohid Ebrahim Beigli and Orkhan Mamedov are accused by Azerbaijani authorities of planning to establish the ""Karima"" state in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade"" (Hosseinchiler) with 14 Azerbaijani students who were studying in Qom and Mashhad.  The aim of the group was to fight against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli, along with 14 students from the Republic of Azerbaijan who were studying in Qom and Mashhad, formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade,"" with the stated objective of fighting against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  Who is Ruhollah Akhundzadeh?  Ruhollah Akhundzadeh, the deputy of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Following his release, he traveled to Iran in 2020 where he has been actively involved in organizing religious extremist groups closely associated with the Islamic Republic.  The State Security Service of Azerbaijan issued a statement in November last year saying it had conducted an operation against an illegal armed group which operated under the guidance of the Iranian intelligence services. Akhundzadeh was apprehended during the operation.  In the past year alone, Akhundzadeh, with the support of the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic, has reportedly made two attempts to establish an armed group aimed at carrying out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Azerbaijan.  According to the newspaper Mosavat, the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic are secretly promoting religious extremist ideas in Azerbaijan to encourage citizens to participate in military exercises abroad and finance their activities.  Lasting Tensions Between the Two Neighbors  Baku and Tehran have often had strained relations, with Azerbaijan accusing the Islamic Republic of trying to destabilize the country. Azerbaijan also criticizes Iran for allegedly backing Armenia in the long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.  According to the Baku Post, Iranian intelligence agencies attempted to use Azerbaijani citizens to act against Azerbaijan's interests and in favor of Armenia during the 44-day war between the two countries over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.  In turn, Tehran has long accused Baku of fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. The Islamic Republic also fears that Azerbaijani territory could be used for a possible attack against Iran by Israel.  The Azerbaijani authorities strongly reacted to military maneuvers conducted by the Islamic Republic along the Azerbaijan border, calling them provocative and unacceptable.  Tensions between the two neighbors escalated over the past months following a ""terrorist attack"" on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran, the arrest of individuals affiliated with Iranian intelligence services on charges of espionage, the assassination attempt on a member of an Azerbaijani lawmaker, the expulsion of diplomats from both nations, and the opening of an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel.  ""Iran Seeks to Regain Influence"" in the South Caucasus  ""Over the past 30 years, Iran has consistently sought to interfere in Azerbaijan's internal affairs,"" university professor and political analyst Nazem Jafar Soy tells IranWire.  ""This has included sending mullahs to Azerbaijan, influencing the youth of the country through religious teachings in Iran, engaging in espionage, and exploiting the religious sentiments of the Azerbaijani people,"" he added.  But Jafar Soy says that Iran's ""once relatively prominent role in the Caucasus region has diminished"" since the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, with Turkey taking its place.  ""As a result, Iran seeks to regain influence in the region by using threats and creating espionage groups to portray the area as unsafe and reclaim its position in the Caucasus,"" he adds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaXJhbndpcmUuY29tL2VuL3BvbGl0aWNzLzExNjYyNC1jb3VwLXBsb3QtYmxhbWVkLW9uLWlyYW4td2hhdC1kb2VzLXRoZS1pc2xhbWljLXJlcHVibGljLXdhbnQtaW4tYXplcmJhaWphbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Suva"", ""Central"", ""Fiji""}","Wed 17 May 2023 07:18:32","Fiji’s Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka Sunday apologised for his role in orchestrating the 1987 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of then Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, the first Indo-Fijian to lead the country.  “I make this confession on my own behalf and on behalf of all those who took part with me in the military coup on the 14th of May, 1987. We confess our wrongdoings, and we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of the Indo-Fijian community of the time and among them sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of those who were indentured as labourers from India between 1879 and 1916,” Rabuka said in the country’s capital, Suva.  Rabuka, who was then an army lieutenant colonel, entered Fiji’s parliament, arrested Prime Minister Bavadra, and suspended the constitution. The takeover, the first of several military coups in Fiji, was driven by indigenous Fijians’ fear of losing political control to Indo-Fijians, who dominated the country’s economy.  Rabuka’s action had far-reaching and long-term consequences for Fiji, and altered its relationship with the rest of the world, especially India.  The May 1987 coup  On the morning of May 14, 1987, Rabuka, who was accompanied by 10 masked soldiers, stormed the parliament building, herded Bavadra and 27 members of the ruling coalition into a waiting truck, and drove them to an unknown destination.

(Express archive photo)  At a news conference subsequently, Rabuka announced the suspension of the constitution and said he would form a caretaker government until fresh elections are held to “restore civilian rule and go back to democracy”, The Indian Express reported at the time.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, the country’s Governor General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau declared a national emergency and announced he was taking charge of the government under the provisions of Fiji’s British-made Constitution. Fiji was a member of the British Commonwealth (the country has been in and out of the British Commonwealth over the years. It was most recently reinstated as a member in 2014) at the time, Queen Elizabeth II was the head of state, and Penaia Ganilau was officially her representative.  The coup took place a little over a month after an alliance of the National Federation Party and Labour Party won elections that led to the formation of a cabinet dominated by ethnic Indians for the first time since Fiji’s independence from Britain in 1970.  Paper cutting of The Indian Express from May 15, 1987. Paper cutting of The Indian Express from May 15, 1987.  A day after his takeover, Lt Col Rabuka announced he was drafting a new constitution that would guarantee Fiji would never again have an Indian-dominated government (‘No Power for Indians: Rabuka’, The Indian Express, May 16, 1987). He denied discriminating against Indians, and claimed that he was only “looking after the Fijians’ interest”.  Advertisement  On May 19, anti-Indian riots broke out in the country. “[A] crowd of ethnic Fijians ran through the streets of Suva in an hour-long rampage, attacking Indians and Indian-owned shops” despite Rabuka’s appeals for calm, The Indian Express reported on May 20. At least 50 Indians were reported injured in the violence that was provoked by a rally that Indians took out in support of the ousted Prime Minister.  Also in Explained | 25th anniversary of Pokhran-II: India’s journey to become a nuclear power  Rabuka’s second coup  Widespread racial violence followed the military takeover, wrote academic Dr Amba Pande in an article published in Strategic Analysis, a monthly journal of Columbia University (Race and Power Struggle in Fiji). Pande wrote that an attempt by the governor-general to form an advisory council with both Bavadra and Rabuka failed after the ousted Prime Minister refused to participate “on the grounds that the composition of the council was unconstitutional and biased”.  Following weeks of negotiations, in July 1987, plans to reform the constitution were approved, and it was decided that Bavadra and Kamisese Mara — a former Prime Minister popular with indigenous Fijians — would form an interim government.  In response, Rabuka orchestrated a second coup on September 25 of that year. He declared Fiji a republic, and proclaimed himself head of the state, replacing the Queen. Countries around the world condemned these actions and refused to recognise his regime, and India imposed trade sanctions on Fiji.  Advertisement  Under pressure, Rabuka resigned as head of state on December 6, 1987, and Penaia Ganilau became the first President of the Fijian republic. A new constitution was promulgated in 1990, and elections were held two years later.  Background of crisis  The election victory of the Indo-Fijians was only a trigger for Rabuka’s coup. Since independence, the South Pacific Ocean archipelago had been seeing a widening political divide between ethnic Indians and indigenous Fijians.  Advertisement  Indians were brought to Fiji from 1879 onward as “girmitiyas” or indentured labour transported to work in sugar plantations. The majority of these Indians stay back after the indenture system ended and, over time, gained prosperity. The Indian community eventually became the backbone of Fiji’s economic system, and they had, by the 1940s, outnumbered ethnic Fijians in the islands’ population.  Another reason for the Fijians’ resentment was the nature of landholdings. Indigenous Fijians owned more than 83% of the land on the islands, but Indian tenant farmers held most of it on 99-year leases, according to Pande’s article. “Despite the fact that the land was legally made inalienable by the constitution of 1970, the fear of losing it had always been there in the minds of the Fijians,” Pande wrote.  Advertisement  All these insecurities came to a boil after the general elections of 1987, and a section of indigenous Fijians sought to thwart Indo-Fijians from getting political power. Rabuka’s two coups triggered a massive wave of emigration — according to a report published by The Guardian in 2000, around 70,000 Indians fled the country to “escape the oppression”.  Monday’s apology by Rabuka — who was elected Prime Minister in 1992 and then again last year — was not his first for the 1987 coups. He had apologised publicly on the 21st anniversary of the takeover in 2008. “It was a mistake and I admit I was wrong…Staging a coup is something no one should be proud of because you don’t become a hero, so all the copycats should not think they will be heroes,” he said on that occasion, according to a Reuters report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1oaXN0b3J5L2ZpamlzLTE5ODctY291cC13aHktZGlkLXByaW1lLW1pbmlzdGVyLXJhYnVrYS1hcG9sb2dpc2UtdG8tdGhlLWluZG8tZmlqaWFuLWNvbW11bml0eS04NjEzMTgxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Five people are going on trial in Germany on Wednesday over their alleged participation in a plot to kidnap the country’s health minister and overthrow the government in a far-right coup.  Four men, aged 44 to 56, and a woman, 75, are accused of treason and of founding or being members of a terrorist organization.  Federal prosecutors say the group is linked to the Reich Citizens community, which rejects the legitimacy of Germany’s postwar constitution and has similarities to the Sovereign Citizens and QAnon movements in the U.S.  Advertisement  Prosecutors say the five defendants intended to create “conditions similar to civil war” by using explosives to cause nationwide blackouts, then kidnapping Health Minister Karl Lauterbach — a prominent advocate of strict coronavirus measures.  There were no indications that the group, which called itself United Patriots, was close to launching a coup attempt. But prosecutors said the group’s procurement of weapons and money showed they were “dangerous criminals who wanted to implement their plans.”  The men, whose names weren’t released for privacy reasons, were arrested in April last year. Police at the time seized 22 firearms, including a Kalashnikov rifle, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as large sums of cash, gold and silver.  The woman, who was arrested six months later, is alleged to have drafted numerous documents for the group, including an “arrest warrant” for Lauterbach. The retired teacher also wrote letters addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Polish President Andrzej Duda.  Lauterbach told German weekly Der Spiegel that he hopes for a “hard, fair verdict” that would deter others from planning similar plots.  The case is separate from that of the more than two dozen people arrested in December, also on suspicion of planning to topple the government.

"coup","2017-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 03:09:00","1. On the surface, everything looked good early on. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo came out aggressive scoring 14 of the HEAT’s first 17 points. Kyle Lowry scored 13 points in the second quarter. Everything was falling outside the paint. Three. Mid-range. You name it, it was going in. Midway through the second quarter, the score was knotted.  Problem was, the vast majority of the HEAT’s offense was coming from the outside, and the majority of those opportunities were self-created, non-assisted. Boston’s switching scheme wasn’t slowing them down, but it was keeping bodies out of the paint. Unlike against Milwaukee’s drop-back scheme, the jumpers weren’t off the comfortable, walk-on-in variety – Butler’s four mid-range makes in the first quarter were one off his season high for an entire contest. Meanwhile, the Celtics were punishing the paint much as the New York Knicks did in Game 1 of that series. Unlike the Knicks, Boston was actually hitting a few threes. After a few stagnant possessions from the HEAT, the Celtics ran off an 8-0 run capped off by an Al Horford triple, and went into the half up 66-57, outscoring Miami 40-16 in the paint with Marcus Smart posting 10 assists.  Of course, four minutes into the third it was tied because the HEAT just kept hitting all their shots, just as they did against the Bucks, because they stopped turning the ball over, because Adebayo was incredible and because Miami started to earn more points in the paint while preventing them on the other end. By the end of that 46-point quarter – the highest scoring quarter in franchise postseason history – with Miami stringing together multiple threes to close it out, it was HEAT by 12.  Boston isn’t a team to fold. About 90 seconds into the fourth, they had closed it to five on a 7-0 run. As they have so often in this postseason, Miami held out a stiff arm, holding the lead and answering every punch with a made shot. Five minutes to go, the lead remained five, Butler quieting the crowd as he picked off Boston’s cross-court passes. In the end, it was the makes. It had to be the makes. Caleb Martin and Butler putting Miami up 10 with under two minutes to play with another pair of threes essentially decided it, Boston – with just 22 paint points in the second half – coming up short despite multiple chances to make it a one possession game. HEAT take Game 1, 123-116.  2. Coming into this series, it was expected that Boston would likely win the Shot Quality – the actual statistical measurement – category on most nights. They were among the league leaders in catch-and-shoot threes in part because they had so many players who could attack, drive and pass. Outside of the Warriors, if there was a team built to put up a mathematically efficient shot profile every night, it was Boston.  All that said, the way that particular relationship played out in Game 1 was not to expectations. Miami has long been a team that prioritizes keeping the ball out of the paint even if it means giving up some threes, but it was almost as if their scheme had been turned on its head in those first two quarters. The perimeter closeouts were excellent as far as meeting the pass at the shooter and keeping the three-point volume down (13 attempts through two quarters), but Boston was driving those closeouts and getting into the teeth of the defense and through it. Just as it was against the Knicks, allowing 40 paint points in a half is a highly, highly unusual occurrence for this HEAT group.  Shot profile also doesn’t matter if you keep hitting all your shots, and Miami shot 16-of-31 from deep and 11-of-16 on long two-point jumpers. The shots came about in different ways, but this was exactly what Miami did to Milwaukee – make what you get, whatever you get. We don’t have the numbers as of this writing, but Game 1 against Milwaukee was one of the single best shotmaking games – actual percentages over expected percentages based on opportunities – in recent league postseason history. This one will probably rival that, if not exceed it.  3. Due to Boston’s switching, this was always going to be a Butler and Adebayo series. Sure, you can beat switches with slips and double screens. You can induce miscommunications and you can attack the seams left open mid-switch. But at the end of the day you’re going to have to be able to score one-on-one for sustained half-court success, and Butler and Adebayo are the guys who are most reliably going to score one-on-one.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmEuY29tL2hlYXQvbmV3cy9jb3Vwcy10YWtlYXdheXMtaGVhdC1yaWRlLWhpZ2hlc3Qtc2NvcmluZy1xdWFydGVyLWluLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1wb3N0c2Vhc29uLWhpc3RvcnktdG8tZ2FtZS0xLXZpY3RvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Colombia"", ""LasTunas"", ""Cuba""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:00:00","It was a daunting moment last Thursday in Colombia, South America’s longest-running democracy, when retired Colonel John Marulanda, ex-president of the Andean country’s powerful Retired Officers Association (ACORE – Spanish initials), threatened to depose (Spanish) Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro. In a statement directed at Petro, Marulanda said they are going to “defenestrate a guy who was a guerrilla."" Those comments came a day after hundreds of Colombia’s military veterans protested against Petro in Bogota. Since taking office on August 7, 2022, the relationship between former socialist guerrilla Petro, who is Colombia’s first ever leftwing president, and the public forces, which have experienced substantial resignations, has been particularly strained. Since then, fears have emerged that Colombia’s armed forces, a politically influential body with close ties to former hard-right President Alvaro Uribe, will not accept a former socialist guerrilla as president.  The political intrigues and conflict playing out in Bogota, long a focal point for clashes between the extreme left and right, are being fanned by considerable unease in the upper socioeconomic levels of Colombian society over a one-time leftwing revolutionary holding the office of president. As a young man, Petro joined the socialist M19 guerrilla movement, founded after the disputed and allegedly fraudulent 1970 presidential election. During his time with the M19 Petro was imprisoned and according to him tortured. After the group disbanded as part of the March 1990 peace deal - where Petro was a negotiator - struck with the government of President Virgilio Barco, he held various government appointments. Petro then went on to become a congressional representative in 2002 and a senator in 2006. After two earlier failed attempts to win Colombia’s presidency, in 2010 and 2018, Petro finally succeeded during the 2022 election.  Tensions are further heightened in Colombia because of the impact of the fallout from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with the Andean country struggling to recover from spiraling poverty, crime, and violence. By the end of 2021, nearly 40% of Colombians were living in poverty (Spanish) compared to 36% in 2019, while 12% of the population was living in extreme poverty against just under 10% 2 years earlier. Petro’s predecessor President Ivan Duque ignited a tinderbox of simmering community resentment in April 2021 when he announced plans to hike taxes subsequently triggering Colombia-wide violent anti-government protests.  After emerging victorious during the July 2022 presidential run-off, Petro announced his ambitious yet what increasingly appears to be an unachievable plan for total peace. This focuses on obliging the state policy to seek peace with the disparate illegal armed groups engaged in Colombia’s decades-long bloody civil conflict that has claimed 262,000 lives, the vast majority of whom were civilians. It is this low-level asymmetric war which is responsible for much of the violence occurring in the strife-torn country, notably in remote rural regions. As part of that plan, Petro prematurely declared a ceasefire at the start of 2023, but it was not recognized by the numerous illegal armed groups operating in Colombia which continued attacking crucial infrastructure, civilians, and the armed forces. That only heightened tensions with the military and police which have borne much of the brunt of the uptick in violence.  Petro, to the displeasure of the hard-right and many within the armed forces, resumed peace talks with the last remaining leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish initials ELN. His predecessor Duque suspended negotiations (Spanish) with the guerrillas after their January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy claimed 21 lives. The ELN, which was founded in 1964, is believed to have as many as 2,500 combatants making it the second largest illegal armed group in Colombia after the Gulf Clan, a neo-paramilitary group that has an estimated 5,000 fighters. The Gulf Clan emerged in 2006 when senior paramilitary leader Vincente Castaño broke away from the demobilization process of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC – Spanish initials) and rearmed a paramilitary group. After clashing with a variety of other illegal armed groups the Gulf Clan emerged as Colombia’s most powerful criminal organization. There are also various bands of combatants from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) who didn’t accept the 2016 peace accord with Bogota.  There have been frequent scandals and allegations concerning Colombia’s police and army’s involvement in human rights abuses, illegal detention, torture, extrajudicial killings, and rampant corruption over the last two decades. The most severe instances occurred during the 2021 national strike where thousands of Colombians took to the streets to protest against President Duque’s proposed tax hikes, soaring corruption, and economic mismanagement. The crisis of impunity among Colombia’s public forces is so severe that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR – Spanish initials) expressed concerns over endemic police violence in Colombia in 2021. Petro’s desire to secure peace, eliminate corruption, and end the impunity enjoyed by Colombia’s armed forces and police when it comes to human rights abuses saw him appoint controversial prominent anti-corruption investigator Iván Velásquez as Minister of Defense. That further inflamed tensions with Colombia’s armed forces.  This is all occurring at a time when there is considerable rumor and innuendo about a rightwing campaign by various former senior security officials as well as business leaders and supporters of former President Uribe to undermine Petro’s presidency. While Petro has been able to maintain an overall semblance of a functional relationship with Colombia’s Armed Forces despite evident tensions, his relationship with retired members of the military has been strained and antagonistic. Regardless of the issues discussed, Colombia’s active military has, thus far, shown no interest in Marulanda’s comments. Petro ridiculed the statement and warned the Colombian people of the threat writing via Twitter “Why are they conspiring for a coup d’état? Because they are terrified that we will put an end to impunity.” Indeed, the retired colonel later walked back his comments claiming that he was referring to the President of Peru Pedro Castillo, who was ousted from office during the first week of December 2022 to be later arrested and detained.  While a coup certainly appears unlikely with Marulanda’s comments appearing to amount to nothing more than saber rattling, Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office has opened an investigation (Spanish) to determine whether a crime has been committed. They have also inflamed tensions at a crucial time for Petro whose controversial health reforms, aimed at establishing a centralized government-monitored payment system to reduce corruption and improve care, were rejected. After the clashes over his health reform proposals, the president replaced seven ministers in his cabinet who were seen by many as moderates. There are also accusations that retired military members protested to create a distraction from the explosive testimony from paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. That includes claims of close ties between paramilitary forces, the Army, and police as well as their participation in extrajudicial killings.

Advertising Read more  Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.  Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.  A single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.  Myanmar’s military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists.""  “The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate,” Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to “step up and stop the flow of arms” with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmar’s military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.  The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmar’s domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.  State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.  Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscow’s state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.  Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.  “Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar,” the report said.  Andrews said he had informed the countries named in the report of his findings ahead of publication.

As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help. He said at least 160 people were killed, including many children.  In addition, the machine guns and bombs used in the attacks included parts and materials from companies located in Singapore, China and Thailand, he said.  Myanmar is mired in strife because of a political crisis unleashed when the military took power. Its takeover prompted widespread peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with deadly force, triggering armed resistance throughout the country that the army has been unable to quell. Andrews said at least 22,000 political prisoners have been detained since the coup, at least 3.500 civilians have been killed and 1.5 million people have been forcibly displaced.  The report documents over 12,500 purchases that were shipped directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working for the military from Feb. 1, 2021, when the military ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, until December 2022, Andrews said at a news conference.  He said the volume and diversity of equipment the military received was “staggering,” ranging from fighter jets and attack helicopters and drones to advanced missile systems, tank upgrades, sophisticated communications equipment, radar complexes and components for naval ships.  Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine , said he had received “highly credible and detailed information from confidential sources” identifying the major networks and companies involved in the arms trade with Myanmar.  The report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council identifies $406 million in weapons and material that went to the Myanmar military from Russia, $267 million from China, $254 million from Singapore, $51 million from India and $28 million from Thailand.  Since the coup, the report said, 28 Russian private and state-owned companies have transferred fighter jets and their spare parts, advanced missile systems, reconnaissance and attack drones, attack helicopters and other systems to the junta.  The report identified 41 private and state-owned companies registered in China and Hong Kong that supplied the Myanmar military with an extensive array of arms, equipment and raw materials between October 2021 and December 2022, including advanced trainer jets, light attack aircraft, tank upgrades and repairs for Chinese fighter jets, which make up the Myanmar Air Force fleet, the report said.  They also supplied aluminum, copper, steel, rubber and lubricants for use in Myanmar’s domestic weapons manufacturing, it said.  Unlike with Russia and China, and to a lesser extent India, Andrews said he received no information indicating that the governments of Singapore or Thailand approved or transferred arms to the Myanmar military.  He said companies in Singapore are of critical importance to the junta, having supplied spare parts, raw materials and manufacturing equipment, especially for Myanmar’s KaPaSa weapons factories. Thai companies have done the same, the report said.  Twelve Thai companies were established after the coup, many by sanctioned arms networks already operating in Singapore, which suggests arms dealers may be looking at Thailand as an alternative route to avoid scrutiny, the report said.  Andrews said Singapore has a policy prohibiting the transfer of arms to Myanmar, and he reported his detailed findings to the government, which he said expressed appreciation for the information and indicated it was reviewing the effectiveness of its export controls.  If the Singapore government stopped all arms shipments to the Myanmar military, he said, the impact on the ability of the junta to manufacture arms “would be significant.”  Andrews said China and Russia both criticized the report, saying it went beyond his human rights mandate, and accused him of “vilifying legitimate arms trade.” He countered that “identifying the sources of gross human rights violations and atrocities, including crimes against humanity and war crimes, is within my mandate and in my moral obligation.”  Andrews said India responded to the report’s findings that 22 state-owned and private firms shipped a coastal surveillance system, a remote-controlled weapons system, components from an ammunition and missile manufacturer, and 122 mm howitzer barrels by saying these involved contracts with the previous civilian government.  A U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted on June 18, 2021, calls upon all member states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar, but unlike a Security Council resolution it is not legally binding. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Switzerland have imposed sanctions on arms dealers providing support to the military.  Andrews said the sanctions weren’t coordinated and have been largely ineffective. He called for countries to impose coordinated sanctions that target the networks that procure weapons and also the junta’s finances.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215YW5tYXItd2VhcG9ucy1ydXNzaWEtY2hpbmEtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLTA1YmQyNmJjNTRkZjhiYzY4MmVlMTE0M2YwZjM2YTVl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2021-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 01:39:40","UN expert says Russia, China and companies in Singapore top list of those sending weapons to military accused of abuses.  Myanmar’s military has imported arms worth at least $1bn since seizing power in February 2021, despite “overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for atrocity crimes”, a United Nations expert has said.  Most of the weapons came from Russia, China and companies in Singapore, Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar said in a report [PDF] released on Wednesday in New York.  The exports cover weapons, dual-use technology and materials used to manufacture weapons exported from the day of the coup on February 1, 2021, to December 2022.  “These weapons, and the materials to manufacture more of them, have continued to flow uninterrupted to the Myanmar military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for atrocity crimes,” said the report. It identified more than 12,500 unique purchases or recorded shipments directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working on the military’s behalf.  “The diversity and volume of goods provided to the Myanmar military since the coup is staggering,” it added, saying the military had taken delivery of weapons and equipment from fighter jets to drones, communications equipment and components for navy ships.  Myanmar was plunged into crisis by the coup, which triggered mass protests. A deadly crackdown ignited armed resistance, with ethnic armed groups that have long been fighting the military joining forces with so-called People’s Defence Forces (PDFs) to fight against the generals.  The PDFs are aligned with the National Unity Government (NUG) established by legislators removed in the coup and others opposed to military rule.      The UN and rights groups have accused the military of human rights abuses in its attempts to suppress opposition, saying some incidents may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  In his report to the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva, Andrews pointed to last month’s attack on Pazigyi village in the central Sagaing region, where reports indicate near-daily confrontations between resistance forces and soldiers.  As some 300 villagers, including children, gathered to mark the opening of a new NUG office, a Russian-made Yak-130 fighter jet dropped two 250kg (550 pounds) bombs on the crowd.  “The ordinance detonated with deadly impact – ripping the bodies of men, women, and children open, turning their skin to ash, and inflicting critical shrapnel wounds,” the report said.  Amid the carnage, the attack continued as two Mi-35 attack helicopters fired on the survivors and those trying to help the wounded.  At least 160 people were killed and the remains of only 59 people were identifiable, the report noted.  “The attack is yet another example of the Myanmar junta’s probable crimes against humanity and war crimes against the people of Myanmar,” it said.  No doubt about buyer  According to the report, Russian entities were the source of $406m of the arms and related-equipment, China entities $254m and Singapore-operating entities $254m.  Armaments were also sent from entities in India ($51m) and Thailand ($28m).  State-owned entities in Russia, China and India were among those Andrews identified as exporters.  “Over $947 million of arms-related trade identified went directly to entities controlled by the Myanmar military—e.g., the Directorate of Procurement, Directorate of Defense Industries, or specific branches of the military like the Myanmar Air Force or Tatmadaw Basic Training School,” the report said.  “This means that the military itself was listed as recipient on trade-related documents, eliminating any doubt of who the end recipient would be.”      Andrews said he had shared his findings with the relevant governments.  In their response, Russia and China accused the rapporteur of going beyond his mandate and “vilifying legitimate arms trade”.  India, meanwhile, said the arms contracts involving state-owned companies had been signed by a previous government.  Andrews noted that he had found no information indicating that entities owned or controlled by the governments of Singapore or Thailand, or the governments themselves, had approved or transferred the arms to the Myanmar military, and that it seemed arms dealers were using the territories to carry out their business “specifically the banking and shipping sectors”.  As a result of the report, the Singapore government indicated it was reviewing the effectiveness of its export controls, Andrews said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTgvbXlhbm1hci1taWxpdGFyeS1oYXMtaW1wb3J0ZWQtd2VhcG9ucnktd29ydGgtMWJuLXNpbmNlLWNvdXDSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xOC9teWFubWFyLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWhhcy1pbXBvcnRlZC13ZWFwb25yeS13b3J0aC0xYm4tc2luY2UtY291cA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-15","22:00:00","{""Ankara"", ""Ankara"", ""Turkey""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:55:00","Kemal Kilicdaroglu, presidential candidate of Turkey's main opposition alliance, walks at the Republican People's Party (CHP) headquarters on election night in Ankara, Turkey May 15, 2023. REUTERS/Yves Herman  Tayyip Erdogan's presidential challenger appealed to young Turkish voters on Tuesday to support him in a May 28 election runoff, as he seeks to prevent the president extending his rule of NATO-member Turkey into a third decade.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the candidate of a six-party opposition alliance, won 45% support in Sunday's vote while Erdogan got 49.5%, falling just short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff of a vote seen as a referendum on his autocratic rule.  Turkish assets weakened for a second day, especially government and corporate bonds and banking stocks, as investors bet that Erdogan would win another five-year term and continue his unorthodox economic policies.  However, Kilicdaroglu, 74, sought to rally his supporters, many now downcast, putting a positive spin on the outcome.  ""A message of change emerged from the ballot box. Those who want change in this country are now more than those that don't want it,"" Kilicdaroglu said, referring to Erdogan falling short of 50%, in a series of tweets addressed to ""dear young people"".  In a parliamentary election held simultaneously, Erdogan's AK Party and its nationalist and Islamist partners won 322 of 600 seats in the new parliament, achieving a majority that will enable him to argue that voting for him will ensure stability.  'DARK TUNNEL'  Kilicdaroglu appealed to young voters with references to the cost-of-living crisis, which in Turkey has been much exacerbated by Erdogan's insistence on cutting interest rates, causing a sharp slide in the lira and soaring inflation.  ""You don't have enough money for anything,"" he said. ""Your joy of life was taken away. Whereas youth should be free of worry.""  ""You won't get your youth back again. We have 12 days to get out of this dark tunnel...,"" Kilicdaroglu added.  Kilicdaroglu has vowed to revive democracy after years of state repression, return to orthodox economic policies, empower institutions that lost autonomy under Erdogan and rebuild frayed ties with the West.  The vote is being closely followed in Washington, Europe and across the region, where Erdogan has asserted Turkish power. He has also strengthened ties to Russia, putting strain on Ankara's traditional alliance with the United States.  The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called on Turkey on Tuesday to fix shortcomings in its election process that were identified by European observers.  In Sunday's presidential vote, nationalist candidate Sinan Ogan came third with 5.2% support and there will be much focus now on how his supporters will vote on May 28.  In a potential boost to Erdogan, Ogan told Reuters in an interview on Monday he would only endorse Kilicdaroglu in the runoff if the latter ruled out any concessions to a pro-Kurdish party, parliament's third largest.  That party, the HDP, backs Kilicdaroglu but is accused of ties to Kurdish militants, which it denies.  Opinion polls had shown Erdogan, 69, trailing Kilicdaroglu, but Sunday's outcome suggested he and his Islamist-rooted AK Party were able to rally conservative voters despite Turkey's economic woes.  Kilicdaroglu and his alliance want to restore a parliamentary system of government and scrap the powerful executive presidency introduced by Erdogan.  The AKP came first in Sunday's parliamentary vote with 267 lawmakers, followed by Kilicdaroglu's secularist CHP on 169 and the pro-Kurdish party on 61.  The prospect of five more years of Erdogan's rule will upset civil rights activists campaigning for reforms to undo the damage they say he has done to Turkey's democracy. He says he respects democracy.  Thousands of political prisoners and activists could be released if the opposition prevails.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkYml6L3BvbGl0aWNzL2VyZG9nYW4tcml2YWwtYXBwZWFscy10dXJraXNoLXlvdXRoLWFoZWFkLXJ1bm9mZi12b3RlLTYzMjgzONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Malaysian ministry has announced that the stranded workers have been hired successfully by a new company that has offered to pay their salaries according to the minimum wage, reports Free Malaysia Today.  ""The human resources minister will give details of their employment soon,"" the source told FMT.  Yesterday, the workers gathered at the Bangladeshi High Commission due to the growing frustration over their woes, says FMT.  Abraham, a spokesman for the workers, revealed that they had not been given jobs upon their arrival in February or paid any allowance in the last four months.  ""They came here and their accommodation is not appropriate. Some of the places they were asked to stay at do not have proper sanitation and facilities. Their situation is very bad.  ""Besides this, they have no jobs, no money, and no food to survive,"" he told FMT.  According to Abraham, as many as 600 Bangladeshi migrant workers came into the country through four companies believing they would get jobs as housekeepers in Genting Highlands.  The Malaysian labour department released a statement saying it would sanction firms and withdraw licences from recruitment agencies involved in hiring migrant workers who found themselves stranded without jobs after arrival. They would also act against recruitment companies that misused government quotas and licences for hiring migrant workers.  Investigation involving companies related to the matter has already begun and the findings will be announced soon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkL21hbGF5c2lhbi1sYWJvdXItZGVwdC1oZWxwcy0xMjAtc3RyYW5kZWQtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaGktd29ya2Vycy1maW5kLW5ldy1qb2JzLTYzMjY1NNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3dvcmxkL21hbGF5c2lhbi1sYWJvdXItZGVwdC1oZWxwcy0xMjAtc3RyYW5kZWQtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaGktd29ya2Vycy1maW5kLW5ldy1qb2JzLTYzMjY1ND9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is despite council claims that a water leak is “entirely unrelated” to the extra traffic.  Southern Water chief operating officer Bob Collington wrote to Brighton MP Caroline Lucas saying that heavy vehicles “may have played a part” in a mains failure which has blocked Upper North Street for repairs.  However, Brighton and Hove City Council has repeatedly denied that the extra bus traffic caused the damage despite similar leaks popping up on other diversion routes.  In the letter to Ms Lucas, Mr Collington said: “The additional traffic or weight of vehicles coupled with the failing road surface may have played a part in the mains fitting failure, however, this would be difficult to confirm.”  He said Southern Water had worked with the council to agree a longer closure to the road, which The Argus understands has been extended to June 9.  MOST READ:  Repair works on the road were originally scheduled to be done by May 5 but remain unfinished.  The letter also said that between 2019 and 2023 only one leak had previously been reported on the road.  A concerned member of the public said: “Days and days go by with no trucks or workers and there is garbage in some of the holes.  “This has been very disruptive. It’s still a big problem but often there’s no one there.”  Previously, the council said the original water leak had “nothing to do with the recent use of the road as a bus diversion” during the improvement works in Western Road.  The council doubled down on the remarks after a similar leak was spotted on a new diversion route in Montpelier Road, saying the leaks were “entirely unrelated” to the buses.  Services heading eastbound in Western Road are currently being diverted along Montpelier Road and through Seven Dials before returning to their normal routes at Churchill Square.

Argentina World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez is all set to visit Kolkata in his tour of India in July. It is expected to be a two-day tour from July 4-5. The Aston Villa no.1 remains a major favourite in the city after starring for the Albieceleste at the Qatar World Cup and playing a pivotal role over their win.  Martinez is currently playing for the Villans in the final stretch of their Premier League campaign. Villa are pushing to secure qualification for a European competition next year and the Argentine goalkeeper is focused on ensuring that happens.  Emiliano Martinez to visit Mohun Bagan Club in July  Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan have confirmed that Martinez has promised to visit their club on July 4, as part of his Kolkata tour. The Mariners have managed to secure an agreement with the World Cup-winning goalkeeper to pay them a visit when he arrives at the City of Joy.  In an official statement, Mohun Bagan General Secretary Debashis Dutta confirmed that Martinez will visit the club tent in Maidan, Kolkata on the evening of the 4th of July. Further details of the programme in which the Argentine will be celebrated is going to be revealed in due course.  Martinez will join group of legends who have visited the Mohun Bagan Ground during their tour of Kolkata in the past. The likes of Pele and Diego Maradona both visited the tent in the past and the Mariners have managed another major coup in the World Cup-winning goalkeeper. It is said that Emi will kick his autographed footballs into the gallery as well.  Where else will Martinez visit?  In his promotional visit to India, Martinez will spend two days in Kolkata in July. He will also meet West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as well as former India cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly during his visit.  He’ll also be a chief guest for a charity match that will take place at the Mohun Bagan Ground during his visit. Moreover, Martinez will also visit some other heritage sights in Kolkata. He’ll travel to Santosh Mitra Square, which has earned its fame for hosting one of the city’s biggest Durja Puja festivities.  Also, he’ll visit Sreebhumi Sporting Club, where a Diego Maradona statue is located at. He could even visit some other famous places in the city, but that is yet to be confirmed.  Martinez was the Golden Glove winner in the 2022 Qatar World Cup, having kept three clean sheets.

Photo / Otago Daily Times  The biggest local council drama of the year has come to a surprising end with Gore District Council mayor Ben Bell surviving a vote of no-confidence raised by his councillors.  In fact, in Tuesday’s extraordinary meeting of council, none of the councillors at the table even voted to advance the motion to hold a vote - despite seven of the district’s 10 councillors last week asking Bell to resign.  It was a sudden end to a drama that dates back to last year’s local elections, where tensions between the newly-elected Bell and his chief executive Stephen Parry reportedly started to fray shortly after Bell’s narrow election victory.  Speaking to On the Tiles - Local Edition host Georgina Campbell, NZ Herald reporter Kurt Bayer said that the “extraordinary extraordinary meeting” had a packed public gallery, more media in attendance than usual, and protesters out front in support of Bell, all waiting for the motion to advance to the vote of no confidence.  “When it came to the big motion, there was silence. Nobody wanted to move the motion, and it died a death right there. That resulted in some big cheers from the public gallery and applause, and a pretty relieved-looking Mayor Bell.”  Bayer said that the move wasn’t a total surprise, as the motion was sold as being a symbolic move to try and change the situation and ease the tensions around the council table.  The intense national attention on the council and the town likely led to a change of heart as well.  “The attention was plainly unwarranted by the town. Yesterday and in the days leading up to it, they’ve talked a lot about ‘the Gore Way’. It’s a pretty conservative farming region, mainland types, so they just want to crack on with things and not be in the national headlights where this is played out. It goes against all of that.  “I would say it’s definitely played into things, whether it made them back down from a coup. I think there was a lot of pressure behind the scenes to sort it out.”  One motion to write to Local Government New Zealand and seek support was supported unanimously, but Bayer said that despite the no-confidence motion failing, there are still big questions about what will change with the central frayed relationship.  “One key figure in all of this, the CEO Parry, wasn’t at Tuesday’s meeting,” Bayer said. “That’s the real key one, I think. Parry, who’s been there 20-plus years running that council, he had a six-term mayor, Tracy Hicks, who he had been working with. And then he got this young out-of-towner, 24-year-old, coming in.  “So they have admitted themselves to a very strained relationship, so how they can work together will remain to be seen.”  Listen to the full episode for more about the Gore District Council drama.

Mohammed Ali, 39, woke to “panicked screams” from his girls, aged seven and 12, as robbers burst through his front door with machetes, a meat cleaver and a brick. The HGV driver first saw two of the intruders on the stairs of his semi-detached four-bed home as another held a knife against his daughters’ throats in their living room. And when his son emerged from his upstairs bedroom seconds later, one of the men chilling yelled “Kill him! Kill him!” before advancing towards the 18-year-old. Mohammed said he pushed the lad back into his bedroom and ran to a bathroom, where they took refuge while the robbers hacked at the doors with their machetes. After five minutes, the brutes finally fled the property and stole his white Seat Leon car from his driveway when they found his keys. Mohammed, who didn’t know why his home was targeted, said he had been left “broken” by the incident - adding he felt like he’d “failed” his family. He said: “My daughter said one of them had a knife and he was saying, ‘It’s all your dad’s fault, be f*cking quiet,’ and was putting a knife to her neck. “They all had gloves and everything, but you could see their eyes through the balaclava – and their voice, I could never forget it. “I’ve not slept since. My family is broken. My kids wouldn’t come home. “It was my daughter’s birthday yesterday, and literally everything is spoiled and I don’t know what to do or what to say to them. I feel like I’ve failed them.” Mohammed said he'd gone to bed at 9.30 pm on May 9, leaving his youngest son, who is five, and two daughters watching the TV at their home in Oldham, Grtr. Manchester. His make-up artist wife Michelle Dunkley, 40, had forgotten her keys when she left the house for work in the evening so he’d unlocked the door before heading upstairs. But at 11 pm, he heard one of his daughters utter a high-pitched scream before finding two masked men on the stairs holding metre-long machetes. He said: “It wasn’t a scream where the kids were fighting. This was a panicked scream, a worried scream. I knew as a parent this was not normal. “As I was trying to get down the stairs, I was faced by three guys in balaclavas. Two were on the stairs, one at the bottom, and one had my kids downstairs. “I started screaming: “Get out! Get out!”. They started swearing at me. My son had the room next to the stairs, and when he came out, they said: “Kill him! kill him!” “I pushed him into his room and closed the door, and they started coming up the stairs. I went to the bathroom, which was right behind me. “I was just screaming: “Make sure they don’t get to you!” “They started hacking at the doors with the machetes, and while they were hacking it, the third guy was ransacking my house.” Mohammed said he spent a terrifying five minutes holding the door shut, hoping the men wouldn’t break through. And when he finally realised they had made their way down the stairs, he heard the rev of his car engine and realised they were trying to steal his car. He added: “I was still half asleep. I was dazed and in a panic and I didn’t know if they’d got my son or my other kids downstairs. “Once my car started and they were driving off, I gave chase then went inside and saw my kids were alright.” Mohammed said his children were thankfully unharmed despite their trauma, and besides his vehicle, the men only took a box of his daughter's miniature dolls. But after he shared footage of the robbery on social media, he said another family in nearby Rochdale reported the same gang had attacked them just an hour later. The disturbed dad said he had reported the attack to Greater Manchester Police but didn’t think they were taking the incident seriously. He said: “It’s absolutely disgraceful. I left it with the police. But it’s like they’re not bothered. “They will only take action when someone is seriously hurt or dead but I don’t want that on my conscious.” Greater Manchester Police have been approached for comment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2RyaXZlci1sZWFkcy1wb2xpY2UtaGlnaC1zcGVlZC0wODM2MjcwMTUuaHRtbNIBUGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvZHJpdmVyLWxlYWRzLXBvbGljZS1oaWdoLXNwZWVkLTA4MzYyNzAxNS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2017-04-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 13:09:34","Turkey knows a thing or two about being on the doorstep of the European Union.  The country of almost 85 million people holds the unfortunate record of the longest process to join the bloc: 36 years – and counting. No other candidate state in Eastern Europe or the Western Balkans comes even close to matching Turkey's protracted path to EU membership.  In fact, since Turkey submitted its official application on 14 April 1987 to be part of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC), 16 countries have seen their bids green-lighted, making Ankara's omission even more glaring.  After a continued succession of ups and downs, promises and threats, it has become apparent that Turkey's accession is a unique case of policy-making that Brussels has not quite learned how to manage.  From Atatürk to Hallstein  To understand Turkey's EU ambitions, we must go all the way back to the days of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the revolutionary leader who resisted the country's partition in the aftermath of World War I and forced the victorious Allies to negotiate favourable terms under the Treaty of Lausanne.  This paved the way for the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923 as a one-party parliamentary system with a president, Atatürk himself, as head of state.  Atatürk then launched an intense and rapid series of reforms to build a modern, Westernised country: in the span of a decade, the newly-formed republic saw the abolition of the Caliphate, the introduction of a Latin-script alphabet, a raft of European-inspired laws, drastic changes in dressing codes and the enactment of secularism in the constitution.  The radical transformation paid off. In 1949, Turkey was among the first countries to join the Council of Europe, the Strasbourg-based human rights organisation. In 1952, it became a member of NATO, the transatlantic military alliance created in direct opposition to the Soviet Union.  Story continues  By then, Ankara had set its sights on the nascent project of European integration in Western Europe. In 1959, the country applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC), a request granted four years later.  ""Turkey is part of Europe,"" declared Walter Hallstein, the president of the EEC Commission, while celebrating the signature of the association agreement in September 1963.  ""It is an event without parallel in the history of the influence exerted by European culture and politics. I would even say that we sense in it a certain kinship with the most modern of European developments: the unification of Europe.""  But a first major roadblock was erected in the summer of 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the northern part of Cyprus in response to a coup d'état sponsored by the Greek military junta. The conflict split the island in two, a division that still looms large over Turkey's European dreams.  A long-awaited declaration  Nevertheless, the association agreement provided Ankara with a solid foundation to gradually move forward.  In 1987, Turkey formally submitted its application to join the EEC, then made up of 12 members, including Greece. At the time, Turkey's GDP per capita was $1,700 – a far cry from the over $16,000 in both Germany and France.  The huge economic gap, coupled with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany and persistently poor relations with Cyprus and Greece, slowed down Ankara's bid.  During this time, Turkey was expected to carry out additional reforms to meet the so-called Copenhagen criteria, the fundamental rules that determine a country's eligibility to join the EU. The criteria, laid down in 1993, impose high standards on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the protection of minorities and an open market economy.  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (pictured centre) is considered the founding father of the Republic of Turkey. - AP/AP1932  In the meantime, Brussels offered Ankara an intermediate step in the form of a customs union for the trade of goods other than agriculture, coal and steel, which became fully operational in early 1996.  It wasn't until December 1999 when EU leaders, during a European Council in Helsinki, unanimously declared Turkey a candidate country, opening the door for Ankara to join their ranks on an equal footing.  ""Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States,"" the leaders wrote in their joint conclusions.  The declaration was not merely rhetorical: it gave Turkey access to millions of EU funds in pre-accession assistance.  The absorption capacity  The 2004 enlargement saw the EU move decisively Eastwards and welcome a total of 10 new members, many of which had been subject to the iron fist of the Soviet Union.  For Ankara, it was an awkward affair: the country had submitted its bid well before any of the newcomers, including Cyprus, and was still waiting for the accession process to kick off.  In 2005, the Council finally adopted the framework for negotiations, a nine-page document peppered with references to the rule of law, the EU's ""absorption capacity,"" the importance of ""good neighbourly relations"" and the possible suspension of talks.  ""The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. These negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand,"" the document says.  ""If Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership, it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.""  The framework served as the main guidelines for the European Commission, which was tasked with steering the negotiations. The talks are split into 35 chapters, a highly complex undertaking that is meant to perfectly align the candidate with all EU rules.  The chapter on science and research was the first one to be opened in 2006 and was provisionally concluded that very same year. In the decade that followed, Turkey, under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, managed to open an additional 15 chapters.  But none were closed.  Total standstill  The 2000s marked a period of impressive economic growth for Turkey: its GDP per capita more than tripled, from $3,100 in 2001 to $10,615 in 2010, while services rapidly expanded thanks to sectors such as transport, tourism and finance, deepening the country's modernisation.  Still, the evolution was not enough to overcome tensions in the Mediterranean and the growing reticence among EU leaders, some of whom began suggesting a full-time membership could be replaced by a ""privileged partnership"" – a big no for Ankara.  ""Between accession and (special) partnership, which Turkey says it does not accept, there is a path of equilibrium that we can find,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in 2011. ""The best way of getting out of what risks being a deadlock is to find a compromise.""  In response to cautionary words coming from Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Erdoğan raised the stakes and said he expected accession to be completed by 2023 to coincide with the republic's 100th anniversary. The migration crisis of 2015-2016 gave Turkey political leverage as the country standing between the bloc and millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees.  But things went sour after the July 2016 coup d'état attempt, a critical episode that led Erdoğan to strengthen his grip on power and consolidate what critics decried as a one-man rule.  In November of that year, Members of the European Parliament approved a resolution blasting the ""disproportionate repressive measures"" introduced under the state of emergency and calling for a ""temporary freeze"" on accession talks.  Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had a complex relation with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. - FRITZ REISS/2006 AP  The 2017 referendum to install a unitary presidential system granting the head of state vast executive powers further undermined Ankara's application and fuelled criticism from EU officials and lawmakers, with some even questioning if Turkey could still be considered an eligible candidate according to the Copenhagen criteria.  The fast deterioration culminated in June 2018 when member states put negotiations on hold.  ""The Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union,"" said the conclusions from a meeting in June 2018. ""Turkey's accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing.""  Since then, progress has been almost non-existent.  Freed from the expectation of having to meet EU standards, Erdoğan has ramped up his denunciations against the West, ordered controversial drilling operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and maintained active ties with Vladimir Putin despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Ties with Brussels have gone so awry that Turkey, which technically speaking is still a candidate country, is now suspected of helping Russia evade EU sanctions.  The 2022 enlargement report released by the European Commission offered a sombre assessment of where things stand now.  ""The Turkish government has not reversed the negative trend in relation to reform, despite its repeated commitment to EU accession,"" the report reads. ""The EU's serious concerns on the continued deterioration of democracy, the rule of law, fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary have not been addressed.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYnJpZWYtaGlzdG9yeS10dXJrZXlzLWxvbmctdG9ydHVvdXMtMTMwOTM0ODIzLmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL3VrLm5ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvYnJpZWYtaGlzdG9yeS10dXJrZXlzLWxvbmctdG9ydHVvdXMtMTMwOTM0ODIzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1973-09-11","11:00:00","{""Santiago"", ""Metropolitana"", ""Chile""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:33:08","Journalist Marc Cooper went to Chile in 1971 as a young radical student. Within a year he was working as translator to elected Socialist President Salvador Allende. In September 1973, 50 years ago, the Chilean military and police, backed by the CIA, conspired to overthrow Allende and establish a brutal military dictatorship that lasted 17 years. Thousands were killed and tortured; tens of thousands were exiled.  The following, excerpted with permission from Cooper’s book “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir,” courtesy of Verso Books, details how Cooper was caught in the sweeping violence of the coup, how he survived it and how he escaped Chile eight days later. Truthdig will host a livestream event with Marc Cooper and Suzi Weissman on Wed. May 17 at noon (PDT) — click here for more information.  7 a.m., Tuesday September 11 1973  The fledgling Santiago sun and the transparent sky, the fresh spring chill in the air and the blossoming jacaranda made that Chilean morning glorious. As I stood in the yard of my friend Melvin’s suburban house in Santiago and glanced at the lingering snowcaps on the Andes towering right behind me, as I sucked the fragrant, misty air into my lungs, I resolved I would, from that moment forward, make a sea change in my life. Quit smoking, cut back on drinking, get to bed before 3 a.m. and start rising earlier so as to enjoy more frequently these morning wonders.  I had gotten up early because my Chilean residency visa expired that day and I needed to renew it. For a year now I had been working as a translator to Salvador Allende, and in this capacity I was scheduled to travel with him the next week.  I knew that presidential translator status would afford me little advantage in navigating Santiago’s byzantine bureaucracy. Renewing my visa would still take the entire morning. And getting an Argentine visa so I could travel with Allende to Buenos Aires for the inauguration of the new Argentine president would take the rest of the day. An early start was imperative.  Taxis had become harder to come by as many of the cab companies had joined the work stoppage led by the Truckers’ Association — a group floated with CIA dollars. Retail merchants, doctors, lawyers and almost everyone more elevated than manual workers and farmers had joined the stoppage. In daily entreaties, they pleaded with the armed forces to do away with the popularly-elected President Allende and restore Chile to Business-As-Usual.  Indeed, Chile had already pitched itself into a dizzying dance of chaos and blood. As Allende’s reforms deepened, as he nationalized the American copper mines and the telephone company, as large rural estates were handed over to their sharecroppers, as wages soared and unions gained a voice in national affairs, as rents were lowered and taxes on the rich increased, the political Right and eventually the Center jettisoned their attachment to the rule of law. Opposition groups fielded chain-swinging thugs. Oil pipelines were dynamited. Industrial production was sabotaged. The wealthy hoarded food and other consumer goods and then complained loudly about the resulting shortages.  Just a week previous to this morning, on September 4, the Chilean Left held its last great public gathering to commemorate the third anniversary of Allende’s election. While the president stood granite-faced on a balcony from early afternoon till late at night, more than half a million Chilean workers marched before him, voicing the nearly unanimous chant: “We want guns! We want guns!” It was a horrible, wrenching moment, one permanently seared in my consciousness. Yes, guns. But what guns? From where? My friends and I walked home that evening with a dark foreboding. The end was surely near.  President Allende and General Pinochet, seen together before the coup. Photo by AFP  In the seven days that followed, the Right drew the noose tighter. Commerce and transport ground to a halt. The night before September 11, the transport stoppage had waylaid me and my girlfriend at Melvin’s house. We had gone out as a foursome, wound up snacking at Melvin’s, and got stranded without a way back to my downtown apartment.  My only chance of transportation that morning came from my friends at RadioTaxi 33. Militant revolutionaries, the drivers there had long ago seized the company from its conservative owners and had turned the place into the most efficient cab service in Santiago. And when the drivers weren’t working their shifts, they would volunteer as drivers and messengers for the most powerful workers’ council in Santiago, the Cordon Vicuña McKenna.  After a 45 minute wait on the corner, I became concerned. I went back to the house to call the cab company again but, inexplicably, the phone lines were now permanently busy. I walked back to the corner and eventually was able to flag down a passing cab.  The driver, pale and harried, rolled down the window. “Can you take me downtown?” I asked.  “Downtown?”  “Yeah, to the immigration office,” I answered.  With a classic Chilean understatement, the cabbie replied: “But, sir, there are problems downtown.”  “Problems?”  “Yes, problems,” he said, refusing to be more specific. After all, these were highly polarized times. You never knew who you were talking to. One person’s problem was another person’s liberation. But a sinking feeling in my gut told me the worst was upon us.  Mustering my own diplomatic skills, I asked: “Problems, you say? Problems with men in uniform, you mean?”  “Yes, sir, problems with men in uniform,” the cabbie said. But now, the fear of the future already imprinted on him, he took what he probably knew would be his last foray into freedom for some time and added: “Yes, the fucking fascists are overthrowing the government.”  7:55 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Everyone else in the house was still asleep. I switched on the massive Grundig radio and waited impatiently for the tubes to heat up. As the audio came alive I turned the dial and confirmed the cabbie’s report: virtually every station was playing the same military march.  I stopped the dial on Radio Corporación, the station of the Socialist party. Allende was speaking, a nervous inflection in his voice. His words made material the nightmares that had haunted us for months: “This is the president of the republic speaking from La Moneda Palace. Confirmed reports indicate that a sector of the navy has isolated and occupied the port city of Valparaiso, which means an uprising against the government is under way…Under these circumstances, I call upon the workers of the country to occupy your workplaces…but I urge you to stay calm…At the moment there have been on extraordinary troop movements in the capital…I am here defending the government that represents the will of the people…”  On just about every other radio station a stern-voiced announcer suddenly materialized. By order of the military junta, he said, all stations were immediately to link up to the armed forces network or “they will be bombarded.” The names of the four commanders making up the junta were then read: leading the national police — the carabineros — was a general, César Mendoza, a little-known name; for the air force, Gustavo Leigh; for the navy, Admiral José Merino. But the most important name on the list was Army General Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet, previously Commander of the Central Garrison, had two weeks earlier taken over as Commander-in-Chief, swearing his loyalty to the president he was now trying to overthrow.  Some more Prussian marches. And then another announcement. An ultimatum to Allende. I sat chilled and shaking as I strained to scribble down the text of what a steely voice called Military Communiqué Number 2: “The Moneda Palace must be evacuated before 11 a.m. otherwise it will be attacked by the Chilean air force. The workers must remain in their workplaces and homes as it is strictly prohibited to leave them. If they disobey, they will also be attacked by air and ground forces.”  I sat paralyzed. A few moments later the same dry baritone voice read out Communique Number 3. Again I noted it on a yellow pad. “The population is hereby warned not to let themselves be carried away by incitements to violence from either foreign or national activists. And let the foreign ones know that in this country we do not accept violent attitudes or extreme positions. This should be remembered, as means are adopted for their rapid deportation from the country. Any resistance will be met with the full rigor of military justice.”  Yet another announcement proclaimed a curfew “until further notice.” Anyone found on the streets “will be shot on sight.” I had roused the others in the house. We sat dumbfounded in the chilly living room listening to Radio Magallanes, the Communist party station, boldly resisting the order to broadcast the armed forces network. Over the air, workers were being urged to report to their factories and organize defense committees.  But we knew this was an empty gesture. Those of us who worked in the Allende government knew the sad truth: that in spite of the right-wing chorus that Allende had formed a “parallel army,” no such units existed. Allende had been scrupulous in his commitment to the constitutional, legal and peaceful transition to socialism. The only guns in the country, he vowed, would remain in the hands of the armed forces. Yes, some Socialists and others had formed clandestine militias — but they were operationally risible.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it. The last man standing in defense of the “bourgeois” constitution would be the Marxist President, AK-47 in hand.  10 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Miraculously, my first attempt to phone the office where I worked in the Moneda Palace went through. Over the sound of crackling gun fire, a secretary, Ximena, told me in tears that she and the others were about to flee the building. My next call was to the U.S. Embassy — up on the 14th floor of an office building diagonally opposite the Moneda. I had had virtually no contact with the embassy and had, in fact, made every effort to steer clear of it. Even my mail was routed to the Canadian Embassy — a government that had shown more sympathy to Allende.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it.  But I phoned the U.S. Embassy that morning hoping that some safety provisions were being made for resident Americans. I figured it was only a matter of hours before I would be swept up in the military dragnet.  The embassy phone answered on the first ring. An accented English told me that I was speaking with a Chilean employee — always more American than the Americans. When I asked if the embassy had issued any special instructions, my respondent only laughed: “No special orders. Just stay off the streets.” And then with another chuckle she added: “I’m looking out the window now with binoculars. Looks like Mr Allende is finally going to get it.” She hung up.  11 a.m., Tuesday September 11    The leftist Radio Corporación and Radio Portales are off the air. But Salvador Allende’s metallic voice is coming live over Radio Magallanes. Via telephone, from inside the Moneda, with troops and tanks poised outside, with the Air Force Hawker-Hunter jets arming their rockets in readiness, Allende spoke:  This is surely the last opportunity I will have to address you. The air force has bombed the towers of Radio Portales and Corporación. My words are not bitter but they are full of disillusionment. And they will serve as moral sanction for those who have betrayed their oath of loyalty: the soldiers of Chile, the branch commanders…Admiral Merino who has named himself Chief of the Navy. Mr. Mendoza, a slinking general who only yesterday swore his loyalty to the government, has proclaimed himself head of the police… In the face of these events I can only say this to the workers. I will not resign… With my life I will pay for defending the principles dear to our nation… History cannot be stopped by repression or violence… Surely Radio Magallanes will be silenced and with it my voice. But that’s of no importance. You will continue hearing me as I will always be by your side… At least you will remember me as a man with dignity, a man who was always loyal to you. You must know that, sooner rather than later, the grand avenues on which a free people walk will be open and a better society will be at hand… These are my last words…  I sat stunned and devastated. I can only remember the four of us listening and sobbing for I don’t know how long. The fear was palpable. To go into the streets was to risk arrest and execution. We had no access to any information except what the military broadcast over the radio. The phone lines were now dead.  Everything I learned over the previous two years told me that the Chilean Revolution was now dead.  4 p.m., Tuesday September 11  A non-stop cascade of military communiques: that the Moneda had been bombed, that the Allende government was no longer, that all political activity was banned, that a dawn-to-dusk curfew was in effect, that the citizenry should denounce all “suspicious foreigners.” As that first evening enveloped us I felt as if I were already in prison.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect. I thought of my apartment and cringed, a downtown high-rise located directly across the street — no more than 20 yards — from the new junta headquarters. Régis Debray, the French writer and radical who had spent time with Che Guevara in Bolivia, had lived in my building when Allende first came to power. Other units were rented to exiled guerrillas from Argentina and Uruguay. The building teemed with the international New Left. One room of my apartment was stocked with the cheap editions of political classics and classic fiction made available under Allende. On my studio desk were copies of the work I had translated for Allende. In my top drawer was my passport, a visa to Cuba where I was scheduled to visit with Allende, and to top it all off, a .22 revolver with a couple of boxes of ammunition. On the floor were two radio transceivers that I was repairing for my buddies at Radio Taxi 33. In short, once the troops broke into my apartment, as they undoubtedly would, a warrant would be issued for a 22-year-old American named Marc Cooper.  Tuesday night to Thursday night, September 11 to 13  Those days were passed in the sort of blur produced by a state of deep shock. All that remains now is a kaleidoscope provided with a semblance of meaning by scraps of hurried, sometimes incoherent notes. I know I didn’t sleep that first night. I imagined Allende riddled and bloodied on his office floor. I could see the Moneda reduced to rubble by rockets and fire. The following morning, an official communique announced that Allende had committed suicide.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect.  The resumption of Chilean TV. A wavering, black-and-white image — now in the annals of history’s infamy — of General Pinochet sitting ramrod straight in the presidential chair, his arms crossed over his chest, Ray-Ban Wayfarers hiding his dulled eyes, his accomplices in the junta standing beside him.  I thought of the poor neighborhoods and factories, now surrounded by vengeful troops. I wondered about my friends: about Vincente and an American named Vince; Ximena, Jorge, Orlando; about the journalists, the coworkers. How many were already dead? How many would I ever see again? How long would it be before the troops came crashing through Melvin’s door to take me away?  I thought of the celebrations no doubt taking place that night in the lush suburbs of Providencia and Las Condes. I listened to the radio and noted down the congratulatory notes pouring in to Pinochet from the Doctors’ Association, the Lawyers’ Guild, the Chamber of Commerce, the Truckers — all the business sectors that had paved the way for the coup.  On Wednesday a statement from the supreme court chief justice, Enrique Urrutia, affirming the court’s “pleasure” with the military takeover. A terse military statement suspending habeas corpus and announcing a declared state of siege. Military communique number 29 dated September 13: “On this date the government junta has decreed the following: the closure of the National Congress and the vacancy of all its parliamentary seats. Signed, the governing junta of the armed forces and carabineros of Chile.”  People lie on the ground after being arrested by the military during the coup against the government of President Salvador Allende in Santiago, Chile. (AP Photo, File)  I winced at what I knew would be the wave of bloodletting, homicide and torture that was about to wash over Chile. I wondered how the hell I was going to get out alive.  I remember getting up at four in the morning and shaving off my beard. I remember opening my wallet and taking out my union card, my Socialist party membership, my ID from the Moneda and setting them ablaze. Those two days after the coup, Wednesday and Thursday, were marked by the sort of looming madness that I imagine accompanies solitary confinement. We had little food in the house. Melvin — a 30-year-old Bronx-born American — had never told me why he was in Chile. I had always assumed he was ducking a drug possession charge coming out of the ’60s. A fervent Allende supporter, and a fervent anticapitalist, he made his living buying and selling on the black market.  The only food in the house was a freezer full of Eskimo pies, several sacks of onions and a case of Pisco liquor. This odd diet, peppered with fear and haunted by uncertainty, drove me into a feverish, swirling retreat. I could barely talk to my Chilean girlfriend — now my wife — Patricia. I slept, I paced, ate ice cream, read Jim Thompson novels, cried and waited either for the curfew to lift or the door to come crashing down. But mostly we sat and listened to the radio. List after list of the wanted: Allende’s cabinet ministers, party activists, union leaders, prominent and not so prominent exiles had their names read over the air and were ordered to surrender at the Ministry of Defense. How they were expected to step out on the curfew-swept streets without being shot was not explained. As every announcement began, I was sure my name would be next.  10am, Friday September 14  Melvin and his girlfriend have drunk themselves into a stupor. As the radio announces that the curfew will be lifted today for five hours, Patricia and I decide we must leave Melvin’s. She had to check on her family. I had to get my passport out of my apartment and figure a way to safety. Two weeks before the coup my former roommate Carlos Luna, an exiled Argentinian guerilla fighter, had shown up at my apartment with a 9mm automatic. “The shit is coming,” he said, pulling the pistol from his jacket. “When it does, I am getting into the Swedish embassy even if I have to shoot my way in.” But I had no such formidable weapon nor such courage. The military had already announced it had put rings of troops around European embassies. I wondered where Carlos was. Was he dead by now?  My impulse to flight was heightened when, during the break in curfew, a client of Melvin’s, a deli owner, came to the house in his 3-cylinder Citroneta. Well-connected to the military, I took his words at face value when he told me matter of factly, “Cooper, you’re fucked. Your apartment has been raided and they’re out looking for you,” I asked him to drive me some­where safe. He refused.  A numbing panic gripped me. For the next four hours I could move, but I had nowhere to go. My apartment had been trashed, I was told, my passport seized, my name was on a wanted list, and the streets were full of soldiers and check­points. The phone started working again. In what must have been the moment of greatest naivety in my adult life, I thought again of the U.S. Embassy. I had an image in my head from Rossellini’s Rome: open City. I could see the grainy black-and-­white footage of Embassy staff cars rushing around the battle-littered streets, their white flags flapping.  I am embarrassed now, years later, to confess that I thought that, given the mounting bloodshed in Chile, the American Embassy on that day would be sending out rescue cars to pick up beleaguered stragglers like myself. I was under no illusions as to where the Embassy was at politically. The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal. But I was deluded enough to think that, in order to avoid the uncomfortable spectacle of American citizens being killed by its new client military dictatorship, the U.S. government might do something to protect us. In this I was entirely wrong.  As the curfew temporarily lifted that Friday I called the U.S. Consulate. Explaining merely that I was an “American student,” that I had done nothing wrong, but that the Chilean Police had raided my apartment and seized my passport, I told the Vice-Consul, Mrs. Tipton, that I needed help. Even as I asked, my heart began to sink. Her husband was the Embassy’s top “polit­ical officer,” tied to the darkest aspects of U.S. policy.  The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal.  “Do you have a U.S. driver’s license?” Mrs. Tipton asked me. “Yes.”  “Good,” the Vice-Consul said. “Don’t bother to come in today because we’re about to close. But come in on Monday. Bring your license and $10 and we ‘II expedite you a new passport. Should take about a week, maybe 10 days.”  Stupefied, I argued with her. But to no avail. No special instructions to U.S. citizens were being offered. “Just stay away from shooting and obey the new authorities,” she said. As far as the Embassy was concerned, my predicament was a simple case of a lost passport.  They certainly knew better. But the political calculation had already been made. It was more important to give political sup­port to the new dictatorship than it was to undermine its credibility by suggesting that American citizens needed protec­tion against it.  Noon, Friday September 14  Turned away by the Embassy, I was now desperate. I rummaged through my mental Rolodex and focused on a long shot. An American friend of mine, an Allendista, had told me some months before that a guy named Dennis Allred, who served as the U.S. Embassy’s Student Affairs Counselor, was a decent man, a closet Allende sympathizer who took secret delight in handing out U.S. scholarships to the most radical of Chilean students. True or not it seemed like the only chance I had.  I phoned the Embassy back. No, I was told, Mr. Allred wasn’t in. But, yes, being a fellow American, I could have his home phone number. “Dennis, you don’t know me,” I told him after he answered his phone. “But I’m an American and I’m in trou­ble. I need … “  “OK,” he said, cutting me short. “I don’t care about the details. If you need a place to stay you’re welcome here. Come now. I’m at Merced 280.”  I thanked him and hung up. Merced 280? That would put him right next door to the heavily guarded U.S. Consulate. Could I get past the troops? Patricia and I hurriedly made a plan. She would catch a bus to her parents’ home but first would swing by my apartment and check its condition. She would call me later at Allred’s. I would walk the seven miles to Allred’s house as I had no ID and buses were being boarded and checked by soldiers.  My clothes were filthy. Melvin, who is 6′ 2″, lent me a pair of pants. I am 5′ 3″. I tucked the bottom of the pants up and pinned them inside with safety pins. He gave me a fresh shirt and I rolled the sleeves up over my wrists. On top of this unlikely outfit I wore my black leather jacket. For three hours I trudged toward Allred’s house, protected only by sunglasses, taking side streets and looking far ahead for any checkpoints.  By 4 o’clock I was on the perimeter of the U.S. Consulate. Neighboring Forestal Park was literally an armed camp. Armored carriers bristled with machine guns and helmeted troops. In front of the Consulate, a few steps from Dennis Allred’s apartment, a company of soldiers lounged on a tank. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I had no idea what I would tell the soldiers if challenged. I walked straight ahead, my eyes fixed on the door of Allred’s building, my pace steady. Like passing through a time warp, I floated into the building uninterrupted.  A big, red-headed Bostoner, Allred greeted me alone in his luxury apartment. I was so pent up I could hardly talk at first. And then I began to talk too much. “I don’t need to hear the details of your story. You can stay here as long as you have to,”” he said. He then offered me a tumbler full of Old Grandad which I gulped down like water. The booze took the edge off, and I slumped back in the broad padded mahogany chair. I called Patricia at her parents’ house. I was relieved to hear that my apartment had not been raided. She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute. She would come and visit me the next day when the curfew was again to be lifted for a short time.  Over a real meal that evening — salad and Kraft macaroni and cheese — Allred told me the news, good and bad. “This apartment theoretically has diplomatic immunity, theoretically Chilean security cannot enter,” he said. “On the other hand, the morning of the coup, the U.S. Embassy took my passport, locked it in a safe, sent me home, and told me they’d call me when I should come back to work. So I don’t know how much protection we really have.” I could only guess that the stories my friend had told me about Allred were true.  She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute.  That night, on the convertible bed in his den, the saddest of Portuguese fadas I had fished out of Allred’s record collection drowned the sounds of sporadic gunfire and the rumble of tanks outside my window. With a strong sleeping pill Denis gave me I slept soundly for the first time in almost 100 hours.  6 p.m., Sunday September 16    The word was apparently out on Allred’s generosity. Over the weekend the apartment filled up with other hunted prey. A few had been beaten and bruised by troops who had broken down their doors. Others, like me, had nowhere to go. Still others were there because I had contacted them. Allred had taken the courageous step of abandoning his direct-dial diplomatic phone to us — a luxury in a country where long-distance calls even under optimum circumstances were difficult to make and where now so-called “press-calls” of the sort we were making had to be cleared by a military censor. With Allred’s phone we skipped over those obstacles.  In Allred’s study we set up a mini information clearing house. We called around the city to check on the safety of over­lapping networks of friends and co-workers. Once the information was compiled from a mongrel mix of sources — friends, friendly reporters, diplomats, health workers, UN func­tionaries — we were able to skirt Chilean censorship and pass the information directly on to family, media and human rights groups in the U.S. Painstakingly, we cobbled together lists of those safe, those arrested, and those simply missing. But there was still no way out of Chile. The airports were closed, the embassies sealed. Any foreigner on the street was ipso facto a sus­pect. Who knew who was on the myriad wanted, arrest and kill-on-sight lists? We already knew the U.S. Embassy was useless.  A friend of mine, a Mexican reporter, called me from his Embassy. Would I be interested in getting on a list that the Mexican Embassy was putting together to be evacuated? “Absolutely,” I answered. I gave him the names of three or four other desperate friends. He told me to sit tight and wait, that word of the flight out could come at any time. I had no choice but to comply.  A few friends who had come to see me at Allred’s told tales of serious resistance, of a regrouping of Allende forces, of guns that were on their way, of former Army General Carlos Prats, forced from office a few weeks before the coup, who was now pulling together a People’s Army. The rumors all sounded wonderful. And we knew they were all false. The Chilean armed forces, the CIA, Nixon, Kissinger, the Chilean business elite had won their victory early that first morning when the Army didn’t divide and when Allende perished inside the Moneda. Now they were just mopping up the rest of us.  Noon, Monday September 17  Word had come that some Americans were missing. David Hathaway had been taken from his apartment. Frank Teruggi was unaccounted for. Sometime that day, our friend Charlie Horman would be seized.  During my time in Chile I had only limited contact with the American expatriate radical community. Some of them had come together in a group called Fuente de Informaci6n Norteamericana (FIN), which struggled to gain a voice as an alternative source of information on Chile to the mainstream media. I had no participation in that project but, for a short time shortly after I arrived in Santiago, I spent a string of Saturday mornings in a “study group” with Frank Teruggi and others. I soon tired of those meetings and what seemed to me at the time their uncritical attachment to the MIR. But I always thought fondly of the spry and witty Teruggi, who was clearly the brightest among his friends.  I had first met Charlie Horman only recently. One after­noon he showed up unannounced at my apartment door and introduced himself as a friend of some of my friends. That was sufficient basis for us, fueled by a couple of liters of rich Chilean red wine, to talk of politics and life deep into the night. We had a few other sporadic lunches and chats.  Now I can only regret that I did not spend more time with Charlie and Frank. I would next see them a decade later and then only as celluloid ghosts conjured up in the Costa-Gavras film “Missing.”  One young American professor rallied us in Allred’s living room and we went as a delegation next door to speak to the U.S. Consul. Enough was enough, we shouted. We wanted the U.S. Embassy to do everything it could to find those who had been arrested. And we wanted protection for ourselves. We wanted the Americans to do what every other diplomatic delegation was doing in Chile — protecting its own citizens from a rampag­ing, barbarous military. The Consul, Frank Purdy, stood in the hall, blocking access to his office. He spouted the party line: he would look into these matters but there was nothing else to be done that day. The State Department had still issued no specific instructions for Americans in Chile. No special protection was to be extended.  “I recommend you be careful,”” Consul Purdy said. And then he looked us in the eye and came up with a straight-out lie. “The armed forces are restoring order but there’s still a danger of scattered left-wing snipers. Be careful.” With that he shooed us out of the Consulate. In retrospect we made mistakes. Our disgust with our government kept us from making what should have been the next logical move. We should have sat down and occupied the Consulate.  That afternoon, shortly after we slumped back from the meeting with the Consul, the whole apartment shook with a thud. Then another bone-chilling thud. Walking out onto Allred’s second-floor balcony we saw the two tanks that were doing the shelling. Comfortably squatting in the park, they lobbed artillery rounds into the Fine Arts Campus of the University of Chile across the river. That’s how the armed forces of Chile were restoring order.  8 p.m., Tuesday September 18  One week since the coup, and the call came through from the Mexicans. Thanks to the Mexican government I was to be on a flight organized by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees for the next morning. Apart from a special military aircraft that carried Allende’s widow to Mexico, this would be the first flight allowed out of Chile. There was a catch, of course. I had to be at the distant Sheraton Hotel the next morn­ing at 7:30 sharp. But curfew didn’t lift till 7. It was going to be tight. Nor could I get word to Patricia to meet me to say good­bye. She used a neighbor’s phone and if I called her now, at night, it would be too dangerous to defy the curfew. I’d have to wait till morning to call. This was another low point. The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  7 a.m., Wednesday September 19  The moment the curfew lifted, I called Patricia and asked her to do what she could to meet me at the Sheraton. I hugged Allred goodbye. With only my passport, $200 in cash and the borrowed clothes on my back, I walked past the encampment of soldiers outside Allred’s door. On the corner, a daring taxi driver was ready for the post-curfew fares. When we got to the Sheraton, I began to reach into my pocket to pay him. The cabbie turned around and commenced one of those skilfully coded dialogues.  “Are you a foreigner?” he asked.  “Yes, an American.”  “Have you been living in Chile?” he asked, noting my local accent.  “Yes, for nearly three years.”  “Are you leaving today?”  “Yes. I am leaving.”  “Then,” the cabbie said, “there will be no charge. I want your thoughts about your last moments in Chile to be positive ones.”  Operating on an emotional hair-trigger, I couldn’t answer through my tears. I only nodded.  Inside the Sheraton lobby I was met by UN and Mexican officials. There was to be a motley mix of about 50 of us on this flight. Few of us knew each other. There were some Spanish clergy. Some Mexican teachers. An American researcher black and blue from a beating. A Texas high-school swim team that had had the bad luck to be passing through Santiago on the wrong day. Because Americans were on the flight manifest, American consular officials were there with clipboards in hand. We refused to talk to them.  The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  Just before I boarded the bus to the airport Patricia arrived for a short goodbye — she would arrange to meet me later in the U.S. Under heavily armed military escort we were taken to the Cerrillos military airport. After bureaucratic stalling by the junta’s new immigration officers, who challenged the validity of our UN-secured safe-conduct pass, we were herded onto a cor­porate 737 owned by LADECO, one of the copper companies nationalized by Allende.  There was an eerie silence as we took off. No one was sure of anyone else on the flight. As we gained altitude, the plane banked around and began to cross the majestic, snow-sparkled Andes en route to Buenos Aires. Twenty minutes into the flight a crackling voice came over the intercom. “Ladies and gentle­men,” the captain announced crisply, “we have just entered Argentine air space.”  The entire plane exploded into yelps of joy and applause. Soon we were all on our feet embracing each other, even the Texas swim team. The Kool-Aid and baloney sandwiches that were served remain to this day the best airplane meal I’ve ever had.  We were greeted in Buenos Aires as heroes even by the immigration police. And that night we marched with 100,000 Argentines to protest the Chilean military dictatorship.  The following week Patricia called me to tell me that on September 22 she went by my apartment and found the front door blown off its hinges, the entire residence sacked by sol­diers.  Two months afterwards she came to the U.S. and we have been married ever since. Dennis Allred resigned from the U.S. Foreign Service. Ten years later when I passed through Sweden I found my old guerrilla roommate Carlos Luna running an import-export business with Cuba.  In his final speech on Magallanes Radio, Salvador Allende promised us that one day there would be a “moral punishment” for the crime and treason that killed him and his Chile. We are still waiting.  Of Salvador Allende, his sacrifice and legacy, Gabriel Garcia Marquez lamented: “His greatest virtue was following through, but fate could only grant him that rare and tragic greatness of dying in armed defense of the whole moth-eaten paraphernalia of an execrable system which he proposed abolishing without a shot.”  Extracted from “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir” by Marc Cooper, published by Verso Books.  Author’s note: Diplomat Dennis Allred left the foreign service after the coup in Chile. He moved to Chicago and later to Brazil. He died in 1990 at age 45 from alcohol-related diseases.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXRoZGlnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaHJvbmljbGUtb2YtYS1kZWF0aC1wb3N0cG9uZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-02-25","Not Discerned","{""Lagos"", ""Lagos"", ""Nigeria""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:55:41","The Lagos State chapter of the Labour Party says no fewer than 20 lawyers and legal professionals have volunteered to help the party and its candidates retrieve their allegedly stolen mandates.  The party at a meeting with some of its candidates in the last general elections, said that a legal team had offered to render services to candidates who felt cheated following the outcome of the Feb. 25 and March 18 general elections in the state.  The Lagos State LP Chairperson, Pastor Dayo Ekong, disclosed this while addressing the frontline candidates and other critical stakeholders at the party’s Secretariat in Ikeja on Tuesday evening in Lagos.  “We have a group of professionals and lawyers who want to volunteer their services for free to help our candidates retrieve their stolen mandates.  “Feel free to contact them in case you need legal advice. We are hopeful that legal practitioners will help those who do not have money to hire lawyers to fight their cases in court.  “All eyes are on the judiciary. We are going to win,” Ekong said.  The chairperson expressed optimism that the party would recover allegedly stolen mandates.  “This is the time for us to stand strong, tall and stay focused no matter the attacks and intimidation.  “We are with you. We want to feel more of you, we want you to support us and together we can move this party forward,” she said  Ekong assured that the state exco would continue to stand behind all candidates challenging the outcome of the last general elections.  According to her, the leadership challenges rocking the party will fizzle out very soon, as the party has commenced processes to expose and show the infiltrators the way out.  “We cannot allow people who are playing the script of some paymasters in our midst to continue. Our children must grow up to see a new Nigeria and that is our passion and commitment.  “Be part of the history, fight the battle no matter the castigation and intimidation. If our country is better, our children will sing a new song,” she added.  According to her, the chapter is solidly behind the Julius Abure-led National Working Committee and would not be part of any back-door coup against the party leadership for any monetary gain.  Urging the candidates not to be distracted but to be focused, Ekong assured them that the truth would prevail at the end of the tunnel.  She urged all the candidates to be closer to the party hierarchy in the state.  “We are at a period in this party when everything looks uncertain because of infiltrations,” she said.  She begged all aggrieved candidates to shelve their grievances and work to promote the party and its ideas in their various constituencies.  Corroborating the chairperson, the LP Secretary in the state, Chief Sam Okpala, said that some people had become ‘comrades in crimes’ to destroy the party and its structure in the state because of selfish gains.  “We need your support to stand and face the shenanigans who are hell-bent to destroy the party. They are out to play the spoiler’s role but God will continue to expose them.  “The party is standing strongly with you in the efforts to reclaim these mandates. We want you to help defend the interests and cause of this party in your various constituencies.  “We have almost 20 lawyers working together with some other professionals working together on this,” Okpala said.  Stating that the Lagos State LP chapter remained the bedrock of the party, Okpala described the interaction as a confidence-building meeting to clear airs on myriads of false narratives making the round about the party.  Commenting, the candidates and leaders of the party unanimously agreed to work with the party and Ekong-led state executive committee of the party.  The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the meeting had in attendance some House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senatorial District candidates of the party in the last general elections with other stakeholders in the state.

"coup","2016-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Indhija"", ""Vojvodina"", ""Serbia""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:03:19","Call him “far-right-inbras.” Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photo: HBO, Getty Images  Watching Succession, it’s almost too easy to think about Shakespeare — specifically King Lear, what with the whole “dying patriarch and three squabbling children” dynamic, but also elements of many of his other plays. Brian Cox pointed out to me that there’s a lot of Henry IV parts one and two in there, given the way Logan distrusts the focus of the generation below him (Kendall’s obsession with looking cool makes him a good analog to Prince Hal). In Shiv and Tom you can probably read into some sort of Macbeth dynamic (who is Lady Macbeth? Depends on the episode) and Greg is, of course, a great Fool, kept around in the court for wasabi-based jests and japes. But as the series heads toward its endgame, watching Sunday night’s election episode, the finale of another big Shakespeare tragedy kept coming to mind: Hamlet.  There’s some resemblance in the plot of that play to what’s currently transpiring with the GoJo deal — squint hard and Kendall’s equivocations about whether to commit to throwing his support behind Mencken and stopping the deal with Mattson are a bit like Hamlet trying to decide whether to kill his usurper uncle. But what’s really interesting is how Hamlet ends, which might provide a glimpse into how Succession unravels. After almost everyone in Elsinore kills each other, the militant prince of Norway, Fortinbras, arrives and claims the castle for himself. Hamlet, right before he dies, lends his support to Fortinbras, saying, “He has my dying voice” (it’s right before the whole “the rest is silence” bit), and Fortinbras then delivers the customary return-to-order speech at the end of the play, announcing that he’s going to give Hamlet a soldier’s burial with “the rites of war.”  It’s an ironic end for Hamlet, considering his whole problem is that he’s bad at taking action, but it tracks with the fact that Hamlet’s had a bit of a crush on Fortinbras from a distance (not unlike Roman Roy and Jeryd Mencken) for the whole play. He’s obsessed with the fact that the Norwegian prince is spending his time marching armies into Poland while he waffles about whether to kill his uncle or not — never mind the fact that Hamlet’s dad (named Hamlet) killed Fortinbras’s dad (also called Fortinbras). If you’re directing Hamlet, you can take that dynamic in all sorts of directions, casting Fortinbras’s crowning at the end as rightful or a coup. Robert Icke’s production at the Armory last summer had recorded cable-TV footage of Fortinbras, played by Starstruck’s Nikesh Patel, leading an invasion. In this way, Hamlet’s dithering leads to his kingdom, already in dire straights, being subsumed by fascism.  That brings us back to our pals in the court of the Roy family. At the end of Sunday night’s Succession, we have Jeryd Mencken — call him “far-right-inbras” — giving his speech on TV about purifying America while Shiv, Roy, and Kendall are at each other’s throats about the fate of Waystar, which is already floundering. Kendall, Succession’s most melancholy prince, goes along with the idea that Mencken is the one to support, simply because he convinces himself it will be possible to do business with him — not unlike going, “Hey, well, at least this guy is also a Scandinavian prince.” Extrapolating forward into the last two episodes, it seems quite plausible that, instead of any one of the Roy children ending up in charge of the company, the three of them destroy each other and then hand over the actual power to outside invaders.  Speaking of which, we should acknowledge the actual six-foot-four-inch Scandinavian prince in the room: Lukas Mattson, who is also watching things from the sidelines, an old (sort of) foe of the Roys’ father. Really, we should have seen a Fortinbras-style ending coming with a character like him from the moment everyone started talking about how their media empire was losing the battle to tech back in season one. Mattson’s numbers in India are probably fake, but in terms of deportment, he’s everything the Roy children are not: decisive, canny, an actual killer. As much as Kendall and Roman think they might be able to use Mencken to stop the GoJo acquisition, or even reverse the flow and swallow the tech giant back (good luck with that), if we’re looking to Hamlet as a model, all the internal conflict between the family will just make it easier, in the end, for Mattson to sweep in and take control without expending much blood of his own (except for the bricks he’s already FedExed to Ebba). Maybe he’ll even be nice and give a little speech about how noble and soldierly the Roy children were right at the end of the show. If that happens, tallying up the numbers, Succession will end up having two Fortinbrases, three Hamlets, and one Yorick (Karl).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi1lbmRpbmctdGhlb3J5LWhhbWxldC1mb3J0aW5icmFzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Prime Minister Chris Hipkins is stirring speculation that Auckland business leaders are approaching Nicola Willis asking her to roll her leader, Christopher Luxon.  Willis denied she had discussed a National Party coup, after a recent poll had Luxon’s preferred prime minister rating drop to its lowest point under his leadership.  “There’s no basis to the idea that I want to do anything other than work with Chris Luxon to make him prime minister,” Willis said.  But she also refused to respond to questions asking if it was true that Auckland business leaders had approached her with concerns about Luxon’s ability to become prime minister.

Asked if business leaders had asker her to roll Luxon, Willis replied: “I’m not going to indulge this.”  On Wednesday, Hipkins and Finance Minister Grant Robertson joked about Willis’ conversations with Auckland’s business leaders.  Hitting back at Luxon during question time, Hipkins replied: “It's no wonder that Nicola Willis is doing so well in Auckland business circles.”  Robert Kitchin/Stuff Nicola Willis, left, has pushed back against speculation over Christoper Luxon’s future as National’s leader.  Willis herself got in on the act.

"coup","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 11:25:10","In both the pro-government and opposition camps, nationalists are key and rising in popularity.  External analysis of Turkish politics often tends to focus on the divide between political Islamism and secularism, between liberals and conservatives.  But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism.  Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Former MHP members who split with the party over its support for Erdogan went on to form the Iyi Party in 2017, now a key part of the opposition alliance.  Another ex-MHP member, Sinan Ogan, has been labelled as the “kingmaker” ahead of the presidential run-off scheduled for May 28 after he surprisingly won more than 5 percent in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday.  And then there are nationalists of a different flavour – left-wing Kurdish nationalists of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), who fought the election under the banner of the Yesil Sol Party.  Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate.  It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year.  A combination of anti-refugee sentiment and economic hardships has even led to pressure on politicians to send Syrians back to their home country, despite the ongoing rule there of President Bashar al-Assad, and even a spike in violence towards people perceived to be Syrian.  Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right.  Ogan himself has already referenced “terrorism” as a red line for his support in the second round – a clear reference to Kurdish groups. While Erdogan’s AK Party included politicians from the predominantly Kurdish Huda-Par Islamist party in its parliamentary candidate lists, this will be more of a problem for Kilicdaroglu, who received a huge amount of support from HDP voters and will struggle to win over Ogan voters without losing Kurdish support.      Islamic movement replaced by nationalism?  Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s.  Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Grey Wolves has gone on to be designated a “terrorist” group in Kazakhstan and banned in France, with calls for a “terrorist” designation to also be applied in the wider European Union and the United States. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence.  While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right.  This was not always the case – the MHP opposed Erdogan’s peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in the early 2010s.  But from 2015 onwards, once the peace process broke down, and particularly after the failed coup against Erdogan in 2016, the MHP became a firm ally.  In that sense, the MHP replaced the group that has largely been blamed for the coup, the Gulenists – who were once Erdogan’s close partners.  Bahceli has replaced figures like former president Abdullah Gul and former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, men who were pivotal in Erdogan’s rise but who eventually split with him.  Davutoglu himself was famous for his “zero problems with neighbours” foreign policy. The Arab Spring, and a desire to support groups with a background in political Islam, such as Ennahdha in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, ended that.  But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean.  It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward.      What comes next?  Erdogan is now expected to win the run-off against Kilicdaroglu on May 28, having defied the expectations of the pollsters to emerge within a percentage point of winning the presidential election in the first round outright.  But the Turkish leader, who has led the country for 20 years, will turn 70 next year and will be 74 at the time of the next presidential election in 2028. Thoughts will surely be turning to who his successor will be.  It is a big problem for the AK Party, which appears rudderless without Erdogan. While his popularity has generally held steady, the party’s has dipped, shedding voters to nationalist parties.  Within the party, no one has Erdogan’s gravitas or popularity.  Some analysts predict that this means that the path will open for a member of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), perhaps someone like Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and that Erdogan’s successor will come from the left.  But it is Turkish nationalism that is on the ascendancy, in both the government and opposition camps, which makes it more likely that successor will emerge from the right.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTYvaW4tdHVya2V5cy1lbGVjdGlvbnMtbmF0aW9uYWxpc20taXMtdGhlLXJlYWwtd2lubmVy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTYvaW4tdHVya2V5cy1lbGVjdGlvbnMtbmF0aW9uYWxpc20taXMtdGhlLXJlYWwtd2lubmVy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Six Opposition parties came together to seize the momentum and fielded a joint candidate, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a mild-mannered former bureaucrat who promised to arrest Turkey’s “slide towards authoritarianism” and fix its economy. Most opinion polls predicted that Mr. Erdoğan was trailing Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu. Yet, in the preliminary results, Mr. Erdoğan won 49.5% of the votes in the presidential election, a tad lower than the threshold that would have avoided a run-off, against Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.9%. The President’s nationalist-conservative coalition also took a comfortable majority in Parliament. Mr. Erdoğan was facing serious criticism, particularly about his mismanagement of the economy. Turkey’s lira has lost some 60% of its value against the dollar in just two years. Foreign investors are fleeing and the current account deficit is ballooning. Annual inflation has hit the middle-class. After a devastating earthquake in February, the government’s response to the calamity and its building permit rules were slammed. Yet, the Opposition failed to turn these challenges Mr. Erdoğan faced into votes.  Mr. Erdoğan, whose Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003, has remained a towering figure in Turkey’s politics. He rewrote its Constitution, turning its parliamentary system into an executive presidency, and got himself elected as the first President under the new Constitution. He used the failed 2016 coup to purge his rivals and tame the generals. He moved Turkey away from the western orbit and began building stronger ties with Russia and Arab countries, while retaining its NATO membership. His promise was to turn Turkey, once the core of the Ottoman Empire, into a major global power again. He presented himself as an outsider who revolted against the Kemalist establishment, and built a new order rooted in Islamist conservatism, public welfare and an Ottoman imperial nostalgia. Sunday’s election results show that this revivalist brand of politics still remains powerful. But that is not the whole story. The results also suggest that there are cracks in his base. In 2018, he won the presidential election in the first round with a 22-percentage point lead over his closest rival. This time, he was not just forced to go into a run-off, but the gap is just five points. Public resentment towards his policies was particularly high in and around Ankara and Istanbul. A directionless Opposition finally seems united and potent. Mr. Erdoğan may still be in the lead, but he has been humbled by Turkey’s voters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9lZGl0b3JpYWwvd2Vha2VyLWJ5LXRoZS15ZWFyLW9uLXRoZS1lbGVjdGlvbnMtaW4tdHVya2V5LWFuZC1yZWNlcC10YXl5aXAtZXJkbyVDNCU5RmFuL2FydGljbGU2Njg1Nzg5MS5lY2XSAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL29waW5pb24vZWRpdG9yaWFsL3dlYWtlci1ieS10aGUteWVhci1vbi10aGUtZWxlY3Rpb25zLWluLXR1cmtleS1hbmQtcmVjZXAtdGF5eWlwLWVyZG8lQzQlOUZhbi9hcnRpY2xlNjY4NTc4OTEuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-03-15","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 11:23:33","Junta Crony Myanmar Crony Promoting Electric Vehicles Despite Ongoing Power Blackouts  Daw Khine Zaw (left) makes a donation for COVID-19 control and prevention in March 2020 at the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry office in Yangon. / Ma Khine Zaw Facebook  Myanmar has been suffering from ongoing power outages since the 2021 coup, but now a new crony has come to the attention of the people for her promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) and the charging stations they use.  Enter Daw Khine Zaw, chief executive officer of the Earth Group Companies. She is a sister-in-law of arch-crony and major arms dealer U Tay Za, the chairman of the Htoo Group of Companies.  Daw Khine Zaw has been involved in military-linked businesses since the days of former military dictator Than Shwe. She also has ties with current junta chief Min Aung Hlaing and his relatives.  According to The Irrawaddy’s business sources, it was Daw Khine Zaw who sold Min Aung Hlaing on the idea of promoting the use of EVs, including electric buses, in Myanmar. She has already been engaged in the renewable energy business, including solar power, for several years.  One Yangon car dealer told The Irrawaddy: “Daw Khine Zaw’s Prime Company alone is handling EVs. She has connections and she has won most of the licenses related to EVs.”  Prime Automotive Myanmar, a subsidiary of Daw Khine Zaw’s Earth Renewable Energy, is licensed to import EVs, while Earth Renewable Energy is licensed to build charging stations for them.  Under the now ousted National League for Democracy government, Daw Khine Zaw rarely appeared at the meetings of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI). But since 2022, she has appeared at UMFCCI and is mainly engaged in solar power and EVs, added the car dealer.  While there is still no necessary infrastructure and facilities for EVs, the military regime formed a national-level committee on EVs and related businesses in June 2022, and took immediate steps to import electric cars and build charging stations.  The junta has also waived the tax on the import of EVs and parts for charging stations for the 2022-23 fiscal year. There are also reports that the tax will be exempted until the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year. Daw Khine Zaw’s companies are enjoying tax exemptions, too, according to automobile dealers.  This March, Earth Renewable Energy opened Myanmar’s first charging station for electric buses on the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay Highway in Naypyitaw’s Dekkhinathiri Township. So far it has built three charging stations along the highway, according to the company.  Traditionally, foreign automakers distribute their cars through authorized dealers in Myanmar. Prime Automotive Myanmar Co has, however, attempted to import vehicles directly from foreign companies, resulting in disputes with local dealers.  The Yangon car dealer said: “They reached out to foreign car companies and asked them to sell branded vehicles, saying they have the permits [to import].”  Who is Daw Khine Zaw?  Daw Khine Zaw is the sister of Daw Thida Zaw, the wife of arch-crony U Tay Za. The 60-year-old businesswoman engages in around five industries including manufacturing, transportation, and renewable energy.  She won the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2019 Women Entrepreneur of the Year award. She is also a vice chair of the Myanmar Industries Association, which is a sister association of the UMFCCI.  Over the past decade Daw Khine Zaw has portrayed herself as a female entrepreneur to boost her image among international business owners, despite her ties to the former and current military regime. She is also close to people who move in political circles in Thailand.  Daw Khine Zaw has previously won licenses for construction projects in the Myanmar capital Naypyitaw that were backed by former generals. The most notable tender was to construct solar-powered lighting along the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay highway. The tender was worth billions of kyats, but the lighting failed within a few years because it was of poor quality.  She is also a laywoman of Sitagu Sayadaw, a military-linked Buddhist monk who is close to Min Aung Hlaing. The monk served as the vice-chair of ultranationalist Buddhist group The Association for Protection of Race and Religion, better known by the Burmese acronym Ma Ba Tha.  The group has become known for racial and religious hate speeches since it was established in 2013, some two years after Min Aung Hlaing succeeded Than Shwe as Myanmar military chief.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9qdW50YS1jcm9ueS9teWFubWFyLWNyb255LXByb21vdGluZy1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy1kZXNwaXRlLW9uZ29pbmctcG93ZXItYmxhY2tvdXRzLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnJhd2FkZHkuY29tL25ld3MvanVudGEtY3JvbnkvbXlhbm1hci1jcm9ueS1wcm9tb3RpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtZGVzcGl0ZS1vbmdvaW5nLXBvd2VyLWJsYWNrb3V0cy5odG1sL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 03:00:00","A few days after the latest fighting in the Gaza Strip slightly improved the position of the prime minister and the governing coalition in the polls – how heroic it is to spar with an organization comprised of a few thousand militants – Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners have nevertheless managed to destroy what little remained of their political capital.  Netanyahu is now trapped between his need and desire to kill Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s poisonous legal upheaval and his inability to publicly announce its demise. So meanwhile, he’s handing out money to the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, who are raiding the public coffers even as average Israelis are being hammered by rising inflation.  'When Trump said F**K Bibi, it wasn't a slip of the tongue' Subscribe 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  The story of the arnona (property tax) fund – a proposal to have wealthy towns allocate a portion of their property taxes to a fund that would benefit poorer communities – took over the battle between the blocs this week. But it also includes two political stories whose implications are greater than they seem.  The first is the divorce between Haim Bibas – mayor of Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities and someone the Likud party marked as potential leadership material some years ago – and Netanyahu’s Likud.  This isn’t the first time Bibas has dared to come out against Netanyahu from his position of power as local authorities leader. He criticized the prime minister during the coronavirus pandemic, he opposed giving homophobe Avi Maoz some of the Education Ministry’s powers, and he bravely spoke out against the government’s destructive efforts to enact its legal coup. But his battle against the arnona fund seems likely to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.  The fault line emerged when Bibas and his fellow big-city mayors discovered that Likud MKs who had supported their position in the Knesset Finance Committee were nevertheless obliged to vote for the bill – because the prime minister was enforcing coalition discipline. People close to Bibas say that contrary to the Finance Ministry’s claims, Bibas never agreed to any compromise on this issue. That’s because he views the fund as harming big-city residents by nationalizing their money, and the “negotiations” as having been forced on the cities by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Knesset Finance Committee chairman Moshe Gafni.  We lost Bibas  “Bibas is no longer with us,” one Likud minister said. “We realized this during the story of the [legal] reform, and now it’s already public. This isn’t just a fight with Netanyahu; the biggest heartbreak is his rift with Yariv Levin. They were brothers, cornerstones of the Likud branch in Modi’in. But today, when you’re against Netanyahu and Levin, Likud is scorched earth for you.”  People close to Bibas also realize that Netanyahu is likely to oust him from his position as chairman of Likud’s municipalities committee – a group with a strong foothold among the grassroots that will be of great importance in the upcoming municipal elections.  During the crisis over the arnona fund, Bibas’ associates said, many attempts to silence him were made, but he is willing to pay any political price, including “being burned with the [Likud] base,” to defend the interests of the city residents he represents.  Yet it’s not at all clear that Bibas will be the big loser in this story. Several centrist parties will likely propose that he run on their ticket in the municipal elections – Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, Naftali Bennett’s expected new party and who knows what others may arise. Some of the above are already courting him.  Open gallery view Modi'in Mayor Haim Bibas. Credit: Jorge Novominsky  But the prevailing political wisdom is that he won’t enter national politics as long as Netanyahu is around. “Bibas is the archetype of what Likud should be – Mizrahi, born in Beit She’an, right-wing, social-welfare-oriented and liberal,” one prominent rightist said. “For Likud to sacrifice him, an act that looks like caving in to Gafni and Smotrich, is a mistake.”  The second story, which was bolstered by the arnona fund, is the ultra-Orthodox community’s blindness about its situation and insistence on making itself hated, to the point that its exclusion from the next governing coalition will become genuinely essential.  The arnona fund wasn’t created solely to benefit the Haredim, but it will benefit most of their towns, at the expense of the wealthiest cities. Coming on top of the scandalous coalition funding (money earmarked for the pet projects of coalition parties and MKs), and given that Gafni, of United Torah Judaism party, was a key player in creating the fund, the proposal looks like another aggressive, avaricious act by the ultra-Orthodox.

They are taking this situation to the extreme, and they will also pay the price.”  Those comments didn’t come from a center-left politician like Lapid or Labor MK Gilad Kariv, but from a Likud minister. In short, the ultra-Orthodox have managed to annoy everybody except themselves.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTE3L3R5LWFydGljbGUvLnByZW1pdW0vdHJhcHBlZC1ieS1oaXMtY29hbGl0aW9uLWFuZC1oaXMtb3duLXBhcnR5LW5ldGFueWFodS1pcy1mb3JjZWQtdG8tZmxhc2gtdGhlLWNhc2gvMDAwMDAxODgtMjYzNC1kZjc3LWFmZTktNmZmNDRhYWEwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","1987-12-24","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:56:17","In the past three years, the US government’s role in the Doha Talks (2010-2020) has attracted scrutiny and criticism within the United States and abroad.  Starting in November 2010, the Doha Talks was a process of intermittent negotiations between the United States and the Afghan Taliban. The culmination of this process was the Doha Agreement, signed in February 2020. The agreement facilitated the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan.  The Geneva talks  However, about three decades earlier, the US government had also played a pivotal role in another peace process on Afghanistan — Geneva Talks. The outcome of the latter talks was the Geneva Accords which facilitated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February 1989.  The Geneva Talks took place in the background of a military occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. In late December 1979, tens of thousands of Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan to prop up a client regime in Kabul. The regime — also known as the Afghan Communist regime — had been established a year earlier following a military coup in April 1978. Ever since its establishment the Communist regime faced an armed resistance from anti-Communist resistance fighters — Mujahideen. At the time, the United States along with neighboring Pakistan supported the Mujahideen.  The Soviet Union claimed that it had deployed its forces in Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government to fend off the threat from the Mujahideen. The United States refuted the Soviet claim. According to American President Jimmy Carter, the Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan as part of an expansionist policy to acquire warmwater ports on the Indian Ocean — which implied further expansion into neighboring Pakistan. Hence, the United States claimed that the rationale behind its support for the Afghan Mujahideen was to stop the claimed Soviet expansion into the Persian Gulf.  Indirect negotiations for six years  Brokered by the United Nations, the Geneva Talks was a series of twelve rounds of indirect negotiations that ran for six years starting from June 1982 to April 1988. The talks nominally took place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the key actors behind the scenes were the Soviet Union and the United States. The outcome of this process was the Geneva Accords which was a set of four interrelated agreements signed on 14 April 1988 by the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan and by the US Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union as the international guarantors.  At the heart of the Geneva talks was an effort by the United Nations to help the parties find a negotiated solution for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union and the Afghan Communist regime reasoned that the Soviet troops would leave Afghanistan once the threat from the Mujahideen was removed. To remove the threat from the Mujahideen, they demanded the United States and Pakistan to halt their support for the Mujahideen first and then the Soviet forces would withdraw. However, the United States and Pakistan contended that the Mujahideen was not the cause but the consequence of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and therefore the Soviet troops must withdraw without any preconditions.  Seeking regime change  The removal of the Communist regime … was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict.  In addition to the issue of the Soviet troops, there was another issue at stake which was not overtly part of the negotiations in Geneva but important to both the Soviet Union and the United States. Besides a withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the United States and Pakistan sought a regime change in Kabul. The removal of the Communist regime in Kabul was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict. For that reason the US government, under Jimmy Carter, had supplied covert financial assistance to the Mujahideen about six months prior to the Soviet invasion. However, for the Soviet Union the survival of the regime in Kabul was of paramount importance because according to the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, the primary reason for the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan was to prevent the fall of the regime.  Withdrawal and noninterference  Hence, the two main issues in the Geneva Talks were withdrawal of the Soviet troops and noninterference. Noninterference referred to a cessation of the US and Pakistan’s support for the Afghan Mujahideen. By implication it also meant that the United States and Pakistan would not pursue a regime change in Kabul.  Differences over who would rule Afghanistan after a withdrawal of the Soviet forces withheld progress in the Geneva Talks for several years. In June 1985, following the ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev as the leader of the Soviet Union, the US and Soviet governments launched bilateral negotiations over regional issues, including Afghanistan.  [Gorbachev] was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union.  The new Soviet leader was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union. However, the commencement of bilateral US-Soviet negotiations on Afghanistan meant that the Geneva Talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan was merely a proforma exercise. This meant that substantive negotiations took place between the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union, and their outcomes manifested in the Geneva format which was nominally taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In November 1985, Premier Gorbachev and President Reagan met in Geneva. Afghanistan was part of the agenda, and once again, a main point of contention between the two leaders was about the status of the Afghan government. Gorbachev proposed declaring Afghanistan a nonaligned state followed by a withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Reagan, however, demurred. He pointed out that the president of Afghanistan — Babrak Karmal — was a Soviet client and therefore implied that it was not feasible to establish Afghanistan’s nonalignment without a replacement of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.  The Soviet Union, however, aimed to preserve the regime in Kabul. In early 1987, the Afghan Communist regime launched a National Reconciliation Program. The program — funded by the Soviet Union — was designed, in addition to offering a share of power to Mujahideen leaders, to lure individual Mujahideen commanders to reconcile with the regime by offering them financial and economic incentives. In other words, the objective of the National Reconciliation Program was to integrate the Mujahideen within the existing political structure in Kabul. Nonetheless, the Mujahideen rejected the program, as they vowed to continue the fight until the destruction of the Communist regime. In Washington, President Reagan also dismissed the Soviet-funded reconciliation program as a “sham.”  Failed reconciliation and intensifying conflict  The failure of the National Reconciliation Program and an intensifying conflict in Afghanistan prompted the Soviet Union to shift its policy from seeking to preserve the Communist regime to preventing a government led by the Mujahideen. In early December 1987, Soviet officials informed their American counterparts that the Soviet Union had made a decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. They urged the Americans to consider mutual interests. A Mujahideen-led government, the Soviet officials said, would also complicate American interests in the region.  Around the same time, Gorbachev and Reagan held another meeting in Washington. On 9 and 10 December 1987, the two leaders discussed the issue of Afghanistan. Reflecting the change in the Soviet position, Gorbachev said that Afghanistan was not a socialist country but a “semi-feudal pluralistic” country. The Soviet Union, he added, was no more concerned about how the people of Afghanistan chose to live. He invited Reagan to “think together in a businesslike approach” to establish a neutral government in the context of a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.  The US position, however, was that a neutral government could not be established without the removal of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Hence, Reagan proposed disbanding the military structures of the Afghan Communist regime in the context of a Soviet withdrawal. In other words, Reagan wanted to dismantle the ruling regime and then “start from scratch.”  Breaking the deadlock  Two months after the Washington Summit, Gorbachev announced on 9 February 1988 that the Soviet Union was ready to start the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan on 15 May 1988 and to complete it within ten months. He added that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was no more conditional on an agreement about the future government of Afghanistan. That, he said, is “none of our business.”  The unilateral announcement by Gorbachev broke the insistent deadlock in the Geneva Talks which had been taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan but without substantial progress. However, two months after Gorbachev’s announcement, the Geneva Talks concluded in April 1988 with the signing of the Geneva Accords which, among other elements, set a nine-month timeframe for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan.  Letting the conflict take its course  Following the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in February 1989, the two superpowers allowed the conflict between the Mujahideen and the Afghan Communist regime to take its course. The expression of this policy was best exemplified in a conversation between Gorbachev and the US Secretary of State, James Baker, in February 1990. Referring to the ongoing war in Afghanistan, Gorbachev said: “Let them boil in their own juices over there.” To which, Baker responded: “When you said, ‘Let them boil,’ I thought we have the same feeling.”  ***  Rahmat Hashemi is a Doctoral Researcher at PRIO.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3MucHJpby5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS90aGUtb3RoZXItcGVhY2UtcHJvY2Vzcy1vbi1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi1nZW5ldmEtdGFsa3MtMTk4Mi0xOTg4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:30:00","As Imran’s bête noire, Gen. Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges  When the relatively unknown and perceptibly dour Gen. Syed Asim Munir took over as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff from the barrel-chested and garrulous Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa on November 29, 2022, it seemed like a change of sensibilities and perhaps even narrative. Gen. Bajwa’s initial “selection” (2018 elections) and later “ejection” (2022 no-trust vote) of Imran Khan was completed. Gen. Bajwa hung up his boots while the vainglorious Imran was given the boot! But it wasn’t the end as Imran kept ranting, provoking and getting under the Pakistan Army’s skin. Beyond Gen. Bajwa and the current ISI chief (Lt. Gen. Nadeem Anjum), Imran called out the ISI number two (Maj. Gen. Faisal Naseer, “Dirty Harry”) to shame the “establishment”. It was a pressure test for Gen. Munir. Imran baited, Gen. Munir bit hard. Ultimately, no change of narrative resulted.  In hindsight, Gen. Munir was always the establishment’s “chosen one” — meaning of Gen. Bajwa. The reasons are clearer now. Gen. Munir had tellingly overcome the technicality of getting “selected” for COAS despite his then retirement date as a lieutenant-general falling on November 27, while Gen. Bajwa was to doff his uniform only by November 29, yet Gen. Munir defied the odds of required adjustment. The farce of Schedule V-A of Pakistan’s Rule of Business says: “The appointment of, and above the rank of, lieutenant-general in the Army and equivalent ranks in the other defence services will be made by the Prime Minister in consultation with the President”. The real McCoy for passing the COAS’ Malacca cane was singularly Gen. Bajwa, representing the establishment. Incidentally, the sitting Pakistan President, Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi, is a founder member of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI): he couldn’t possibly have been allowed to exercise his mandated choice, not in the circumstances then prevailing.  As a rare Shia COAS, Gen. Munir faces the onerous task of exhibiting his fidelity to the “establishment” and steely resolve to the nation, just as it drove the only two other Shia COAS — Gen. Muhammad Musa and Gen. Yahya Khan — to wars with India in 1965 and 1971. Gen. Munir carries the unsaid burden of proving himself in a deeply sectarian society. He was ISI D-G when the Pulwama attack took place on February 14, 2019. Not responding or succumbing to Imran’s accusations about Pakistan’s Army was not an option.  Lo and behold, on May 9, 2023, Imran was bumped into a personnel carrier of the Punjab Rangers and whisked away rather unceremoniously for a former Prime Minister. It was reminiscent of the arrests of Iskander Mirza in 1958 (Ayub Khan’s coup), Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1978 (Zia-ul Haq’s coup) and Nawaz Sharif in 1999 (Pervez Musharraf’s coup). Gen. Munir moved against a man who seemed to be unsettling the Deep State even more than the ruling civilian government.  Gen. Munir earned his place at the top with the critical “one crescent, one star and three crowns” on his epaulettes (as a brigadier), directly under then X Corps commander Gen. Bajwa. Clearly not wet behind his ears in terms of societal posturing, Gen. Munir is a Hafiz-e-Quran (one who has memorised the complete Quran). Unlike many flamboyant colleagues, he served “under the radar” and seemed “safe” (as was ironically, and wrongly, assumed for Ayub Khan, Zia-ul Haq and Pervez Musahrraf). Well-versed with the intrigues of Pakistan, Gen. Munir is the only COAS to have worn the dual hats of director-general of military intelligence and also director-general of ISI.  With the shortest tenure as the ISI D-G, due to his unusual questioning of the corruption trail leading to the wife of then PM Imran Khan, Gen. Munir has his unhealed personal history with him. As Imran’s bête noire, Gen. Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges, while posted as XXX Corps commander. However, as ISI D-G, he would have been wise enough to know the consequences of pointing fingers at the PM’s wife, so presumably he would have only been doing Gen. Bajwa’s bidding to send out a message to Imran to adhere to the establishment’s playbook. But Imran didn’t confine himself to the establishment’s red lines. While Gen. Munir was to be the sacrificial lamb in 2019, he romped home in 2022 as the dark horse who became the all-powerful COAS.  If ever there was any doubt about Gen. Munir as Gen. Bajwa’s acolyte, it was put to rest with his “taking stock” of the situation, as Pakistan’s generals tend to do historically, whenever they or their institution stand to get besmirched. Whether Imran Khan has tripped Gen. Munir into making him an ever-bigger hero in the public eye, or, has bitten more than he can chew, will depend on how the emotions get manufactured and controlled in the days and weeks to come. But the “establishment” has moved decisively, and committed itself to a point of no return — at least for the next two and a half years of Gen. Munir’s tenure. Imran stands to be politically neutralised (not physically, as he melodramatically claimed, as that would irreversibly turn the public tide against the Army).  So, brace yourself for sneaky leaks, sleazy exposés and corruption charges against “Taliban Khan” (as the world increasingly sees him), that will be gleefully and dutifully supported by the discredited ruling side and scared judiciary. Whenever the “establishment” decides to do something, they usually get it, legitimately or illegitimately. Gen. Munir has turned out to be a chip of the old block!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFuYWdlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvMTYwNTIzL2Job3BpbmRlci1zaW5naC10YXJnZXQtaW1yYW4tZ2VuLW11bmlyLWEtdHJ1ZS1zb2xkaWVyLW9mLXBhay1kZWVwLXN0YXRlLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXNpYW5hZ2UuY29tL2FtcC9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvMTYwNTIzL2Job3BpbmRlci1zaW5naC10YXJnZXQtaW1yYW4tZ2VuLW11bmlyLWEtdHJ1ZS1zb2xkaWVyLW9mLXBhay1kZWVwLXN0YXRlLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But the Republican interpretation of the final Durham report will feed a narrative of “Deep State” corruption that is fueling not only Mr. Trump’s quest for the White House in 2024 but that of many of his rivals for the Republican nomination. The vilification of federal bureaucracy was already an emerging theme in the fight to be the Republican standard-bearer. Regardless of Mr. Durham’s actual conclusions, his report appears to serve that theme.  Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mr. Trump’s closest competitor in the still-early Republican primary race, promised on Monday “to clean house” at “weaponized federal agencies,” which he said had “manufactured a false conspiracy theory.”  “Heads need to roll,” another competitor, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, said.  Mr. Trump had termed the Russia investigation “the crime of the century,” and with no one doing time for that crime, the Durham report could still prove to be Exhibit A in how the American right seems to be living in its own universe — and how Mr. Trump still dictates the parameters of that separate reality.  On his Truth Social website, Mr. Trump said the special prosecutor had concluded that “the FBI should never have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!” In fact, Mr. Durham said he agreed that the F.B.I. should have opened a preliminary investigation.  “I, and much more importantly, the American public have been victims of this long-running and treasonous charade started by the Democrats — started by Comey,” Mr. Trump told Fox News Digital. “There must be a heavy price to pay for putting our country through this.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3VzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2R1cmhhbS1yZXBvcnQtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLXJlYWN0aW9uLmh0bWw_YWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrJm1vZHVsZT1XZWxsJnBndHlwZT1Ib21lcGFnZSZzZWN0aW9uPVVTJTIwTmV3c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But if the Welsh club want to stay in the EFL, or challenge for promotion from League Two, they will need to bring in some fresh faces this summer. Manager Phil Parkinson already boasts an impressive squad but knows there is always room for improvement.  Wrexham's Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney want to sign Gareth Bale, but that is highly unlikely to happen. Yet there's a chance they will lure some more former internationals to the Racecourse after persuading Ben Foster out of retirement.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  Foster's short-term deal with Wrexham will expire shortly, but the club are in talks with the former England goalkeeper, 40, over an extension. It will be difficult for Foster to say no after the joyous celebrations that followed Wrexham's title triumph.  One area of the team that Parkinson doesn't need to worry about too much is the defence. Wrexham boasted the third-best defence in the National League this season thanks to a solid back three, with Jordan Tunnicliffe, Ben Tozer, Eoghan O'Connell, Aaron Hayden and Thomas O'Connor all impressing at different times in the year.  O'Connell, 27, is likely to continue playing in defence having only signed from Charlton in January. Tunnicliffe, 29, Tozer, 33, Hayden, 26, and O'Connor, 24, also have EFL experience and will continue playing while Parkinson looks for long-term replacements.  Who do you think Wrexham should sign this summer? Let us know in the comments below!  At right-wing-back, Ryan Barnett, 23, was snapped up from Solihull Moors in February and will be confident of playing in League Two next season. On the opposite flank, Danny Rose could make a shock move to Wrexham to reignite his football career.  The Champions League finalist, 32, has expressed a desire to make a comeback but will want the right club after a year out of the game. Considering the bond between Reynolds, McElhenney and the club's employees, Wrexham could be the perfect fit.  The same could be said about Danny Drinkwater, who would be a huge coup for the Welsh club. The Premier League winner, 33, has also been without a club since last summer but recently admitted he was ""waiting for an offer to excite me"". You heard him, Wrexham.  Drinkwater could form a partnership with James Jones in midfield. The Scot, 27, has played 88 games for Wrexham during the last two years and has plenty of experience in the EFL, making more than 200 appearances in League One and League Two combined.  In terms of the No.10 role, Jonny Williams would be an ideal candidate. The Welshman, 29, helped his country reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and has played at every level in the Football League. His contract with Swindon will expire next month.  But who plays alongside Paul Mullin? The 28-year-old could be joined by his former strike partner Joe Ironside, 29, who has just been released. The pair scored 48 goals between them to fire Cambridge to promotion from League Two during the 2020/21 campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL3dyZXhoYW0tdHJhbnNmZXJzLXJ5YW4tcmV5bm9sZHMtZm9zdGVyLTI5OTk2NDQx0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2Zvb3RiYWxsL25ld3Mvd3JleGhhbS10cmFuc2ZlcnMtcnlhbi1yZXlub2xkcy1mb3N0ZXItMjk5OTY0NDEuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Early this year, the regime halted insurance payouts for families of 66th Light Infantry Division (LID) soldiers killed in Kayah (Karenni) State whose bodies could not be recovered. They are listed as missing in action rather than dead, a source close to families of the 66th LID told The Irrawaddy.  “They are not listed as dead because [the Myanmar military] does not want to give insurance payouts,” he said.  The 66th LID is based in Inma town on the Yangon-Pyay Road some 20 miles to the south of Pyay in Bago Region, and overseen by the Southern Command.  Soldiers who have recently deserted say the bereaved families are not receiving the money owed to them for two reasons. Firstly, corrupt officers are pocketing the payments, and secondly the regime wants to impose news blackouts on the heavy military casualties it is suffering.  The payments were made for regime soldiers who died in clashes with the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine State between late 2018 and November 2020 even when their bodies could not be retrieved, said Hein Zaw Oo, a 19-year-old private who defected from the army in April.  “But lately, [the military] has not been sending death benefits and bank savings for soldiers whose bodies cannot be retrieved,” he said.  Hein Zaw Oo last served in Light Infantry Battalion 2 based in Kyaikto, Mon State. The battalion is under the command of 44th LID and is fighting the Karen National Union and People’s Defense Force in Karen State.  It is mandatory for junta soldiers to buy life insurance. Privates are required to buy a minimum two-year policy worth 500,000 kyats (US$ 238 at the official exchange rate) and pay a monthly premium of around 8,400 kyats.  Also compulsory for military personnel is saving money at the military-owned Myawaddy Bank, and buying shares in the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.  Defector Ye Htet Kyaw, who served as a private in Light Infantry Battalion 341 based in Karen State’s Papun, said battalion commanders would siphon off the money when the dead soldiers had no relatives, or their relatives could not be contacted.  “My superior died after stepping on a land mine while carrying food supplies. He had around two million kyats in his bank account. The battalion commander took the money after his death and said it was deposited in battalion funds. I don’t buy it.”  An estimated 14,890 junta soldiers were killed, and nearly 5,000 wounded in the 12 months after armed revolution began on June 1, 2021, following the military coup in February that year.  CDM captain Htet Myat said: “Most military family members do not know how much military personnel have paid for insurance premiums. Only the soldiers themselves know. And insurance certificates are usually kept at battalion offices. And some family members don’t know about the insurance, in which case they do not get death benefits.”  As family members do not know the insurance amount paid, battalion commanders never give death benefits in full, said defector Ye Htet Kyaw.  “If there is three million kyats in the bank, family members only receive 1.5 million kyats” he said.  Former captain Htet Myat said officers have been siphoning off life insurance payouts since before the coup, listing soldiers killed at front line as missing in action. But the exploitation has worsened since the coup, he added.  Previously, Myanmar military personnel had been required to buy life insurance at state-owned company Myanma Insurance. But since 2015, four years after Min Aung Hlaing became the military chief, military personnel have been required to take out insurance with Aung Myint Moh Min Insurance Co, which is owned by Min Aung Hlaing’s son, Aung Pyae Sone.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXJtYS9teWFubWFyLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWNvbW1hbmRlcnMtcG9ja2V0aW5nLWRlYWQtc29sZGllcnMtaW5zdXJhbmNlLXNvdXJjZXMuaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlycmF3YWRkeS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXJtYS9teWFubWFyLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWNvbW1hbmRlcnMtcG9ja2V0aW5nLWRlYWQtc29sZGllcnMtaW5zdXJhbmNlLXNvdXJjZXMuaHRtbC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When Mohi el-deen Jibril checked his phone on May 11, he saw his name on a list of people accused of betraying the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Instantly, he thought of leaving his war-torn country.  “Seven journalists appeared on the list, but I was the only one still in Sudan,” Jibril, 48, told Al Jazeera. “I have since received threats from many people. Two [wrote to me on WhatsApp] and said that after the army kills the RSF, they will come for me next.”      Since fighting erupted in Sudan between the army and the RSF last month, supporters from both sides have threatened journalists for criticising human rights violations by both sides, according to the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate.  The number of journalists who have been targeted or intimidated remains unknown, but Al Jazeera identified six people who were told that they would be hurt or killed if they continued reporting abuses.  Many others have appeared on lists circulating on social media, where those mentioned are accused of betraying Sudan in an apparent effort to incite violence against them. The list that Jibril was on was shared in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese journalists, but he later discovered it on Facebook, too.  As a veteran television reporter, Jibril has been critical of the army for derailing popular aspirations for democracy by spearheading a coup in October 2021. Now, he fears he could be killed.  “I haven’t taken any position in the war, neither in favour of the RSF or army,” said Jibril. “But the people threatening me keep saying that I should support the army.”      Muzzling dissent  Several journalists also told Al Jazeera that members of the National Congress Party (NCP), which is tied to the political Islamic movement in Sudan and former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir, are implicated in intimidating journalists.  Members of the NCP have reportedly smeared civilian politicians and incited violence against medics. Many NCP loyalists also hold senior positions in the army and blame RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo for turning against al-Bashir in the face of a popular uprising in April 2019.  Now, they are claiming that anyone who appears neutral is against the army and with the RSF.  “I don’t know some of the people that threatened me, but others I recognise as [remnants] from al-Bashir’s regime,” said Jibril.      Another journalist, who asked Al Jazeera not to disclose her name for fear of reprisal, said she criticised the RSF in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese media workers after reports that the paramilitary was raiding and looting homes and raping women.  One member in the group who supports the RSF then sent her an ominous message: “He said, ‘Go ahead and keep talking. I’ll be waiting for you. I’ll be waiting,’” she told Al Jazeera.  “The [threats] are coming from both sides. Supporters of the army are making [threatening] calls and [sending threatening] messages to journalists that they perceive to be pro-RSF and the RSF is making calls to people that they think are pro-army,” said Abdelmoneim Abu Idriss, the elected head of the journalists’ syndicate.  Kholood Khair, a Sudan expert and the founding director of the Confluence Advisory think tank, added that both generals are very clearly aligned in suppressing free speech.  “They are not just against each other … but they are very aligned and have always been aligned … in destroying the parts of the state that they don’t like and parts of Sudanese political life that they don’t like,” she told Al Jazeera.      Raids and attacks  On Thursday, the RSF reportedly stormed the media office of the independent newspaper el-Hirak el-Siyasi to intimidate staff and steal their belongings, according to the syndicate.  In the same week, it reported that an RSF fighter shot photojournalist Faiz Abubakr in the back while he was filming clashes on the street. The RSF then detained, interrogated and beat Abubakr, accusing him of spying for military intelligence.  “Journalists are in real danger,” said Mohamad el-Fatih Yousif, a member of the Sudanese Journalists Network, a press freedom group. “Nobody is allowed to take a neutral position.”  Al Jazeera contacted RSF spokesman and political adviser Youssef Ezzat to ask him about the group’s reported threats and attacks against journalists.  “I didn’t hear about any incidents against journalists and actually the RSF cooperates with journalists and reporters for TV channels,” he said.  None of the journalists who spoke to Al Jazeera described the RSF as cooperative, with some adding that they were thinking of fleeing the country out of fear of being targeted by the group or the army.  ‘Duty to stay in Sudan’  But Abu Idriss said that while he understands why his colleagues would escape Sudan, he believes journalists must stay to offer a factual narrative of the war.  “Both sides in the conflict have their information machines on social media that make fake news, publish hate speech and spread propaganda. For this reason, journalists need to stay, so that we have neutral voices,” he told Al Jazeera.  Abu Idriss added that he won’t leave his colleagues behind as the head of the press syndicate.  “It’s my duty to stay in Sudan,” he said. “I have to try and protect [journalists].”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTYvc2lsZW5jaW5nLWRpc3NlbnQtam91cm5hbGlzdHMtaW4tc3VkYW4tZmFjZS10aHJlYXRzLXJhaWRz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTYvc2lsZW5jaW5nLWRpc3NlbnQtam91cm5hbGlzdHMtaW4tc3VkYW4tZmFjZS10aHJlYXRzLXJhaWRz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:51:48","The decision by EU leaders to allow new cars running on fuels derived from captured carbon dioxide to be sold beyond 2035 was a coup for the auto industry. But opinion is divided over what this means for Europe’s electrofuels (e-fuels) ecosystem, which is largely driven by start-ups and scale-ups.  E-fuels are direct substitutes for conventional fossil fuels such as petrol, diesel and aviation kerosene. To classify as carbon neutral they must be made from hydrogen generated by electricity from renewable sources and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Although this carbon dioxide is emitted again when the fuel is burned, there is no net contribution to the atmosphere.  That is the basis for the case e-fuels are environmentally sustainable. However, the current process for producing them, by using renewable electricity to split water and produce hydrogen and then combining it with carbon dioxide under pressure and with the use of a catalyst, is highly energy inefficient.  For Amy Hebert, chief executive of Danish start-up Arcadia eFuels, the last-minute decision taken in March to allow new cars running on e-fuels onto the market represents an opportunity. “It’s a huge step,” she said. While electric vehicles will go a long way to decarbonising road transport, she thinks a substantial market will remain for e-fuels.  “If cars can be electrified, that makes absolute sense. In cases where that can’t happen, and people need to drive long distances, then we believe e-fuels are an appropriate alternative,” she said.  Others are not so sure. Swiss solar fuel producer Synhelion expects the opportunity to be small. “As sustainable fuels are generally used where electrification is difficult to implement, we do not believe that the decision will have a major impact,” said Carmen Murer, the company’s head of corporate communications.  Norsk e-Fuel, headquartered in Oslo, also sees little in the decision to make it change its plans. “We are specifically focusing on the sectors where we know there is currently no alternative if you want to have a substantial impact on reducing emissions quickly,” said Luisa Wagner, the company’s communications manager.  Aviation is seen as the sector where e-fuels will find a home. Electrification is challenging, even for short flights, and the use of e-fuels is backed by legislative quotas. Until March there was no such legislative opening for road e-fuels. And even if the decision is implemented, the automotive industry still needs to get behind it.  “E-fuel projects such as ours are dependent on the industry supporting our plans, and so far we have seen a much stronger interest and drive from the aviation sector,” said Wagner.  The eFuel Alliance, which lobbies for the industry in Brussels, is also clear that the opportunity is not yet in the bag. “It’s just a declaration right now. We need concrete proposals from the Commission, and then to see how these will be worked out,” said Ralf Diemer, the Alliance’s managing director.  e-fuel only vehicles  A road map for implementing the decision is expected by the autumn of 2024. The first step is likely to be a regulation for the type approval of vehicles exclusively powered by e-fuels. Work will also be required to define how these vehicles contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction targets.  The use of e-fuels in existing vehicles will also receive support in legislation. A revision to the Renewable Energy Directive, also agreed in March, sets a mandatory quota that covers advanced biofuels and e-fuels in the transport sector. The revision also contains an option for a binding sub-quota for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, which covers the direct use of renewable hydrogen as well fuels derived from it. Still subject to confirmation by the Parliament and Council of Ministers, both measures would support the development of a market for e-fuels.  For the industry, there is considerable work to be done to meet the existing mandates for e-fuels in aviation and shipping, let alone any eventual road transport market. Start-ups are important players in doing that.  “The big oil companies are the natural choice for producing these products,” Hebert said, “but the regulatory landscape is still a little bit uncertain for them, and the size of production is smaller than what they are used to, at least at the beginning.” This is because of limitations in renewable energy supply and electrolyser maturity. “So it is up to start-up companies to get this market going.”  Diemer also sees start-ups and scale-ups playing an important role. “Especially when it comes to the technologies around electrolysers, around CO2 technologies, around improving efficiency, a lot of new players are on the field, and they are often start-ups,” he said. “This abundance of start-ups underlines that we are operating in an innovative and emerging market.”  However, for industrial scale production they will have to work with the oil industry. “I don’t think this value chain will be possible without big oil,” Diemer said. “You need a lot of capital, you need the industry’s knowledge and distribution channels to put a product in place. And you might also need to use its refineries.”  He thinks it will be interesting to see how start-ups position themselves as the market evolves, with some electrolyser specialists already broadening their scope to support the whole e-fuel production chain, or moving into production.  This is the case for Ineratec, which in April started work on an e-fuel production plant in Frankfurt. “So far, Ineratec has been a technology producer, but now it has decided to run a first production site by itself, together with partners, and in the end it might end up as a fuel producer,” he said  The chemistry of e-fuel production is well established. One route is the Fischer–Tropsch process, developed in the 1920s to convert coal into liquid fuels. The other is to use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to create methanol, which can then be shipped or stored for use as a fuel feedstock. In both cases the technology is mature, so it would be relatively simple for companies producing e-fuels for one sector to pivot to another if demand changed.  Arcadia eFuels, for example, was set up in 2021 to leverage various technologies for the production of e-fuels in transport applications. The company plans to build its first plant at the Port of Vordingborg in the southern part of Zeeland, with production currently scheduled to begin in 2026.  “With the plants we are building we are able produce e-kerosene for jet fuel, we can produce e-diesel for long-haul trucks, for cars or for the shipping industry, and we also produce naphtha, which is a product that can be used for gasoline blending,” Hebert said.  Intermediate product  Norsk e-Fuel is a consortium formed in 2019 including electrolyser technology company Sunfire and carbon capture specialist Climeworks. The company's first production facility, at Mosjøen in northern Norway, is also due to come on line on 2026, and it recently signed a partnership agreement to supply fuel to Norwegian, Norway’s largest airline.  It uses the Fischer-Tropsch route to produce a synthetic crude oil. “From that intermediate product we can do anything that you do with oil, so from a technical point of view we could easily adapt our process to produce diesel or gasoline,” Wagner said.  Regardless of where the fuel is used, the e-fuel industry faces a number of hurdles when it comes to scaling up production. These include development of carbon capture infrastructure, the availability of renewable energy, and production of the technical components.  And there is scope for further innovation. “Electrolyser efficiency is currently around 70%, but there is no reason that cannot increase to more than 95% over the next five to ten years,” said Hebert.  More work also needs to be done on carbon capture. “The ideal technology is direct air capture, but this is currently too expensive and inefficient for industrial production. So, this will require a lot of research and development,” Diemer said.  Even where technology is proven in other spheres, work is required to apply it to e-fuels. “We are filing several patents on the integration of these technologies, which have never been put together in this way before,” Hebert said. “So there is quite a lot of innovation there, and ways to reduce cost.”  Although the chemical processes involved are mature, there is scope for innovation to provide further efficiencies. Already in its first plant, Norsk e-Fuel is planning to integrate a co-electrolyser based on solid oxide cell technology. This makes it possible to combine two process steps in the conventional approach, and to re-use heat generated in the Fischer-Tropsch process.  “Since electricity is the main cost driver in the production of e-fuels, that means more productivity for any given amount of electricity and less cost for the final product,” Wagner said.  Finally, there needs to be political support for the development of the industry and surrounding value chains. “The challenge lies in the industrial scale-up, which we don’t have right now, since we produce only small amounts of e-fuels,” Diemer said. “Unfortunately, the political framework conditions at EU level are thwarting precisely this ramp-up.”  Investment is particularly challenging for the companies. “The e-fuel projects that are ramping up production now are all first movers,” Wagner said. “It’s a new value chain, a new market, and a new product, and those innovations accumulate. So we need investors who are not too risk averse and ready to take on new opportunities.”  Help is also required if e-fuels are to compete on price with fossil fuels. Hebert draws a parallel with wind and solar energy, whose price has fallen dramatically over the past two decades so that it is now competitive with fossil fuels. “I think the same will be true of e-fuels, but we need more incentives and government support to make that happen,” she said.  The challenge for producers in Europe is that the incentives and penalties are aimed at users, such as airlines, or the fuel distributors, not at the companies making the fuels. “In the US, with the Inflation Reduction Act, the incentives go directly to the producer,” Hebert said. “That means the producer can lower the overall price to the end user, so then you’re sure that more plants will get built.”  One aspect of this political support is stability. In this respect, the March decision on new cars was not necessarily a positive development. Made at the last-minute following strong pressure from the German government, some see it as setting a dangerous precedent.  “Where negotiations have been going for years on decisions that industry needs in order to ramp up production, we think it is dangerous if states can intervene at the last moment,” Wagner said. “So, even if it gives us a market in the future, we concerned about the way it came about.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW5jZWJ1c2luZXNzLm5ldC9uZXdzL01vYmlsaXR5L2Vjb3N5c3RlbS1ldXJvcGVzLWVsZWN0cm9mdWVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1wcmVwYXJlLWxpZmUtcm9hZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-15","15:07:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:40:15","United States USMNT might finally have answer to striker problem in Folarin Balogun Updated May. 16, 2023 3:07 p.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link  Folarin Balogun and the United States Soccer Federation had only just been notified by FIFA early Tuesday morning that the Arsenal striker's petition to represent the U.S. in international competition instead of England had been approved.  Yet within a few hours, the news was already reverberating on both sides of the Atlantic, with global soccer's governing body soon confirming the Brooklyn-born, London-raised Balogun's one-time switch of allegiance. The intense interest in Balogun's decision is understandable in both countries.  Balogun becomes the latest in a parade of highly regarded young dual citizens to choose the U.S. over more decorated programs in recent years. In 2020, midfielder Yunus Musah also opted for the Stars and Stripes over England; last November, Musah played all 90 minutes in a scoreless draw with the Three Lions at the World Cup.  ""To represent the United States means a lot,"" Balogun said in a press release. ""I'm very proud and honored to have this opportunity, and I want to give everything I have to make our team successful.""  U.S. fans are even more excited about Balogun, who just happens to fill the Americans' most glaring positional need. The 21-year-old has 19 goals in 34 games on loan from the Gunners to French team Reims this season.  Balogun instantly becomes the leading candidate to start at center forward for the Americans in next month's CONCACAF Nations League semifinal against chief rival Mexico.  ""Having the opportunity to play against Mexico in a rivalry match would be amazing,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I can make a difference.""  ADVERTISEMENT  Another recruiting coup for the U.S., maybe the most important yet  Like many countries, the U.S. has been fielding dual nationals for decades. And like most others, they've also lost some along the way — most notably New Jersey product Giuseppe Rossi, who opted to play for Italy in the mid-2000s.  But the Americans have been on a roll since 2019, when then-USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter and then-U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart flew to the Netherlands to secure the commitment of fullback Sergiño Dest, who was being aggressively recruited by the Dutch. Musah joined up a year later. So did others during Berhalter's four years at the helm, including forwards Jesús Ferreira (Colombia), Ricardo Pepi (Mexico) and Daryl Dike (Nigeria).  Berhalter and his staff didn't land everyone they wanted. But by and large, U.S. Soccer has been wildly successful in this space in recent years — success that has built on itself.  Musah spent time with Balogun in Arsenal's academy and shared his positive experiences with the U.S. program with his former (and now future) teammate, a source confirmed to FOX Sports. The Americans' showing at the World Cup in Qatar didn't hurt, either, nor did the fact the U.S. will host the Copa America next summer and the World Cup in 2026.  ""It's almost too good to be true,"" Balogun said. ""To have the World Cup in America is just crazy, and then to be the host nation and my first World Cup, it's all come together nicely. Some things are just meant to be.""  However it happened, it's another clear coup for the U.S. And given Balogun's age, pedigree and obvious scoring touch, he has a chance to end up being the most impactful of them all.  No coach? No problem for Balogun  The timing of Balogun's decision says a lot about how far the USMNT has come since failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The program's first contact with the player came last year, through Berhalter. Berhalter's contract expired last year, and while recently hired U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker insists he's a candidate to return, the uncertainty didn't dissuade Balogun any.  Not only did the USMNT not have a coach when U.S. Soccer rolled out the red carpet for Balogun in Orlando in late March, Crocker wasn't yet on board. Neither was Oguchi Onyewu, who effectively became Crocker's deputy last week. Former USMNT general manager Brian McBride had departed months earlier.  None of that organizational uncertainty moved Balogun to wait to make his choice. The fact he picked the U.S. without even knowing which coach will be making the lineup decisions between now and 2026 speaks to how comfortable he was, how sure he is that playing for his birth nation — which he left at age 2 — is the best option.  ""In the end, it became a no-brainer,"" Balogun said of his decision. ""It feels like I'm at home here.""  That's a testament to the culture that has been built in the American dressing room.  Newcomer could lead American line for years  While Musah and other recent commits lauded how they were immediately accepted by their U.S. teammates, and while the Americans no doubt did all they could to make Balogun feel welcome when he visited their camp, the on-field fit was surely also a factor.  Harry Kane is England's captain and starting striker when healthy, and he's still just 29. Behind him are at least two other established Premier League scorers: Marcus Rashford and Callum Wilson.  The U.S., meanwhile, has been without a clear-cut center forward since Jozy Altidore's days with the national team ended in 2019. Three different men — Ferreira, Haji Wright and Josh Sargent — started games for the Americans at the World Cup. Only Wright scored in Qatar. Balogun has more goals this season than any of them, plus Dike and Pepi, despite playing in a stronger league.  The opportunity for Balogun is clear. He withdrew from England's U-21 camp in March and flew to Florida only after England senior team boss Gareth Southgate didn't name a replacement for the injured Rashford. Now, he's likely to make his full international debut inside a packed NFL stadium in Las Vegas in less than a month, with plenty more high-profile games to follow.  ""It's a really young, energetic squad and for sure the potential of the squad is amazing,"" Balogun said. ""I think I can add my qualities.""  In the end, the chance to quickly establish himself as the guy for the Americans for the better part of the next decade simply was too attractive for Balogun to pass up.

To contribute, click here.  •••  The 10th Ward violence has been a long time coming, and no one cares till it's filmed (""DFL melee is a sign of the times,"" editorial, May 16). The truth is the politics of division and derision were on display during the failed Jan. 6 coup, and at the Minneapolis 10th Ward convention. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, this is an American political system issue.  What needs to be addressed is not only the behavior of those on the floor; there must be accountability for those running for office and seeking the party endorsement. I lived in the 10th Ward for over a decade, till two years ago. I watched the escalation, especially in the last four years, toward this politics of division, derision and hate: ""Those not supporting me are the enemy.""  The races are not about ideas, a vision of leadership and unity after a hard-fought race. It's us vs. them. You only talk to your base and rile them up by saying in subtle ways that your opponent and their supporters are the enemy.  Until the party stands up and holds the candidates responsible for sparking this and the supporters who follow through with the inevitable violence responsible, nothing will change. The party needs to draw the line. If violence is not the answer, then hold everyone accountable. But we all know nothing will be done and the politics of hate will just grow stronger, and everyone will lose.  David Schlosser, Minneapolis  GUN LEGISLATION  Popular in the abstract  In response to a May 15 letter about gun legislation: Thank for your spirited take on Minnesota's public safety bill. I must, however, correct a few misinterpretations.  Public policy polling doesn't equate to support for specific legislation. The devil, as they say, is in the details. When the minutiae of a policy are revealed, public approval fluctuates dramatically as people learn the actual scope of legislation.  When we question the potential political fallout for Sens. Grant Hauschild, Rob Kupec and Judy Seeberger, we're not issuing threats but merely observing the political pulse of their districts. It's not a threat to predict a storm when the clouds are already gathering.  The ""cloak and dagger"" approach to passing this bill, sneaking language into a 500-plus-page omnibus bill after it never saw the Senate floor, thus avoiding a clear up or down vote, doesn't scream ""confidence in constituent support"" to me. It's more like a shell game meant to obfuscate their intent from their voters. That's not bravery, it's political subterfuge.  And let's touch on the ""independent spirit"" of these senators. On the campaign trail, and even during session, they've pledged to be mavericks, but one glance at their voting record shows they fall in line with their party like ducks in a row. Independence isn't just a word; it's an action. And sometimes, it means disagreeing with your party.  We don't make threats; we advocate for the rights of Minnesota's peaceable gun owners. It'd be nice if our senators did the same.  Rob Doar, Blaine  The writer is a lobbyist for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.  ELECTIONS  State can empower average voters  According to Open Secrets, 2022 national midterm elections fundraising skyrocketed to $8.9 billion, a new record. The U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling made it legal for corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to campaigns in the name of free speech. Regardless of political affiliations, wealthy special interests look out for themselves, not everyday Americans. Two items at the Minnesota Legislature are flying below the radar that could strengthen our democracy by reducing candidates' dependence on big money.  The first is in the state government and election omnibus bill. It would triple the Campaign Finance Board's public subsidy program for political candidates who register with the board. The public subsidy program was started in 1974 in response to the Watergate scandal. A candidate must sign and file a public subsidy agreement to qualify for the program. They have to abide by the disclosure and fundraising requirements the board sets.  For years the budget has stagnated at $1.2 million per biennium for candidates running for office. That amount comes from the general fund and is equally divided among all candidates of major political parties running for a specified office. If the conference committee includes this provision, it will increase by $2.1 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a total of $3.3 million. This means less money to raise and more time communicating with voters about the issues that matter to them.  The next is in the Senate tax omnibus bill. The Senate and House have proposed to increase the political contribution reimbursement program from $50 per individual to $75 and for married couples from $100 to $150. If passed, it would increase the proportional importance of small donors and average Minnesotans so that candidates do not depend as much on large contributions, lobbyists or special interests.  Earlier this session the Democracy Dollars bill was introduced that would issue a $25 dollar voucher to each voter to donate to candidates. It didn't advance. Seattle adopted this program in 2015 with great success. It's seen that it not only reduces the influence of big contributors but it encourages more people to run for office, increases the number of voters and gives everyday people a bigger voice in their elections. We've been advocating for a voucher program since 2017 and hope to see it return in the next biennium.  We must restore balance and create a system where every citizen has an equal vote and say. More public financing of campaigns is good for democracy and is a bipartisan issue. We urge the tax committee and the state government and elections conference committee to include these increases in their final reports, for the House and Senate to pass them so they can be signed by the governor and be available for the 2024 election.  Mary Hartnett, Minneapolis  The writer is executive director, Clean Elections Minnesota.  DURHAM REPORT  Where was the detailed coverage?  Admittedly the report by John Durham into the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion allegation was less than the ""blockbuster "" President Donald Trump promised. Nevertheless, the 306-page report should have been treated with far more importance than the Star Tribune gave it, limiting its coverage to two paragraphs on page A6, which reported only that Durham accused the FBI of a ""lack of analytical rigor"" (""Durham issues final Russia inquiry report,"" May 16). With another presidential election on the horizon, Durham's findings should have been given far more comprehensive coverage.  Durham's conclusion that the FBI ""failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law"" when it launched its investigation into the Trump campaign using ""seriously flawed information"" is of major importance if we are to avoid a repeat in 2024. His finding that the FBI rushed to investigate the Trump campaign even as it proceeded cautiously on allegations related to his Democratic opponent suggests it favored one candidate over another. Its disparate treatment went even further, giving defensive briefings to the Clinton campaign that were denied the Trump campaign. The report went so far as to suggest the FBI should have considered whether it was being ""manipulated for political or other purposes.""  Democracy is threatened when its premier intelligence agency demonstrates a clear preference of one candidate over another. That is the importance of the Durham report, and for that reason it merited far more comprehensive coverage than it was given by this paper.

"coup","2021-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:03:38","As an underdeveloped country, Myanmar has long been vulnerable to corporate crimes. Since the country’s transition to democracy in 2010, it has faced pressure to implement effective reforms and regulations for companies, particularly in relation to foreign investments. One crucial aspect of these reforms has been the protection of human rights (HR) violated by corporations. However, due to the Military Coup in February 2021, legal reform progress has been halted, and the country is now facing even more serious human rights violations. Therefore, this article aims to shed light on the problems with existing laws and enforcement mechanisms concerning human rights violations from an Environmental Human Rights (EHR) perspective. Additionally, it proposes potential solutions under the current circumstances.  Legal Framework  In Myanmar, the concept of corporate crime is relatively new to regulators and law enforcement agencies. This is evident in the recent laws that regulate the Environmental Human Rights (EHR) Protection Agenda. The notion of corporate social responsibility related to EHR was only introduced in 2012 through the Environmental Conservation Law and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in 2015. Other regulatory developments include the Myanmar Investment Law and Rules, which establish a licensing procedure for projects with significant environmental and community impacts, the Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Area Law of 2018, and the Forest Law of 2018. For the purpose of this article, these laws will be collectively referred to as “the Legal Framework.”  Despite the existence of this Legal Framework, exploitation and abuses persist, indicating its ineffectiveness in deterring companies from committing EHR violations. Thus, this article aims to identify the reasons why the Legal Framework falls short in deterring EHR offenses and explore alternative approaches to achieve deterrence.  Issues  According to American legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, a successful legal system must possess the following characteristics: (1) generality, (2) publicity, (3) prospectivity, (4) clarity, (5) consistency, (6) stability, (7) capacity to be performed, and (8) congruence (Fuller’s eight principles). The failure of the Legal Framework in Myanmar may be attributed to a lack of adherence to some of these principles. A more comprehensive examination is required to determine which of the eight principles are lacking in the Legal Framework. This article primarily highlights issues related to congruence and clarity.  The issues identified in this article are as follows:  1) Inefficiency of Punishments  The Legal Framework criminalizes all environmental offenses, and the available punishments are divided into three categories: civil penalties, administrative penalties, and criminal actions. Administrative penalties empower relevant government agencies to impose fines, business suspension or closure, and blacklisting, among other measures. Alternatively, civil and criminal actions can be pursued, with prosecutors presenting cases before the court for stronger sanctions such as imprisonment or larger fines, in accordance with the Attorney-General of the Union Law of 2010. Notably, prosecutors in Myanmar do not currently possess the discretion to enter into Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) or Non-Prosecution Agreements (NPAs) that would incentivize organizational reform. Consequently, it can be concluded that the Legal Framework in Myanmar leans towards retribution and deterrence theories rather than the reformative theory.  To effectively deter corporate crimes, the laws should be designed to increase the costs and reduce the profitability associated with such offenses, given the profit-driven nature of companies. However, the available sanctions under the Legal Framework are insufficient to shift this balance.  Under the existing Framework, the highest fine for environmental offenses is set at USD 10,000.  Although this amount may carry significance for individuals, it represents a low risk for companies engaged in investments that can have a substantial impact on the environment. Additionally, administrative officials have the authority to impose other penalties alongside fines. However, the lack of clear guidelines is a legal concern. As Professor Fuller mentioned in his aforementioned book, “Obscure and incoherent legislation can make legality unattainable by anyone, or at least unattainable without an unauthorized revision, which itself impairs legality.” When officers are granted discretionary power without proper guidelines, the consideration for effective deterrence is often overlooked. For instance, under the Forest Law, the arresting Forest Officer possesses the authority to cancel permits as a form of punishment. However, there are no rules or guidelines regarding the determination of such penalties, such as considering the scale of the offense, the nature of the offender, or the impact of the offense. Consequently, it is less likely that corporate offenders are deterred from committing crimes.  It is worth noting that some of these laws allow for criminal sanctions, where the amount of fines is determined based on the judge’s discretion. Although this represents progress towards achieving deterrence, it can also be ineffective for three reasons:  Court procedures are often time-consuming, which may delay addressing urgent environmental issues. There is a lack of guidelines for judges to consider factors such as the size of the company and the scale of the impact. Most judges have limited exposure to large companies and environmental assessments, which can hinder their ability to impose larger fines.  2) Compliance and Enforcement Issues  Congruence between official action and the law is essential for the functioning of a legal system. One factor that can impair congruence is “stupidity.” Strong evidence of this can be observed in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure and its implementation gap. The World Bank’s 2019 Report identified issues with the implementation of the EIA procedure, highlighting the slow progress in approvals. For example, out of 1,971 Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) submitted, only 112 were approved in 2019. Compared to the data from 2018, the approval rate had only increased by 4. The report also recognized the limited technical capacity and resources of the EIA Division to effectively review EIAs/IEEs/EMPs. These findings demonstrate that the existing EIA procedure cannot function properly given the current capacity of the officers.  Professor Fuller has pointed out additional challenges to congruence, including bribery, prejudice, and the pursuit of personal power, collectively known as “corruption.” In 2022, Myanmar ranked 157 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, marking a new low in the ranking after the Military took over the country in February 2021. Prior to the coup, corruption in Myanmar was monitored by the Anti-Corruption Commission. However, following the conviction and accusation of corruption against State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the commission lost its credibility. This situation has created opportunities for government officials to engage in corruption. Furthermore, the new political situation has caused a 16% rise in the inflation index, leading to socio-economic difficulties in the country. This puts significant strain on government officials whose salaries are already low. Additionally, due to the revolution, many government officials have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement, resulting in a labor shortage within the government system. As a result, those who choose to remain in the system become susceptible to corruption either due to personal strain or the lack of supervision and opportunity. The prevalence of corruption among officials has created a culture of neutrality, further exacerbating the issue.  This corruption incentivizes the growth of corporate crimes in the country due to the administrative discretionary power held by government officials, as mentioned earlier. This situation is particularly problematic in cases of environmental offenses, as most issues and complaints arise from communities in remote areas where large-scale projects are taking place. Consequently, this corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the Legal Framework intended to deter offenders.  Solution  Under normal circumstances, these issues could be addressed through legislative amendments, training programs, or rigorous monitoring. However, given the ongoing unrest in Myanmar, creative solutions are required.  In Myanmar, the People’s Republic of China (China) is the second-largest investor, reportedly holding 23.48% of foreign investments. Specifically, many small-scale Myanmar operations in the mining sector, particularly in border areas, receive informal backing from Chinese capital. These projects are expanding rapidly after the coup and are unlikely to comply with environmental standards. The corrupted local officials and military regime are unwilling to interfere with these projects due to their shared private interests. This article proposes that this situation could be addressed through the implementation of Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) measures mandated by the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence.  According to the Interpretive Guide to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provided by OHCHR, HRDD is “an ongoing management process that a reasonable and prudent enterprise needs to undertake, in light of its circumstances (including sector, operating context, size, and similar factors) to meet its responsibility to respect human rights.” While the concept of HRDD is reflected in many international standards, none of these standards, principles, and guidelines are legally binding or require corporations to actively engage. This lack of binding requirements hampers corporate compliance. However, a new EU Directive aims to change this. Under this Directive, EU companies will be obligated to conduct due diligence throughout their entire value chain, including subsidiaries and cross-border independent third parties, to ensure the protection of human rights and the environment, regardless of the presence or absence of laws in third countries. This obligation expands the corporate liability of EU companies and imposes pecuniary fines, compensations, or other legal remedies for HR and EHR violations committed by their affiliated companies.  Being the major actor in global value chain, Chinese companies work closely with the companies in the EU Market. In fact, China holds $770 million FDI in the EU. The Directive, therefore, will surely have impact not only on the local Chinese companies but also those in the third-world countries like Myanmar where the productions of raw materials are taking place. This impact will, hopefully, indirectly help reducing the HR and EHR violations in Myanmar.

AFP via Getty Images  One month after fighting between Sudan's two military factions broke out in the capital, Khartoum, internationally-brokered peace talks in Saudi Arabia have yielded no solution. Airstrikes and artillery continued to pound the country's capital and surrounding regions in recent days, and violence has also spread to the long-embattled Darfur region in the west. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said Monday that more than 600 people had been killed and over 5,000 injured as a result of the fighting. The real toll is expected to be far higher. Almost a million people have fled their homes, both to locations within Sudan and across the border to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, those who have stayed put often have no access to essentials despite a commitment from the two warring factions to restore access to food and electricity. Prices of food and fuel have soared, exacerbating malnutrition and hammering the local economy. Warring generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (or ""Hemedti""), leader of the Rapid Support Forces, show no signs of halting the conflict as they vie for total control of the state's military and government, natural resources and 46 million inhabitants. The U.S., U.N. and Saudi Arabia are brokering talks between the two sides, though tentative cease-fires and commitments to allow humanitarian corridors into the sprawling country have collapsed almost immediately.  'The needs are immense'  The IRC warned Monday that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate unless all parties involved prioritize the protection of civilians. ""We know there are many uncertainties for people right now, but one thing that's clear is the needs are immense, immediate and will be for a long time,"" said IRC Vice President for East Africa Kurt Tjossem. ""The longer they remain in these conditions, the more vulnerable they become to disease, hunger, and other hardships."" Things have come a long way from 2021 when Burhan and Hemedti led a military coup that ousted the civilian government of Abdalla Hamdok. Since then, the SAF and RSF had been sharing power in Khartoum to facilitate what most Sudanese citizens hoped would be a transition back to civilian rule. The World Bank and several global powers froze aid to the country after the military takeover, honoring calls from civilians not to legitimize its leadership. However, Burhan and Hemedti's divergent political visions were never reconciled, and the fragile power-sharing arrangement began to unravel in early April, culminating in the breakout of a full-scale conflict in Khaartoum on April 15.

Amanuel Sileshi / AFP via Getty Images  In a speech at the UN Human Rights Council last week, U.K. Minister for International Development and Africa Andrew Mitchell stressed the importance of the international community in helping to revert Sudan to the ""political track"" by sending a ""united message of concern and of horror"" and breaking the ""cycle of impunity in Sudan."" Yet many Sudanese believe that despite the efforts of various regional and international bodies, the Jeddah talks — lacking a substantial civilian voice and the threat of harsh international sanctions against the generals and their respective inner circles — will not be part of the solution.  Rewarding 'belligerence'  Sudanese-Australian writer, broadcaster and activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied told CNBC last week that global leaders had inadvertently given Burhan and Hemedti political legitimacy and rewarded their ""belligerence,"" leaving the majority of Sudanese who long for civilian government unrepresented. Both the SAF and RSF benefit from financial and political support from foreign powers including Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, the University of Cambridge's Associate Professor Sharath Srinivasan told CNBC last month. While Benjamin Hunter from risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said these close relationships make it more difficult for a resolution to the conflict to be found imminently. Targeted and collaborative efforts by the international community to exert pressure on the countries supporting Sudan's military factions were needed, Abdel-Magied said. ""If [their] resource[s], financial and otherwise, can be throttled, then we might actually be able to find the right kind of incentive that's going to make them stop fighting,"" she told CNBC via telephone.  watch now","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvc3VkYW4tb25lLW1vbnRoLW9uLXdoeS1jZWFzZS1maXJlcy1hcmUtZmFpbGluZy1hbmQtd2hhdC1nbG9iYWwtbGVhZGVycy1hcmUtbWlzc2luZy5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvc3VkYW4tb25lLW1vbnRoLW9uLXdoeS1jZWFzZS1maXJlcy1hcmUtZmFpbGluZy1hbmQtd2hhdC1nbG9iYWwtbGVhZGVycy1hcmUtbWlzc2luZy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2025-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:02:00","By Khalid Abdelaziz  DUBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - Air strikes and artillery fire intensified sharply across Sudan's capital early on Tuesday, residents said, as the army sought to defend key bases from paramilitary rivals it has been fighting for more than a month.  The air strikes, explosions and clashes could be heard in the south of Khartoum, and there was heavy shelling across the River Nile in parts of the adjoining cities of Bahri and Omdurman, witnesses said.  The fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has triggered unrest in other areas of Sudan, especially in the western region of Darfur, but is concentrated in Khartoum.  It has caused a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region,displacing more than 700,000 people inside Sudan and forcing about 200,000 to flee into neighbouring countries.  ""The situation is unbearable. We left our house to go to a neighbour's house in Khartoum, escaping from the war, but the bombardment follows us wherever we go,"" said Ayman Hassan, a 32-year-old resident.  ""We don't know what the citizens did to deserve a war in the middle of the houses.""  Fighting has surged both in Khartoum and in Geneina, capital of West Darfur, since the two warring parties began talks in Jeddah brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United States more than a week ago.  The talks have produced a statement of principles around providing access for aid supplies and protecting civilians, but mechanisms for setting up humanitarian corridors and agreeing to a ceasefire are still being discussed.  The army has relied mainly on air strikes and shelling, only occasionally engaging in ground fighting, as it tries to push back RSF forces that took up positions in neighbourhoods across Khartoum soon after the fighting erupted on April 15.  The RSF attacked major military bases in northern Omdurman and southern Khartoum on Tuesday in an apparent attempt to prevent the army from deploying heavy weaponry and fighter jets, residents and witnesses said.  The army has been trying to cut off RSF supply lines from outside the capital and to secure strategic sites including the airport in central Khartoum and the major Al-Jaili oil refinery in Bahri.  The war began after disputes over plans for the RSF to join the army and the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal for a political transition towards civilian rule and elections.  Army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, took the top positions on Sudan's ruling council following the 2019 overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising.  They staged a coup two years later as a deadline to hand power to civilians approached, but both sides began to mobilise their forces as mediators tried to finalise the new transition plan.

"coup","1979-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Grenada"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:00:00","Jennifer Hosten was 23 years old when she made history, as the first Black woman to be crowned Miss World. Footage of that evening, on 20 November 1970, was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall in London to about 100 million viewers worldwide, and shows Hosten, representing Grenada, looking radiantly beautiful and endearingly stunned, as host Bob Hope places the winner’s crown on her head.  Her moment in the spotlight had already been overshadowed, however. Approximately 40 minutes earlier, the proceedings were interrupted when a group of women’s liberation activists began sounding football rattles and throwing flour-bombs in protest at what they saw as an egregious display of sexism.  Hosten, who was backstage at that point, could only hear the demonstrators. “I don’t think I was scared,” she says, “but the sound made us wonder what was going on. People thought the contest had come to an end.” Once order was restored, a visibly shaken Hope returned to the stage and attempted to assign meaning to the melee: “I want to tell you anybody that would try to break up an affair as wonderful as this … with these wonderful girls from the entire world, have got to be on some kind of dope!”  Hosten as Miss World in 1970. Photograph: Bill Zygmant/REX/Shutterstock  In the half-century since, Miss World 1970 has been touted as an example of the need for “intersectional feminism”, before the phrase had even been invented. Was the contest ever really intended as a celebration of international womanhood? Or was it always just an organised excuse for an ogle? Either way, in the eye of the storm, Miss World herself found some clarity: “It seemed like all these things were supposed to happen, that it was meant to be,” says Hosten, who is now 75, from her home just outside Toronto, Canada. “At that point, I realised how much I had to do on my own.”  Even if the event made her a global celebrity, Miss World was by no means the culmination of Hosten’s career: she would go on to travel the world, meet movie stars and heads of state, obtain several advanced degrees and have a ringside seat for history in the making. She has very much written her own script.  Hosten was born in 1947 in St George’s, the picturesque capital of her Caribbean island home, the youngest of five children. It was an idyllic childhood, characterised by morning sea-swims and evenings spent gathered around the radio, which fostered a patriotism that Hosten has carried throughout her life. “When I look back on my childhood I realise I really was quite blessed,” she says. “We didn’t know about drugs and we didn’t have social media to contend with. We made our own fun.”  Jennifer Hosten with her brother Robin, her mother and father, and her sister Pommie. Photograph: Sutherland House  As her parents were professionals – her father a prominent lawyer, her mother a schoolteacher – there were standards to live up to, but the family were not part of any island elite, she says. “Grenada is a small community, so the structures are not so defined, not like in England,” although she describes Grenadians at the time as more class conscious than colour conscious. “Most of us were of mixed blood,” she says, and describes her own heritage as including African, Scottish, Flemish and Carib Indian.  The radio was Hosten’s main window into a world beyond Grenada, and after leaving school, she pursued a career in broadcasting, eventually travelling to London, aged 18, to enrol on a BBC training scheme. After nearly two years in the UK, and six months as an au pair in France, she returned to Grenada a cosmopolitan, bilingual, polished woman of 20 – an ideal candidate to work as a flight attendant for British West Indies Airways.  It was in this role that a series of events – “what you might consider coincidences, which I don’t think are coincidences, really” – propelled her towards her date with destiny at the Royal Albert Hall. There was a fateful in-flight meeting with the recently crowned Miss Guyana; happening to pick up a discarded newspaper reporting Grenada’s plans to send a representative to Miss World; and bumping into an old friend whose mother was the head of Grenada’s tourist board. He persuaded Hosten to compete, suggesting Miss World would be no different from the traditional carnival queen contests she had participated in as a teenager. “They were never really about beauty. They were always more about promoting the culture of the island,” she says. “Throughout the Caribbean, you were considered ‘attractive’, rather than ‘beautiful’; and that meant that you had a nice smile, that you presented yourself well.”  I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know?  Miss World was very different. “The objectification was exemplified by having to turn around for your backside to be judged,” she says. “Even back then, it was shocking, because I never had to do that in Grenada. And it was shocking to my daughter, who later saw the contest. She was embarrassed for me. She said: ‘Oh Mum, I can’t imagine that you had to do that!’” Hosten is also a little embarrassed for her younger self, watching the footage back. “It seems so corny. I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know? But that’s what it was.”  Her win made the front pages around the world, but Hosten was disturbed by the tone of much of the reporting. “The first time I ever saw myself as a minority was when I came to England for Miss World, because the day after I won, the headline was: Miss World is Black,” she says. “I found it shocking that your colour or race should be a headline … because even if they thought of me as Black, was that the most important thing for them to be highlighting?”  The same articles often included allegations that the contest must have been rigged, since the judging panel included the Grenadian premier, Eric Gairy. Hosten found this risible: “There were three British judges, there was also an African judge, a judge from Denmark, I think there was a judge from India … and all of a sudden, the one from Grenada should have made the difference?” It seemed to her the fuss was a cover for their true objections: “It was really because there were two women of colour [Pearl Jansen, Miss Africa South, placed second], and the fact that I wasn’t the standard European type of winner. [In their minds] I could not possibly, naturally, have been able to win. It was hurtful.”  Protesters invade the Royal Albert Hall during the 1970 Miss World contest. Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty Images  Coming face to face with the women’s lib protesters was, by comparison, less disconcerting. When crowds singing the protest song We Shall Overcome accosted an official Miss World coach en route to the Royal Albert Hall that day, she remembers some of the contestants on board joined in the singing. “Well, at one level we thought, this is a women’s demonstration, and we’re women.” Hosten says she agreed with much of what the UK women’s liberation movement had to say, but they made one great tactical error: “They never reached out to us at any point in time, to explain anything about what they were trying to achieve, or who they were against.”  If they had, she would have tried to describe to them her experience – as a woman of colour from one of the smallest nations in the world – and how it might differ from theirs, as white women in the UK. “I was able to represent women that really had not had an opportunity like this. And let’s be frank: it was a stepping stone for most of us. I never saw myself as a beauty contest winner, really. I saw it as an opportunity, which I took, to have an experience, and to make some money!”  At that time, the simple fact of a Black woman being proclaimed the world’s “most beautiful” sent a powerfully countercultural message. While the “Black is beautiful” movement had been challenging internalised racism among African Americans since the early 1960s, in much of the western world the existence of women with darker skin tones or afro hair textures was ignored by the media and the cosmetics industry. “It was always a job to find something that would really complement my skin,” says Hosten. “When I won, no cosmetic companies or hair product companies contacted me to advertise for them, as they had done for previous Miss Worlds.”  Hosten realised she was also carrying a banner for long underrepresented women of colour from all over the world: “I think I was one of the first Miss Worlds to be invited to Africa, for instance. I didn’t accept the invitation to South Africa, during the height of apartheid, but I did go to Nigeria, and pass through Ghana, and they were wonderful to me, just like a homecoming.”  Hosten and Bob Hope on Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Photograph: AP  If Hosten’s only goal had been personal advancement, she’d likely have parlayed her Miss World fame into a showbiz career. There was ample opportunity, including all the contacts she made on Bob Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Despite Hope’s self-perpetuated reputation as a womaniser, she describes the man she got to know as an avuncular, if slightly detached figure, who continued to send her a Christmas card every year for decades afterwards. “It was only ever addressed to ‘Miss World, Jennifer Hosten, Grenada’, but somehow it always got to me.” Then there was a teatime tête-à-tête at Joan Crawford’s New York home, which Hosten remembers as a flurry of small dogs and big hats, during which the Hollywood star personally invited Hosten to enrol at her acting school. Instead, after fulfilling her year of contractual obligations, she went a different way.  Many beauty queens claim to strive for “world peace”, but few have put those words into action as literally as Hosten has. A year after Miss World, she married a Canadian IBM manager named David Craig and set up home with him in rural Ontario, where they raised two children and Hosten did the daily commute to her customer relations job at Air Canada on a snowmobile. One day in 1978, however, she received a phone call from Gairy, by then the Grenadian prime minister, inviting her to serve as high commissioner (equivalent to ambassador) to Canada.  Being a woman meant she was expected to be ambassador and ambassador’s wife, combining her diplomatic duties with the full domestic schedule of a mother of two. “I would have to come home and plan the cocktail parties, organise the childcare. I remember an occasion where [former Canadian PM] Pierre Trudeau came to my home and read the children a bedtime story … That was quite special.” Special, but also a nightmare of parenting logistics: “I was the one that had to arrange for them to actually go to bed, and here I was, also the ambassador.”  Any notion that this would be a ceremonial role was soon dramatically disproven. “I was returning from a UN meeting in Ecuador when the government fell,” she says, referring to the 1979 coup in Grenada led by Maurice Bishop, the leader of the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement (NJM) and an old acquaintance from her London days. “I had to very quickly use whatever skills I had, and get recognition for the new government. I think I was instrumental in that, actually.” Hosten stayed on until 1981, through what would turn out to be one of her nation’s most tumultuous chapters. She is critical of the fallen Gairy government, describing it as “verging on authoritarian” and presiding over a long discontented populace: “The people wanted independence [from Britain, which happened in 1974], but they didn’t want independence under that government.” The NJM government, however, soon descended into something “much worse … total abuse of power, the doing away of all freedoms”. In 1983 Bishop was executed by dissident members of his own party, triggering a US invasion. These are events that Hosten is still sorting through in her mind. “There is actually much more to that story that I can tell, that I will sometime write about. I don’t know if they’ll ever publish it.”  With their children grown up and their careers taking them to different countries, Hosten and her husband divorced after 28 years of “a fairly good marriage”. She went on to marry – and separate – twice more and accept other high-level diplomatic and trade roles, including at the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and Canada’s High Commission in Bangladesh before, aged 60, retraining once again, as a psychotherapist and counsellor. These days Hosten is a proud grandmother who enjoys a close relationship with her family, as well as keeping in touch with the many friends she has made around the world. Throughout all her reinventions, she has retained the grace and sincerity that won her that 1970 title.  Hosten at the Misbehaviour premiere in London, in 2020. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy  In 2020, the events of the 1970 Miss World were dramatised in the movie Misbehaviour, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hosten and Keira Knightley as Sally Alexander, the organiser of the women’s rights protest. It was during the publicity tour for Misbehaviour, listening to Knightley discuss her choice of acting roles, that Hosten landed on a useful analogy forher own sense of identity: “She’s played pirates in the Caribbean, and been in Jane Austen adaptations, and lots of other types of movies, because actresses don’t like to be typecast,” she says. “Well, people don’t want to be typecast … I didn’t want to be remembered just as a beauty contest winner, because there are so many other sides to us.”  This plurality of womanhood is what Hosten hoped – and still hopes – to convey: “I don’t know how far [the women’s movement] has come in the sense of really including the interests of a broader section of women,” she concludes. “But I do think they achieved a great deal and I really have to congratulate them. What, it seems to me, is still missing, is asking: who are we to be limiting the roles of other women?”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjMvbWF5LzE2L2plbm5pZmVyLWhvc3Rlbi1maXJzdC1ibGFjay1taXNzLXdvcmxkLWdyZW5hZGHSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIzL21heS8xNi9qZW5uaWZlci1ob3N0ZW4tZmlyc3QtYmxhY2stbWlzcy13b3JsZC1ncmVuYWRh?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There are 228 days left in the year.  Today's Highlight  On May 17, 1954, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court handed down its Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision which held that racially segregated public schools were inherently unequal, and therefore unconstitutional.  On this date  In 1536, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared the marriage of England's King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn invalid after she failed to produce a male heir; Boleyn, already condemned for high treason, was executed two days later.  In 1940, the Nazis occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World War II.  In 1946, President Harry S. Truman seized control of the nation's railroads, delaying — but not preventing — a threatened strike by engineers and trainmen.  In 1973, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate began its televised hearings into the Watergate scandal.  In 1980, rioting that claimed 18 lives erupted in Miami's Liberty City after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four former Miami police officers of fatally beating Black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.  In 1987, 37 American sailors were killed when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. (Iraq apologized for the attack, calling it a mistake, and paid more than $27 million in compensation.)  In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a measure requiring neighborhood notification when sex offenders move in. (""Megan's Law,"" as it's known, was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994.)  In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages.  In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that young people serving life prison terms should have ""a meaningful opportunity to obtain release"" provided they didn't kill their victims.  In 2015, a shootout erupted between bikers and police outside a restaurant in Waco, Texas, leaving nine of the bikers dead and 20 people injured.  In 2017, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.  In 2020, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was tested for the coronavirus on live TV as he announced that all people in the state who were experiencing flu-like symptoms were eligible for tests.  Ten years ago: The ousted head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven Miller, faced hours of intense grilling before Congress; both defiant and apologetic, Miller acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status, but insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions. Jorge Rafael Videla, 87, the former dictator who took power in Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands during a ""dirty war"" against alleged subversives, died in Buenos Aires while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity.  Five years ago: With six Democrats joining Republicans in voting to confirm her, Gina Haspel won Senate confirmation to become director of the CIA. The Miss America Organization announced that it would now have women in its three top leadership positions, after an email scandal in which male officials were caught making vulgar and insulting comments about past winners.  One year ago: President Joe Biden condemned the poison of white supremacy and said the nation must ""reject the lie"" of the racist ""replacement theory"" espoused by a shooter who killed 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York. Mariupol appeared on the verge of falling to the Russians as Ukraine moved to abandon the steel plant where hundreds of its fighters held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city.

"coup","2017-09-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 13:05:00","Before-and-after images have revealed the devastation caused by deadly Cyclone Mocha.  The powerful cyclone came ashore in Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe, with wind speeds of up to 130mph, according to the country's meteorological department.  Figures for the number of deaths in Myanmar - a country run by military leadership following a 2021 coup - have yet to be independently verified.  State media, which is tightly controlled by the military junta, have reported around two dozen deaths and hundreds of others injured due to Mocha.  However, residents of the western region of Rakhine state, where there is a large population of Rohingya Muslims, said at least 100 people had died and many more were missing and feared dead.  Scroll across the before-and-after pictures to see the extent of the damage in the city of Sittwe, where homes have been destroyed, roofs have collapsed and public buildings left damaged.  As much as 90% of the city has reportedly been destroyed, while the area has been declared a natural disaster zone.  Others images show what is left of a coastal road and bridge covered in seawater and dirt thrown up from the storm.  Pictures from inside the town show paths and roads blocked off in the aftermath of the cyclone.  Before-and-after images also show the significant damage to Sittwe University - a technical university focused on science and engineering.  The pictures show a number of buildings on the campus with collapsed roofs and blown-out windows.  In other images, an old lighthouse, which remains as a historical landmark, appears unscathed, while a number of buildings around it appear damaged by the cyclone.  The storm is one of the worst since Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of southern Myanmar - one of Asia's least developed nations - killing nearly 140,000 people in 2008.  Thousands of people living along the western coast of Rakhine state were evacuated or moved into shelters before the cyclone came ashore.  Story continues  But at camps for displaced Rohingya, the presence of aid agencies is spotty and help from the country's military government is negligible.  At the world's largest refugee camp in neighbour Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, Rohingya from Myanmar were moved to safer areas until Cyclone Mocha passed - potentially saving thousands of lives.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in total more than 700,000 people were moved to cyclone shelters or makeshift facilities including schools and mosques.  On Monday, rescuers evacuated about 1,000 people trapped by seawater 3.6 meters (12 feet) deep along western Myanmar's coast.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2N5Y2xvbmUtbW9jaGEtaW1hZ2VzLXNob3ctZGV2YXN0YXRpb24tMTMwNTAwMjM4Lmh0bWzSAVdodHRwczovL3VrLnN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2N5Y2xvbmUtbW9jaGEtaW1hZ2VzLXNob3ctZGV2YXN0YXRpb24tMTMwNTAwMjM4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The shipment included blankets, kitchen sets and mosquito nets for 500 families, the IFRC said in a statement.  Another shipment was expected in the coming days containing medical supplies.  “Most of our aid supplies were already distributed to people in need, despite some being looted in Khartoum and Darfur,” said IFRC Regional Director for Africa Mohammed Mukhier. “So, this international humanitarian shipment comes at a crucial time as it will help the Sudanese Red Crescent Society to assist people caught between the conflict and the next flooding, which is typical in the country.”  Since the fighting broke out more than a month ago, at least 600 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization.  The conflict has displaced more than 700,000 people within Sudan, while another 200,000 have fled to neighboring countries, the United Nations said.  The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.  The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.  Tensions between the generals have been growing over disagreements about how the Rapid Support Forces should be integrated in the army and who should oversee that process. The restructuring of the military was part of an effort to restore the country to civilian rule and end the political crisis sparked by the 2021 military coup.

He aims to turn up the pressure on the ruling junta, and cut off their financial resources, and he sees this week's G7 summit in Hiroshima as an opportunity.  Kyaw Moe Tun has been a thorn in the side of Myanmar's military regime ever since it seized power in a February 2021 coup. He was appointed ambassador to the United Nations under the democratically elected administration of Aung San Suu Kyi and remains loyal to the democratic government in exile.  The regime has tried more than once to unseat Kyaw Moe Tun, but the UN committee that oversees his tenure has so far allowed him to remain in the role, which he is now using to call for international support to restore democracy in his country.  ""The military has committed serious human rights violations amounting to the crisis, humanity, and war crimes,"" he says. ""It includes massacres, indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombings, wholesale burning of homes, and destroying our schools and hospitals. So many innocent people, including women and children, were brutally killed by the military.""  The pro-democracy National Unity Government, or NUG, says at least 168 people, including children aged 5 or younger, were killed in the Sagaing region on a single day in April. It is believed to be the deadliest attack since the junta seized power.  Human rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says that more than 3,500 people have been killed by the military since the coup, and the UN's refugee agency UNHCR says nearly 1.5 million people have been internally displaced.  Kyaw Moe Tun gave a three-finger salute at a UN General Assembly meeting in February 2021, a gesture that shows resistance against the military.  Kyaw Moe Tun is calling for an end to the violence and a return to democracy. He says it is essential to cut the military off from its revenue.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military,"" he says.  The Japanese government decided in 2021 that it would provide no new Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Myanmar. The Foreign Ministry says Japan provided 1.4 billion dollars worth in fiscal year 2019. But the government also said it would follow through on aid projects already promised.  The ambassador has rejected the junta's demands that he step down. In August 2021, investigators in the US uncovered a plot to assassinate him. But he continues to urge the international community to cut the military's funding sources and sees the upcoming G7 summit in Hiroshima as a chance for those nations to use their collective leverage.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military. I just want to urge Japan not to normalize engagement with the military junta when the military is killing its own people and committing area attacks on civilians,"" he says.  Kyaw Moe Tun says he hopes the situation in Myanmar is one of the main items on the agenda at the summit.  ""There are so many pressing issues in the world, from climate change to conflicts, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" he says. ""No doubt G7 leaders will pay attention to all these pressing issues. Myanmar is also one of the pressing issues that world leaders should pay attention to. It already has implications for regional peace and stability.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3My5uaGsub3IuanAvbmhrd29ybGQvZW4vbmV3cy9iYWNrc3Rvcmllcy8yNDU5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2019-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Turkey"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:37:06","(Natasha Pszenicki)  It was billed at the “world’s most important election” — pending the 2024 version, which will likely determine whether Donald Trump returns to the White House. Less international attention would usually attach to Turkey’s presidential race but when critical alliances are at stake, results matter far beyond the Golden Horn.  This vote is a reminder that autocracy is not easily dislodged. Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP (Justice and Development Party) has channelled regional resentments, Islamic frustration, strongman fantasies, and grudges against the country’s business and cultural elites to consolidate power for the best part of 20 years.  The result — Erdogan won just under 50 per cent of the vote, putting him in pole position in the run-off in a fortnight — is a setback. But it is not terribly surprising in a country where to be an opponent of the ruling party is an uphill struggle. Visiting Turkey for the past decade, each encounter has featured some conversation which provides a glimpse of over-weening power. Newspaper editors and publishers who refused to toe the line are stripped of jobs and assets. Professional groups who raise concerns about unsafe building practices, the backdrop to the country’s recent harrowing earthquake, find their leaders facing onerous “investigations”. The tax system is routinely used as a weapon against companies disfavoured by a corrupt and economically reckless leadership. The 2016 coup attempt was followed by a ferocious reckoning and waves of imprisonment — and a school curriculum bent since with Maoist determination to write history only as Erdogan would like it to be read.  Like many modern power-grabbers he also has support and the combination of that defiant base and the pre-electoral advantages of media domination, corruption and intimidation have won him 49.4 per cent of the vote. His centre-Left opponent Kemal KÄ±lÄ±çdaroÄlu, meanwhile, has underperformed in this election. Now both parties will scrap it out for the three million or so votes of the third party. It looks like a better shot for the incumbent. Erdogan also has a performer’s ability to hold the limelight. Mocking his rival, who had filmed campaign ads in his modest kitchen, Erdogan took to his party HQ balcony boasting, “Some are in the kitchen, we are on the balcony” and singing to the crowd. All this while insisting that Twitter bans opposition and anti-corruption accounts in the run-up to the vote.  Story continues  In short order, another Erdogan victory would be a headache for both Volodomyr Zelensky and Rishi Sunak, who held talks yesterday to advance UK support for supplying additional weapons to Ukraine to supplement a decisive counter-offensive against Russia — and training Ukrainian pilots to use Nato standard F-16 jets.  Turkey is already the main strategic beneficiary of the war. It serves the Kremlin’s interests by undermining Nato’s unity, helps Russia dodge Western sanctions and reaps dubious construction deals with cash advances to bail out an ongoing financial crisis.  Russia and China are the new “lenders of last resort” in a shaken global system, prepared to spend lavishly to buy loyalty or at least fealty. Erdogan’s prosperity track record is a sham — poor Turks struggle to buy staple goods.  Erdogan has played an advanced game of Risk, leveraging favours from both sides in the war. That is unlikely to change. Crucially, as an early member of Nato, Turkey has a central but often conflicted role in a security alliance on which the Ukraine war outcome depends. The blocking of Swedish accession is a signal of its ability to deploy cunning brinkmanship when its support can command a bidding war for favours and trade deals.  It’s no coincidence that one of the most astute James Bond novel plots, From Russia With Love, is set in Turkey as Soviet-inspired and Western spies battle it out for technological superiority. That fiction has roared back to life, with a 21st-century twist — an authoritarian leader eroding a fragile democracy and a doomed economic model.  That also poses a conundrum for the West — how far to indulge a wayward ally whose values are all wrong but who may re-emerge as key to a vital but vulnerable security compact? The nail-biting election will be decided in weeks. The consequences will resonate across Europe and beyond, down the decades.

"coup","2019-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Athens"", ""Attiki"", ""Greece""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:25:33","By Karolina Tagaris  SALAMINA, Greece (Reuters) – In working-class neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Athens, Spiros Richard Hagabimana is going door-to-door in an election campaign that could see him become Greece’s first Black lawmaker.  It is a remarkable journey for Hagabimana, who just eight years ago was jailed in his native Burundi for refusing to open fire on anti-government protesters as a high-ranking officer of the National Police.  It would also be a historic win in a country where migrants rarely hold official posts and where, less than a decade ago, the extreme-right Golden Dawn party was the third-most popular political force on a fiercely anti-immigrant agenda.  Dressed in a suit and tie, Hagabimana walks the streets of the constituency he is contesting in Greece’s May 21 election, meeting voters in farmers’ markets and cafes.  “I have an opinion about racism,” Hagabimana, 54, now a senior migration ministry official and candidate with the conservative New Democracy party, told Reuters in an interview.  “Racism cannot be fought with words alone. Racism is fought with everyday actions. When the other person is afraid of the unknown, you must give them an opportunity to come into contact with what they are afraid of.”  In a sign that Greek society is beginning to change, another Black candidate, Nikodimos-Maina Kinyua, the Kenyan-born founder of ASANTE, a non-governmental organization helping migrants, is also running with the leftist Syriza party in Athens, though he is seen as having less of a chance of winning a seat.  The district where Hagabimana is running, which includes the poverty-hit town of Perama and island of Salamina, just west of Athens, was a bastion of Golden Dawn at the height of Greece’s economic crisis in 2015.  Golden Dawn later imploded and its leaders were jailed over hate crimes in 2020.  For Hagabimana, it meant Greece had turned a page.  “(Golden Dawn) executives were in parliament. Now they’re in prison. I have faith in the Greek people,” he said.  ‘I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINISHED’  Hagabimana first arrived in Greece in 1991 on a scholarship to study at the Naval Academy.  When he graduated in 1996, Burundi was roiled by a military coup and he was forced to seek asylum in Greece. He studied law and joined New Democracy’s youth wing.  In 2005, the year he received Greek citizenship, Burundi’s 12-year civil war ended and Hagabimana decided to return to help peacekeeping efforts with the United Nations.  A decade later, the country was gripped by protests opposing a third presidential term. Hagabimana, then a National Police officer, refused orders to suppress demonstrators and was jailed and beaten, he said.  Recalling a night in prison, he said: “I knew if they hit me on the head I would have been finished.”  While in jail, a lawyer friend in Athens launched an international campaign for his release. He returned to Athens in 2016, with the help of Greek authorities.  Hagabimana’s agenda is business-focused, but he also hopes to inspire migrants that “they can be equal members of society… and that everything I achieved, they can do more”.  The colour of his skin should not be the focus, he said.  “It is more important to me that I am a Greek citizen by choice.”  (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Alex Richardson)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8va2Znby5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9idXJ1bmRpLWJvcm4tZXgtcG9saWNlLW9mZmljZXItc2Vla3MtdG8tYmUtZ3JlZWNlcy1maXJzdC1ibGFjay1sYXdtYWtlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:24:00","Much has been said about Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) plopping over $4 billion on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) last summer, only to sell most of those shares a few months later (and all the rest in this year's first quarter, according to Berkshire's new 13F filing).  Buffett and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have shared their thoughts on what happened. However, at Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual meeting, Buffett offered a little more insight into Berkshire's decision on the world's largest contract chipmaker, and what he would be looking for in an alternative semiconductor stock.  Buffett says TSMC is like no other, but...  When asked (again) about selling Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), Buffett reaffirmed that he likes the business -- a lot. In fact, Buffett said ""[TSMC] is one of the best-managed companies and important companies in the world,"" and that ""there's no one in the chip industry that's in [TSMC's] league, at least in my view.""  You could also make a very solid argument that TSMC stock was dirt cheap the summer and autumn of 2022, and still is, at less than 13 times trailing-12-month earnings. With the entire semiconductor industry expecting a rally in sales in the back half of 2023 and into 2024, TSMC's earnings could be headed higher as soon as this summer, which would make the stock even cheaper (assuming stock price stays the same). That also satisfies Buffett's buying a ""wonderful company at a fair price"" criteria.  So here's the catch: Buffett dislikes instability, and TSMC's location in Taiwan unsettles him. As I wrote a few months ago, it's possible that Buffett changed his mind after the U.S. CHIPS Act was passed last August. After that, the U.S. started dialing up its restrictions of advanced chips and chip manufacturing equipment to China. That, in turn, has led to rising China-U.S. tensions, as well as China's hints it might invade Taiwan to reunify it with mainland China.  Such an event would be disastrous for TSMC, not to mention the global economy and its reliance on the advanced chips TSMC makes.  What does Buffett want in a semiconductor stock?  Buffett said he wants to find that wonderful business in the semiconductor industry like TSMC, but he wants to ""find it in the United States.""  Currently, as Buffett stated, there currently isn't anyone who can operate with the same level of chip manufacturing or financial precision of TSMC -- in the U.S., or anywhere else. Perhaps Intel can pull off a coup and retake the manufacturing crown, but that will be a very expensive multiyear process, if it succeeds at all. At least as far as semiconductor manufacturers go, don't count on Buffett buying anything anytime soon.  But manufacturing is just one area of the chip industry. There are high-quality, dominant names based in the U.S. That said, fair values are tough to come by. There's no way Buffett and company are ever going to invest in an Nvidia or AMD. Charlie Munger has expressed his dislike of companies like this that have to reinvest lots of cash into new research and development to maintain their technological edge, rather than return most of that cash to shareholders.  However, the semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers are one corner of the chip industry that could fit all three of Buffett's metrics. Most of this space is dominated by just five companies:  These businesses have been around for decades and operate in an oligopoly. That means they face little in the way of competition, the entire semiconductor industry relies on their equipment to make chips, and they thus enjoy high rates of profitability.  Applied Materials especially fits the bill because it has the broadest range of tools covering all parts of the chipmaking process, it's valued reasonably (under 16 times trailing-12-month earnings), and it's based in the U.S. And it also pays a growing dividend and repurchases lots of stock.  This is just my opinion on a stock that would fit within Warren Buffett's framework. As it stands right now, Berkshire Hathaway is continuing its aversion to high tech, focusing instead on more industrial companies with well-entrenched business models. If Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't make the cut for Buffett, I'm not sure any other business in the space will either.  10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway  When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

He also suggested that Russia is entering a volatile period.  McFaul says that Ukraine's victory should be the restoration of the 1991 borders, which includes Crimea, and that any country that believes in sovereignty, democracy and opposing annexation should support those goals as well.  The former diplomat says that he believes the Biden administration should provide Ukraine with more weapons and faster. ""I most certainly believe that if Putin loses the war in Russia, it will undermine his political standing in Russia.""  McFaul agrees that hoping for Ukraine's victory to cause the Russian regime to collapse is wishful thinking. The goal of the U.S. and NATO should be to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, he finds. He also says that everybody would be better off if Ukraine was given security guarantees and the ability to defend itself against future attacks, suggesting that Ukraine should be able to join NATO eventually.  He harks back to when Estonia joined NATO and how everyone thought that would be destabilizing and anger the Russians. ""But look at what has happened as a result of that. Countries that are inside NATO have not been attacked. Countries that are outside NATO – Georgia is on my mind, Ukraine is on my mind – have been attacked. I think NATO expansion could be stabilizing for all countries.""  McFaul suggests there is plenty of disappointment with Putin among the economic and political elites of Russia, while it is too dangerous to express it now. ""But my prediction is that Putin will stay in power as long he is physically capable. I don't see a scenario where he is overthrown, that a general will lead a coup d'état. I think they're very unlikely.""  He adds that the day after Putin will be a volatile time in Russia. ""Because he will pick his successor, Putin 2.0, without question. But that person will not have the political support that Putin had. They won't have the history of having been in place when the Russian recovery recovered,"" McFaul says, adding that Putin had no hand in that and simply got lucky with his timing.  Talking about scenarios where Russia might become even worse after Putin or fall apart, McFaul says that maybe the leader after Putin might be more radical but they will be a transitionary figure. ""Secondly, the Russian state today is a lot stronger than it was in 1992. So the nightmare scenarios where criminal regimes will take over nuclear weapons – I think that is very unlikely."" He goes on to say that while there is a lot of corruption in Russia, influential criminal groups and private armies, they are all signs of weakness, as Putin would not need the Wagner mercenary group, would not need to hand down lengthy prison sentences [pointing to Vladimir Kara-Murza] if he was beloved and strong.

Small is also infamous for exacting aggressive retaliation efforts towards his perceived political enemies.  For example, Small led a political coup to have John Devlin removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority … in a move so outrageous that Atlantic City Council President George Tibbitt publicly called out Small, saying:  We were lied to by Mayor Small. We owe John Devlin a public apology.  Tibbitt then went on to issue a public apology for Devlin being unjustly removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority. Devlin was the board chairman of the time of ouster.  Devlin presently has a massive lawsuit working its way through the New Jersey court system against Marty Small, the City of Atlantic City and many other elected and appointed Atlantic City officials.  From the Believe it or Not files … tonight, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, political retaliation against Devlin has struck again.  The Atlantic City Board of Education has officially voted to remove Devlin from his duly elected Board of Education seat.  Devlin has now lost two public board seats at the hands of Small. It’s outrageous by any civilized norm.  Devlin is/was the Dean of the Atlantic City Board of Education.  Devlin has had an exemplary attendance record over the past two decades … many of those years serving as Board President.  Devlin has only missed two regular board meetings as of late. He missed one due to contracting COVID-19 and he missed a second regular board meeting because of a death in his family.  Devlin notified the Board Secretary in advance of missing these meetings.  There is a policy in New Jersey, that if a board member misses three unexcused meetings in a row, a board can consider removal proceedings.  It’s rarely done and it’s especially not considered when a board member has a legitimate reason for missing a meeting(s).  I have spoken with Devlin just after tonight’s adverse board action against him. As usual, he did not hold back.  ""They couldn't beat me in an election so they fabricated a frivolous reason to vote for my removal. I don't even know where to start … they even prevented me from seeking legal representation, I didn't even get due process.”  “This is a perfect definition of a whistleblower case … this was orchestrated by Shay Steele and his boss Marty Small.”  “This all stems from when I demanded an independent investigation into how a child molester living in The Marty and La’Quetta Small Home was allowed to work in our district. This matter is under litigation and I will assure you I will have my day in court,” said Devlin.  We published a letter recently hat was sent to Devlin that addressed his attendance … however, nothing about the letter would have indicated that they were prepared to move this swift against Devlin.  Heres the letter.  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Devlin only received a few hours notice about the adverse action that the board was considering against him at tonight’s meeting.  He wanted to have his attorney with him … but, he could not do so on only a few hours notice.  Devlin does have the option of a formal appeal before the state board of education, regarding the action taken tonight by the Atlantic City Board of Education.  This appears to be an obvious case of political retaliation against Devlin, that will serve him well in his current lawsuit against the City of Atlantic City… As a continued example of political retaliation taken against him.  If this unjust move against Devlin is allowed to stand… It is a big loss for the taxpayers of Atlantic City… As Devlin was the only one on the school buses that was keeping checks and balances on both Marty and La’Quetta Small.  Devlin will be appearing on-air with us tomorrow morning, Wednesday, May 17, 2023 from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. in his first interview since his removal from The Atlantic City Board of Education.

"coup","2023-04-01","14:00:00","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:17:00","Is this the best rivalry in the NBA right now?  No other set of teams can claim meeting in three of the past four Conference Finals. No other set of teams has had the results swing in either direction – a necessity for a true rivalry – with Miami winning one series in six games and Boston winning the other in seven. Maybe the back and forth doesn’t extend into the pre-handcheck era, but you’d be hard pressed to find a matchup with more recent history – particularly when you consider the changing cast of characters over the years.  None of that really matters. It’s just a fun thing to consider before diving into the meat of a series, the reality of which should be stated clearly – Boston was the better team this season. By any measurement, they came out well ahead of a HEAT team that, by the same measurements, would likely be the worst to win a title (they had a negative points differential after all) in the three-point era, statistically speaking. The Celtics may not have been quite a dominant as they were in the second half of the previous season, but their league-leading Net Rating (+6.7) was close enough.  Boston is going to be favored. The projection systems are going to give them heavy odds. Journalists and analysts are going to pick them. It makes sense. The HEAT can win, undoubtedly, but picking them requires discarding much of what we saw during the regular season and choosing to believe in the smaller sample sizes, both in recent weeks and in toughness and resolve that shows up in the late, tight minutes.  The counter argument is that Miami was building something all season long, even if the results were never quite there. Erik Spoelstra saw what happened to his team’s offense against Boston last year, when the shooting fell off and Boston’s switching defense guided (pushed) them into quicksand, and decided changes were necessary in order to maximize their postseason potential. One of the beneficiaries of those changes broke his hand about a month ago, but otherwise it was Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo first and everything else built off of them – their matchup hunting, their scoring, their playmaking, their impact on the geography of the floor.  The offense cratered as the shooting couldn’t sustain the previous season’s results, but there was always a glimmer of something meaningful in the way the team was playing off of its stars. Meaningful in the sense that it would matter in the most important games, if they could just get back to them.  They got back there alright. It took 45 percent three-point shooting, Butler having one of the best series anyone has ever played and Giannis Antetokounmpo missing a few games – not to mention consecutive fourth-quarter double-digit comebacks – but they knocked off the No. 1 seed all the same. They thrived in the grind of the Knicks series, always looking like the better team despite Jalen Brunson’s most willful efforts. And now they have a chance to face the team which spurred many of their changes in the first place.  “We’ve had to find a lot of different solutions for a bunch of different coverages,” Spoelstra said. “That’s the most important thing. You let the game dictate. We still have to get to our main things. We’re aggressive but we also have to move the ball, that’s regardless of the scheme. Cycling through different challenges in some weird way has allowed us to wrap our minds around that.”  Any series against a team that switches a ton automatically becomes a Butler series. It’s a matter of fact, if not record. He’s the HEAT’s best isolation player, one of the best in the league, and you’re going to have to score one-on-one against switches. But now he’s got Adebayo, with his isolation usage pumped up all season, to help shoulder that burden. Al Horford is a brilliant defender – check what he did against Joel Embiid in the last round – who is both well acquainted with Adebayo and trusted by his team to defend him in single coverage, but Adebayo has a couple big games against him last year and averaged 25 against Boston this regular season. Even if the weight of this series isn’t on his shoulders, this is another opportunity, after facing Milwaukee’s drop coverage, to test the theory held season-long that he was building his postseason profile.  “His development has been built for, not specifically any team,” Spoelstra said of Adebayo. “It’s been all of these experiences we’ve had on these deep runs. You need to find different ways to get your best players impactful. There are different schemes. When you play against the Bucks, New York and Boston, it’s three different kinds of gameplans. It’s been 2-3 years of Bam’s iron will of player development. I’ve seen great improvement in his ability to be effective against different kinds of schemes and teams.”  Miami can win this series, they’ll just have to do it in ways they haven’t won with this postseason. Good thing their entire team identity has been finding different ways to win, whatever-it-takes-ing their way through every moment, every second.  WHAT THE STARTERS MEAN  One of the most relevant developments in this series happened in the last one. No, not against the New York Knicks. Against Philadelphia.  Trailing 3-2 and facing elimination on the road, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla made the call to return to the starting frontcourt combination of Al Horford and Robert Williams. That’s the configuration that kickstarted one of the best defensive runs of the past two decades for Boston last year. But with Williams missing the first 29 games of this season and Boston opening the season at a historic offensive level, Mazzulla never returned to the two-big look for more than a handful of games.  Games 6 and 7 marked the first time in the postseason that Horford and Williams started together, having averaged just 5.2 minutes together in the previous 11 games. The 76ers proceeded to post Offensive Ratings of 89.6 and 95.7 as Boston kept Horford mostly attached to Joel Embiid in his pick-and-rolls with James Harden and brought Williams over from the weakside on any downhill attack.  Celtics Preview: Rob Williams Paint Help  That’s a tough look for any team to score on, even if Boston was essentially challenging Harden to score. With how much Miami has been reliant on Adebayo pick-and-rolls, it’s not hard to see how third-party rim protection could throw a wrench in the gears, especially with good wing defenders chasing the ball from behind – or attached at the hip – and Horford cutting off those dotted line catches for Adebayo just as he did Embiid’s nail opportunities.  Of course, that type of coverage is only possible because Boston was comfortable with Williams helping off P.J. Tucker and conceding that spray pass to the corner – just as they were last year leading to Tucker not being on the floor down the stretch of Game 7. And there’s the predicament at the dawn of this series. Coaches tend to stick with what has been working most recently until proven otherwise. Mazzulla has already stated, on Tuesday, that Williams will remain a starter. With Erik Spoelstra starting Kevin Love, can the Celtics be as effective as they’ve been with what might not only be their best defensive lineup, but their best overall lineup?  On paper, that’s a win for Miami. If the other team is going to help off a good shooter, you let that shooter try to punish the defense. But it’s never that simple. Williams, who is capable of some of the best three-point closeouts you’ve ever seen from a player his size, doesn’t have to concede the same shots to Love that he did Tucker. Boston can stay in rotation, sending an additional defender to the corner and filling in from there. They’re capable of that. Williams also doesn’t have to be assigned to Love in the first place. In Game 1 against Milwaukee this year, Giannis Antetokounmpo – wanting to play a similar free-safety role alongside Brook Lopez – was on Gabe Vincent with Miami otherwise starting two good shooters in Max Strus and Tyler Herro. Those plans went awry, of course, but it was their plan.  It might only take a few threes from Love to force an adjustment, but there are further layers to consider. Say Boston decides to go back to their spread, five-out lineup used for most of the regular season, with Derrick White – or Grant Williams, even, for maximum switchability – alongside the four regulars. That’s a group that stretches your defense out as well as any. They’ll test Love’s defense in space, whether he’s dropping back or showing out off of screens, in ways that neither Milwaukee nor New York could even dream of.  What if Miami adjusts first and moves someone like Caleb Martin into the starting lineup despite Spoelstra’s seeming resistance to doing so with how successful Martin has been with bench groups? The Celtics put Williams on Martin last year during the regular season and to Martin’s credit, he didn’t try to punish the coverage only with outside shots – though he will shoot if left open – and regularly drove the paint.  “Shooting the ball is going to be big for me especially if they’re going to have guys overhelping,” Martin said. “There are multiple ways I’m going to try and be effective and impactful if they’re going to put guys like that on me.”  There’s another layer to this that wasn’t exactly present last time around, namely that with Miami less focused on switching this year they’ve often thrived in this postseason the closer they can keep Adebayo to the rim. That was especially true against New York, when Mitchell Robinson’s presence, plus a decent dose of zone, meant Adebayo could hang around the paint and deter the attacks the Knicks were so dependent on. Boston’s stretch will make that more difficult, but at least with Williams – literally the only non-shooter in Boston’s rotation – in the game that makes it easier for Adebayo to be the same kind of help defender, and rim deterrent, that Williams is on the court to be.  It’s popular to say that starting lineups don’t matter, but with Boston essentially playing a two-big rotation, with Horford and Williams both playing the five, a two-big starting lineup is the cleanest way for them to get to that look. Miami has the personnel options to make it tougher on the Celtics to crowd the paint with length. Keep an eye on how this plays out over the first couple games. Maybe someone blinks first. Maybe nobody does. Maybe blinking isn’t even a battle lost in the long run.  HOW THE TURNTABLES…  There are some stats that you never forget. Even if the exact numbers escape you over time, the meaning behind them linger in the shallow recesses of the brain ready to be called upon whenever the right context presents itself.  For last year’s Eastern Conference Finals, it was all about the turnovers.  On all possessions which started off a defensive rebound or a live-ball turnover in that series, the HEAT scored a pristine 1.30 points per possession. But when they were playing off Celtics scores, either field-goals are free-throws, their efficiency dropped all the way down to 0.94. The effect for Boston was not nearly as dramatic, as they mustered 1.10 points per possessions playing off Miami scores. In other words, turnovers and stops were the source of everything good on offense for the HEAT, which is why there were so many dramatic, snowball runs over the course of those seven games. The Celtics averaged 12.3 turnovers in their four wins. They averaged 19.3 in three losses. Even this season, Boston’s 13.3 turnover percentage jumped up to 18.8 in four games against the HEAT.  The main culprits on Boston’s part were their highest usage players in Tatum and Brown, who combined for about eight turnovers a game, 10 in Boston’s losses. Many of those weren’t just any turnovers, setting illegal screens or offensive fouls or throwing the ball out of bounds. They were direct transferences of possession, often outside the paint, where Miami could quickly take the ball in the other direction. Miami had 21 pick-six possessions overall (turnovers becoming near-immediate transition scores) in the series.  Celtics Preview: Tatum/Brown Turnovers  These things did not happen by accident. Rather, they were a direct result of the intersection of occasionally brute-force attackers and a scheme that specifically shrinks those attacking lanes. In that area, Miami hasn’t changed at all. Whatever pick-and-roll coverage they’re in, they are going to bring extra limbs and bodies into the path of the ball.  “That’s where we find our strength on defense,” Strus says. “We’ll keep being the aggressor.”  The personnel is a bit different, though, and neither Brown nor Tatum have been quite as loose with the ball this year. Among the regular rotation guys in the previous series, Victor Oladipo – who appeared to have timed out Brown’s dribble and gather specifically – led all players with three steals per 100 possessions. P.J. Tucker was fourth in that category, behind Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry. What all those players have in common is that they have incredible hands, swiping and grabbing and making the act of turning a dribble into a shot as miserable an experience as possible. The HEAT still have good defenders in their spots – this might be a series for Haywood Highsmith for this exact reason, along with simple one-on-one defense – and Lowry and Butler will create their own brands of chaos, but it’s tough to replicate true First Team All-Hands Team guys.  Maybe this series is different. Maybe Miami doesn’t need to force turnovers this time around in order to produce consistent offense. Maybe they force them all the same, with different players doing the forcing. All we have to go on is past performances, and based on what we’ve seen, and what we know from watching the Celtics play just about anyone else over the past 18 months, the turnover column in the box score might be second in importance only to the one that tells you how well a team is shooting from three. It won’t be a panacea, but it factors into who Miami wants to be.  “We’re at our best when we’re disruptive, but we also feel like our offense has taken some strides,” Spoelstra said. “Against a really good team like Boston, you have to compete at a high level on both sides. It’s not as simple as we’re going to get stops or turn them over.”  DROP IT, SWITCH IT, BOP IT  It’s been a postseason of drop coverage for Miami. Between Brook Lopez and Mitchell Robinson – even with Robinson playing up higher and New York crowding the paint – there have been plenty of opportunities for HEAT ballhandlers to come off a screen and know a shot will be available to them. You could even make the argument that, aside from Butler entering the Konami Code on himself, the confidence Miami’s shooters had knowing where and when they could get shots was the primary driver of the team’s blistering offensive pace in that series.  Al Horford is going to drop, too, but the difference with Horford is that he’s not dropping because it’s Boston’s only scheme. It’s almost calculated, giving the offense a look that Horford can toggle out of whenever the need is there. Just look at Horford’s switch rate, per 100 possessions, by quarter this season:  First Quarter: 6.6 switches per 100  Second Quarter: 7.8 switches per 100  Third Quarter: 8.4 switches per 100  Fourth Quarter: 11.2 switches per 100  That’s not someone who switches because he has to. That’s intentional, saving the bulk of his switches for the moments where protecting the paint above all else, playing the math game, is less important than contesting every shot. The later in the game it gets, the less important your points per possession becomes as simply maximizing your chances of putting points on the board, even on shots of lesser value, is often what wins you games. In other words, you might catch the HEAT getting some solid looks against Horford’s drop early on, but chances are they’re going to have to beat late-game switches one way or another.  “They’re second in switches but that can also play a more traditional drop coverage, so you can’t just prepare for one thing,” Spoelstra said.  Williams, on the other hand, will be in drop most of the time. It’ll look more like New York than Milwaukee, generally speaking, with Williams able to adjust the depth of his positioning while also being a bit more mobile, a bit more quick-twitch than both Robinson and Lopez before him – meaning he can both contest shots while shadowing a ballhandler that might get a stop on him. When Miami needs to stabilize and get a look, this might be where to get it, though keep in mind Boston also has the capability of pre-switching Williams out of those actions as his man gets called up should Mazzulla see the coverage being exploited too often.  The switch is still the thing. Only Brooklyn switched more screens than Boston this season, and you could argue that nobody executes as creative, sophisticated switch schemes as this Celtics squad, just as capable of switching away from the ball as they are on it. Like the HEAT, they also haven’t been quite as good at it this year. A possession featuring a Boston switched screen during the 2021-22 season was expected to allow 0.87 points-per – bordering on silliness. This year it’s jumped back up to 0.96, elite but not historically so. They haven’t been as razor sharp as before, though we should consider that having their backs up against the wall against the 76ers could very well have revitalized said tool.  For all the gains Miami has made with their offense this year – we know what you’re thinking, but it was all reflected more in style and process than in results, with an eye on postseason basketball – they continued to struggle at times against switches, scoring just 0.97 points-per-switched-screen. The good news there is that Butler, considering switches often lead to isolations, produced 1.09 points-per-switch this season as a ballhandler.  Chances are that the HEAT’s offense is going to look stalled out at times. It’s an inescapable reality when you’re playing a switching team hitting their apex. But switching requires an incredible amount of individual ability and team-wide precision, which is why most teams don’t even attempt to switch at the volume Boston does, including Miami after a few roster changes. When it looks bad, the HEAT are going to have to weather the storm. Butler and Adebayo in particular are going to have to break them out of those rough patches with some hard-earned buckets.  But the Celtics of this year have not shown an ability to execute with the same consistency as a season ago. That’s where the HEAT are going to have to make hay, forcing Boston into situations where they either have to execute, two, three or four switches in a row, or – by stacking actions and screens – execute two, three or four switches at the same time. There are seams in there to attack, a defender a step slow to get in front of the ball or a miscommunication in the madness, and Miami is a team more than familiar with forcing teams into mistakes and then capitalizing on them.  In that sense it’s going to look bad for Boston sometimes, too, because if there’s anything this Miami team does well it’s make the other team look bad – even if it’s sometimes at the cost of making themselves look good.  DESERVES GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT  With all their shooters and scorers, rather with all their players who can both shoot and score, the Celtics can get a good look at a three just about any time they want. It’s an ability that can sometimes seduce a team as they lose sight of the paint, but it’s a dangerous ability nonetheless. Consistently running a true five-out lineup off the arc is one of the most difficult things to do in this league.  “When it comes to breaking down our half-court defense that we take so much pride in,” Love said, “we’re going to have to make four, five maybe six efforts at some point and some guys are going to be throwing their fists up saying, ‘Hey, I need a blow, I need a break.’ We’re going to have to go extremely hard to get these wins.”  Adds Lowry, “You can’t take away everything. You have to be to work an extra four seconds longer, or an extra three seconds harder or an extra rotation. We have to be on the same page and ready to go.”  Even if they’ve changed a bit from last year, Miami and Boston’s schemes aren’t so different. We’re once again going to learn the answer to the question of what happens when a team that takes a lot of threes going up against a defense which allows a ton of them. Difference is that Boston tends to get cleaner looks – the most catch-and-shoot opportunities in the league – and their Shot Quality (second best behind the Golden State Warriors) is going to routinely be better than Miami’s. There are going to be games in this series where it looks like Boston should be winning based on the differences in shots earned, but Miami might still be the team out in front through some combination of turnovers and offensive boards. Deserving to win doesn’t matter in the playoffs if you don’t actually win, and as the Bucks just learned sometimes a seven-game series is too short a time for percentages to normalize.  Miami’s win conditions in this series aren’t too complicated. They’ll need to force turnovers. They’ll need Boston to miss some good threes. They’ll need to capitalize against Boston’s early drop coverage just as they did against the Bucks. They need to win the possession game, ending up with more shots than their opponent. Their perimeter rotations and closeouts will have to be as good as they’ve been all season. And they need individual scoring efforts from Butler and Adebayo when the switching flattens them out and mucks up their movement actions.  But more than anything, they need to be who they’ve been. Not necessarily how they’ve played, but what this season has made them. Boston is supremely talented, but they have moments at the end of games where they take their foot off the gas. They leave the door open at times when it should be shut. This HEAT group, two games away from setting the record for games decided by five points or less in the regular season and postseason combined, is more than happy to kick doors down if they’re open even just a crack.  Maybe picking the HEAT in this series requires less schematic analysis and a couple more taps of the ‘Believe’ sign above the door. That’s fitting, because that’s what this team has been doing for the past month.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vaGVhdC9uZXdzL2NvdXAtaGVhdC1jZWx0aWNzLXRocmVlcXVlbC1wcmV2aWV3LWJ1dGxlci1hZGViYXlvLXRhdHVtLWJyb3du0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-04-01","20:00:00","{""Valdivia"", ""LosRios"", ""Chile""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:18:13","On April 9, at around 8 p.m., four members of a drug gang fired at least 25 shots at a house where the mother of the leader of a rival gang lived. Some of the bullets flew through the windows of the house next door, where there were children. The attack, in which no one was injured, occurred in the Los Jazmines neighborhood in the city of Valdivia, some 850 kilometers (530 miles) south of Santiago, Chile. When Investigations Police (PDI) agents arrived at the scene, the attackers fled. One of the gang members, aged 15, threw a pistol into a backyard as he ran away. The following day, a resident called the police to report that he had found the gun on his property. It was a .380 Pietro Beretta, with a brown grip and a name embossed on it: Augusto Pinochet U.  After running the weapon’s serial number, the General Directorate of National Mobilization confirmed that the pistol was registered in the name of Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte, the former Chilean dictator who died in 2006. The system also showed that the gun had been reported as lost. The question authorities are now asking is: how did a pistol belonging to the general who staged the 1973 coup d’état find its way into the hands of a teenage member of a street gang in the south of the country?  The Pinochet family lost track of the gun a decade ago. In April 2014, Marco Antonio Pinochet Hiriart, the dictator’s son, reported the pistol missing at a police station in Lo Barnechea, in the province of Santiago, along with 17 other weapons including a rifle and several pistols and revolvers. There are around 770,000 registered firearms in Chile. Of those added to the registry over the last three years, at least 60% have been reported as lost or stolen, chief prosecutor of the North Central Metropolitan Region, Tania Sironvalle, said in an interview last November.  Pinochet's name engraved on the pistol grip. PDI Chile  Marco Antonio Pinochet noticed the missing weapons when he decided to make an inventory of his late father’s objects in what had been his residence during his final days, a property located in the municipality of Lo Barnechea, one of the most affluent areas of the Chilean capital. According to the police report, as quoted by the newspaper La Tercera, the fourth of the dictator’s five sons said “a large number of weapons of different brands and calibers were missing, and that they were duly registered with a collector’s description and one of them was defined as a weapon for personal defense.” According to sources familiar with the case, Marco Antonio told the police it was a case of “misappropriation.”  At the end of 2014, Lucía Hiriart, Pinochet’s widow, sold the mansion where the former dictator resided from 2000 following his return to Chile after being arrested in London. The following year, the new owners — who bought the home for $1.6 million — demolished the 1,500 square meter property to build a condominium.  Almost three months after the complaint lodged by Marco Antonio Pinochet, the Eastern Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office ruled out investigating the case due to a lack of evidence. However, now that Pinochet’s Beretta pistol has resurfaced as part of a criminal investigation, the original case has been reopened. The Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Los Ríos, led by Juan Agustín Meléndez, has decided to separate the investigation of the attack on the house in Los Jazmines into two branches: one will deal with the two rival gangs of drug traffickers, in which 10 people have already been arrested, and the other will work toward solving the theft of Pinochet’s small personal armory in 2014.  The local prosecutor in Valdivia, Tatiana Esquivel, said that the 10 detainees in the gang case have been charged with attempted homicide, illegal possession of firearms and the unjustified discharge of weapons on public streets. Among the charges being brought against the 15-year-old gang member who discarded Pinochet’s pistol is illegal possession of firearms. On the night of the shooting, the teenager was also carrying a black bag containing 26 grams of cocaine and three shotgun cartridges. The PDI’s Anti-Narcotics and Organized Crime Squad arrested him almost a month after the attack, along with nine other members of his gang and a criminal organization known as Población Libertad, of which the son of the woman whose house was shot at was a member. He is currently in prison in Valdivia for drug-related crimes.

HARARE - Zimbabwe's upcoming presidential election and compensation of white farmers whose land was seized two decades ago are key to efforts to restructure its crippling debt, the African development bank chief said Monday.  African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina and Mozambique's ex-president Joaquim Chissano, are leading efforts to help Zimbabwe re-engage with the West to clear its $8.3 billion bilateral and multilateral debt.  ""The success of the efforts we have all put into this process will depend on what happens with the upcoming presidential elections,"" Adesina said at debt resolution talks with President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare.  He said the international community will be ""watching very closely"" the vote.  ""The full weight of re-engagement with the international community will depend on this... (and) the entire electoral process that guarantees a credible election"".  ""Success on the political and electoral reforms, and a free and fair election, are crucial to clear the pathway towards arrears clearance and debt resolution for Zimbabwe,"" he added.  Rights groups and opposition parties have complained of a clampdown ahead of elections, whose date is yet to be set.  Chissano, a respected statesman said holding ""free and fair elections"" and settling the issue of compensation for white former commercial farmers were among ""low-hanging fruits"" in advancing dialogue with the West and international financial institutions.  ""Harvesting these low-hanging fruits is critical as they are likely to trigger decisive action towards arrears clearance and debt resolution,"" he said.  Chissano and Adesina last week met members of the US Congress, State Department, Treasury among other agencies to discuss Zimbabwe.  Adesina revealed that the AfDB is working with Zimbabwe to develop ""innovative financial instruments and structures that can be used to front-load the mobilization of the $3.5 billion for compensations"", without getting into further debt.  ""It is important that we find a mechanism to try to fast-track...the payment of these compensations"".  Zimbabwe's late ex-president Robert Mugabe launched land reforms in 2000, grabbing white-owned farms to reverse a historical land ownership imbalance that favoured the white minority population.  More than 4,000 of Zimbabwe's 4,500 white commercial farmers were evicted from their properties, which were given to black tenants.  But in 2020 Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe following a military-led coup, signed a $3.5 billion deal with dispossessed farmers to compensate them for infrastructure developments on their former land.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZXduLmNvLnphLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvZnJlZS12b3RlLWtleS10by16aW1iYWJ3ZS1zLWRlYnQtc2V0dGxlbWVudC1hZnJpY2FuLWJhbmvSAVlodHRwczovL2V3bi5jby56YS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2ZyZWUtdm90ZS1rZXktdG8temltYmFid2Utcy1kZWJ0LXNldHRsZW1lbnQtYWZyaWNhbi1iYW5rL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(MPVA)  South Korea is set to mark the 43rd anniversary of the 1980 pro-democracy uprising in the southwestern city of Gwangju later this week, the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Wednesday.  Some 3,000 people are expected to gather at a national cemetery in Gwangju, 330 kilometers southwest of Seoul, on Thursday to commemorate the May 18 uprising, a watershed event for the country's democratization.  On May 18, 1980, demonstrators, including students, protested against the then ruling junta led by Chun Doo-hwan who seized power in a military coup the previous year. The military conducted a bloody crackdown on them, leaving hundreds dead.  Thursday's 45-minute-long ceremony will be held under the theme of sharing the ""spirit of May together with citizens"" -- a message meant to uphold the spirit of the Gwangju movement to safeguard the values of liberal democracy and human rights, according to the ministry.  It features a performance to console the bereaved families and a video clip of interviews with citizens highlighting their efforts to preserve the ""spirit of May"" and move forward to the future.  At the end of the ceremony, participants are to sing in unison the ""March for the Beloved,"" an iconic song representative of the nation's past struggle for consolidated democracy.  Whether to sing the song together used to be a controversial issue in the past as some right-wing politicians shunned it, in part because it was favored by their liberal rivals.

Each year, the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) produces Global Terrorism Index, or GTI, for 163 separate countries. The most recent GTI finds that, by the numbers, terrorism deaths dropped slightly during 2022. However, much of that “decline” is a result of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan: since the Taliban is now the government, it isn’t included in GTI’s terrorist calculations.  But the index’s most eye-opening finding? The Sahel now accounts for 43 percent of the world’s terrorism deaths—more than South Asia and the MENA region combined. That percentage is on the rise. According to GTI, two Sahel countries—Mali and Burkina Faso—are among the world’s five countries most impacted by terrorism deaths. With 1,135 terrorism deaths in 2022, Burkina Faso now accounts for more terrorism deaths annually than any other country.  The Sahel is usually defined as the region in West and Central Africa with the Sahara to its north and the savanna to its south. The IEP includes parts of ten countries in their definition of the Sahel region: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.  So why is this region particularly vulnerable to terrorism? Many are quick to blame ethnic and religious conflict made more destructive by the growing availability of weapons from outside the region. But there are other contributing factors that are fueling deeper stressors and frustrations within and between communities. Weather extremes, unpredictable growing cycles, desertification, and diminishing arable land all contribute to the sense of declining economic opportunity that many feel—especially the region’s youth. Instead of using their authority to resolve disputes and build inter-communal understanding, many political leaders, armed with social media, appear all too ready to exploit these pressures for their own political gain. It’s also interesting to note that there have been six coup attempts in the region just since 2021.  All of these stressors open the door for violent extremists—including a number of deadly terrorist groups—to amass more power and gain more followers. Nowhere is that more true than the area where Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger come together. Here there is a growing presence of IS affiliates and Jamaat Nursat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen—a coalition of militant jihadists. But other violent groups, many not formally aligned with outside terrorist organizations, are engaging in crime and violence. An attack on Saturday, April 22, killed 10 people and wounded more than 60 when a bomb was detonated in the town of Sevare in Mali’s Mopti region. Less than two weeks earlier, the Burkina Faso villages of Kourakou and Tondobi near the Niger border, were attacked simultaneously killing 44 people.  With France’s withdrawal of its military forces from Mali last year, Russian mercenaries have seen an opening to increase their own presence and activities in the region. The Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group is believed to be operating in Mali and Central African Republic. They are also suspected of operating—or soon to be—in Burkina Faso and Chad. And there are rumors of other outside groups taking advantage of the region’s weak governance and lack of western assistance.  During my time as the USAID administrator, our programs in the Sahel region were pointed toward building resilience, increasing constructive options and opportunities for individuals (especially youths), resolving conflict through tailored mediation and reconciliation programs, and promoting messages that affirm peace-and-stability to counter extremist propaganda. While military efforts to counter terrorism are important, it is also critical to work with local governments to increase their responsiveness to citizen needs and counter extremism through opportunity.

"coup","2021-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:44:13","Advertisement  From May 9 to 11, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened in the stunning fishing town of Labuan Bajo in the eastern Indonesian region of Nusa Tenggara for its 42nd summit. It was the 10-member bloc’s third summit since the February 2021 coup d’etat in Myanmar, which pushed the country into a prolonged state of violent conflict and economic decay.  It was also the third summit since ASEAN adopted the “Five-Point Consensus” and created a special envoy mechanism to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. In keeping with the bloc’s current policy, Myanmar’s seat at the 42nd summit remained vacant, with the Burmese junta disinvited to the high-level event.  Despite the policy of snubbing the junta, ASEAN has failed to implement the Five-Point Consensus. One could even argue it has allowed the consensus to fail. Myanmar’s obstinate generals continue to take the bloc for a ride by ignoring the consensus’ stipulations and setting their own terms, definitions, and timelines for its implementation. This obduracy hasn’t noticeably damaged the junta’s already-tarnished image, but it has certainly soured ASEAN’s reputation as a regional organization.  Meanwhile, the current ASEAN chair, Indonesia, has initiated a backdoor process that might potentially break the political and diplomatic ennui over the crisis. The exact contours of this shadow mechanism remain fuzzy, but in the current scheme of things, it certainly indicates forward movement of the glacier.

Can they find a resolution to the Myanmar imbroglio?  The ASEAN Way: A Broken Record?  In the latest ASEAN summit’s 25-page “Chairman’s Statement,” the Myanmar crisis triggered by the coup and the ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus were mentioned in the very last point, below the Russia-Ukraine war. Beyond noting the recent completion of the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) and “partial delivery” of humanitarian aid in Myanmar by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Center), the bloc said nothing new on the crisis. It continues to hold the Five-Point Consensus as its “main reference point” on the issue, despite negligible progress on its implementation.  Advertisement  Save for the recent attack on an AHA aid convoy in eastern Shan State by an unidentified “militia,” ASEAN did not condemn nor mention any other violent incident in Myanmar in the final statement. In fact, the bloc condemned the convoy attack and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable in a separate statement on the very first day of the summit.  In the final statement, there was no mention of the devastating aerial bombing of a large civilian gathering in Sagaing Region’s Pazi Gyi village on April 11, which killed more than 175 people. Indonesia, as the bloc’s chair, had “strongly condemn[ed]” the attack in a statement released on behalf of the entire organization on April 13. However, ASEAN stuck to neutrally urging for “immediate cessation of all forms of violence” in the post-summit statement.  Notably, the bloc also did not highlight the junta’s failure in making any progress on the Five-Point Consensus, which it did in last year’s final statement. However, during the meeting, Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said that “there has not been significant progress” on the consensus’ implementation.  ASEAN appears to be locked in an endless and all but futile cycle of taking cognizance and issuing condemnation. In fact, its repetitive refrains on Myanmar have started to sound trite and unimaginative. This vagueness comes from two places – structural constraints on making hard interventions in Myanmar, and serious internal disagreements on how to deal with the junta.  By now, it is an open secret that ASEAN is divided over the latter. According to CNA correspondent, Leong Wai Kit, a “leaked memo” from the latest summit revealed that while some member states want ASEAN to re-include the junta at the highest levels, others, like Indonesia and Singapore, favor the current boycott policy.  This is hardly a surprise given that the bloc continues to employ a hybrid – some would say, indecisive – strategy of including and boycotting the junta. While the junta remains uninvited to the annual summits, its senior officials have participated in dozens of ASEAN meetings since the coup, including the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meetings (ADMM) in 2021 and 2022 and a meeting-cum-exercise of the ADMM-Plus in February. The junta was, however, excluded from the defense ministers’ annual retreat in November 2022.  Ultimately, ASEAN remains awkwardly stuck between censuring and entertaining the coup regime. This has generated widespread frustration and confusion in external quarters, including Myanmar’s revolutionary forces, who are aghast at ASEAN’s failure to hold the junta accountable for its brutality and foot-dragging.

Many of them might want to eventually deprioritize Myanmar and focus on other issues, such as the Indo-Pacific. As a result, Myanmar’s issue with ASEAN might slip into a state of comatose.  The Indonesian Way: A Breakthrough?  Earlier this month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters that Jakarta had been “quietly engaging key stakeholders in Myanmar’s conflict, as well as neighbors India, Thailand and China in an effort to kick-start a peace process.” She revealed that Indonesian diplomats have had more than 60 “engagements” with parties involved in the Myanmar crisis, including the military junta, ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and the civilian-led National Unity Government (NUG). Retno characterized Jakarta’s conflict mediation efforts as “non-megaphone diplomacy” designed to “build trust with all stakeholders.”  Advertisement  This came four months after Jakarta revealed that it would use its ASEAN chairmanship to set up a “special envoy’s office” in order to manage the bloc’s conflict diplomacy on the Myanmar crisis. The office was later set up with Retno as its head. Senior diplomats are playing a supporting role by conducting closed-door meetings with various stakeholders on her behalf, while a small coterie of administrative and logistical staff has been handling day-to-day operations.  It remains to be seen whether the office will be carried forward into next year, when Laos takes over from Indonesia as the ASEAN chair. Jakarta might want to remain active in the mediational efforts beyond its chairmanship. However, it has not yet fully institutionalized the office or resourced it to a level where it can become a concrete, ASEAN-level unit. This is a major concern, as the bloc’s rotating chairmanship has come in the way of ensuring continuity and consistency of intent and action on Myanmar.  Since the 2021 coup and the signing of the Five-Point Consensus two months later, this is the first time an ASEAN chair has done something beyond what is understood to be its standard remit on the Myanmar issue. In fact, Indonesia has demonstrated that with political willingness and diplomatic tenacity, progress is possible. Crisis diplomacy is delicate business, and Jakarta’s approach reaffirms the constructive possibility of going behind closed doors to build confidence and create trust where there is none.  Most importantly, unlike India and Thailand – who are known for their own “silent diplomacy” on Myanmar – Indonesia has engaged all sides, and not just the junta, in its shadow diplomacy. This may look like a radical move given the region’s conservative legacy, but is simply in line with the Five-Point Consensus.  Despite this, the closed format has its own downsides. Outside observers do not get to assess the outcomes of the talks. This means there is little to no public accountability. It becomes impossible to assess whether such a process is actually working, or if its outcomes align with the broader objectives enshrined in the Five-Point Consensus. So the risks of expecting too much from “the Indonesian way” are real. Jakarta may be trying its best to find a meaningful, people-centric solution to the crisis, but it remains hostage to more than one restraining factor.  One, Indonesia faces a serious normative dilemma over ASEAN’s non-interference principle, on which the jury is still very much out. On the one hand, Jakarta wants to be principled and seek accountability from a member that has grossly violated the ASEAN Charter. On the other, there is also a limit to what Indonesia can do to seek such accountability. Any wrong move might be seen as conferring legitimacy to one side in the conflict, which could instantly alienate the other sides. Further, fellow ASEAN countries could see Indonesia’s Myanmar diplomacy as idealistic unilateralism, which could then widen existing fissures within the bloc and eventually, dilute its centrality. This is a scenario that Jakarta would want to avoid at all cost.  Indonesia also remains apprehensive of the fact that the Myanmar imbroglio could hijack the entirety of the ASEAN agenda under its chairmanship. Jokowi, during the latest summit, said that the “issue of Myanmar must not hinder the acceleration of ASEAN community building because community building is awaited by the people of ASEAN.” Earlier, Teuku Faizasyah, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry’s director general of information and public diplomacy, in an op-ed for The Jakarta Post, argued against judging Indonesia’s ASEAN chairmanship “solely by the ongoing stalemate in Myanmar.”  Finally, Indonesia lacks the capacity to sustain a comprehensive mediational initiative that is backed by sufficient political willingness and resources. There is no doubt that the Foreign Ministry is keen on moving ahead. But, beyond the Rohingya crisis, the general Indonesian public does not yet see the Myanmar situation as a strategic impediment. This might disincentivize the Jokowi government from continuing to invest diplomatic capital in the crisis. Throw in the fact that Jokowi himself is term limited and will be replaced by a new president in 2024, and the longevity of the current effort is questionable.  A Third Pole?  Besides the collective ASEAN track and the distinctive “Indonesian way,” there is a third regional approach that has emerged regarding the Myanmar crisis. This Track 1.5 approach is primarily led by Thailand and India, Myanmar’ two influential neighbors to the east and west, respectively.  The latest meeting of this “third pole” took place on April 25 in New Delhi as a follow up to the first one hosted by the Thai government in Bangkok on March 13. The Indian government, along with the Indian Council on World Affairs (ICWA), hosted it. Government and think tank representatives from Thailand, Bangladesh, Laos, China, Vietnam, and the former and current ASEAN chairs, Cambodia and Indonesia, joined the Track 1.5. The hosts also invited “mid-level” junta representatives from Myanmar, but left the NUG out.  As per media reports, the participants discussed “reduction of violence, countering transnational crimes, national reconciliation, delivery of humanitarian aid” as well as “creating space for dialogue.” They also agreed to support “Myanmar’s capacity to fight transnational crimes,” indicating a desire to work with the junta on specific issues. According to a Nikkei Asia report, India “agreed with Myanmar to send a delegation to Naypyidaw to help push for a ‘full resumption of dialogue’ between the regional governments.”  Advertisement  Enjoying this article?

It is clear that this third track is designed to serve the interests of Myanmar’s immediate neighbors in South Asia and the Mekong region, who feel flustered by ASEAN’s vague approach. The overall tone and tenor of the discussions suggest that the hosts, instead of finding a solution that respects the wishes of the Myanmar people, only seek to normalize relations between the coup regime and regional governments, including with themselves.  Most of the states joining this effort see the Myanmar situation from a pragmatist-realist perspective, and have resumed normal diplomatic engagement with the junta over the last one year. They also have little track record in seeking accountability from autocratic military regimes. This creates a very narrow and instrumentalist pathway to conflict resolution that privileges geopolitics over justice and accountability. The meeting’s secretive nature also allows its participants to dodge public accountability, not unlike Jakarta’s own shadow diplomacy.  These are serious concerns that Indonesia, or any ASEAN chair, should take note of. Four months before New Delhi hosted the Track 1.5, Retno told The Hindu that India (and all ASEAN partners) should follow the Five-Point Consensus, instead of going their own way on Myanmar. But, contrary to claims made by its hosts, this process appears to be only negating, not complementing, the ASEAN consensus, which stipulates engagement with all stakeholders, and not just the junta. By drawing in only a select few ASEAN member states, further, the Track 1.5 risks widening the cracks within ASEAN.  Overall, there seems to be a clash of views and methods between Myanmar’s immediate neighbors, who seek short-term solutions as countries directly impacted by the conflict’s cross-border spillover, and the ASEAN perspective, which is more normative, although internally conflicted. Yet, even “distant” countries that have felt the ripple effects of the Myanmar situation – such as Indonesia, which has seen an expansion of Myanmar-linked transnational criminal networks – may gravitate toward short-term fixes instead of a comprehensive resolution. Hence, ASEAN needs to reconcile with its own abstractions and confusions before attributing its failures to external entities.  The ASEAN Five-Point Consensus approach, the Track 1.5 process, and Indonesia’s “silent diplomacy” will have critical implications on each other and ultimately, on the dire situation in Myanmar. They may complement each other if all three operate in tandem. But, if the processes unfold in silos, they may end up scuttling each other and doing more harm than good.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcmVnaW9uYWxzLXNwbGl0cy1vbi1teWFubWFyLWFyZS1iZWNvbWluZy1tb3JlLWFwcGFyZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ghannouchi, 81, founder of the Ennahdha party, has refused to be removed from his place of detention for questioning or to attend Monday’s trial, considering that the cases are “political settling of scores targeting opponents of the regime,” lawyer Samir Dilou, a former party leader, said in an interview with The Associated Press.  Ghannouchi, a former speaker of parliament, is the most prominent critic of Tunisian President Kais Saied. He has maintained that Saied’s move in 2021 to take all powers into his hands amounted to a coup d’etat.  Ghannouchi was detained in mid-April on the charge of plotting against the security of the state. He has been called in numerous times for questioning on various matters, but this was the first time he wasn't released.  Monday's case grew out of a complaint by a security union member claiming that Ghannouchi used the word “taghout,” or tyrant, while eulogizing a member of his party at a February 2022 funeral. According to a tweet by his daughter Soumaya, he said that the deceased ""did not fear poverty, ruler or tyrant.”  Ennahda condemned the decision to prosecute as “an unjust political ruling” and called for his immediate release.  Ghannouchi is also being investigated for what his party says is another case of twisting words — allegedly evoking the threat of civil war if Ennahdha and other opposition parties are excluded from the political scene.  His party said on its English-language account that Ghannouchi was charged with conspiracy against state security and ordered to remain in prison pending trial.  “Kais Saied is making a mockery of the judiciary, using it as a tool for political revenge and persecution,” his daughter tweeted.  About 20 other people, including the director of the respected radio Mosaique, Noureddine Bouttar, are currently detained on a variety of charges.  The crackdown on opponents comes amid growing social tensions and deepening economic troubles in Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring pro-democracy movement more than a decade ago.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvdHVuaXNpYXMtbW9kZXJhdGUtaXNsYW1pc3QtbGVhZGVyLXNlbnRlbmNlZC1hYnNlbnRpYS15ZWFyLXByaXNvbi05OTM2NDM2NdIBfGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd2lyZVN0b3J5L3R1bmlzaWFzLW1vZGVyYXRlLWlzbGFtaXN0LWxlYWRlci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtYWJzZW50aWEteWVhci1wcmlzb24tOTkzNjQzNjU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to Saw Nanda Hsue, a spokesperson for the Karen Human Rights Group (KHRG), in the two years following the military coup, people have witnessed a rise in arbitrary arrests, killings, and the destruction of their homes and property by the military.  ""Based on our records, we have observed an alarming increase in extrajudicial arrests, looting, and killings primarily during the period between 2022 and 2023. Particularly in areas such as Brigade 3, Brigade 6, and Brigade 5, there has been a significant occurrence of looting and destruction targeting the homes of local residents, especially those who are fleeing. They unlawfully enter people's homes, prioritizing the seizure of valuable possessions. Even worse they often resort to burning down their homes.”  KHRG also reports they are carrying out arrests and killings upon encountering people in the area. "" We have noticed a rise in incidents where the public is being arrested, tortured, and killed if they are spotted in any fighting zone. These occurrences are happening more frequently,” he said.  Saw Nanda Hsue further stated that the military forcibly displaced villagers from their homes, arrested them, and employed them as human shields. In addition, airstrikes and artillery shells were unleashed, resulting in the loss of numerous lives.  ""These acts blatantly disregard international humanitarian law and qualify as war crimes.

The move is a coup for the PFL, whose previous marquee signings have included social media influencer Jake Paul — signed in January — and two-time Olympic Games judo gold medalist Kayla Harrison, who has fought 15 times for them since 2018 and twice won the company's lightweight tournament.  Ngannou will fight in the PFL's Super Fight division, a pay-per-view roster of fighters that gives 50% of event revenue to competitors and was co-founded by Paul, who has outspokenly criticised UFC pay and called for fighters to receive more money.  Part of the reason behind Ngannou's UFC departure was the 36-year-old's desire to compete in professional boxing, with the fighter known as 'The Predator' publicly agreeing in February 2023 to the terms set out by heavyweight boxing world champion Tyson Fury for a bout between the towering pair.  MORE: Follow Francis Ngannou in the PFL on DAZN  Francis Ngannou joins Professional Fighters League  Ngannou's next move has been the subject of significant conjecture during his hiatus since his most recent fight, when he defended the UFC belt he had originally won against Stipe Miocic in March 2021 by beating Ciryl Gane at UFC 270 in January 2022.  Now he will become part of the PFL's tournament format, which works in seasons as part of a knockout competition giving fighters the chance to reach a final with a prize of $1 million (£800,000) for the winners.  The PFL launched in 2018 and has continuously expanded, agreeing major deals with broadcasters including DAZN and ESPN and recently beginning its inaugural season in Europe.  Promotions including MMA organisations ONE Championship and Bellator MMA and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship are thought to have tried to sign Ngannou, whose UFC deal expired in January 2023.

Ngannou will be given equity and chairmanship of PFL Africa, a ""priority market"" for the company and one of six new international leagues the PFL wants to introduce by 2026 to form what it is calling a Champions League of MMA.  He will be part of an advisory board representing fighter interests in a position harbouring parallels with the 'head of fighter advocacy' role handed to Paul.  The deal will be for two-to-three fights, guarantee a ""seven-figure"" purse per fight and a split of net event profits, and afford Ngannou a bonus or salary to serve as a PFL ambassador, according to Bloody Elbow, which also claimed he will have his own sponsors in the cage, no 'champion's clause' or other extensions.  PFL CEO Peter Murray called Ngannou ""the greatest heavyweight MMA fighter in the world"" and pledged support for the fighter's work with communities in Africa and around the world, including his charitable foundation.  ""You have to give a ton of credit to Francis,"" said Marquel Martin, the head of Ngannou's management company. ""Most fighters couldn't go through what he went through this past year.  ""He understands his value and has been extremely patient to get to this point. Now, not only is he the best heavyweight in the world, but he has a deal that is unmatched and will set him up for life.""  Francis Ngannou PFL move: What has the MMA star said?  Ngannou had teased that an announcement was imminent, causing some fans to speculate that one of the most popular MMA fighters in the world might be about to return to the UFC.  He has called his partnership with the PFL ""game-changing"" and described himself as ""very excited"" about the agreement. ""I believe in the PFL's 'fighter-first' culture and global vision, including developing the sport in Africa,"" he added.  Will Francis Ngannou fight Tyson Fury?  The PFL announced that Ngannou will not make his debut for the promotion until mid-2024, leaving the door open for the boxing match he wants in 2023.  One of the reported stipulations in the contract Ngannou has signed is that he will not be exclusively tied to fighting for the PFL.  After Tyson Fury knocked out Dillian Whyte in a boxing match at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, the Englishman was joined by Ngannou for a live TV interview in the ring, when they spoke jovially about a bout both have said they want to happen.  In another interview, Fury said he wants the fight to take place in a cage using Queensbury rules and 4oz gloves, with former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as referee.  Ngannou responded on social media agreeing to all of those conditions, and reports have suggested their showdown is close to being finalised in what would be Ngannou's professional boxing debut.  Whether or not his opponent is Fury — a fighter known for his tendency to talk up huge fights that subsequently fall through — it looks likely that Ngannou will box before he appears for the PFL.  Ngannou next fight: Who could he face in the PFL?  PFL boss Donn Davis has said he wants the 2023 PFL season to be ""the road to Francis"". ""I want to see the heavyweight division fight it out,"" he told Aaron Bronsteter in January 2023.  ""Whoever wins the 2023 heavyweight division, challenge Francis at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.""  2022 heavyweight champion Ante Delija could be the man to face Ngannou if the Croat continues his winning streak in the next stage of the tournament in June 2023.  Delija had been due to fight Gane in the UFC in 2020. The fight was cancelled because of a contract dispute between the PFL and Delija, ESPN reported.  Why did Francis Ngannou leave UFC?  Ngannou had repeatedly said that he did not feel the terms the UFC offered to him and its wider roster of fighters were sufficient.  A three-fight deal had been discussed between Ngannou and the UFC, with a reported offer to fight fellow heavyweight great Jon Jones in return for $8m.  Bloody Elbow said that Ngannou would ""very likely"" have earned more money than he will with the PFL had he stayed with the UFC and not lost his title within his next three fights.  MORE: History of boxing vs MMA: How Mayweather, Shields and UFC stars have fared  However, his PFL deal will handsomely reimburse Ngannou and address the issues he was unhappy about, including a one-year exclusive negotiating window and matching rights clause following the expiry of any contract. He also wanted in-cage sponsorships and health insurance for fighters.  UFC president Dana White said the company had allowed Ngannou to leave, claiming their former fighter ""doesn't want to take a lot of risks"" and ""feels he's in a good position where he can fight lesser opponents and make more money"".  ""In that contract, I'm not free,"" Ngannou told Ariel Helwani about the terms he said he had been offered. ""In that contract, I'm not an independent contractor.  ""In that contract, I have no rights, I have no power. I hand over all the power to you guys [UFC], and I've seen in the past how you can utilise that power.  ""How about those guys at the bottom? They can't really afford that health insurance. I have been there, so it's something I still carry in my heart.  ""I need some respect. I need some freedom. I need to feel like a man.

"coup","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:52:00","              BANGKOK, May 16 (Reuters) - Thailand's influential former premier Thaksin Shinawatra on Tuesday hailed the election-winning Move Forward Party as disruptors who mastered social media, and said aging army generals central to years of turmoil should retire with dignity.  The self-exiled tycoon, a towering figure in Thai politics whose family is the driving force behind the dominant Pheu Thai party, said Move Forward proved social media and user-generated content (UGC) can triumph over big-spending campaigns and vote-buying.  Before Sunday's vote, Thaksin's populist political juggernaut had won every election since 2001, despite being ousted from office three times. It lost to the progressive Move Forward by 10 seats.  ""They used UGC on TikTok because the youngsters use TikTok. It's getting votes and canvassers organically and you don't use a lot of resources,"" Thaksin said during a two-hour political discussion streamed online.  Move Forward had strong appeal and organisation in university towns, Thaksin said, adding many young people convinced their parents to vote for Move Forward.  ""Pheu Thai got hammered because we did not disrupt ourselves enough. Move Forward's trend overcame Pheu Thai and the other parties that had money,"" he said.  Move Forward rode a wave of excitement among the youth generated by its liberal agenda and promises of bold change, including tackling monopolies and amending a law that prescribes long jail sentences for insulting the monarchy, a taboo issue.  Pheu Thai has agreed to form a six-party alliance with Move Forward, hoping more will join to keep the defeated pro-military parties out of government in the coup-prone country.  'WHATEVER WILL BE'  Thaksin wields significant influence despite being in exile for 17 years to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power, which he denies. He reiterated his plan to return to Thailand in July and asked about prison said: ""whatever will be, will be.""  Thaksin also pledged loyalty to the palace and stressed Pheu Thai would not back any actions by Move Forward that would impact the monarchy.  Move Forward and Pheu Thai trounced parties backed by the royalist military, two of those led by former army chiefs involved in coups against Thaksin and the government of sister Yingluck Shinawatra.  Thaksin dismissed speculation of a secret deal with one of those generals to form a government, calling it an attempt to discredit Pheu Thai using online trolls.  He said Move Forward even won support in districts with large concentrations of rank-and-file soldiers, highlighting a generational differences over the military's political role.

The report, which analyzes the status of religious freedom in every country, is published annually and is an important tool to increase understanding of persecution in its many forms worldwide.  At the release of the report, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “We defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.”  The State Department noted that some countries showed improvement in religious freedom in 2022, including Brazil, which passed legislation making it a crime to carry out discriminatory acts on religious practices. Lawmakers in Brazil also codified religious freedom protections for followers of Afro-Brazilian religions, which are minority religious groups who have historically faced discrimination for their beliefs in the country.  And in the Central African Republic, authorities continued to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians following the military coup in 2003. In July, Idriss Ibrahim Khalil was arrested for his war crimes which led to the killing of multiple civilians, including a massacre in 2018 that left over 100 Christians dead.  Among the isolated cases of improvement, however, is a global trend that speaks to the deteriorating situation for religious minorities around the world. For example, the IRF report raised deep concern for the situation in Iran, where the government routinely convicted and executed protestors on charges of spreading anti-Islamic propaganda. Reports show that these prisoners were given punishments, including amputations, flogging, solitary confinement, and the death penalty.  In Nicaragua, the Catholic church faced government and societal discrimination, including arbitrary arrests, withholding tax exemptions, death threats, and unlawful entry. The anti-Catholic sentiment was further pushed by President Daniel Ortega, who called for the arrest of priests and bishops across the country, labeling them as “criminals” and “coup-plotters.”  And in Nigeria, the report highlighted the ongoing violence against Muslims and Christians, particularly in the northern region. Terrorist groups, militant herdsmen, and criminal gangs continue to target and attack religious minorities, all while the Nigerian government turns a blind eye to their suffering.  In November 2021, the State Department removed Nigeria’s Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designation, a move that drew widespread and continued criticism from human rights watchdogs. CPC designations are assigned to countries that engage in “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.”  Under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA), the President has 90 days following the release of the IRF Report to issue these designations.

President AMLO said that there was a consensus between Mexico, Colombia and Chile not to give the presidency of the alliance to Peru.  “There are four countries [in the bloc]: Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. And the opinion of the president of Colombia is similar to mine and the president of Chile. He is [also] not interested in giving Peru the presidency of this group called the Pacific Alliance… We can hand it over to Chile, to Colombia and let them decide what they [want to] do, but this lady, with all due respect, [is] a usurper, [who] expelled our ambassador from Peru,” said AMLO in response to a journalist’s question during his daily morning press conference.  President AMLO reiterated that the former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo was unjustly imprisoned because he came from a humble background and he did not allow the conservative forces to plunder his country as they are doing today. In this regard, he suggested that Boluarte leave the presidency to Castillo, who obtained a legitimate victory in free elections.  “I suggest that she resign from the presidency because she is usurping that position and that she gets Pedro Castillo out of jail, a humble person, a teacher from the mountains of Peru and unfortunately in that country as in others racism and classism prevail,” said AMLO.  AMLO once again insisted that he cannot hand over the presidency of the Pacific Alliance to Boluarte because “for us, she is not legally and legitimately the president of Peru.”  Last month, on April 25, the Boluarte government requested the AMLO administration for the transfer of the pro tempore presidency of the trade bloc for the second time since December 2022. Through an official communique, sent to the foreign ministries of Mexico, Colombia and Chile, the Boluarte government demanded respect for Peru’s right to assume the rotating presidency of the bloc “without further delay” and said that “Mexico’s refusal breaches international obligations that affect the prestige of the alliance.”  Boluarte took office on December 7, 2022, after Castillo was removed by the right-wing dominated Congress in a legislative coup, and was subsequently arrested for having tried to dissolve the Congress by decree.  Following Castillo’s forcible removal and illegal arrest, hundreds of thousands of people, mainly from the long-neglected and marginalized countryside of Peru who identify themselves with Castillo, mobilized in different parts of the country. The protesters condemned Boluarte for betraying the progressive ticket she was elected on after she entered into a political alliance with the country’s right-wing forces. They demanded Castillo’s immediate release, Boluarte’s resignation, new elections, and a new constitution.  The Boluarte government unleashed brutal police and military repression against those who took to the streets against her government. According to reports from local media and human rights organizations, around 70 people have been killed in the protests, most of them in violent repression by state security forces.  On May 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) confirmed its report that 57 people died in these protests, and said that the state’s response to demonstrators was characterized by the “disproportionate, indiscriminate and lethal use of force.” It added that in some cases, the actions could be classified as “extrajudicial executions” and “massacres.”  Various Latin American political leaders have criticized the Boluarte government for violating Castillo’s political rights as well as the human rights of thousands of Peruvians who demanded her resignation. Mexico President AMLO, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Honduran President Xiomara Castro, and Bolivian President Luis Arce are among those who have explicitly expressed support for Castillo and repeatedly called on Peruvian authorities to respect human rights and not to repress the people.  In the past months, the Boluarte government also announced the definitive withdrawal of the Peruvian ambassadors to Honduras, Mexico and Colombia. Peru has been maintaining bilateral relations with the countries through the chargé d’affaires. Additionally, in January and February, the Peruvian Congress also declared former Bolivian President Evo Morales and Colombian President Petro, respectively, a ‘persona non grata’ and prohibited them from entering Peru, due to their comments rejecting the coup against Castillo.  According to a recent survey conducted by the IPSOS Peru, 75% of the Peruvian citizens disapprove of the Boluarte administration, 79% reject the performance of the Congress, 68% are dissatisfied with the Judiciary, and 57% are displeased with the work of the Prosecutor’s Office.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlc2Rpc3BhdGNoLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L21leGljby1yZWZ1c2VzLXRvLWhhbmQtb3Zlci10cmFkZS1ibG9jLXByZXNpZGVuY3ktdG8tcGVydXMtZGUtZmFjdG8tcHJlc2lkZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2014-07-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:03:00","GUANGZHOU, China: The past weekend saw general elections in two countries — both with names starting with the letter ""T"" in English — the results of which are likely to have at least moral, if not outright sociopolitical and even geopolitical, implications for their regions, if not the whole world, as they are widely considered to be middle powers in their own right.  In our part of the world, the military has played a significant — some might say an indispensable — role in the polity, society and even economy of quite a few countries. In Indonesia, the military under Suharto seized power from its founding father Sukarno and proceeded to rule the country until almost the end of the last century when the country transitioned into a more functioning democracy. Even today, the strong military presence is palpable across Indonesia, although some might say it could become a crucial counterbalance against the impending ""green wave,"" a broad movement of religiously inspired political activism. In Myanmar, the military has been running the country under various juntas since almost the earliest days of independence. The latest military coup happened but two years ago, ruthlessly ending a decade of democratic experiment and reimposing repressive rule by military strongmen. The international community appears to be helpless in resolving the enigmatic, multifaceted Myanmar crisis.  Then there is Thailand. The country distinguished itself in being the only country in Southeast Asia not to have been ruled by colonial powers. And that was perhaps why its military has also entrenched itself in all aspects of Thai society, not least in politics. Successive democratically elected Thai governments were often toppled by the powerful military as soon as the latter subjectively saw the former as being deleterious to national interest, which is often self-servingly interpreted as its interest. In this century alone, democratically elected Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra was deposed by the military in 2006, and eight years later, his similarly democratically elected sister Yingluck Sinawatra was similarly stripped of her premiership by the military.  The Thai military's coup playbook is remarkably consistent, although sometimes accidental — to the military mind — results which the military would ""rectify,"" sooner or later. Typically, the relationship between a Thai government with genuine popular mandate that is pushing some reforms with which the military is displeased would see its working relationship with the omnipotent military sour to the point of no return. Then the long-standing or even newly appointed military chief would launch a coup with his brother generals, sweeping the civilian leaders aside. Then after a number of years of outright military rule, the military would supposedly cede power to a civilian government if it's to its liking, sometimes with the same generals shedding their uniforms in favor of suits, with the vested interest of the military having been well-preserved or even enhanced. But sometimes, the supposedly well-controlled electoral results could go awry, and a genuinely popular civilian government is elected. Then the whole vicious cycle would repeat itself.  To forestall the ""unexpected"" and thus unfavorable results, the latest Thai ruling junta crafted a constitution which almost guarantees their continued hold on, or at least their participation in, future Thai governments. A wholly military-appointed Senate was created in addition to the popularly elected lower house of parliament, with the number of senators equal to half the number of lower house members. And then the military gets creative. Thailand is supposedly a parliamentary democracy, and in most other such jurisdictions, the lower house member who commands a majority of other lower house members' support would be appointed prime minister and form the next government. But the new Thai military-inspired constitution curiously provides that the successful prime ministerial candidate must command the majority of the total number of senators and lower house members. As such, unless the democratic opposition wins well over three quarters of the lower house seats, it cannot form a new government, and must work with, or even cede leading power to, the militarily connected parties.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  So, in the latest round of Thai elections over the weekend, a new youth-led party, Moving Forward Party (MVP), unexpectedly won the most number of lower house seats, trumping the popular Sinawatras' populist Pheu Thai party. The military political elite appeared to be momentarily split in recent months, and the two militarily connected parties garnered only the fourth and fifth most number of seats. Despite its second-best electoral showing, Pheu Thai conceded defeat to MVP, but even the combined seats won by these two major parties cannot reach the three-quarters needed to take the premiership. MVP's young and charismatic leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, was educated in the best Western universities, and in a sense brings a breath of fresh political air to Thai politics, wishfully away — from many voters' perspective — from both the military and the Shinawatras. But Pita could possibly clinch the premiership if he is able to round up not only Pheu Thai, but also a plethora of minor parties with lower house seats, to support him and together to form a new civilian government.  But an MVP-led Thai government may again not be in the good graces of the military, especially when the military is not a part of the ruling coalition. MVP put out as its main electoral appeal the ""Three D's"" of demilitarization, demonopolization and decentralization to restore Thai democracy. MVP also promised to end military conscription. All these measures, if really proposed, would no doubt irk the Thai military, and if its previous patterns persist, another coup can almost be expected in the months to come. Such is the relentless fate of modern Thai politics, with heavy-handed military intervention always at the back of the civilian leaders' minds.  Across the globe, as Turkey looks set to enter the second round of its presidential election, a discussion of its implications, not the least to this part of the world, will also come in due course.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9kZW1vY3JhY3ktd2l0aC10aGFpLWZsYXZvcnMvMTg5MTgyM9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9kZW1vY3JhY3ktd2l0aC10aGFpLWZsYXZvcnMvMTg5MTgyMy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""MexicoCity"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:16:00","Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2023 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuelan opposition figures reportedly conspired with Colombian paramilitaries to stage a coup d’etat and assassinate President Hugo Chávez.  Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.

"coup","2021-01-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:42:10","Last Wednesday evening marked the unofficial start of Donald Trump’s campaign to be reelected president of the United States.  He spent over an hour of prime-time television before an adoring crowd — courtesy of CNN — suggesting America should default on its debts (the crowd applauded) and that we should not defend Ukraine from Russia (cheers).  He defended his infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” comments, and called E. Jean Carroll, against whom a Manhattan jury had just found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, a “whack job” and said her trial was “a rigged deal” (cheers and applause).  All of this was bad enough.  But what really got my attention was his attempt to rewrite the history of his attempted coup: He asserted that Jan. 6, 2021 was “a beautiful day” (more cheers), that the Capitol rioters had “love in their heart,” and that if elected, he’d pardon those who have been convicted (big applause). He denied moderator Kaitlan Collins’ factual assertion that he took three hours to tell the Jan. 6 rioters to go home (more cheers).  He claimed that he never asked Georgia election officials to “find” him the exact number of votes needed to defeat Biden in Georgia. (He did, and it’s on tape.) He claimed that ex-Vice President Mike Pence had the power to overturn the election. (He didn’t.) He called Michael Byrd — the Black Capitol Police lieutenant who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt while protecting lawmakers during the storming of the Capitol — a “thug.” (He isn’t.)  And he reiterated that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and — menacingly — refused to commit to the results of the 2024 presidential election (more applause).  What’s been the reaction to this prime-time squalor?  No Republican lawmaker has condemned it — except for Utah’s Mitt Romney (remember him? He was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012, as amazing as that now seems).  From the rest of the Republican Party — Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, other Republican leaders in Congress, Republican governors? Nothing.  What about Democratic lawmakers?  Besides questioning CNN’s judgment in giving Trump the platform, remarkably little.  My sources in the Biden administration say they were “delighted” with the CNN event because it gave Biden even “more ammo” against Trump and will “drive more Dems and independents to the polls to vote for Biden next year.”  Maybe. But what if it convinced more Americans of Trump’s lies? Of his “strength?” Of his baseless convictions?  CNN has gone into overdrive defending itself (and its CEO, Chris Licht) for giving Trump the platform. After all, said CNN repeatedly, Trump is the leading Republican in the race for president and the public has a right to see and hear him. Others in the media claimed it would be irresponsible to “ignore” Trump and “keep him under a bushel basket.”  As if that were the issue.  The issue was CNN’s decision to give Trump exactly what he wanted — more than an hour by himself, with a hand-picked audience, and a single reporter who couldn’t possibly correct his torrent of lies (after Kaitlan Collins repeatedly asked him about his handling of classified documents, he called her a “nasty person,” eliciting audience cheers).  But the problem we face is larger than the silence of Republican lawmakers, the smug tactical response of Democrats, and the blinkered defense of CNN by the media.  Two and a half years after Trump summoned supporters to Washington, rallied them outside the White House, and, knowing they were armed and dangerous, sent them to “stop the steal” on Capitol Hill — where they rioted, threatened the lives of Congress, and caused five deaths — he has still not been held legally accountable.  Yes, he has been found liable in a civil trial for sexually harassing and defaming one woman and indicted for making hush-money payments to another.  But he instigated an attempted coup of the United States in plain sight. Where is the Attorney General? The Special Counsel? The law?  Silence.  Wake up, America!  We are no longer dealing with politics as we have come to understand it — as I have seen and practiced it over the last half century: Democrats versus Republicans, liberals versus conservatives, left versus right. In this old form of politics, compromise was expected and often necessary.  It is now democracy versus authoritarianism.  There can be no compromise. And there must not be silence.  In 2016, Trump was a joke. He is no longer a joke. He has taken over the Republican Party, turning it into an anti-democracy party containing many officials who have bought into and magnified his big lie about winning the 2020 election.  Those who stood up to Trump have now been purged. Most Republican lawmakers who remain have made it clear that they will bend or disregard any rule that gets in their way.  Trump’s racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia have fueled a dramatic rise in hate crimes across America.  His grievances and calls for vengeance are causing the nation to become ever more bitterly divided, paranoid, and suspicious.  He is less constrained than he was before. His lies are even larger. He is even more self-assured in telling them.  His rhetoric is even more menacing. “In 2016, I declared I am your voice,” Trump said at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”  Yet if the tepid silence from the rest of America continues, he has a fair shot at becoming president again in 2024.  Friends, we do not have the luxury of waiting 18 months until the 2024 election. The danger is now.  We must speak out against Trumpian fascism.  Demand that Trump be held fully accountable for what he has done.  Condemn the media for allowing him to set the terms for appearing, and for magnifying and legitimizing his lies.  Urge secretaries of state and other state election officials to refuse to put him on the ballot — under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone from holding office who, having taken an oath to support the Constitution, has engaged in an insurrection against the United States.  And we must make good trouble, as John Lewis put it: Mobilize to protect equal rights and preserve the rule of law. Call out haters and bigots. Take to the streets, if necessary, to defend our democracy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbm90ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL25hdGlvbmFsLWNvbHVtbmlzdHMvMjAyMy8wNS9zdG9wLXRydW1wLWZhc2Npc20tZGVtb2NyYWN5LWluLWRhbmdlci1ub3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:34:00","Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta reviews the Brighton game  Manchester United have received a welcome boost in their pursuit of Napoli defender Kim Min-jae, who is reportedly set to be replaced by a former Arsenal defender before the start of next season. The Red Devils are said to be keen admirers of Kim, who has turned plenty of heads with his impressive form in Italy to help Napoli clinch the Serie A title for the first time since 1990.  Kim is thought to have been earmarked as the player United want to become their first summer signing when the bidding opens later this year, with Erik ten Hag eager to strengthen his defensive ranks by activating the South Korea international's £52million release clause. It seems as though Arsenal could also be set to benefit from the move if it goes ahead over the coming weeks, with LondonWorld reporting that Napoli have identified former Gunners defender Konstantinos Mavropanos as Kim's long-term replacement.    It is claimed that Mavropanos has already been 'lined up' by Napoli in advance of next season, although his current focus will be to help preserve Stuttgart's status in the Bundesliga as they battle to avoid relegation to Germany's second tier. They only signed Mavropanos on a permanent basis last summer following two season-long loan spells at the club but could be poised to lose him in the not-too-distant future if Napoli manage to tempt them with a suitable offer before the new campaign gets underway.    Stuttgart are believed to value Mavropanos at around £25m, which would see Arsenal pick up a chunk of any transfer fee given the presence of a sell-on clause that was inserted into the deal which saw him join the Bundesliga strugglers nearly a year ago. The move would also pave the way for Kim to join United, which would get the Red Devils off to a promising start in terms of their summer recruitment drive before the Premier League resumes in August. JUST IN: Six stars that won Premier League and got relegated as Jamie Vardy could be next  Arsenal could reportedly be set to benefit from United's first bit of summer business  It had recently been claimed that Napoli were willing to enter into talks with Kim over a new and improved contract in Italy, but everything now appears to be pointing to an exit at the end of the season in order for him to pursue a new challenge in the Premier League. It remains to be seen whether United will be able to win the race for his signature in the not-too-distant future, with Liverpool and Tottenham having also been linked, although they are seemingly in pole position to snap him up ahead of their divisional rivals as things stand.    The 26-year-old was recently given the ultimate compliment by Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti, who labelled him the best defender on the planet and underlined his impressive physical qualities after their victory over Atalanta in Serie A back in March. He told DAZN: ""Kim does at least 20 incredible things per game. For me, he truly is the best centre-back in the world. When he starts to run, he can get into the opposition penalty area in five seconds flat.""  Konstantinos Mavropanos is said to have been lined up as Kim Min-jae's long-term replacement","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvZm9vdGJhbGwvMTc3MTA0Ny9NYW4tVXRkLXRyYW5zZmVyLW5ld3MtQXJzZW5hbC1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS1sYXRlc3TSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2Zvb3RiYWxsLzE3NzEwNDcvTWFuLVV0ZC10cmFuc2Zlci1uZXdzLUFyc2VuYWwtcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtbGF0ZXN0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ibrahim Babangida (retd.) in 1990.  Orkar, who hailed from Benue State, and his conspirators seized the FRCN radio station, various military posts around Lagos and the Dodan Barracks, Lagos, the military headquarters and presidential Villa.  Babangida was present when the barracks were attacked but managed to escape by a back route.  In his coup address, Orkar called for the excision of five northern states, alleging that the Babangida regime marginalised the South.  However, the coup was crushed by the Babangida regime and Orkar including 41 other coconspirators were tried, convicted of treason and were executed by firing squad on July 27, 1990.  Related News  The Commissioner for Information, Benue State, Mike Inalegwu, told journalists in Markurdi on Tuesdaythat the decision to immortalise Orkar was taken at the meeting of the State Executive Council.  According to the information commissioner, the State Executive Council, at its Tuesday meeting, declared that everything that Orkar said then had come to pass, hence, its decision to immortalise him.  Inalegwu said, “To recognise one of its heroes, the Executive Council today decided to name a 9km township road that burst out at Apir after the late Major Gideon Orkar.  “When Orkar came out with that broadcast, nobody took it seriously but today all that Orkar said in that broadcast has come to pass. So, we, in Benue State, have come to realise that Orkar meant well for this country.  “So, in the council meeting today, we resolved that a street should be named after Gideon Orkar and that is to tell Nigerians that Orkar had prophesied about what the country is facing today and unfortunately, he was executed. The 9.7km road that bursts out at Apir will be named after Gideon Orkar.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYmVudWUtaG9ub3Vycy1vcmthci1sZWFkZXItb2YtMTk5MC1jb3VwLWFnYWluc3QtaWJiL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYmVudWUtaG9ub3Vycy1vcmthci1sZWFkZXItb2YtMTk5MC1jb3VwLWFnYWluc3QtaWJiLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to the Times, Arsenal are far from content to rest on their laurels this summer. The Gunners are in no mood to sit back and admire the progress they’ve made this term and as such, are gearing up for a blockbuster transfer window.  Indeed, the publication report Arsenal have given Arteta the greenlight to sign West Ham captain, Declan Rice, and Brighton midfielder, Moises Caicedo.  The latter was a transfer target for the Gunners in January, though despite lodging sizeable bids, neither Arsenal or Chelsea could convince Brighton to cash in.  The situation could be different at season’s end and Arsenal are prepared to go above and beyond from a financial perspective to get deals done.  The Times report Arsenal’s summer spend ‘may exceed £200m’ when all is said and done. Rice and Caicedo are up first and per the report, will cost a combined £170m. The breakdown is speculated to be roughly £100m (including add-ons) for Rice and around £70m for Caicedo.  To free up both funds and squad space for the colossal outlay, the report names four first-team stars who could be sold.  Centre-back, Rob Holding, midfielder Granit Xhaka and attackers Emile Smith Rowe and Folarin Balogun are the quartet in question.  Of that foursome, it’s Xhaka who already has his next move lined up.  Xhaka nearing four-year deal with Leverkusen  Indeed, Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg brought news of Bayer Leverkusen lining the 30-year-old up. Their manager, Xabi Alonso, reportedly views Xhaka as a ‘top leader’ leader who can add a missing ingredient to his side.  Not long after, Fabrizio Romano tweeted a move to Leverkusen is quickly taking shape.  The trusted reporter noted Xhaka is “set to leave Arsenal at the end of the season”. A new contract is out of the question and both his and Arsenal’s plan is to sever ties.  Romano added Leverkusen are in “advanced” discussions over the deal and an agreement on personal terms is close. A four-year deal running until 2027 will be signed.  Story continues  Arsenal are primed to pocket around €15m (approx. £13m) from the sale. That is a far cry from the roughly £30m he was signed for from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2017, though is merely a by-product of the fact he’s now the wrong side of 30.  Xhaka is the first high profile exit on the agenda at the Emirates, though won’t be the last.  The Times named Holding, Smith Rowe and Balogun who were also present on a 14-man out-list, as reported by Goal.

"coup","2021-09-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:27:33","Since the 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military has consolidated control over the country’s mobile service providers, putting activists, opposition members and journalists at greater risk of surveillance, according to experts.  With the country’s four mobile service providers now either directly or indirectly linked to Myanmar’s military, sensitive user data is more easily accessible and could be used to persecute opposition voices, experts say.  “The military in Myanmar has continued to oppress human rights online in the face of ongoing civil disobedience, political opposition, and armed conflict,” Freedom House researcher Kian Vesteinsson said.  The consolidation of mobile service providers means “people lose out on being able to express themselves freely or enjoy the privacy of their communications,” he said. “The distinct risk here is source safety and the safety of journalists.”  Since the coup, Myanmar’s military has killed more than 3,500 people, and over 17,900 remain detained for resisting the coup, according to the human rights research group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.  The U.N. Human Rights Office has said that the military’s actions, including airstrikes, likely amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Consolidating control over mobile service providers is part of the military's broader strategy to monitor and censor the internet, according to experts and journalists.  Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, a freelance reporter who left Myanmar after the coup, believes media are at risk.  “For sure, independent media workers and journalists are the most at target,” said Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, who is now based in Hawaii.  Myanmar’s military did not reply to VOA’s request for comment about its use of telecommunication companies to track people in the country.  Myanmar has four mobile service providers: Mytel, ATOM, Ooredoo and MPT. Before the coup, the military already owned Mytel and MPT. Following the coup, ATOM — formerly the Myanmar operation of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor — and Qatari-owned Ooredoo’s Myanmar operation came under ownership of junta-affiliated firms, according to media reports.  But even before the coup, telecom and internet service providers had been ordered to install intercept spyware that could give the military power to listen in on calls, view texts and web traffic including emails, and to track user location, Reuters reported.  In Myanmar, telecom company ownership is shrouded in layers of secrecy. “It’s purposefully opaque,” says Oliver Spencer, an adviser at the group Free Expression Myanmar.  A former Myanmar telecom company employee, however, told VOA that to a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that all four companies are now linked to the military to varying degrees. The employee requested that their name and former company be withheld for safety reasons.  “In this current period, it doesn’t matter who owns or how linked the company is to the military. The response of the companies would be identical,” they said. “Compliance is the result.”  In an email to VOA, ATOM’s communications team said the telecom company respects its customers’ rights and privacy.  “ATOM Myanmar will never facilitate or allow unlawful interception requests or equipment,” ATOM said. “Our telecom operation will always act in a law-abiding, ethical manner.”  “We continue to provide essential communication services to the people of Myanmar while respecting local and international laws; upholding human rights; and advocating for consumer protection regulations, especially in terms of data security, data resilience, privacy, connectivity, roaming, internet access, and others,” ATOM said.  The other three telecom companies did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment.  The military is most interested in accessing the user data of potential political opponents, resistance members and journalists as part of its broader effort to squash dissent, analysts believe.  That data can include details on who a user texts or calls, the length of calls, location data, and contents of unencrypted messages. Sometimes data can even reveal website history and whether a user is using a VPN.  “All types of data requests that you can dream of — it’s all done here,” the former employee said.  All the military needs is a phone number. That allows them to track who else that individual calls and texts, according to Spencer. “They’re basically enabling the military to spy on their customers,” he said.  A former journalist, who has left Myanmar but asked for anonymity for safety reasons, says that when a reporter’s “mobile number is exposed to police and military intelligence” they are no longer secure.  “The journalists who are living in Myanmar are aware of digital safety,” he said, adding that more and more reporters use encrypted platforms, regularly delete messages, and use two phones — one for reporting and another for non-sensitive use. The latter helps them pass through checkpoints, where police regularly check and confiscate phones.  Journalists still inside Myanmar also often change their SIM cards for security reasons, according to Nu Nu Lusan, a freelance reporter based in Malaysia.  “I don’t have much to worry about since I live outside the country, but my concern is for the sources in Myanmar,” she said. She uses secure messaging platforms to communicate with sources on the ground.  The Myanmar military’s control over technology and the internet with web shutdowns, online censorship, and surveillance has led U.N. experts to describe the strategy as an attempt to establish a “digital dictatorship.”  Although the former telecom company employee said the situation is less risky if users have access to a VPN and use encrypted messaging platforms, “where the internet is cut off but the phone line is not — that’s where the risks are for journalists and activists.”  Across the country, all 330 townships have been subjected to internet shutdowns at least once in 2022, with about 50 townships facing shutdowns that measure more than one year, according to a February report from the digital rights group Access Now.  “I try secure online communication options, but most conflict areas have no internet access,” Lusan said, so sources have to go somewhere with service. “There is no absolute safe communication when I communicate via telephone with the sources.”  All of this means it can be dangerous for people on the ground to communicate with each other and access banned independent news websites, which makes it harder for people to stay up to date on what’s happening in their country and around the world.  “This is the military strategy,” Spencer said, “to create a system of fear.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvaG93LW15YW5tYXItcy1qdW50YS11c2VzLXRlbGVjb20tY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLXRhcmdldC1qb3VybmFsaXN0cy83MDk2MDgyLmh0bWzSAWlodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvaG93LW15YW5tYXItcy1qdW50YS11c2VzLXRlbGVjb20tY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLXRhcmdldC1qb3VybmFsaXN0cy83MDk2MDgyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For decades, as Pakistani military remained the force that decided the country's fate, Ustad Daman's mockery stood the test of time; a subsistence of dry humour typical of two Punjabs of the Indian subcontinent, bitterly partitioned into present-day India, Pakistan and eventually Bangladesh after the British left in 1947.  But on May 9, 2023, when hundreds of enraged supporters of ousted Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan pushed through the gates of army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the army, unlike Ustad Daman's poetic assertion, was nowhere to be seen.  Hours earlier, Khan, Pakistan's cricket icon-turned-populist politician, was arrested from a courtroom in capital Islamabad, where he had sought bail for one of over 142 corruption cases filed against him through the Army-run National Accountability Bureau (NAB).  ALSO WATCH | Imran Khan arrest: 9 killed, over 2,000 arrested across Pakistan | WION Fineprint × Days later, after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief managed to get bail and a two-week arrest freeze following the Supreme Court's intervention, an emboldened Khan launched an even more vigorous attack on the army; recalling its humiliating defeat in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh and Osama bin Laden's killing in 2011 in Abbottabad in an operation by the US Special Forces. Pakistan turmoil: Cracks within the army in spotlight For the first time in Pakistan’s history, action against a political leader inspired a 'mini-intifada' against the military itself. But despite an unprecedented action from Khan's supporters, there is no unprecedented counter-reaction from the army (which history suggests, is usually a coup or imposition of Emergency in Pakistan). Instead, the army was quick enough to ward off the speculations of Martial Law imposition.  The army pulled its guards back, and let the looting of its officers’ homes take place, avoiding bloodshed near key military installations.  But why such stoicism?  Divisions or rifts within the army are now emerging as the most plausible reason behind Rawalpindi's refusal to formally take over Islamabad's corridors of power.  The rift within the army has been evident since General Asim Munir took over as Army chief against officers like Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed, who were seen as more sympathetic to Imran Khan.  ""It would be unwise of the army to take over directly because the situation is so bad in Pakistan when it comes to not just the economy but also the terrorism. Whoever is directly in charge would incur further unpopularity,"" Sharat Sabharwal, India's former ambassador to Pakistan, and author of 'India's Pakistan Conundrum: Managing a Complex Relationship', told WION.  Pointing towards the relationship of ""mutual dependence"" between the army and the civilian leadership, Sabharwal asked: ""Why would they do it when they have a civilian façade from where they continue to operate?"" What lies ahead for Pakistan: Emergency or technocratic government? Immediately after the events of May 9th, a proposal for the imposition of a state of Emergency was laid out in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.  A national state of Emergency will give the authority to the army without taking over directly. ""A civilian government can declare Emergency and call the army out and the latter can do their bit,"" Sabharwal told WION.  In the past, the moments of crisis in the chaotic relationship of mutual dependence between the Pakistan Army and the civilian government have led to the formation of technocratic governments.  In a technocratic government, individuals are appointed to the ministries on the basis of their expertise and are not necessarily career politicians. Most recently, between 2004 and 2007, Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf installed Shaukat Aziz, a former banker and financier, as prime minister in a technocratic government.  Pakistan has justified military takeovers and formation of such technocratic governments with a ""doctrine of necessity"", which refers to extraordinary actions to restore order even if such actions contravene established laws.  ""The Supreme Court is made to give an endorsement in making an exception to the constitution,"" Sabharwal said, while cautioning that such an endorsement may not come easy during the tenure of current chief justice Umar Ata Bandial.  ""The chief justices in the past have been browbeaten by the army and made to act in their favour. But this one so far has not done so. He would have known that the army was behind Imran Khan's arrest and despite that he ordered his release. He's a bold guy,"" Sabharwal said. A novel outburst against the army Meanwhile, a number of Pakistanis have come out to cheer the way a section of their fellow citizens have brazenly rounded upon the armed forces. This, according to Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, is a “novel outburst”.

"coup","2023-07-17","10:00:00","{""Quito"", ""Pichincha"", ""Ecuador""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:31:03","Lasso could trigger the ‘two-way death’ clause in Ecuador’s constitution, dissolving both the legislature and ending his presidency.  Ecuador’s National Assembly has begun an impeachment hearing against President Guillermo Lasso, who stands accused of corruption with regard to an embezzlement scheme involving a state-owned oil transport company.  But the hearings, which launched on Tuesday, could trigger a potentially explosive showdown between the president and the country’s unicameral legislature.  Experts have speculated that Lasso could invoke a never-before-used constitutional clause known as “two-way death”, which would allow him to both dissolve the legislature and end his presidency.  Speaking to the legislators on Tuesday, Lasso maintained he was guilty of no wrongdoing. “There is no evidence, nor relevant testimonies,” he told the lawmakers. “Rather, all there is is information that proves my total, evident and unquestionable innocence.”  In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ana Belen, a member of Lasso’s Creating Opportunities party, called Tuesday’s proceedings, if successful, “nothing short of a parliamentarian coup”.  But members of the opposition have rejected such accusations, calling instead for an end to government corruption.  “This is no coup. We’re not trying to destabilise the country,” Viviana Veloz, an opposition member of the assembly, told Al Jazeera. “It is a response to a demand by citizens, a desperate clamour for a constitutional solution to a problem called Guillermo Lasso.”  At issue in Tuesday’s hearing was Lasso’s decision not to intervene to end an embezzlement scheme between the state-owned oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private entity Amazonas Tankers.  Opponents say the scheme cost the state millions in losses and is part of a pattern of corruption within the administration.      Lasso has denied the allegations, with his supporters saying the president had no responsibility to intervene in the deal between the two companies, which had been struck before he took office in 2021.  “Remember that this contract was signed in 2018 by the previous government,” Belen told Al Jazeera. “Investigators have found no penal responsibility, so there can’t be a political one.”  Lasso has previously hinted that he could trigger the “muerte cruzada” or “two-way death” clause of Ecuador’s constitution if he appears to be on the cusp of impeachment, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Alessandro Rampietti, who reported from the capital Quito.  That decision could happen any time before the vote, Rampietti added.  Such a move would mean Lasso is declaring “the situation in the country is so complicated that governing is not an option anymore”, he said.  “That would mean essentially dissolving Congress, also the end of his presidency and calling for early elections. But he would then have the opportunity to continue governing by decree for the next six months.”  “It has never been done before in Ecuador,” Rampietti explained. “It’s considered an extreme political decision.”  Analysts fear such a move could spark protests similar to those that broke out last year over the rising cost of living. Further instability would rock a country already contending with deteriorating economic conditions and a tide of drug-related killings.  For its part, the opposition believes it has the supermajority needed to succeed in its impeachment attempt. A supermajority is reached with 92 votes out of the 137-person chamber — in other words, a two-thirds majority.  Lasso, a 67-year-old former banker, narrowly survived an impeachment vote last year, with only 80 legislators voting in favour.      Opinions were divided on the streets of Quito, where some citizens spoke in support of Lasso’s impeachment.  “The Congress is representing the will of the people. This government has only destroyed our health and education systems,” Carla Araujo told Al Jazeera.  Others, meanwhile, felt Lasso deserved to serve out his term in office.  “The people, 18 million Ecuadorians, voted, and he won a majority,” Fidel Lopez, another Quito resident, said. “We should let him finish his work.”  On Monday, the Organization of American States also weighed in, calling on Ecuadorian legislators to “offer all the guarantees of justice and respect the rules of due process” during the impeachment proceedings.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTYvaW1wZWFjaG1lbnQtaGVhcmluZy1iZWdpbnMtaW4tZWN1YWRvci1hZ2FpbnN0LXByZXNpZGVudC1sYXNzb9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE2L2ltcGVhY2htZW50LWhlYXJpbmctYmVnaW5zLWluLWVjdWFkb3ItYWdhaW5zdC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtbGFzc28?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","1963-11-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:34:31","In the haunting Oscar-winning film The Lives of Others, an East German Stasi agent spies on innocent artists to tragic effect – but ends up changed, regretful and more fully human.  Watching it again this past week made me wonder: Is it remotely possible that America’s domestic spies and malefactors – who conspired to subvert and perhaps destroy our republic the past seven years – might also someday feel guilt and shame enough to come clean?  The Durham report on the FBI’s Russia collusion coup lays bare the fact that federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies under Barack Obama cynically conspired to gin up an investigation of candidate-turned-President Donald Trump. While cozying up to the Hillary Clinton campaign, the agency ignored intelligence of “a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”  The world-class conspiracy, involving an unknown number of unindicted co-conspirators, led to trumped-up charges against former Trump National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (who is now suing the government for $50 million for wrongful prosecution); illegal surveillance of a Trump supporter, aided by the phony Steele dossier and by repeated bald-faced government lies to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; and a two-year, multimillion-dollar Potemkin “probe” by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that hamstrung and further divided America.  All this, despite the fact that Christopher Steele’s own researcher had told the FBI in May 2017 there was absolutely nothing to the dossier. Yet the political operatives atop the agency plowed on in their scheme to destroy Trump and install their preferred political regime.  Does that even sound like America?  Even the far-left New York Times had to admit that Inspector General Michael Horowitz “painted a bleak portrait of the F.B.I. as a dysfunctional agency that severely mishandled its surveillance powers.”  There is a long history and a tragic trail of victims of FBI incompetence and corruption. But the Russia collusion fabrication – an attempt to first swing an election and then, failing that, nothing short of an attempted coup – is the darkest hour of a now wholly discredited law enforcement agency.  Emboldened by their ability to get away with their crimes against the American people, federal intelligence officials more recently conspired before the 2020 election to help Joe Biden by insinuating the damning Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. To pull off the ruse, they produced a letter bearing the weight of 51 former intelligence officials. And now we know it was all to give the elder Biden cover during a presidential debate with Trump.  It also helped the Biden family corruption story – which, three years later, has fresh legs – to go away in time for the fateful election.  But again, as bad as that was, the Russia hoax is “the biggest scandal in American history, that we’re still living with today,” says former U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who was among the first to unearth the conspiracy years ago.  “This changed the course of human history. It changed the course of our elections.”  Undoubtedly. Still, the reason we’re “still living” with it is because the spies and malefactors behind it all can somehow live with themselves, and apparently won’t slink out of the slimy sewers of espionage to own up to their crimes.  They should. And they must.  If there’s a shred of decency, a shard of shame, left inside them, they’ll step out of the darkened alleys of their contemptible crimes to tell their countrymen, the world and posterity what they have done to the nation and to the cause of freedom.  And then they’ll fall to their knees and beg Americans for forgiveness.  I’ve watched The Lives of Others before, but it has a particularly somber resonance today. For, like the East Germans of old, we, too, live under a government that has turned on its own people – at least those of us who refuse to conform to the liberal orthodoxy of the current ruling class and its torch-wielding sycophants bent on breaking down the few doors to power they don’t already control.  In the film, the victim eventually learns that his Stasi spy had secretly grown to care for and actually protect him from government overseers. In a free and unified Germany, the victim later writes a book called Sonata for a Good Man – which he has cryptically dedicated to the spy who came in from the cold.  Could that happen here? Could any of those in our intelligence and law enforcement agencies who have knowingly subverted our republic feel remorse sufficient to admit their crimes – offenses which they compound every morning when they wake up in a free country they don’t deserve to live in, much less “serve”?  Are there no good men left?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL2hlYXJ0bGFuZGVybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi93aWxsLXRoZS1zcGllcy1hbmQtbWFsZWZhY3RvcnMtaW4tb3VyLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtZXZlci1jb21lLWNsZWFuLW9uLXRoZWlyLXJvbGVzLWluLXRoZS1ydXNzaWEtY29sbHVzaW9uLWNvdXAtaXMtdGhlcmUtb25lLWdvb2QtbWFuLWFtb25nLXRoZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2022-04-13","Not Discerned","{""Koblenz"", ""RheinlandPalatinate"", ""Germany""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:05:42","They are accused of planning a coup and to kidnap German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Now, five suspected members of a terrorist group linked to the ""Reichsbürger"" movement are facing trial.  The trial of five suspected members of the ""Vereinte Patrioten"" (United Patriots) group begins on Wednesday (May 17) at the Higher Regional Court in the western German city of Koblenz.  The four men, along with a 75-year-old woman who is suspected of being the group's ringleader, are accused of planning to overthrow the German government. According to federal prosecutors, they got together in mid-January 2022 and called themselves the ""Vereinte Patrioten"". They are now charged with founding or being a member of a terrorist organization.  The group stands accused of wanting to unleash a civil war-like situation by causing an electricity blackout and kidnapping German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Their goal: the end of the parliamentary democracy in Germany.  After their planned takeover, the accused wanted to assume control of government agencies themselves. Federal prosecutors, therefore, accused them of ""preparing high treason against the federal government.""  The plotters had been planning to kidnap Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Image: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images  How advanced were the group's plans?  Investigators have described ""concrete preparations"" by the accused, who communicated primarily via a chat group on the Telegram online messaging service and met several times in various locations.  One of the accused scouted targets for attacks on the electricity network. Another planned the kidnapping of the health minister, ""if necessary, by killing his bodyguards.""  To that end, the group obtained kalashnikovs and pistols as well as ammunition. They also wanted to import barrels of explosives from the former Yugoslavia.  Part of the 'Reichsbürger' movement?  The alleged ideological leader of the group is a 75-year-old former pastor and teacher who most recently lived in Saxony. Her writings were found on the blogs of the ""Reichsbürger"" (Citizens of the Reich) movement. They are written in the characteristic style of the 23,000-member movement which claims that the German Reich — Germany under the rule of an emperor — still exists as it did until 1918. The Reichsbürger reject all current state authorities as unlawful.  Open letters the woman is accused of writing on ""Reichsbürger"" blogs are addressed to Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, or ""the Allies."" In them, she expresses antisemitic thoughts, signed with ""Wilhelm-Emperor-Rex-Descendants,"" implying that she saw herself as a successor of the last German emperor.  Federal prosecutors are convinced that the woman and her accomplices were more than eccentric imposters. According to the group's theory that the German Reich continues to exist based on the constitution of 1871, they would conclude that the democratic order of the Federal Republic of Germany was invalid. Instead, an authoritarian system of government modeled on the German Empire must be reintroduced.  Why target the health minister?  Karl Lauterbach has long been considered a bogeyman by Germany's ""Querdenker"" (lateral thinkers) and ""Reichsbürger"" movements. Even before he was appointed health minister in December 2021, the professor of medicine made countless media appearances as an expert during the COVID-19 pandemic. During these, he advocated for strict measures such as limitations on interpersonal contact to combat the spread of the virus. He continued this course when he entered office as minister.  In doing so, he drew hatred from extremist circles who rejected government measures to combat the pandemic in Germany. Lauterbach remains under round-the-clock protection to this day.  How was the group discovered?  An undercover investigator is said to have played a key role in the arrests of the suspects. He was deployed in the surroundings of the accused for months.  On April 13, 2022, the four accused men were arrested, and the woman on October 13 the same year. Since then, they have been remanded in custody.  If the court finds them guilty, they are likely to face several years in prison.  This article was originally written in German.

The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2F6ZXJiYWlqYW4tY291cC1wbG90LWlyYW4v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGVmZW5zZXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvYXplcmJhaWphbi1jb3VwLXBsb3QtaXJhbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Soviet invasion of 1979 started a series of continuous civil wars – Russian vs Mujahideen; Taliban against the American-led invasion, a brief respite before Kabul fell to the Taliban once again in 2021.

"coup","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Bangkok"", ""Bangkok"", ""Thailand""}","Mon 15 May 2023 12:24:15","This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  BANGKOK (AP) — Following a stunning election victory in which they together captured a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Thailand’s top two opposition parties began planning Monday for the next stage in their bid to replace the military-dominated government.  The Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old businessman Pita Limjaroenrat, placed first in the election, surpassing most expectations. It squeaked past the Pheu Thai party, which had been favored to top the polls.  Pheu Thai stumbled despite the star power of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist prime minister who was toppled by a 2006 military coup and is the driving force behind the party.  “The overwhelming electoral victory by Move Forward and Pheu Thai is a decisive sign that voters want a polity where the people, not the military, decide their future,” said Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thai studies scholar at the University of Wisconsin.  “Voters want a Thailand with free speech, without compulsory military conscription, and where the people’s voices are valued, not something to be silenced or bought,” she said.  Pita said Monday he has been talking to five other parties about forming a coalition government. It would have 309 House seats in total, providing more stability than the 292-seat partnership with Pheu Thai as a sole ally. Parliament selects a new prime minister in July, so has about two months to seal a deal.  Move Forward's supporters drove through the streets of Bangkok on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory. Pita smiled broadly and waved as a convoy of open trucks took him and other party members slowly through the streets of the old part of the capital.  Thailand for the past nine years has been led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in a 2014 military coup and was returned as prime minister after the 2019 election. He ran for reelection on Sunday, but has been blamed for a lagging economy, a botched initial response to the coronavirus pandemic and for thwarting democratic reforms — a particular sore point with younger voters.  “The sentiment of the era has changed and it’s right,” Pita said Monday. “And today it’s a new day and hopefully it’s full of bright sunshine of hope going forward.”  Earlier, as it became clear his party was taking the lead, he tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister. “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you.""  Move Forward and Pheu Thai are mostly allied in their opposition to the military’s recurring interference in politics, demonstrated by more than a dozen coups it has staged since 1932, when Thailand became a constitutional monarchy, and most recently in 2006 and 2014.  Both parties also favor reform of some aspects of the monarchy, a position that riles the conservative royalist establishment that regards the institution as sacrosanct. Because Move Forward has been more outspoken on the subject, it is regarded as radical in the context of mainstream Thai politics.  With almost all votes counted Monday, Move Forward had captured a projected 151 seats in the lower house by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the votes for the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Pheu Thai party trailed a close second with its combined seat total projected at 141.  Prayuth's United Thai Nation Party holds fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Although the numbers place Pita in a favorable position for becoming the next prime minister, he faces a difficult path.  Candidates are handicapped by constitutional rules crafted by the military government to restrain political parties with populist appeals from taking root and upending the long-established conservative order.  The prime minister is elected by a joint session of the 500 members of the newly elected House and 250 senators, who were appointed by the military. The winner must secure at least 376 votes.  The Senate, a stalwart defender of the royalist order along with the army and the courts, voted unanimously for Prayuth in 2019, enabling him to overcome Pheu Thai’s first-place finish and form a coalition government.  There is a strong possibility that Pita will be seen as too radical by some partner parties, and they will have to look for a more moderate candidate.  Pheu Thai’s Paetongtarn is the most popular choice of her party base. But her ties to her father, Thaksin, with whom the military has never reconciled since ousting him in 2006, would make winning any support from the Senate difficult. One of Pheu Thai’s other candidates for prime minister, real estate magnate Srettha Thavisin, would stand a better chance in that case.  There are also fears the conservative elements in Thai politics would again employ what critics consider to be dirty tricks to keep a hold on power. Since Thaksin’s fall, they have repeatedly used the courts and so-called independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue controversial legal rulings to cripple or sink political threats from opponents. Such efforts would likely stir up vigorous street protests.  “Is the form of coalition that Pita proposed, with 309 seats, stable enough? In a democratic world, it’s the most stable. But in a world of half-dictatorship that has the Senate as an important variable, Move Forward must lever the Senate with the people’s voices,” said Pinkaew Laungaramsri, a professor of anthropology at Chiang Mai University.  “We have to wait and see whether the authoritarians will dare using their illegitimate authorities that go against the will of the people. If they do that, it’s just creating a condition for the people to go back onto the streets,* she said.  ___  Associated Press video journalist Jerry Harmer contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am91cm5hbGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYXJ0aWNsZS90aGV5LXdhbnQtY2hhbmdlLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tcGFydGllcy13aW4tYmlnLWluLTE4MDk5MTUwLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"coup","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 05:48:00","CNN —  Thai voters delivered a powerful message to the country’s military-backed government on Sunday: you do not have the will of the people to rule.  The progressive Move Forward Party, which gained a huge following among young Thais for its reformist platform, won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote.  Pheu Thai, the main opposition party that has been a populist force in Thailand for 20 years, came second.  Together they delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.  “This is an unmistakable frontal rebuke, a rejection of Thailand’s military authoritarian past. It’s a rejection of military dominance in politics,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.  Over the last two decades, each time Thais have been allowed to vote, they have done so overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political opponents. Sunday’s vote – which saw a record turnout – was a continuation of that tradition.  But despite winning a landslide, it is far from certain who will be the next leader.  Supporters of the Move Forward Party react as they watch results come in at the party headquarters in Bangkok on May 14, after polls closed in Thailand's general election. Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images  That’s because the military junta that last seized power in 2014 rewrote the constitution to ensure they maintain a huge say in who can lead, whether or not they win the popular vote.  Neither opposition party won an outright majority of 376 seats needed to form a government outright, they will need to strike deals and wrangle support from other parties to form a coalition big enough to ensure victory.  But that won’t necessarily be straightforward.  Dangerous territory  The first thing to know is that any opposition party or coalition hoping to form a government must overcome the powerful voting bloc of the senate.  Under the junta-era constitution, Thailand’s unelected 250-seat senate is chosen entirely by the military and has previously voted for a pro-military candidate.  Because a party needs a majority of the combined houses – 750 seats – to elect a prime minister, it means opposition parties need almost three times as many votes in the lower house to be able to elect the next leader and form a government.  In 2019, coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha won the senate votes which ensured his party’s coalition gained enough seats to elect him as prime minister, despite Pheu Thai being the largest party.  There are also other threats to the progressive movement’s win. Parties that have previously pushed for change have run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.  Move Forward Party leader and prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, attends a press conference following the general election, at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 15. Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters  Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.  And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the constitutional court are all dominated in favor of the establishment.  In the progressive camp’s favor, however, is their large margin over the military-backed parties.  “If the results were murky, or if the pro-military parties got more, then we would be looking at manipulation, trying to shave the margins. But the results are so clear and very difficult to overturn now,” said Thitinan, adding that if there were attempts to subvert the vote, there would be public anger and protests.  Move Forward’s predecessor the Future Forward Party won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it violated electoral finance rules.  In the short term, that decision ended the threat from the Future Forward Party. But it also, in many ways, laid the foundation for Sunday’s historic vote.  Youth-led protests erupted across Thailand in 2020 after Future Forward was dissolved and a whole new generation of young political leaders were born, some of whom were willing to debate a previously taboo topic – royal reform.  Those calls electrified Thailand, where any frank discussion of the monarchy is fraught with the threat of prison under one of the strictest lese majeste laws in the world.  Many youth leaders were jailed or face ongoing prosecution linked to those protests. But some also went on to create the Move Forward party that swept to victory in the popular vote on Sunday.  That leaves the military establishment now locked in a political battle with a party that has kept the subject of royal reform on its manifesto.  Experts have said another coup would be costly, and dissolving a party with such a mandate would be “drastic.”  “Dissolving a party is a fairly drastic move. If there’s a way of keeping Move Forward out without dissolving them, then conservative politicians would probably prefer to do that. Because it’s not as strong a step in subverting the will that people have expressed,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute.  “But you can’t rule that out.”  See why Thailand's ex-coup leader is showing a softer side ahead of election 02:58 - Source: CNN  Vote for change cannot be ignored  Move Forward’s allure went beyond the youth vote on which it built its base.  Unofficial results showed the party captured 32 out of 33 seats in Bangkok – traditionally a stronghold for conservative parties.  “What this shows is that people who are living in urban areas are really fed up with the government that the military has provided for almost a decade,” said Patton.  “They are wanting to choose something different, and Move Forward is not just the youth party but actually can attract a wider cross section of support as well.”  Move Forward’s radical agenda includes reforming the military, getting rid of the draft, reducing the military’s budget, making it more transparent and accountable, as well as constitutional change and to bring the military and monarchy within the constitution.  The party’s win over the populist juggernaut Pheu Thai is also significant. This is the first time a party linked with ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has lost an election since 2001.  And Pheu Thai’s marginal defeat to Move Forward shows voters’ frustration with the old cycle of politics that pitted populist Thaksin-linked parties against the establishment.  Thailand’s “two party system was already breaking down in 2019, but it’s continuing to break down this election,” said Patton.  In a press conference on Monday, Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat said the party would go forward with plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws – a key campaign pledge despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.  One of his priorities is to support young people facing jail terms on lese majeste charges, and Pita warned that if the law remains as it is, the relationship between the Thai people and the monarchy will only worsen.  His policies “strike at heart of the establishment,” said Thitinan, and even talking about the monarchy openly “is an affront to the palace.”  The Move Forward leader said Monday that he wants to form an alliance with the four other opposition parties to secure a majority in the lower house.  It could take 60 days before a prime ministerial candidate is endorsed by Thailand’s combined houses of parliament, but Sunday’s vote shows the people are ready for change.  However, if Thailand’s turbulent recent history is anything to go by, that could mean little. The military has shown in the past that it has few qualms about ignoring the popular vote.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTUvYXNpYS90aGFpbGFuZC1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLXBhcnRpZXMtbWlsaXRhcnktZWxlY3Rpb24tYW5hbHlzaXMtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDUvMTUvYXNpYS90aGFpbGFuZC1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLXBhcnRpZXMtbWlsaXRhcnktZWxlY3Rpb24tYW5hbHlzaXMtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"coup","2023-03-02","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 15:36:54","Thailand’s opposition racked up a stunning majority of the 500 seats at stake in the race for the House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to the establishment parties and the former general who has led the Southeast Asian country since seizing power in a 2014 coup.  The results of Sunday’s general election are a strong repudiation of the country’s conservatives and reflect the disenchantment in particular of young voters who want to limit the influence of the military in politics and reform the monarchy.  But the exact shape of the new government is less clear as post-election coalition talks and behind-the-scene negotiations take center stage.  The results  With almost all votes counted Monday, the Move Forward Party emerged as the big winner. It captured a projected 151 seats in the lower House by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Tailing a close second is the main opposition Pheu Thai Party, whose combined seat total is projected at 141.  The party of incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general who came to power in the 2014 coup, held the fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Voter turnout was about 75% of the 52 million registered voters.  What’s next?  Who becomes the next prime minister will depend on a vote set for July that includes all the House lawmakers plus the 250-seat military-appointed Senate, whose members share the establishment’s conservative policies. The winner must attain at least 376 of their combined 750 seats.  Opposition parties have criticized the process as undemocratic. It’s a legacy of the 2014 coup and a new constitution drafted in its aftermath that was meant to ensure that the military and the state bureaucracy, the main upholders of the royal order, continue to hold sway.  Analysts have pointed out that a lot can still happen before the Election Commission even declares the results valid, a process that can take up to 75 days and will almost certainly include legal challenges.  In the past, the commission and the courts have used their authority to disqualify opposition parties.  What the opposition wants  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister.  “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you,” he wrote.  Although he energized younger voters with his progressive agenda, the businessman has alarmed conservatives with calls for reform of the monarchy, the institution that has been traditionally treated as sacrosanct.  In 2019, the Constitutional Court ousted his colleague from Parliament on charges of violating the election law and dissolved the Future Forward party, which then changed its name and leadership to become Move Forward.  It had been supporting amending the draconian law that punishes defaming the monarchy, which according to critics has been used as a tool to quash political dissent and imprison pro-democracy student activists.  Student-led protests beginning in 2020 openly criticized the monarchy, previously a taboo subject, leading to vigorous prosecutions under the law. They were also dismayed by the dissolution of the Future Forward party, which they believed was an unfair use of state power.  Thaksin’s shadow  Pheu Thai is led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was toppled in a 2006 coup.  The power struggle between Thaksin’s supporters, many of them rural poor who benefited from his populist policies, and his conservative opponents has been fought – sometimes in the street, sometimes at the ballot box – for almost two decades.  In the 2014 coup, Mr. Chan-ocha unseated the government of Yingluck Shinawatra – Paetongtarn’s aunt, Thaksin’s sister – as prime minister. And Pheu Thai topped the field in the 2019 vote, only to be denied power when the army-backed Palang Pracharath Party found partners to assemble a coalition government.

"coup","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 23:30:51","Move Forward Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat (second from right) leads a victory parade on Monday. Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP via Getty  Thai voters made clear in Sunday's election that they want change. The question is now whether the military-aligned establishment will let them have it.  Why it matters: Sunday's result was a political earthquake, not just because pro-democracy parties trounced pro-military ones, but also because the progressive party that finished first, Move Forward, campaigned on the once-taboo topic of reforming the monarchy.  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a former business executive and relative newcomer to politics who studied at Harvard and MIT, introduced himself on Monday as ""the next prime minister of Thailand.""  The twin pillars of Thailand's establishment, the military and the monarchy, have the power to block him. Thailand has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, and parties or candidates have frequently been disqualified from holding office even after elections were held.  But such an intervention would risk ""major street violence"" and create ""an incredibly unstable situation,"" says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Thailand is the only upper-middle income country that regularly has coups,"" Kurlantzick tells Axios. ""Young Thais are tired of the economy and politics being stuck in this archaic past, run by generals and kings.""  The big picture: Before Sunday's shock result, the election had been billed as a showdown between the military and the Shinawatra political dynasty, represented by the Pheu Thai party.  Parties associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had won the most seats in every election since 2001, but were repeatedly elbowed out of power by the coup-prone military.  This time, Thaksin's daughter Paethongtarn Shinawatra was on the ballot, facing off against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a 2014 coup and retained power after the 2019 election. His popularity has since collapsed.  Meanwhile, massive pro-democracy protests broke out in 2020, with student leaders demanding reform not just of the military, but also of the monarchy.  That was unprecedented in a country where lèse-majesté laws mean criticizing Thailand's king can result in jail time. Dozens of protesters remain in prison.  In this election, Pheu Thai stuck to its pitch of lifting up lower-income voters but avoided the reform proposals that had energized the youthful protesters.  ""Pheu Thai fought the wrong war, the populism war that it already won. Move Forward takes the game to the next level with institutional reform. That's the new battleground in Thai politics,"" Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told Reuters.  By the numbers: Move Forward won an estimated 151 of the 500 lower house seats, nearly sweeping the capital, Bangkok. Pheu Thai won 141. Pita announced on Monday that they'll try to form a government with four smaller parties, bringing the bloc's total to 309 seats.  That clear majority could nonetheless be insufficient because a new constitution brought in under Prayuth's junta gave 250 military-appointed senators a vote on prospective prime ministers. If the Senate votes against Pita's coalition, it would be rejected.  But Prayuth's party and another military-backed party only won a combined 76 seats.  Even if the pro-military bloc gets other nonaligned parties onside, it could only cobble together a very weak minority government. That is, unless it enticed Pheu Thai to join forces, though that currently looks unlikely.  What they're saying: Paethongtarn Shinawatra congratulated Pita and said she expects their parties to be able to work ""smoothly together.""  Prayuth said he respects ""the democratic process and the election results,"" a message that's undercut somewhat by his recent history as a coup leader.  For his part, Pita said there would be ""a hefty price to pay for someone who’s thinking of abolishing the election results or forming a minority government,"" adding: ""I don’t think the people of Thailand would allow that to happen.”  What's next: Thailand's Election Commission has 60 days to confirm the results, during which time Pita will likely work to solidify his coalition, while the other major players will plan their next moves.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE1L21vdmUtZm9yd2FyZC13aW5zLXRoYWlsYW5kLWVsZWN0aW9uLXJlc3VsdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Zelensky landed by helicopter at Chequers, the British leader’s official country retreat, and was greeted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It’s Zelensky’s second trip to the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  This is the fourth European country Zelenskky has visited in the past few days. He is seeking more aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake territory seized by Russia.  Ukraine’s leader made an unannounced visit to Paris on Sunday evening to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, after trips to Germany and Italy, where he met those countries’ leaders and Pope Francis.  A message posted Monday on Zelensky’s official Telegram Channel said: “Today — London. The UK is leading the way when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.”  The UK has become one of Ukraine’s major military allies, sending Kyiv short-range missiles and Challenger tanks and training 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week Britain announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) — the first known shipment of the weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak’s office said that on Monday Britain will confirm it is giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles).  “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,” Sunak said. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  “We must not let them down.”  Sunak will also push allies to deliver more support to Ukraine at a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week, Downing Street said.  As Zelensky visited European capitals, Russia stepped up attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles over the weekend. On Sunday, Russia shelled two communities in the northern border region of Sumy, the region’s military administration said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. It said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelensky and Macron met for about three hours on Sunday at the French presidential Elysee Palace — an encounter kept under wraps until shortly before the Ukrainian leader’s arrival in Paris.  Macron’s office said France will supply dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles “in the weeks ahead,” without giving specific numbers. Also promised were more air defense systems, but again details weren’t made public.  More Ukrainians will also be made battle-ready, with France aiming to train about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland as part of a wider European effort, Macron’s office said.  France has supplied Ukraine with an array of weaponry, include air defense systems, light tanks, howitzers and other arms and equipment and fuel.  France had dispatched a plane to pick up Zelensky in Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier Sunday and discussed his country’s planned counteroffensive.  It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine worth more than 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion), including tanks, anti-aircraft systems and ammunition.  After initially hesitating to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defense system. Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive.  In the western German city of Aachen, Zelensky also received the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize, awarded to him and the people of Ukraine.  On Saturday. he met Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome.  On the European trip, Zelensky said Ukraine will aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and not attack Russian territory.  The Washington Post cited previously undisclosed documents from a trove of US intelligence leaks suggesting that Zelensky has considered trying to capture areas in Russia proper for possible use as bargaining chips in peace negotiations to end the war launched by Moscow in February 2022. This would put him at odds with Western governments that have insisted that weapons they provide must not be used to attack targets in Russia.  Asked about the report, Zelensky said: “We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory.”  “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia),” he said, according to an official interpreter. “And we also don’t have weapons to spare with which we could do this.”  “We are preparing a counterattack for the illegally occupied areas based on our constitutionally defined legitimate borders, which are recognized internationally,” Zelensky said.  Among areas still occupied by Russia are the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMDM0ODYvd29ybGTSASlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFibmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS8yMzAzNDg2L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Awami League lawmaker Naheed on Wednesday filed the case against former army chief and former president Ziaur Rahman, retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher, and 25 others, accusing them of taking part in the killings of her father Colonel Khandker Nazmul Huda, Major General Khaled Mosharraf, and Lieutenant Colonel ATM Haider in Dhaka during a turmoil inside the army on November 7, 1975.  ‘Naheed Izahar Khan filed the case against Ziaur Rahman for her father’s murder for the benefit of the current fascist Awami League regime. There is a political conspiracy behind it. The main reason is to divert domestic and foreign democracy-lovers’ attention from the ongoing anti-fascist movement,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka.  Giving a formal reaction about the case filed 48 years after the killing of Colonel Nazmul Huda in an army mutiny on November 7, 1975, the BNP leader said that Ziaur Rahman rather ordered the protection of Nazmul Huda.  In a written statement, the BNP secretary general mentioned that it was an irony that Naheed Ezaher Khan probably did not even read the book authored by her mother. Her mother, Neelufar Huda, clearly writes in the book titled ‘Colonel Huda O Amar Juddha’, stating the situation in which Colonel Huda was killed.  ‘The testimony of the people present there proves that on that day Ziaur Rahman ordered Colonel Nawazish Ahmed to protect Khaled Mosharraf, Colonel Huda, and Major Haider. On page 134 of the book written by the mother of the plaintiff, Naheed Ezaher Khan, Colonel Taher’s involvement in the murder has clearly emerged,’ Fakhrul said.  Mentioning that Colonel Huda was the brigade commander in Rangpur Cantonment in 1975, Fakhrul said that Colonel Huda was one of the participants in the military coup led by Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, 1975.  ‘He [Colonel Huda] came to Dhaka to lead the coup. It should be noted that the then army chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman, was put under house arrest to seize state power under Khaled Mosharraf. Basically, Khaled Mosharraf and his associates’ political ambitions led to the most brutal prison killings in history,’ he added.  Fakhrul said that the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup created an extremely chaotic environment in the army.  ‘By taking the opportunity, the Revolutionary Soldier Organization and Jasad Gono Bahini, led by Colonel Taher-Inu [Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu], staged a counter-coup, creating an army officer-soldier dispute in the army and participating in a far-reaching domestic-foreign plot to kill brutal army officers. Colonel Nazmul Huda, one of the participants in the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup, is a cruel victim,’ he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FnZWJkLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMTY3Mi9hbHMtaW50ZXJlc3QtYmVoaW5kLWNhc2UtZmlsZWQtYWdhaW5zdC16aWEtYm5w0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now we know what he means.  If Labour wins next year, Starmer plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds.  The plan would mean that 3.4million EU citizens with 'settled status' would be eligible to vote. Another 2.6million are 'pre-settled' and would doubtless be fast-tracked by Labour.  At a stroke, the electorate would be packed with some 6million foreign voters: More than enough to swing any general election – or a new EU referendum.  Enfranchising under-18s would add another 1.4million voters to the electoral roll.  © Provided by Daily Mail If Labour wins next year, Keir Starmer (pictured) plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds  The audacity of this expansion of the franchise – the biggest for nearly a century since 1928, when most women got the vote – is exceeded only by its cynicism.  For Sir Keir knows, of course, that the great majority of these extra votes would go to him.  Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour's favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power.  Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Many on the Left have looked enviously north of the border, as the SNP lowered the Scottish Parliament's voting age to 16 and extended it to EU citizens too.  Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, may now be disgraced and discredited, but – when it comes to her electoral initiatives – Labour is following her example.  Sir Keir's electoral stitch-up is so transparently self-interested that it amounts to political chicanery – 'dirty and nasty' indeed.  Yet the fact that it fails the smell test doesn't mean it could not happen. Most people will instinctively know that Labour's plan is wrong. But why?  Giving votes in general elections to EU residents would be a bad idea even if it were reciprocal. But it is not. Last year the European Court of Justice ruled that UK citizens living in France cannot vote even in local elections, let alone national ones.  © Provided by Daily Mail Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Pictured: Starmer at a pro-EU rally in 2019  That ruling applies to all other EU countries apart from Ireland because it has a century-old reciprocal agreement on voting with Britain.  Why should the UK give votes to EU nationals who live and work here, when Brussels refuses to do the same for British expats in Europe?  A more fundamental reason for rejecting Labour's plan is that voting is the most basic of democratic rights, which ought to be granted only to British citizens with a permanent stake in the future of this country. My Polish daughter-in-law gained UK citizenship, not just by living here for a decade and mastering English, but by demonstrating her knowledge of and commitment to Britain, by – among other things – making a solemn oath of allegiance to the Crown.  To give the vote to foreigners who have done none of this, but merely have 'settled status', is to devalue the very idea of citizenship.  We all loathe the idea of 'health tourists' – visitors who come here only to take advantage of the NHS. So why create 'voting tourists'? As for giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, this preposterous proposal ignores the fact that they are still adolescents and considered insufficiently mature to enjoy many of the rights and freedoms that over-18s enjoy.  We don't allow under-18s to gamble, to buy alcohol or tobacco, or even to have a credit card. In England and Wales, it is not possible to get married until the age of 18.  These and many other legal prohibitions exist because, in law, 16 and 17-year-olds are not adults but children, who need protection and cannot be held fully responsible for their actions.  That is why courts are much more lenient in sentencing minors. By the same token, however, under-18s should not expect to enjoy the same rights as adults. That includes the right to vote.  By dangling this precious right in front of youngsters who cannot yet properly grasp its significance, Sir Keir shows that he cares nothing for their welfare but everything for his own party political interest.  Lowering the voting age is a policy he has inherited from Jeremy Corbyn – the most dangerous man ever to lead a major party in Britain.  And let it never be forgotten that Sir Keir campaigned to put Corbyn into No 10.  It is chilling to imagine the consequences of giving the vote to EU citizens and children. The temptation to promise them favours at the expense of others would be overwhelming.  It's easy to imagine Left-wing politicians lifting border controls to please EU voters. Or wooing teenagers with a bonfire of age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes, betting and nightclubs.  Britons are rightly proud of having exported liberty under the law to the whole world. But if Labour's rigged the electoral system, it would be a sinister kind of euthanasia for the oldest parliamentary democracy on Earth.  'Dirty and nasty'? The words are yours, Sir Keir.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLWF1L25ld3Mvb3RoZXIvc3Rhcm1lci1zLXJpZ2dpbmctb2YtZnV0dXJlLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1pcy1iaWctc3RlcC10b3dhcmRzLWEtb25lLXBhcnR5LXN0YXRlLXdyaXRlcy1kYW5pZWwtam9obnNvbi9hci1BQTFiYms4WT9vY2lkPVBlcmVncmluZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Some 400,000 people were evacuated in Myanmar and Bangladesh ahead of Cyclone Mocha making landfall, as authorities and aid agencies scrambled to avoid heavy casualties.  ""All communication is still down and people are in trouble because all the roofs are gone,"" said Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army, which control swathes of Rakhine state. ""We are using military devices to communicate with them.""  Benjamin Small, a consultant with the United Nations Development Programme, said it was hard to understand the scale of destruction because of ruptured communications in Rakhine.  ""But with reported 250 kph (155 mph) winds making Cyclone Mocha one of the strongest in Myanmar on record and the worrying images online, it's not looking good,"" Small said on his Twitter account.  In 2008, Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of Myanmar with winds of 240 kph (150 mph), killing nearly 140,000 people.  Since a junta topped a democratically elected government two years ago, Myanmar has been plunged into chaos and a resistance movement is fighting the military on various fronts following a crackdown on protests.  A junta spokesperson did not immediately answer a telephone call from Reuters seeking comment.  The military has imposed internet shutdowns across parts of the country, including some areas in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin state, which was also in Cyclone Mocha's path.  ""There is significant overlap between the shutdown areas and the cyclone's path, which is a major concern, as it's hindering efforts to reach people,"" said digital rights activist Htaike Htaike Aung.  In remote and hilly Chin, which has previously seen heavy fighting between the junta and the resistance, the areas the storm swept through is under a communications blackout since the coup, the Chin Human Rights Organization said.  ""We have not yet been able to establish the extent of the devastation,"" said the group's deputy director Salai Za Uk Ling. ""The storm itself is a trigger for more problems as heavy rains continue and landslides and flooding tend to follow.""
