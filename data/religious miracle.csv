"religious miracle","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""LittleElm"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:36:00","Jessica Bernardo poses for a photo at her home in Little Elm, Texas, Thursday, May 18, 2023. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  One woman had to carry her baby, missing much of her skull, for months knowing she'd bury her daughter soon after she was born. Another started mirroring the life-threatening symptoms that her baby was displaying while in the womb. An OB-GYN found herself secretly traveling to Colorado to abort her wanted pregnancy, marred by the diagnosis of a fatal fetal anomaly.  All of the women were told they could not end their pregnancies in Texas, a state that has enacted some of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws.  Now, they're asking a Texas court to put an emergency hold on some abortion restrictions, joining a lawsuit launched earlier this year by five other women who were denied abortions in the state, despite pregnancies they say endangered their health or lives.  More than a dozen Texas women in total have joined the Center for Reproductive Rights' lawsuit against the state's law, which prohibits abortions unless a mother's life is at risk — an exception that is not clearly defined. Texas doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to $100,000, leaving many women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy.  “Our hope is that it will allow physicians at least a little more comfort when it comes to patients in obstetrical emergencies who really need an abortion where it's going to effect their health, fertility or life going forward,” Molly Duane, the lead attorney on the case, told The Associated Press. “Almost all of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit tell similar stories about their doctors saying, if not for this law, I'd give you an abortion right now.”  The lawsuit serves as a nationwide model for abortion rights advocates to challenge strict new abortion laws states that have rolled out since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Sixteen states, including Texas, do not allow abortions when a fatal fetal anomaly is detected while six do not allow exceptions for the mother's health, according to an analysis by KFF, a health research organization.  Duane said the Center for Reproductive Rights is looking at filing similar lawsuits in other states, noting that they've heard from women across the country. Roughly 25 Texas women have contacted the organization about their own experiences since the initial lawsuit was filed in March.  The women who joined the lawsuit describe being elated about finding out they were pregnant before the experience turned catastrophic.  Jessica Bernardo and her husband spent years trying to conceive, even consulting fertility doctors, before finally become pregnant with a daughter, Emma, last July.  Almost immediately, Bernardo was coughing so hard and often she would sometimes throw up. Fourteen weeks into the pregnancy, test results revealed her baby likely had Down Syndrome, so she consulted a specialist who gave her devastating news: Emma's heart was underdeveloped and she had a rare, deadly disorder called fetal anasarca, which causes fluid to build up in the body.  “He handed me a tissue box,” recalled Bernardo, who lives in Frisco, Texas. “I thought maybe the worst thing he was going to tell us was that she's going to have Down Syndrome. Instead, he said, ‘I can tell you right away...she wouldn’t make it.'”  The doctor warned her to watch out for high blood pressure and coughing, symptoms of Mirror syndrome, another rare condition where a mother “mirrors” the same problems the fetus is experiencing.  With Bernardo's blood pressure numbers climbing, her OB-GYN conferred with the hospital's ethics board to see if she could end the pregnancy but was advised Bernardo wasn't sick enough. Bernardo spent $7,000 traveling to Seattle for an abortion a week later.  Even if Emma made it through the pregnancy, doctors would have immediately needed to drain excess fluids from her body, only for her to survive a few hours or days, Bernardo said.  “Reading about everything they would do sounded like complete treatment torture to a newborn that would not survive,"" she said. “Had I not received an abortion, my life would have very likely been on the line.”  Other women facing similar situations have not had the financial resources to travel outside of the state.  Samantha Casiano, a 29-year-old living in eastern Texas, found out halfway through her pregnancy last year that her daughter, Halo, had a rare diagnosis of anencephaly, where much of the skull and brain is missing. Her doctor told her she would have to continue with the pregnancy because of Texas law, even though her baby would not survive.  With five children, including a goddaughter, at home she quickly realized she could not afford an out-of-state trip for an abortion. The next next few months of her pregnancy were spent trying to raise money for her daughter's impending funeral, soliciting donations through online websites and launching fundraisers to sell Mexican soup. Halo was born in April, living for only four hours.  “I was so full of heartbreak and sadness, all at the same time,” Casiano said.  Women in the lawsuit say they could not openly discuss abortion or labor induction with their doctors, instead asking their doctors discreetly if they should travel outside of the state.  Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, never talked about her own abortion with her doctors after they discovered anencephaly on the baby's ultrasound during her third pregnancy last year. She worried her out-of-state trip to end the pregnancy could jeopardize her medical license or invite harassment against her and her husband, also an OB-GYN. But after one of Dennard's patients sued the state in March for having to travel to Colorado to abort a twin fetus diagnosed with a life-threatening genetic disorder, she decided to go public, too.  “There was an enormous amount of fear that I experienced afterward,” Dennard said. “It’s an additional way of feeling silenced. You feel you have to do it in secret and not tell anyone about it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWtvcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAyMy81LzIyLzIxNzA2NzYvLU1vcmUtd29tZW4tc3VlLVRleGFzLWFza2luZy1jb3VydC10by1wdXQtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWJsb2NrLW9uLXN0YXRlLXMtYWJvcnRpb24tbGF3P3BtX2NhbXBhaWduPWJsb2cmcG1fbWVkaXVtPXJzcyZwbV9zb3VyY2U90gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He has said that we take a resolution on the strength of our Guruji's Pratap and Balaji Sarkar that a person of any religion or creed should come and face us. We are calling him with a shout. We will not even catch those who show any kind of miracle and will make them wet.  Bageshwar Baba said that that's why it is our prayer that if you come in front of us, ask as much as you can listen. Then don't say that Guruji exposed us. Pandit Dhirendra Shastri is telling Hanumant Katha in Jaisi Nagar of Sagar. Before the beginning of the story of the second day, a divine court was held. Before accepting the applications from the stage here, he said that heretical forces are increasing continuously. If a person studies a little, then he starts feeling that there is no God. That Mahatma is considered a hypocrite. Thinks that there is business in religion.  Bageshwar Baba further said that we do not have any power, but we take a vow of the glory and blessings of the Guru that we have received and say that except the saints of Sanatan Dharma, a person of any other religion should face us. We challenge him and call him in front. If we catch even one person, then 25 opponents will get electrocuted. Will not leave worth showing. We have full faith in our Balaji and Sanyasi Baba.

"religious miracle","1977-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:32:50","The well-publicized sexual and financial shenanigans of Liberty University’s Jerry Falwell Jr. – which led to his dismissal from Liberty in disgrace -- and the release of the 2021 film “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” which earned Jessica Chastain an academy award for her role as Tammy Faye Bakker, brought Jim Bakker back into the spotlight. Can a disgraced charismatic Christian conservative televangelist -- who plummeted from fame and power – make a comeback by hawking End Times visions, Trumpy conspiracy theories and phony COVID cures? So far, it’s been a bumpy ride!  Bakker tried to rebuild his fortunes during the COVID-19 pandemic by hawking the “silver solution,” which he claimed was a “miracle cure.” Religion Unplugged’s Jillian Cheney reported in October 2021 that “Credit card companies refused to allow those sales, and Bakker begged viewers to send checks instead to keep him from filing for bankruptcy.”  Aiming to stay relevant with the conspiracy crowd, Bakker and his wife Lori, hosts of “The Jim Bakker Show” featured Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, in a three-part telethon. Lindell, an ever loyal Trumper and Stop the Steal proponent, rehashed the same old same old during his appearance, while whining about being “attacked” and “canceled” on the Internet.  Are Christian conservative evangelicals so desperate for attention and an apocalyptic messenger that they’re turning to a disgraced televangelist to carry their End Times message? Can Jim Bakker be their man? This is the Jim Bakker of the discredited PTL Club (Praise the Lord) televangelist, who drove around in Rolls-Royces while buying up vacation homes and building a super-sized Christian theme park, was fleecing his audience. This is the Bakker who was involved in a juicy sex scandal, and eventually served time in prison, found guilty on 24 accounts of mail and wire fraud and conspiracy (http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/bill-berkowitz/86352/jim-bakker-profiteering-from-toxic-garbage-the-shameless-televangelist-slogs-on).  These days, Bakker is still on the televangelical scene, albeit playing to a much smaller audience.  Originally located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The PTL Television Network was founded by Jim and Tammy Faye (LaValley) Bakker in 1974, and dedicated in April 1977. Over its 14-year run, Jim and Tammy Faye became two of the most powerful and recognizable conservative Christian evangelicals, living the American Dream.  PTL collapsed in 1987 after a former church secretary, Jessica Hahn, accused the evangelist of rape, and later financial scandals purported that the couple had used the nonprofit PTL's donations to fund an opulent personal lifestyle. Bakker went to prison for embezzlement in 1989.  As Wikipedia detailed:  PTL's fund raising activities between 1984 and 1987 underwent scrutiny by The Charlotte Observer, eventually leading to criminal charges against Bakker. From 1984 to 1987, Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 ""lifetime memberships,"" which entitled buyers to a three-night stay annually at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA. According to the prosecution at Bakker's later fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships had been sold, but only one 500-room hotel was ever completed. Bakker ""sold"" more ""exclusive partnerships"" than could be accommodated and raised more than twice the money that was needed to build the actual hotel. Much of the money went into Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million in bonuses for himself. The $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who was mistakenly supposed to be a Bakker staff member, was paid by Tammy Faye's later husband, Roe Messner. Hahn was actually a onetime acquaintance of Bakker set up by a ""friend"" in 1980.  [Fun fact: While Bakker served time in the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota, he shared a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche, a prominent conspiracy theorist who founded the U.S. Labor Party in 1973 as the political arm of the National Caucus of Labor Committees(NCLC), and skydiver Roger Nelson, the internationally known champion skydiver who was in prison for tax fraud.]  Now, headquartered in in Blue Eye, Missouri, just above the Arkansas border, Bakker and his wife Lori, host the daily hour-long The Jim Bakker Show, broadcast on Roku, DirecTV, DISH Network and on demand, and sometimes lasting as long as six hours. According to its website, the show featuring “prophetic and Biblical revelations brought to light in today’s world. In these end times God is providing answers and wisdom to be revealed at just the right time. And the time is now!”  “Hosts Jim and Lori Bakker welcome amazing Biblical teachers and prophets to explore and challenge your heart, mind and spirit as they examine the world TODAY, and God’s loving promises! How do we prepare for what is to come? What does God tell us about our future? What is YOUR calling during these times? Join us as we discover the next supernatural piece of the puzzle!”  As Religion Unplugged’s Cheney reported, Bakker “continues his ministry today in relative obscurity, no longer preaching about prosperity but instead about the coming apocalypse.”  Cheney noted that, “Lori and Jim started hosting ‘The Jim Bakker Show’ in 2003 in Branson, Missouri, and moved to Morningside in 2008. According to Buzzfeed, original PTL partner Jerry Crawford offered an investment of $25 million for Morningside and still owns most of the land. ‘The Jim Bakker Show’ has broadcast from the community ever since.”  According to Cheney, “Most of the attendees at the show aren’t visitors but rather members of the Morningside community who are renting or have purchased one of the condos on the property. These condos and other living accommodations are available for overnight stay for visitors, though, and there’s also onsite camping. Morningside amenities also include a chapel, a general store, a cafe, a center for pregnant women and a 15-foot-tall statue of Jesus.”  Baker, who suffered a stroke last Fall, is 83. According to various online resources (Wikipedia, Forbes, Bloomberg), he has an estimated net worth of around $1 Million.  Bakker is hawking Jim Bakker Holy Water Enemas™. He reportedly told supporters that if they truly want to expunge sin from their lives there is no faster method than using his device that’s “fueled by the Holy Spirit.” Sources say he’s sold millions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWtvcy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzUvMjIvMjE3MDY3Ny8tQXBvY2FseXBzZS1KaW1teS1EaXNncmFjZWQtVHJ1bXB5LVRlbGV2YW5nZWxpc3QtSmltLUJha2tlci1IYXdraW5nLUVuZC1UaW1lcy1hbmQtU3Vydml2YWwtR2VhctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A Brief Overview  Jesus is known as the central figure of Christianity, and his life is the subject of the four canonical Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Scholars and historians agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, which is now known as the West Bank. After his birth, his family went to Egypt to avoid King Herod’s massacre of the children in Bethlehem.  After Herod’s death, the family returned to Nazareth, a small town in the region of Galilee. Jesus grew up in Nazareth and began his public ministry there when he was about 30 years old. He traveled throughout Galilee, preaching and teaching the message of the Gospel, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and performing miracles.  Jesus’ public ministry lasted for three years, and he eventually made his way to Jerusalem, the heart of Judaism, where he was crucified. His death and subsequent resurrection are considered to be the central events of Christianity.  The Life of Jesus in Nazareth  Nazareth was a small town in the region of Galilee, located about 65 miles north of Jerusalem. It was a rural community, and most of the residents were peasants who worked as farmers or fishermen. Jesus grew up in Nazareth and was known in his community as the carpenter’s son.  There is not much information about Jesus’ life in Nazareth, but it is likely that he lived a simple life, working as a carpenter and living with his family. He probably attended synagogue and followed traditional Jewish customs and practices.  Jesus’ Travels and Teachings Outside of Nazareth  Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, preaching and teaching the message of the Gospel. He attracted large crowds of followers with his message of love, forgiveness, and the coming of the kingdom of God. He also performed many miracles, including healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and raising the dead.  Jesus’ teachings often included parables, which were stories that used everyday situations and objects to convey spiritual truths. Some of his most famous teachings include the Beatitudes, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Sermon on the Mount.  Jesus’ Death and Resurrection in Jerusalem  Jesus’ final journey took him to Jerusalem, where he was hailed as a messianic figure by his followers. However, he also had many enemies among the Jewish religious leaders, who saw him as a threat to their authority. Jesus was eventually arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion.  His followers believed that he rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. This event, known as the Resurrection, is considered to be the cornerstone of the Christian faith.

"religious miracle","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T20:56:35","Here’s the latest from the crossroads of faith, media & culture: 05/22/23  The National Religious Broadcasters Convention kicks off tonight night in Orlando with opening remarks from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis, of course, is expected to soon join the growing list of challengers to former President Donald Trump, the far-and-away front-runner (as of now) for the GOP presidential nomination. So, what are voters of faith thinking as the race shapes up? Here’s what a new Trafalgar Group polling conducted for the conservative Convention of States tells us. The survey of of over 1,000 likely general election voters was conducted from May 9th through May 12th.  A Strong Majority of Faith Voters Want 2024 Presidential Candidates to Prioritize Religious Freedom, Candidates to Express Faith— 74 percent of faith voters say they are more likely to support a candidate in 2024 presidential election who expresses their religious beliefs and personal faith, 85.8 percent of faith voters say it is important for Americans to be able to freely express their religious beliefs in news media and on social media.  A Majority of Faith Voters Believe Christians Should Hold Firm in Their Traditional Beliefs— 66.7 percent of faith voters should not adjust their traditional beliefs to fit into modern America but should hold to their traditional beliefs, 52 percent of voters overall agree.​  Faith Voters Continue Strong Support for Israel— 84 percent of faith voters agree it is important for America to have a strong relationship with Israel, 78 percent of voters overall support maintaining strong relationship with Israel.  Faith Voters are More Likely Than Average Voters to See Important Role Alternative News and Podcasts Play in Keeping Public Informed—81 percent of faith voters say alternative news media sources and podcasts are important to having a fully informed American public, 77 percent of voter overall say alternative news and podcasts are important.  ______  Eye on CBS’ fall schedule. Meanwhile, as promised in my last post, I’m taking a look at each of the five broadcast networks announced fall schedules with a focus on their likely appeal to mainstream viewers of faith. These are people, IMHO, who are not expecting (or even necessarily want) all television fare to look like it was produced by and for their respective denominations. What they do expect and want though is programming that is inclusive and respectful of all Americans — including them. What they’re tired of is seeing their faith, conservative values and American heritage either subtly (or not so subtly) subjected to double standards and treated with apparent disdain. They want to see characters and issues presented in a way that, ultimately, reflects mutual respect for people of different cultural backgrounds and points of view. They want old-style Big Tent Television that brings people together while lifting them up in hope.  Without further ado, here’s a look at CBS’ 2023-24 season programming along with my thoughts on the likelihood that they will connect with the mainstream public. You can view the network’s fall schedule here.  Elsbeth (Thursday, 10:00 PM ET)    IMHO: This spin-off from both The Good Wife and The Good Wife seems to be going for something of a Columbo vibe with the arrogant killer underestimating a disarmingly quirky-but-intrepid investigator he or she (probably mostly he) looks down on. What both the trailer and the show’s pedigree (married producers Robert and Michelle King) seems to suggest though is a show that’s likely to lean heavily into Woke tropes. The Kings, by the way, are also the creators of Evil, which began its life on CBS but now streams on Paramount+ and which, from what I’ve seen, focuses its attention on the most negative (and, dare I say, nutty) aspects of the Catholic faith.  The Bottom Line: I have very low expectations for Elsbeth.  Matlock (Sunday, 8:00 PM ET)  IMHO: Ripping off the name of the long-running legal mystery starring Andy Griffith and airing in the longtime time slot of the classic Angela Lansbury whodunnit Murder, She Wrote, this Kathy Bates vehicle can look forward to — a much shorter run than either of its predecessors. Those who fondly remember the original Matlock are apt to find this citified gender-swapped remake a travesty. Younger viewers will, of course, find the connection meaningless and the premise nothing to text home about. BTW, at one point in the trailer, Bates’s character Madeline Matlock quips that her name is indeed Matlock “like the old TV show.” That’s actually not bad as a running gag but the show itself should not be called Matlock. At the very least call it Madeline Matlock. That way it would at least have it’s own identity – not a stolen one.  The Bottom Line: See Elsbeth.  Poppa’s House (Midseason, Time Slot: TBD)  IMHO: No trailer available here but the premise of a multi-cam camera sitcom with Damon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. starring as, respectively, a divorced opinionated black radio host and his adult son struggling with the challenges of marriage and fatherhood has potential. The fact that the pilot was written by Wayans Sr. and Kevin Hench, a writer for Tim Allen’s Last Man Standing (one of the relatively few network shows of recent years to favorably present a somewhat conservative POV) offers some additional hope.  The Bottom Line: I’ll keep an open mind.    Tracker (Midseason, Time Slot: TBD)  IMHO: While the above blinked-and-you-missed-it trailer doesn’t offer a lot to go on, the premise (based on the Jeffrey Deaver novel The Never Game) involves a survivalist named Colter Shaw (Justin Hartley of This Is Us) who travels the country locating missing people and solving mysteries has a certain meat-and-potatoes appeal.  The Bottom Line: Personally, I’d name the show after the lead character rather than the generic-sounding Tracker but, other than that quibble, I’m in for checking it out.  The Network Bottom Line: Of all the broadcasters, it’s CBS (not Fox) that does the best job of programming for Mainstream America. As Deadline reports, the number-one television network currently averages more than six-million viewers every weeknight and offers a schedule that includes an array of hit shows that includes TV’s #1 drama (NCIS), #1 new drama (Fire Country) and #1 comedy (as well as my personal favorite current show) Young Sheldon. The network actually has 14 series that consistently win their time periods, including Blue Bloods, Ghosts, The Neighborhood and Bob Hearts Abishola – all shows that can be seen as taking a mostly positive view of faith. As for the upcoming season, the two shows they’re leading out of the gate with (Elsbeth and Matlock) appear less than promising. Don’t rest on your laurels, CBS.  Three Free Suggestions for CBS  1. How about filling the Sunday at 8:00 PM (ET) slot with an hour of The Twilight Zone? Take the old classic scripts (and Rod Serling‘s classic voice), update them appropriately (including with more diverse casting) and let a new generation discover it’s top-notch writing and provocative themes (some of which seem more timely now than when they were written).  2. Make better use of talented producer DeVon Franklin (Miracles from Heaven). CBS has had a development deal with the successful producer of faith-themed films for years but has, thus far, kept his shows relegated to Paramount’s BET cable network, most notably the gospel music drama Kingdom Business (the title of which I think should be shortened to the less cynical-sounding Kingdom). Last season he had a sequel to CBS’ uplifting nineties fantasy drama Early Edition under consideration at the network. It’s a great match between producer and concept. They should reach back and pick it up.  3. Pull the Frasier follow-up from Paramount+ and put it on (free) CBS where it belongs. Even better (from my point of view), revamp the currently planned concept with The Frasier Crane Mysteries and put it on Thursday nights in the slot currently going to Elsbeth).  You’re welcome, CBS. Next: NBC.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxpZWZuZXQuY29tL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvZmFpdGhtZWRpYWFuZGN1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNS9yZWxpZ2lvdXMtYnJvYWRjYXN0ZXJzLXRvLWhlYXItZnJvbS1yb24tZGVzYW50aXMtdGhlLTIwMjMtMjQtdHYtc2Vhc29uLWEtcGVlay1hdC1hbmQtdGhvdWdodHMtb24tdGhlLWNicy1zdHJhdGVneS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"religious miracle","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T22:31:43","Was Jesus Ever Angry?  Jesus Christ is a central figure in Christianity, worshipped by millions of believers worldwide. Known for his teachings of love, compassion, and forgiveness, Jesus is often depicted as a peaceful, gentle man. However, there are instances in the Bible where he displays emotions of anger and frustration. So the question arises, was Jesus ever angry?  Jesus’ Anger in the Bible  The Bible describes a few instances where Jesus showed anger or frustration. One such example is the cleansing of the temple. In the book of John, Jesus enters the temple courtyard and drives out the merchants and money changers, overturning their tables and saying, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!” (John 2:16).  Another example is in the book of Mark, where Jesus performs a miracle on a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. The Pharisees, who were observing Jesus, charged him with breaking the law of the Sabbath. This incident made Jesus angry, and he responded by asking, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” (Mark 3:4).  Reasons for Jesus’ Anger  Jesus’ anger wasn’t motivated by selfish reasons or malicious intent. Instead, it was born out of a deep sense of righteousness and justice. He was angered by the hypocrisy of religious leaders who exploited their positions of power and misled people.  In the case of the cleansing of the temple, Jesus was angered by the way the temple was being used for commercial purposes. The courtyard, which was intended to be a place of worship and prayer, had turned into a marketplace. This angered Jesus, who believed that the temple should be reserved for sacred purposes only.  Similarly, in the case of the miracle on the Sabbath, Jesus was angered by the Pharisees’ legalism and lack of compassion. They were more interested in enforcing the letter of the law rather than showing mercy to a man in need.  Jesus’ Response to Anger  Although Jesus did display anger on some occasions, his response to it was always measured and compassionate. He didn’t lash out or seek revenge, nor did he act impulsively. Instead, he responded with wisdom and restraint.  In the case of the cleansing of the temple, Jesus used this as an opportunity to teach the people about the importance of genuine worship. He also used this as an opportunity to prophesize about his own death and resurrection.  Similarly, in the case of the miracle on the Sabbath, Jesus didn’t back down from the Pharisees’ accusations. Instead, he used this as an opportunity to challenge their legalistic interpretation of the law and to teach about the importance of doing good and showing compassion.  Frequently Asked Questions  1. Did Jesus ever sin?  No, Jesus never sinned. He lived a perfect and sinless life and remained faithful to God’s will till the very end.  2. Why did Jesus get angry with the money changers?  Jesus was angered by the fact that the temple, which was meant to be a place of prayer and worship, had been turned into a marketplace. The money changers were exploiting people by overcharging them for their services and profiting from their religious practices.  3. Did Jesus ever express joy?  Yes, Jesus expressed joy on various occasions. For instance, he expressed joy at the prospect of saving lost souls and at witnessing the faith of individuals.  4. Why did Jesus weep at the tomb of Lazarus?  Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus out of compassion for his friends and family. He understood the pain and suffering that death brings and was moved by the grief of those around him.  5. Was Jesus always a peaceful person?  While Jesus was known for his teachings of love, compassion, and forgiveness, he was not always peaceful. He expressed anger and frustration when he saw injustice or hypocrisy.  6. What is the significance of Jesus’ anger in the Bible?  Jesus’ anger in the Bible serves as a reminder of the importance of living a life of righteousness and justice. It also shows that anger, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool for bringing about positive change.  7. Did Jesus ever lose his temper?  No, Jesus didn’t lose his temper in the way we often do. His anger was always directed towards a specific issue or problem, and he responded to it with wisdom and compassion.  8. Did Jesus ever speak out against social injustice?  Yes, Jesus frequently spoke out against social injustice. He was particularly vocal about the way religious leaders were using their power to exploit and oppress people.  9. Did Jesus ever forgive those who wronged him?  Yes, Jesus forgave those who wronged him, including those who crucified him. He preached a message of forgiveness and urged his followers to forgive one another.  10. Was Jesus ever sarcastic or witty?  Jesus was known for his clever use of parables, which often contained a touch of irony or wit. However, his humor was always tempered with compassion and was used to teach moral lessons.  11. Why did Jesus curse the fig tree?  The fig tree incident in the Bible is a metaphor for spiritual fruitlessness. Jesus used this as an opportunity to teach his disciples about the importance of bearing fruits of righteousness and the consequences of failing to do so.  12. Did Jesus’ anger ever get the best of him?  No, Jesus’ anger was always under control. He responded to it in a measured and compassionate way and used it as an opportunity to teach and bring about positive change.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vZ2J0aW1lcy5jb20vd2FzLWplc3VzLWV2ZXItYW5ncnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T19:31:19","What is the Feast of Dedication?  The Feast of Dedication (also known as Hanukkah) is a Jewish holiday celebrated for eight days in December. The holiday commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE. The holiday begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev and is usually celebrated around the same time as Christmas.  FAQs  1. What is the origin of Hanukkah?  The origin of Hanukkah dates back to the 2nd century BCE when the Jewish people were under the rule of the Seleucid Empire. King Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire allowed the Jews to continue practicing their religion, but his son, King Antiochus IV, banned Judaism and desecrated the Second Temple in Jerusalem. This led to the Maccabean Revolt, in which the Jewish people fought to reclaim their holy temple from the Seleucid Empire.  2. Why is Hanukkah celebrated for eight days?  Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days to commemorate the miracle of the oil. According to Jewish tradition, when the Maccabees reclaimed the Second Temple, they found only enough oil to light the menorah (a candle holder with eight branches) for one day. However, the oil miraculously lasted for eight days, allowing the Jews to rededicate the temple and celebrate their victory over the Seleucid Empire.  3. How is Hanukkah celebrated?  Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting the menorah each night and reciting prayers. Traditional Hanukkah foods include latkes (potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (jelly-filled donuts). It is also common to play dreidel (a spinning top game) and exchange gifts.  4. Is Hanukkah a religious or cultural holiday?  Hanukkah is both a religious and cultural holiday. While it has historical and religious significance for the Jewish people, it also holds cultural importance for many Jewish communities around the world.  5. How does Hanukkah compare to Christmas?  While Hanukkah and Christmas are both celebrated in December and involve gift-giving, they have different origins and meanings. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple and celebrates the Jewish people’s victory over their oppressors. Christmas is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.  6. Can non-Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah?  Yes, non-Jewish people can celebrate Hanukkah. Hanukkah has become a widely recognized holiday in many countries and is often celebrated by people of different faiths.  7. Why is the menorah lit from right to left?  The menorah is lit from right to left to symbolize the miracle of the oil. The right side represents the present and the left side represents the past, so lighting the menorah from right to left signifies the miraculous nature of the oil lasting for eight days.  8. What is the significance of the ninth candle on the menorah?  The ninth candle on the menorah is called the shamash, which is used to light the other candles. It is taller or positioned higher than the other candles to distinguish it from the rest.  9. Are there any specific Hanukkah prayers?  Yes, there are specific Hanukkah prayers that are recited during the holiday. The most well-known is the Hallel prayer, which is recited during morning services on each day of Hanukkah.  10. What is the significance of the dreidel?  The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top that is traditionally played during Hanukkah. Each side of the dreidel has a Hebrew letter, which together stand for the phrase “a great miracle happened there” (referring to the miracle of the oil). The game is often played with chocolate coins called gelt.  11. Does Hanukkah have any deep spiritual significance?  Yes, Hanukkah has deep spiritual significance for many Jewish people. It represents the struggle for religious freedom and the importance of standing up for one’s beliefs.  12. Can Hanukkah overlap with Christmas?  Yes, Hanukkah can overlap with Christmas because it is celebrated according to the Jewish calendar, which is based on the lunar cycle. Therefore, Hanukkah usually falls in December but can sometimes begin in late November or early January.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vZ2J0aW1lcy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtZmVhc3Qtb2YtZGVkaWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2018-10-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:08:43","Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement  By Gomi Senadhira  This month the highly controversial Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), which was signed in January 2018 and enforced in May 2018, completes five years in operation. Given the high level of concern among domestic stakeholders regarding the agreement. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed an independent committee of experts, in August 2018, to study the agreement and the committee handed over its report to the President in December 2018. The committee had identified a number of pitfalls in the agreement and President Maithripala Sirisena had directed that the agreement be amended as per the recommendations of the expert group. In May 2021, it was revealed that the National Negotiation Committee had reviewed the SLSFTA and identified 18 amendments to be made to the agreement. Hence, as the SLSFTA marks five years of implementation, it is appropriate for relevant government agencies to provide an overview of the significant trade and economic effects of the FTA during the period, and any efforts undertaken by the government to revise the articles in the agreement which are unfavourable to Sri Lanka. This is particularly important in trade policy because Sri Lanka is currently engaged in FTA negotiations with a number of other countries, including China, India, and Thailand. A careful analysis of the SLSFTA, at this stage, would help to avoid repeating similar mistakes in these negotiations as well. Furthermore, the way our trade negotiators and “experts” reacted to some of these public concerns on the agreement also reveals the limits of their expertise on trade agreements and negotiations, and their understanding of the commitments they had extended to Singapore! Some of their comments are so absurd that it appears that they do not even comprehend the very basics of trade negotiations!  One of the most controversial issues in the SLSFTA was the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka to open up import and process waste/garbage from Singapore. I was the first to raise this issue in August 2018 (SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China, etc. shut their doors, The Island 18th August 2018). Last year, in a study undertaken by Anushka Wijesinha, who was an advisor to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, and Janaka Wijayasiri state, “At times, the concern morphed into undue fears and propelled misleading views and myths…Another concern that arose quite surprisingly was that the SLFTA – and the tariff liberalisation offered – would permit harmful products such as garbage, clinical waste, nuclear waste, chemical waste etc. to be imported to Sri Lanka. The argument by those individuals and groups that raised this issue was that since waste products are included in the TLP, such items can be dumped into the country under the agreement… To be clear, the reduction or elimination of tariffs does not grant automatic entry of a product into a country – all applicable domestic regulations and mechanisms would still apply, including any applicable import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals. The SLSFTA does not take away Sri Lanka’s rights under International Environmental Protection Treaties to which Sri Lanka is a signatory and therefore, relevant environmental laws and regulations would apply to such imported products with no exception for those imports from Singapore under the SLSFTA.” (Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA Four Years On: Policy Context, Key Issues, and Future Prospects – August 2022)  When I exposed the commitments undertaken in the agreement to allow waste, particularly plastic waste, imports from Singapore it was not done based simply on tariff liberalisation. It was done after analysing the global trade of plastic waste, the challenges Singapore was facing in exporting plastic waste, Sri Lanka’s import of plastic waste, and Sri Lanka’s commitments in the agreement under the TLP, rules of origin, and services.  The Global situation  The developed countries lawfully or unlawfully export garbage as “recyclable waste” overseas for recycling. That is because recycling is a labour-intensive and dirty industry. For example, a PET bottle would have to be washed, its cap, and the label taken off before it can be recycled. So, it is a labour- intensive process. Very often large quantities of toxic or hazardous wastes also are mixed with “clean” waste. Then it also becomes a hazardous industry. During the cleaning process toxic waste is released into local environs and workers get exposed to them. So, developed countries prefer to do this “recycling” in developing countries. To do their dirty work these global garbage traders particularly target developing countries with corrupt officials and shady businessmen where import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals can be bent and corrupt officials would facilitate the clearing of even toxic garbage containers without any examination. In these countries, the bulk of the imported garbage ends up in the local garbage dumps.  China was the world’s largest importer of garbage and imported almost 60% of the world’s plastic waste. However, there was a growing public outcry, over many years, against the import of “foreign garbage.” in general and import of plastic waste in particular. This intensified after the release of the documentary film “Plastic China” in 2016 depicting the lives of two families who make their living recycling plastic waste imported from developed countries. In 2017 China decided to ban imports of 24 types of rubbish and notified the WTO accordingly. “We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials. This seriously polluted China’s environment. To protect China’s environmental interests and people’s health, we urgently adjust the imported solid wastes list, and forbid the import of solid wastes that are highly polluted. Protection of human health or safety; Protection of animal or plant life or health; Protection of the environment,” stated China’s WTO notification.  Normally, in international trade when the import of a product is banned in one country, it will be redirected to other countries. After the Chinese ban. Increased volumes of plastic waste started to move into other traditional importers of waste for reprocessing (Thailand, Vietnam, and other countries in the region) and these countries too started to restrict the imports of waste products. So, where will the world’s waste exports end up, if not in China or South East Asia? By late 2016, the Chinese plastic waste processing industry was looking for places in South Asia and Africa to relocate this billion-dollar industry.  Situation in Singapore  Singapore is one of the world’s largest, per capita, plastic waste generators. From 2012 to 2017 the total volume of plastic waste generated in Singapore averaged around 800 thousand tons per year. In 2013 Singapore exported over 90,000 tons of plastic waste. Out of it over 57,000 Tons went to China. After China’s ban on the import of plastic waste, Singapore’s exports fell to around 30, 000 tons by 2021. In Singapore, plastic waste is either exported or incinerated. Ash from incineration is shipped to a man-made island and that landfill is also fast filling up. Furthermore, the incineration of plastic waste even under controlled conditions leads to environmental degradation. Singapore is very keen on maintaining its air quality and incineration is not a preferred option. But recycling in Singapore is expensive. So, recycling companies in Singapore used to undertake that in Malaysia, China, or other countries in the region. After the Chinese ban exports to China have stopped totally and other importers also were contemplating import restrictions. Hence, it was no secret, when the SLSFTA was negotiated Singapore was exploring new overseas locations to establish recycling operations, or dumping grounds. In 2021 Singapore generated 982 thousand tons of plastic waste and only around six percent of the plastic waste generated was recycled. (See Table I)  The situation in Sri Lanka  When the SLSFTA was under negotiation Sri Lanka had already commenced importing plastic waste. The surge in imports between 2013 and 2017 shown in the Table II, clearly indicated the presence of a small but growing plastic waste “recycling” industry in Sri Lanka. My comments in 2018 was partly based on this analysis. (See Table II)  Though trade flows indicated a possible presence of global waste “recycling” mafia in Sri Lanka, I didn’t know, at that stage, garbage “recycling” or “resource recovery industries” had already commenced thriving operations within the BOI, under the Commercial Hub Regulation Act.  That was revealed only after the media exposure in 2019, of a huge waste dump inside the BOI. At that time, a representative from the “resource recovery industry” operated in the Katunayake FTZ, brazenly claimed at a press conference that this was the world’s “fastest-growing and most admired industry”. However, the investigation revealed that this clandestine waste dump inside the BOI contained toxic waste. Then came the discovery of over 200 stinking garbage containers in the Colombo port! Again, with toxic waste! These were discovered only because dirty fluids started to ooze out these smelly containers. It was reported that the environmental and customs officials even refused to open these containers as it was unsafe to do so. It was also reported that the garbage consignments moved from the port to the BOI were not physically checked by the Customs and other regulatory agencies, and these agencies did not conduct any entry processing or check on documents, due to BOI regulations! Though the Finance Minister promised the Parliament, in July 2019, that he would conduct a comprehensive investigation into the matter and would take legal action against the culprits nothing much had happened even after four years. It is also noteworthy that these garbage containers were discovered only after the collapse of Meethotamulla Garbage Dump in 2017. If Meethotamulla had not imploded, at least some of the waste may have ended up there.  Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA  The SLSFTA was negotiated at a time when the global crisis in the garbage trade was at its peak. So, how did Sri Lankan negotiators react to the crisis? Did they see it as a threat or an opportunity? Trade negotiators are expected to analyse trade statistics before making any commitment on any tariff line. Didn’t they know that Sri Lanka was already importing plastic waste? The representatives from the BOI were involved in the negotiations. Didn’t they know Sri Lanka had established these “resource recovery industries” within the BOI? How Singaporean negotiators approached this issue. Did they request any commitments from Sri Lanka in the area of import and processing of waste? Did we provide these commitments without any requests? And finally, didn’t they even know that Sri Lanka made these commitments?  When I warned that plastic and asbestos waste will be imported for processing and recycling, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade responded by stating “… in order for products manufactured in Singapore using non-originating raw materials (imported raw materials) to become eligible for Customs duty concessions under SLSFTA, origin criteria listed below should be complied with: I. Sufficient working or processing + comply with value addition of 35% of FOB or II. Sufficient working or processing + comply with CTH (change of tariff no at 4- digit level between the finished product and imported inputs) or… Sufficient working or processing + comply with Product Specific Rules”),” (“Garbage in, Garbage out’- Malik’s response,” The Island, October 9, 2018).  Unfortunately, our trade negotiators and advisers are not even aware that under the SLSFTA Rules of Origin, waste and scrap for recycling qualify as wholly obtained products, like plants … grown and harvested, or live animals born, raised and slaughtered in Singapore. The relevant sections are Article 4 k, l, and m, which state” … (k) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials; (l) wastes and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there; (m) waste and scrap derived from used goods collected in the exporting Party, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials.“ Under these sub- articles plastic waste, asbestos waste and similar products, can be imported for the recovery of raw materials by the “resource recovery industry” which had a highly lucrative operation in the BOI zones when the agreement was signed.  The agreement clearly categorises waste collected in Singapore as a wholly obtained product under Article 4, the Ministry of DS& IT claimed waste cannot be imported under Article 5. Didn’t our International Trade Ministry and other trade “experts” understand waste collected in Singapore is covered under Article 4 and hence the limitations in Article 5 do not apply? Or was it a deliberate attempt to hoodwink the public?  Then there are a few specific rules of origin that would facilitate the dumping of dangerous products in Sri Lanka. For example, crocidolite asbestos (HS 6812) also known as blue asbestos, is considered the most hazardous type of asbestos. Sri Lanka prohibited the use of crocidolite asbestos in 1987. Singapore banned the use of all types of Asbestos in 1989. However, a significant amount of the material remains in the buildings and elsewhere in Singapore and there are strict laws governing the demolishing and removal of these materials. Shockingly this item is not only included in Sri Lanka’s TLP but our negotiators have spent time and money on formulating very simple specific rules of origin to facilitate its imports. If a product containing Crocidolite, simply changes its tariff subheading then it qualifies as a product of Singaporean origin.  Then in the Services Chapter Sri Lanka has undertaken a specific commitment on Waste Disposal Services which is reproduced below (see Table 3):  The CPC 9402 refers to “refuse collection and disposal services’ and it includes collection services of garbage, trash, rubbish and waste, whether from households or from industrial and commercial establishments, transport services and disposal services by incineration or by other means. The use of “**” against the CPC code indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code. Sri Lanka’s commitment clearly limits its scope to waste collected from industrial establishments not run by the Government, but no other areas are excluded.  Under these commitments, services can be provided through four modes of supply. For “Waste Disposal Services” Sri Lanka has opened up only two modes of supply, namely, Mode 2) Consumption abroad and Mode 3) Commercial presence. The term “None” under this commitment means that the country is committing itself to provide full liberalization without any limitations on market access or national treatment for the service sector and modes of supply for which commitments are written.  By opening up Mode 2 without any restrictions, Sri Lanka permits the other party to the agreement to process its solid waste in Sri Lanka. If the intention of Sri Lankan negotiators, as the government claims, was to limit this to waste collected in Sri Lanka, then mode 2 should have been left unbound. By opening up of Mode 3 Sri Lanka has allowed Singaporean Waste Disposal Services to establish a subsidiary in Sri Lanka, subject to regulations of the Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka. Therefore, under this commitment waste can be imported from Singapore not only to recover raw materials but also to dispose of.  Before the SLSFTA entered into force in May 2018, if a Singaporean, Chinese or any other national wanted to recycle imported waste in Sri Lanka, it was possible to do so under BOI regulations. After May 2018, any Singaporean company can establish refuse disposal services in Sri Lanka, under the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka in the services chapter of the SLSFTA, to recycle and/or process waste!  After I raised this issue it was widely discussed. I believe the Presidential Commission also recommended that the articles which permit waste import and recycling should be amended. My article “SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China etc. shut their doors,” published in the Island in 2018, was tabled in the parliament by Shehan Semasinghe. Later, in April 2022, he became the Minister of Trade and since September 2022 he is the Minister of State for Finance. In spite of all that the government had not taken any action to protect Sri Lanka from becoming a garbage dump for developed countries other than calling my claim, “… a despicable attempt … to deceive the public” and in turn releasing few press releases with incorrect information to mislead the public. Even when the government imposed a ban on imports of hundreds of products, waste items like plastic waste were not included in that list and every year Sri Lanka continues to import thousands of tons of plastic waste!  In 2019, the Philippines, in a major diplomatic row with Canada, reshipped 2,400 tonnes of Canadian toxic waste which was imported labelled as plastic waste for recycling. Other countries in the region also had taken similar action. But we in Sri Lanka are not like that. Last year alone Sri Lanka imported over 6000 tons of plastic waste! Most of it came from China, a country that banned the import of plastic waste to protect environmental interests and people’s health and safety.

"religious miracle","2019-05-23","Not Discerned","{""KualaLumpur"", ""KualaLumpur"", ""Malaysia""}","2023-05-23T00:00:49","KUALA LUMPUR (May 23): Rivals-turned-allies Pakatan Harapan (PH) and Barisan Nasional (BN) should not be overambitious by trying to campaign for each other in six impending state elections, according to political analysts.  As grassroots supporters of both coalitions have not embraced the partnership in the national unity government formed after the 15th general election, pushing them to back previously-fierce rivals could backfire, they said.  PH and BN will enter the state elections for Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Penang, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu as partners for the first time, after being direct rivals up until GE15 last November.  Assistant Professor of Political Science at International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) Syaza Shukri said although the two must highlight the importance of their alliance for national stability, they should still stand apart in the state elections.  “I think the best strategy is for them to campaign on their own, however, they have to make it clear that the parties stand together under the unity government. I said so because the grassroots may not be too comfortable, like in your example, if DAP comes out campaigning for Umno and vice versa.  “They have their strong voter base, they just need to campaign to get them out to vote. But they have to mention the unity government because they need to portray to the people that voting for them means voting for stability and strength in numbers. That cannot be avoided,” she said.  Universiti Malaya Centre for Democracy and Elections (UMcedel) sociopolitical analyst Associate Professor Awang Azman Awang Pawi also believed the coalitions should campaign individually for best effect.  However, he said the two must still discuss their strategies and messaging, especially on controversial topics where they could be vulnerable to their opponents in Perikatan Nasional (PN).  This would avoid the two coalitions and their other partners from crossing signals while campaigning, he said.  Last month, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s national unity government confirmed it withdrew the appeal of a court ruling over the use of “Allah,” the Arabic word for God, in Christian publications.  The appeal was initiated in 2021 by the government of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, the head of PN that is now the federal Opposition, which is expected to turn the controversy into campaign fodder.  “The best strategy and priority is for each party to continuously campaign for their own party to convince their voters to vote for the unity bloc,” Awang Azman said.  “At the same time, other party leaders can and should provide clarification on aspects that require a more detailed explanation when involving complicated or controversial issues.”  Still, he said both PH and BN must work on convincing their grassroots about their alliance, as doing so would be vital even after the state elections.  According to Singapore Institute of International Affairs senior fellow Oh Ei Sun, it would also be critical for the two coalitions to avoid attacking one another, either intentionally or out of old habits.  However, he said this would take a “miracle” to prevent, as their partnership was not universally accepted in the coalitions and there were elements within each that did not want it to last.  Already, leaders of both coalitions, such as BN’s Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan and DAP’s Hannah Yeoh, have been urging their respective supporters to no longer see their former rivals as enemies but as newfound allies.  “In all political parties and coalitions, the most intense power struggles are not external, but internal in nature, as various ambitious players would like to plant their stakes within the party or coalition,” Oh said.  “This includes undermining the relative positions of one another, for example, by making certain rival candidates from the same party or other component parties lose their seats to the other side, such that the political future of the rival comrades could be cut short.”  Previously, Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari said he and his counterparts Penang, Negeri Sembilan, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu have tentatively agreed to seek the dissolution of their state assemblies at the end of June, for elections to be held in July or early August.  The six must hold their state elections this year as they did not do so when GE15 was held last November.  In GE15, the parties in PH and BN set aside decades-old enmity and formed a national unity government, thwarting PN from gaining federal power. – Malay Mail","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvc3RheS1pbi15b3VyLW93bi1sYW5lLWFuYWx5c3RzLXRlbGwtcGFrYXRhbi1ibi1hbGxpYW5jZS1mb3Itc3RhdGUtZWxlY3Rpb24tY2FtcGFpZ25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Kumasi"", ""Ashanti"", ""Ghana""}","2023-05-22T09:27:33","Many Ghanaians have come to terms with the NPP government's failures as well as the role that tribalism has played in the Ashanti Region's underdevelopment. I used to underestimate the impact of tribalism but after reading articles by some writers; I realized the strength of this psychological illness. They can’t even write about the president's crimes, his incompetence and laziness, let alone the pervasive corruption that has ruined the nation's infrastructure.  However, they spend all of their time writing pointless articles for which I am unable to discern the true motivations, considering that the public is so fed up with Akufo Addo's administration. The damage, suffering, and pervasive corruption in Ghana today, have changed the minds of the people and many don’t want to hear the name of the president. The NPP act as if they are unaware of what is happening, but in reality, Akufo Addo is the target of insults and expletives from all corners of the country.    The three incompetent and ""corruptionists,"" Akufo Addo, Ken Ofori-Atta, and Mahamudu Bawumia, have wrecked Ghana beyond remedy.  Everyone, including Dampare, is aware of this, and it is one of the reasons he arrested the man who insulted Akufo Addo, making sure to instill fear in the populace. Unfortunately, his actions inflamed many Ghanaians to the point where insults directed at Akufo Addo have risen. I feel bad for the individual since this happened to him because Ghanaian law is ineffective. Who can be able to inform me if anyone has heard of a president-insult arrest in a developed nation? Things are only stupid in Africa.    This demonstrates that the public no longer has faith in this government, and as a result, they are not wanted. The majority of Ghanaians do not want Bawumia or Kyerematen either because they are all a part of this disastrous government. Writing articles to persuade Ghanaians that the new IMF deal is better than past ones would not change their minds, therefore if you are a writer and find it difficult to write about the political calamity that has struck the country, don't waste your time trying. I can prove that.  The NPP politicians are aware that this government is supported by a frail thread that could break at any moment since, aside from their worst failure; they have no other means of persuading the populace that they are qualified to lead this nation. People in Ghana today, are suffering so much that they desire miracle emancipation; as a result, no one cares whether they receive a better deal from the IMF in terms of financial aid; instead, they want to be freed from this pain, which is still a long way off.  Why did the NPP government have to start working on street projects at night as a result of the by-elections? They are acting to remedy the problem because they are conscious of their failure, but the people are now wise and acting accordingly. The NPP government was seen in a video that has gone viral, giving rice to the poor due to their extreme predicament. How many days can a man survive on two cups of rice? The NPP administration is conscious that it has failed since Mahama has outperformed Akufo Addo, as already mentioned.

"religious miracle","2023-02-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T08:33:52","Each of these statements was made during the pandemic by medical doctors who remain licensed to practice medicine.  “This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax. I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don’t need [a] mask. There is a cure.” Stella Immanuel, M.D. Licensed in Texas, July 2020  “[P]eople … have long suspected there was some sort of an interface, yet to be defined, an interface between what’s being injected in these shots, and all of the 5G towers.” Sherri Tenpenny, D.O. Licensed in Ohio, July 2021  “Anyone here waiting for an apology from Birx, Fauci & Biden & all the democratic governors for their unconstitutional tyrannical #MaskMandates? #Masks #FaceMasks #MasksDontWork” Sherri Tenpenny, D.O. @BusyDrT, Feb. 10, 2023  “I don’t want to be part of this mass genocide that I see happening [with COVID vaccines]. … And yet I have an unrestricted license to practice, for 30 years.” Rashid Buttar, D.O. Licensed in North Carolina, October 20211  Conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter Immanuel, who is also a pastor, was one of the white coat-clad America’s Frontline Doctors, members of a right-wing political group with ties to the Tea Party Patriots. They appeared in a July 2020 video at the Capitol, which President Trump praised and helped to go viral. The video reached 20 million Facebook users within hours. (Donald Trump deleted his tweet, and the video was recognized as misinformation and soon taken down by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Donald Trump Jr. was banned from tweeting for 12 hours because Twitter said he had engaged in “sharing misinformation on COVID-19” by sharing the video.) In the video, the doctors said that interventions such as masking, social distancing, and school closings were unnecessary and that hydroxychloroquine “could both prevent and cure” COVID-19. In just a two-month period in 2021, America’s Frontline Doctors raked in over $6 million on telehealth evaluations that included prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, two hyped (based on bad science) medications used for COVID-19 that have repeatedly been found ineffective at treating COVID-19.  Immanuel was recently named the “highest U.S. prescriber of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine” for the last two years, according to an analysis of prescription data by MedPageToday, a medical news website. Astonishingly, Immanuel’s prescribing habits are apparently legal. For its part, the Texas Medical board had made its stance on COVID-related treatments painfully clear. In July of 2020, referencing rumors of an unnamed “cure” for COVID-19, the board said it would not “issue endorsements” of any treatments and that “patients and physicians have a right to decide what treatments may be used for COVID-19.” In the fall of 2021, the board released a notice about prescription use of COVID-19 therapies, saying that they wouldn’t “endorse or prohibit” any particular therapies for the condition, preserving physician’s use of “off-label” therapies. (“Off label” means a medication is being used to treat a condition for which it lacks FDA approval. While off-label prescribing happens commonly, like any privilege left to individual physician discretion, the practice can be abused—as has been the case with both hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin during the pandemic.)2  Ultimately, Immanuel was fined $500 by the Texas Medical Board in October 2021 and given “corrective action”—not for prescribing bogus treatments but for failing to properly document informed consent for her “off-label” hydroxychloroquine treatments. The board’s action was non-disciplinary. (In another notable case, in 2022, Houston doctor Richard Urso was cleared of malpractice claims by the Board for his use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.)  Tenpenny, who rails against face masks as “germy” and harmful (they suppress your immune system, she claims), has also claimed that the COVID vaccine “makes people magnetic.” She has been pursued by the Ohio Medical Board since 2021 (recent local reporting indicates “unspecified reasons” for the board inquiry) and has failed to respond to their communications and subpoena.  Buttar has long practiced medicine in North Carolina despite offering expensive sham treatments for cancer and autism. Buttar is also active on Twitter, where he does live streams; on a recent stream about gun violence, he implied that COVID vaccinations were to blame for frequent mass shootings because they cause people to be in pain from heart or lung problems and the AI in them is interfering with people’s neurologic system, presumably making them mentally disturbed. Buttar has a veritable rap-sheet of “adverse actions” taken by the North Carolina Medical Board going back to 2007. Buttar even referred to the medical board as a “rabid dog” that the legislature needed to “put down” for trying to discipline him years ago.  These doctors are just a few of the many who have made news over the years for spreading misinformation3 about medical issues, or who promote outright quackery (by quackery, I mean medical practice based on pseudoscience). A few of the most prominent include Joseph Mercola, D.O. (licensed to practice in Florida and Illinois), described by the New York Times as “the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation”; Christiane Northrup, M.D., a former obstetrician-gynecologist (no active license but has a grandfathered board certification in her field from 1981) and “champion of a feminine and intuitive approach to health and well-being” who was once “Oprah’s favorite gyno” and is now an anti-vaccine and QAnon conspiracy theorist; and, of course, Mehmet Oz, M.D. (licensed in Pennsylvania), celebrity doctor, wannabe politician, and promoter of hydroxychloroquine, whose The Dr. Oz Show bombarded audiences with 13 seasons of “magic” health cures and helped the former cardiothoracic surgeon amass a net worth of nine figures as of 2022, the year his show ended. Tenpenny, Buttar, Northrup, and Mercola are all featured alongside Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s “Disinformation Dozen,” a list of anti-vaxxers with large platforms who spread misinformation online. (There are many other prominent physician COVID contrarians and minimizers who would take up an entire article themselves.)  That these doctors still retain their medical licenses (or board certifications) despite such terrible rhetoric and practice, and dozens of doctors have continued to spew misinformation and minimize COVID-19 and COVID vaccination without much consequence, points to a troubling and long-standing problem with the regulation of the medical profession. In 2022, Politico reported that only eight physicians had been disciplined by medical boards since January 2021 for “spreading coronavirus-related misinformation.” As David Gorski, M.D., Ph.D., a cancer surgeon and researcher, wrote in a June 2022 blog post—his response to an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine calling for doctors to face consequences for spreading misinformation:  Again, this was a problem that I had long written about going back to the very beginning of this blog, namely how toothless state medical boards are, how easily bad and even dangerous doctors can keep practicing, and how oblivious our fellow physicians had been to the threat of medical misinformation before the pandemic, a threat to which they have only fitfully been waking up.  To understand the complexity of the problem with physician regulation, we can look at two major currents: the ethical questions raised by the rise of Oz, and the growth of the anti-vaccine and health freedom movements, which was helped in no small part by the fraudulent work of disgraced former British physician and anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield.  Perhaps the most recognizable (and one of the most long-standing) of the Doctors Behaving Badly bunch is Mehmet Oz, who has been called both “America’s Doctor” (Oprah) and “America’s Quack” (Gorski). He was on faculty at Columbia University for many years—during which the institution faced criticism for keeping him on—until the spring of 2022, when the media reported that he had been largely “scrubbed” from their website ahead of his Senate run (he lost to John Fetterman). Oz’s interest in alternative medicine dates back to his childhood days, writes Vox contributor and Oz profiler Julia Belluz, who has written nearly two dozen articles about him and the questionable ethics of his enterprise of books, magazines, and talk shows in which he has dispensed medical information and recommendations that are often based on little more than hype. Some of Oz’s most notorious claims include “the miraculous powers of green coffee extract and the fat-burning magic of raspberry ketone.” Congress scolded him in 2014 for his role in promoting bogus therapies that one medical ethicist likened to “fairy dust.” There was even a so-called “Oz effect,” or claims of increases in sales of products after they were mentioned on Oz’s show. Oz has done his own share of pandemic misinformation. As just one example, according to the New York Times, Oz went on Fox News 25 times to endorse hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in March and April 2020.  Writers who profile Oz tend to concede an uncomfortable truth: that there’s something icky about what he’s doing in blurring the line between offering medical advice and entertainment, or “medutainment,” and that the financial incentives seem off. But it’s rare for anyone to suggest he be disciplined by his state medical board for such behavior. There have been two exceptions. One is Jen Gunter, M.D., an obstetrician-gynecologist known for her strongly worded debunks of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop nonsense (jade eggs, vaginal steams, and now—sigh—back-door ozone). In 2022, she reported Oz to the Pennsylvania State Medical Board, citing his endorsement of a long-time go-to quack therapy, colloidal silver, which can have a number of untoward side effects and is not considered safe by the FDA, as well as Oz’s misinformation on masking during COVID. The state medical board currently notes no disciplinary actions on Oz’s public profile.  Belluz was also asking, back in 2014, why it was that “Dr. Oz can say anything and keep his medical license.” As she noted, the American Medical Association (a conservative group that, it should be noted, has historically opposed reform toward universal single-payer healthcare) has created guidelines around ethical behavior, but they can’t enforce anything. And Columbia, for its part, said it would not censor a faculty member’s free speech. It turns out that in 2014, then medical student at University of Rochester (now a pathologist) Benjamin Mazer was calling for New York State to “treat health advice on TV in the same vein as expert testimony, which already has established guidelines for truthfulness.” That would have been something!  Political scientist Dominik A. Stecula and colleagues have situated Dr. Oz within a larger media ecosystem they call alternative health media (AHM), which they describe as media that popularizes alternative medicine therapies while at the same time casting doubt on mainstream medicine and on government agencies such as the CDC and FDA. Examples of AHM include The Goop Lab, Natural News, Mercola.com, Alex Jones’ Infowars, and The Doctors, a talk show featuring four doctors that ended in 2022 after 14 seasons on air.  The features of AHM are reminiscent of what Lauren Fadiman, looking at the issue from a folklorist’s perspective, recently described in this magazine as a culture of “medical skepticism,” which encapsulates not just a penchant for alternative medicine and a fear of (assumed) harmful mainstream medical practices along with institutional distrust but can also accommodate “full-blown conspiracy theories” about COVID vaccines or government leaders being pharma shills.  The influence of such media—and the doctors who work for them—cannot be overstated. As Stecula et al. note, at a time when many people lack access to a primary care doctor and want health advice, shows like Oz offer a parasocial relationship with someone who is “relatable, accessible, and trusted.” It’s easy to see how influential Oz, who has been described as “telegenic,” can be in this kind of setting.  One thing I’ve realized over the years is that, in general, doctors behaving badly seem to get a free pass and a lot of sympathy. For example, Sandeep Jauhar, a cardiologist, wrote a 2014 memoir, Doctored, about some of his time in practice. He admitted to doing questionable things when he was freelancing (essentially, gig work) with a local doctor who ordered unnecessary cardiac testing on unwitting patients. He did it to finance his family’s lifestyle. He discussed how the medical system in the area was essentially operating as a huge racket, shuffling unsuspecting patients to doctors and procedures they didn’t need. “I always felt as if I were selling my soul,” he said of that work. Book reviewers acknowledged the questionableness of his behavior and of the perverse financial incentives that cause doctors to do more things to patients to bring in revenue, but nobody really says that this kind of behavior ought to be disciplined in any way by a medical board. Many people, doctors and non-doctors, seem to assume that some degree of unethical look-the-other-way behavior goes on in medicine, and this is simply accepted. It could be that this kind of acceptance makes it easier for the public to accept charlatans like Oz and other persuasive misinformers.  If, as Fadiman wrote, for-profit healthcare creates mistrust among the public, then it also encourages unethical physician behavior—in patient practice, or in public pronouncements and the media—which then becomes somewhat acceptable to a public eager to seek trust in a “brave maverick” or contrarian physician who offers them cures or the truth. All the while, regulatory bodies are ill-equipped to deal with the damage done not just to the profession’s credibility but to public health.  Doctors, of course, have been on the wrong side of public health long before COVID and Dr. Oz, and one doctor in particular is partly responsible for the rise of the anti-vaccine movement in the last two decades. Andrew Wakefield, a former physician from Britain, published a paper in The Lancet in 1998 in which he hypothesized a link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. His fraudulent work, which was later retracted (he was also stripped of his medical license), was responsible for “usher[ing] in a new era of distrust for vaccine[s],” writes Peter J. Hotez, M.D., Ph.D. in 2021 in an article about the rise of antiscience in the U.S. (Despite massive evidence that vaccines are safe and effective and that vaccines do not cause autism, the vaccine-autism myth just won’t die.) Hotez, a pediatrician and vaccine scientist, writes that the anti-vaccine movement has grown stronger since the early 2000s, as states have seen increases in legislation to allow religious or philosophical exemptions to routine childhood vaccinations. Decreased vaccination rates have resulted in outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, a highly contagious disease that can cause dangerous complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, or even death, particularly in young children. (Measles had been declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but outbreaks have occurred in recent years, including large case numbers in 2019 due to unvaccinated people.)  Furthermore, Hotez notes, the anti-vaccine movement has taken up the libertarian banner of medical freedom or health freedom, which combines a skepticism of mainstream medicine along with a tendency to promote unproven cures (before ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, there was, for example, MMS, or miracle medical solution, a bleach enema ‘treatment’ for autism). As these movements have grown, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest, anti-vaccine political action committees have formed. In his 2021 book Preventing the Next Pandemic: Vaccine Diplomacy in the Time of Anti-Science, Hotez writes:  Of the 14 metropolitan areas in western states and the state of Michigan where in 2018 we identified large numbers of children not receiving vaccines, most if not all were located in states where anti-vaccine PACs are active. Measles cases appeared in 7 of those 14 counties in 2019. In contrast, there are few if any lobbies or PACs specifically committed to vaccines.  In a 2022 article called “The Great Texas COVID Tragedy,” Hotez linked the state’s high death toll to the fact that it’s a state “which has been ground zero for the anti-vaccine health freedom movement” in the U.S., and because conservative parts of the state had low levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. As Hotez notes, the World Health Organization in 2019 listed “vaccine hesitancy” as one of 10 threats to global health alongside air pollution, climate change, and antibiotic resistance. That the dishonest work and activism of a former physician could help bring about one of the top threats to global health ought to be a source of shame for the profession—as is the ongoing slew of misinformation and anti-vaccine rhetoric coming from physicians.  Today’s misinformation doctors are often associated with larger right-wing moneyed efforts, as reported in December 2022 by the Center for Media and Democracy’s Walker Bragman:  Throughout the pandemic, a number of doctors and other medical experts have leveraged their credentials to promote misinformation and build large social media followings, styling themselves as bold whistleblowers challenging a tyrannical medical establishment. Many of these professionals have been promoted by the political Right, particularly business-aligned groups like those in Charles Koch’s influence network that oppose public health measures and workplace safety requirements for businesses.  Remember the Great Barrington Declaration that came out in the fall of 2020? It was an open letter authored by three academics (affiliated with prominent institutions the University of Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard) who got access to President Trump to promote their misguided idea of a herd immunity/anti-lockdown approach to COVID. Bragman notes that the aim of the declaration was “to undermine scientific consensus around public health measures.” But the World Health Organization and other major public health groups and scientists dismissed the approach. The Declaration arose from the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), a libertarian think tank with ties to the Koch Foundation and which promotes climate denial and the supposed harms of labor unions and corporate regulation. Additionally, the Koch-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance supported a challenge on behalf of five doctors to California’s 2022 state law that would allow for doctors who spread “coronavirus lies” to be disciplined. In January of this year, a federal judge halted the enforcement of the law.  We can thus identify a thread from anti-vaccine sentiment to medical freedom to right-wing and libertarian attacks on public health during the pandemic. At the center of this lies the physician misinformer, who promises not only the truth, but to sell you something—and is getting away with it.  In the context of California’s attempt to discipline physicians for misinformation, in November 2022, the New York Times asked, “Is Spreading Medical Misinformation a Doctor’s Free Speech Right?” Clearly, the correct answer to this question is, Absolutely Not. Just as licensure doesn’t confer the right to malpractice or to inflict harm, it does confer a responsibility to give sound medical advice and not engage in the promotion of quackery.  But it’s easy to be gaslit by takes like: “Who determines what false information is?” such as was asked by Dr. Jeff Barke, a Southern California physician quoted in the article. Barke expressed concern that California’s law would “impose a rigid orthodoxy on the profession that would rule out experimental or untested treatments.”  But you don’t have to be an adherent of a “rigid orthodoxy” to understand that disproven or dubious medical treatments should not be recommended to the public (or mass-prescribed via telehealth, which is another problem in and of itself) or that conspiracy theories about 5G and mass genocide are simply beyond what any reasonable and informed physician should be saying. To paraphrase Gorski: in medicine, we may not always know what’s right (understandings of diseases and treatments evolve with time and new evidence), but we usually do know when something is wrong. Thus, the idea that we can’t determine truth amounts to a kind of radical relativism, as if there’s some kind of arrogance to claiming that something is true and something else isn’t.  In another Times article about this year’s court ruling against California’s law, one doctor said, “Today’s quote-unquote misinformation is tomorrow’s standard of care.” To entertain this kind of situation, consider the cases of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Both were known to exhibit anti-viral properties before the pandemic. So there was a theoretical basis to think the drugs might work against COVID-19. But they don’t. We have to judge today’s information by what we know today, and the claims being made by the misinformers listed here are simply not plausible or have not been shown to be valid (or have even been disproven).  Furthermore, the idea that today’s “misinformation” will be vindicated tomorrow is simply wishful thinking, especially when the proposed thing isn’t even really plausible (microchips and vaccines, vaccines and genocide, masks as ineffective, which simply doesn’t add up with what we know about the physics of how masks work to block respiratory particles).  The stakes for people’s lives, and for public health, are too high to allow charlatans, grifters, and misinformers to continue unabated. It’s even worse that people in the healing profession profit off of fake treatments—Immanuel, Tenpenny, Mercola, Northrup, and Buttar, for instance, offer dozens of pills and supplements on their, or affiliate, websites. Take note: if a doctor is trying to sell you something such as a supplement, run the other way. I don’t care how many letters they have behind their name. It’s a conflict of interest of the worst kind, and it’s wrong.  We all probably know someone who has foregone medical treatment or vaccination (or sought out bogus treatments) due to fears or conspiracy theories brought on by misinformation. A family member of mine believed the false claims that COVID vaccines cause infertility and that rapid tests contain tracking devices inside them. He didn’t wear a mask in public, and he didn’t get vaccinated. He came down with COVID in fall 2021 and got ivermectin prescribed to him via a telehealth appointment. He continued to worsen at home and avoided getting a physical assessment until he became too short of breath to walk around. Just shy of 60 years old, he died after a prolonged hospitalization. His death was likely entirely preventable.  One analysis reported in NPR found that around one-third of U.S. COVID deaths could have been prevented with vaccination. We can then wonder how many of those vaccine refusals were caused by misinformation. Additionally, a 2022 Morning Consult poll showed that nearly three-quarters of doctors surveyed said that misinformation, whether about COVID or non-COVID topics, was negatively impacting clinical care (and that physicians who “intentionally spread misinformation should be held accountable”).  It’s not just the press that frames medical misinformation coming from doctors as a free speech issue. Consider the case of Simone Gold, M.D., the founder of America’s Frontline Doctors. She was sentenced to prison for her involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots and served 60-days’ time for a trespassing charge. Interestingly, the judge who sentenced her “emphasized that her statements about COVID vaccines and unproven medications were not the reason for imposing her incarceration—nor was she being punished for exercising her right to free speech—but her trespassing into a federal building was.” Here, the judge is helping to prime the public to see medical misinformation speech as untouchable under the First Amendment.  Gold, meanwhile, has her own rap-sheet of actions pertaining to her license, including a felony conviction, malpractice judgment, and hospital disciplinary action (the details of which are not public per the state board website). In a document dated January 2023, Gold faces a “petition to revoke” her medical license in California related to her conviction as well as general unprofessional medical conduct (the document specifically listed her speeches and activities advocating against COVID-related public health measures and vaccines as pertinent to her unprofessional conduct). Her California license is still listed as active. And she has now gotten a license to practice medicine in Florida.  How could that happen? This brings us to the problem of state-based medical licensing.  Just as the public health response to the pandemic has been fragmented and state based, with leaders loath to interfere with states’ rights, medical licensure is state based. The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) is a nonprofit that advocates for the 71 medical boards operating in U.S. states and territories. Some states have more than one board, and boards may also oversee the licensure of others such as acupuncturists and podiatrists. The country has just over 1 million licensed physicians, according to the federation’s latest census.  According to the FSMB, the right of the states to license medical doctors under the 10th Amendment was solidified by the 1889 Supreme Court Case Dent v. West Virginia, which upheld a lower court’s decision that a man named Frank Dent could not claim a right to practice medicine since he hadn’t undergone what was considered the proper training at the time. The practice of medicine is governed in each state by a Medical Practice Act, which defines the practice of medicine and outlines standards for licensing, renewal, professional conduct, and discipline of physicians. Boards essentially operate to enforce the Medical Practice Act and to discipline and rehabilitate doctors when necessary. The FSMB website says that their ultimate goal is to “keep patients safe.” Boards are staffed by doctors, other healthcare providers, and members of the public (most of the latter are appointed by governors).  The boards’ potential inadequacies are numerous. First, political appointees can be a problem generally, especially when so many officials, particularly Republicans, have shown themselves to be broadly anti-public health during the pandemic.4 One particularly bad political appointment shows just how far things can go: Florida’s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, M.D. (also of America’s Frontline Doctors notoriety) has been extremely hostile to COVID vaccines, masking, or COVID public health interventions in general (which was the reason Governor DeSantis picked him). Politico reported recently that he altered vaccine safety study results to make the vaccines look riskier than they are. In Texas, a recent investigation by KXAN News found that Governor Greg Abbott appointed “top dollar donors” to sit on the state medical board, in addition to people “from telecom, business, real estate and energy sectors, with no obvious patient advocacy or medical experience.”  Furthermore, medical boards are underfunded (they rely on state budgets) and understaffed for the volume of work required of them. Boards may receive complaints in the hundreds or thousands, and these may take months or longer to investigate, much less resolve. Boards also tend to focus on individual impairment issues (alcohol or drug abuse or other inappropriate conduct) and helping doctors get care or treatment that they need. (While these issues are certainly important, they clearly aren’t the only problems worth investigating.) As current FSMB President and CEO Humayun J. Chaudhry, D.O. told CNN in October 2021: “The system has been set up as a complaint-based system. … These state boards simply do not have the resources … to monitor what’s happening on the internet or what’s going on even in an individual patient encounter.”  This is all not very reassuring.  Yet, it’s pretty obvious that when doctors spout misinformation, such behavior ought to bring inquiry by those charged with “keeping patients safe.” To which some will respond: well, the public isn’t their patient. They aren’t practicing medicine by tweeting, and they only have a responsibility to follow the rules regarding interactions in the exam room, clinic, or hospital. But these boundaries aren’t always so clear. In the case of Oz, for instance, Benjamin Mazer pointed out that Oz essentially had 4 million patients (the show’s average daily viewership around 2004, which jumped to 22 million at the height of the pandemic in 2020) and that he and other physicians encountered patients who had stuck with Oz’s medical advice and treatment recommendations over their in-person doctor’s recommendations.  The FSMB noted in its 2022 Annual Report that it was alarmed by the amount of medical misinformation that had surfaced during the pandemic. In 2021, they released a statement warning that doctors’ COVID vaccine misinformation could put their license at risk. They noted that their statement had “major impact” because it got 3.4 million views on Twitter and was picked up by CNN and other major news outlets and mentioned in 1,400 news stories. They held two town halls, which medical board members could attend, as well as a webinar. That all sounds….great. But what about discipline?5  In 2021, 3,402 physicians were disciplined; most of these actions were reprimands or restrictions on licensure. The terrible truth, though, is that neither FSMB’s annual report nor their snapshot of disciplinary actions from 2021 indicates how many physicians were disciplined specifically for misinformation (remember, Politico said it was only eight as of February 2022). At the time of publication, FSMB had not responded to my email inquiry asking for those numbers.  Board specialty certification groups have tried to up the ante as well. The American Board of Emergency Medicine, American Board of Pathology, American Board of Internal Medicine, American Board of Family Medicine, and the American Board of Pediatrics released similar statements indicating that engaging in misinformation amounted to unprofessional conduct and that certification could be at risk. Taking away board certification is not a trivial thing. Without board certification—demonstrating expertise in one’s area of medicine—doctors will find it difficult to get a medical job in many institutions. But these statements, too, may have amounted to mere warnings, as it doesn’t appear anyone has had their board certification rescinded for misinformation. (Some doctors have been suspended or fired from their jobs here and there, but this is not a systemic solution.)  The bottom line comes down to something the FSMB says in its training video online for prospective board members: “All members of boards must put the best interests of the public—not health care providers—first.” And yet, medical boards seem to be failing to live up to the demands of the moment, one which happens to be a largely unmitigated public health disaster.  It certainly doesn’t help that right-wing legislatures have been hostile to medical boards during the pandemic. When, for example, in 2021 the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners issued a warning about COVID vaccine misinformation to its doctors, a Republican legislator on a powerful committee demanded that the Board remove the statement from its website and even threatened to “terminate” the Board. The board acquiesced and voted to remove the information from its website.  The FSMB has also documented what it calls “legislative overreach,” or bills that defang “boards’ authority to investigate patient harm related to COVID-19.” They noted that as of 2022, there were more than 45 such bills in 23 states. Becker’s Hospital Review in 2022 reported that  More than half of all U.S. states have proposed or passed legislation designed to promote access to ivermectin. … Twenty-eight states have bills that would either restrict medical boards’ authority to discipline clinicians who prescribe the unproven COVID-19 treatment, allow off-label use of the medication or both. … The legislation reflects growing political pressure to restrict boards’ authority to penalize physicians over health misinformation.  Examples of such legislation abound. This year’s Virginia’s SB 793 amends the code of Virginia to allow medical practitioners to prescribe, administer, or dispense hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and prevents the medical board from disciplining practitioners “solely” for that act. This year’s Texas SB 514 would cancel any discipline imposed on practitioners governed by the medical board who were investigated for making statements about the efficacy of masks or failing to wear masks as well as expunge the records of board discipline and investigation of these people. Even more extreme, Louisiana’s SB 29 from 2022 would prohibit employers from disciplining doctors for providing any medical treatment that was carried out with patient consent. (So now the practice of medicine is only limited to whatever any patient will agree to?) Florida’s HB 687 from 2022 would protect doctors free speech rights and limit the authority of the medical board to discipline a doctor for speech unless it could be proven that that speech caused “direct physical harm” to a person with whom the doctor had a therapeutic relationship in the prior three years. While these bills have not become law, the presence of so many of them is a clear sign that the physician regulatory system is actively being undermined.  To think about disciplining doctors for giving out medical misinformation, we have to contend with doctors’ free speech rights under the First Amendment. As Seton Hall Law Professor Carl H. Coleman writes, “a basic tenet of first amendment law” is that harmful speech should be challenged with “counterspeech.” According to this logic, it’s OK for a doctor with a large social media following to say that vaccines are magnetic as long as we put up some counter posts saying that that’s not true. But this hardly seems like it would be effective. Applying the counterspeech standard to medical misinformation seems dicey at best and foolish at worst. Brandolini’s law, or the asymmetric bullshit principle, as Gorski points out, says that the “amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.”  There’s also an argument to be made that physicians are not just private citizens who may say whatever they want. The free speech rights of the physician which would allow misinformation have been conceived of in terms that are too libertarian for public safety. We have to bring the balance back in favor of public health and the public good.  Fear of over-censure is no excuse not to go after the low-hanging fruit now (conspiracy theorists and misinformers with large platforms) and to find ways to reasonably assess other doctor misinformation and discipline such behavior. Doctors who spread misinformation should face disciplinary action by medical boards, including, in some cases, having their licenses revoked. Medical specialty boards, which handle board certification, ought to use their influence, too.  illustration by J. longo  Hall argues that there is a way for medical boards to discipline physician misinformation without running afoul of First Amendment. He proposes use of the “actual malice” standard as used by the legal profession to discipline lawyers’ actions not just in practice but in actions that reflect more generally on their fitness to practice law. (Hall also argues that Medical Practice Acts can be adjusted to explicitly include standards around medical speech for unprofessional behavior.) This is essentially the route California has taken with Gold in their accusation of unprofessional conduct. As the Times summed up, the California law was “narrowly written in hopes of avoiding First Amendment entanglements,” and Governor Gavin Newsom said that the law had been “narrowly focused on malicious intent.” But the LA Times reported in March of this year that the law remains “entangled in lawsuits” related to free speech or the law potentially being too vague. If these kinds of laws cannot pass legal scrutiny for vagueness, then they are going to have to be more specific.  Physician autonomy sounds like another hurdle—licensed doctors should be allowed the authority to treat patients as they see fit and to exercise their right to free speech. This sounds reasonable. And yet, why is it that the standards in place now seem to result in outcomes that harm patient care and public health?  A look at the larger issue of physician autonomy reveals that it seems to be upheld in ways that result in patient and public harm. Consider anti-abortion and anti-trans healthcare bills. We’ve seen that these bills make doctors hesitate to give care to patients, which ultimately threatens patients’ lives. The physician’s autonomy, and the patient’s health, therefore, are placed second to the law. I’ve written about how this is unethical with abortion (it is, too, with gender-affirming care) and how doctors need to take care of their patients according to appropriate standards of care rather than acquiescing to unjust laws.6 In the case of medical misinformation, we simply cannot allow a physician’s free speech rights to be upheld when their speech is a threat to public health. At some point, the public’s health has to be prioritized over a doctor’s speech and healthcare bills by bigoted state legislatures.  If we put a standard in place that the public good must come first, this means no withholding appropriate medical care and no giving out false medical information (or bogus treatments) to the public. But this will likely take action by more than a few medical boards or legislatures. It will require a movement among physicians, clinicians who work alongside them, and the general public to bring physicians back to the familiar invocation, “First, do no harm.”  Right now, we face an uphill battle to protect the public from medical misinformation that promotes dangerous disproven and unproven therapeutics and discourages effective and essential public health measures like masking and vaccination. Unfortunately, we even have a strongly antivaccine presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has made a career out of medical disinformation and whose paranoia and conspiracy theory obsessions truly make him a danger to the public and unfit for office. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf recently said that misinformation was even contributing to the country’s decreasing life expectancy because of Americans’ “choices.” “Why aren’t we using medical products as effectively and efficiently as our peer countries? A lot of it has to do with choices that people make because of the things that influenced their thinking.” Well, good choices cannot easily be made when you’re surrounded by supposed experts telling you the wrong thing, and no one is there to stop them. We have a public that is eager for basic health and medical information and distrustful of government institutions, and this is a dangerous combination that allows for medical-misinformation charlatans to get so much attention. We need better public health education and better public health.  The right-wing tendency is always to do less to help the collective, which is, of course, made up of individuals. The libertarian “health freedom” ideal, if taken to its logical conclusion for physicians, would mean, as Gorski puts it, “freedom from professional responsibility, government regulation, or any consequences whatsoever for endangering patients.” Combining this with the anti-vaccine tendency and the most extreme elements of today’s right wing—which propose doing away with much of the government’s regulatory oversight altogether—would yield a decidedly anti-public health and excessively deregulated society.  Such medical deregulation was endorsed by laissez-faire capitalist economist Milton Friedman, who complained that licensure created a shortage of doctors and thus harmed the public (physician shortages are always a valid concern, but there are multiple reasons for this which are beyond the scope of this article). “I conclude that licensure should be eliminated as a requirement for the practice of medicine,” he wrote. Less government regulation would rein in the licensing body’s “monopoly” power, he believed.  But here, his solution is even worse than the problem he complains about and would certainly lead to more public harm. The answer to physician shortages (real or an imbalance in supply and demand) and perverse economic incentives in medicine is to remove the profit motive from medicine and create a system that centers human needs. We must enact single-payer universal healthcare (Medicare for All) and any and all accompanying legislation we need in order to build the human and physical infrastructure necessary to provide care to everyone and to adequately regulate physicians—not make it so that anyone can practice their version of medicine. And preserving free speech and physician autonomy must not come at the cost of the public’s safety and well-being.  It’s past time to reign in these bad physician actors and give them a hefty dose of disciplinary medicine. We need to adequately staff and resource medical boards so that they can do their jobs to discipline doctors whose words (and likely deeds) go against acceptable professional standards, and going forward we ought to consider a national licensing system for doctors.7 I agree completely with Gorski, who writes the following:  The bottom line is that practicing medicine is a privilege, one of the highest privileges society can grant to any human being. It is not a right. Unfortunately, all too often the law treats it more like a right.8 … That needs to change, and that change needs to include stopping physicians from abusing the privilege of their profession to spread disinformation that kills, as too many physicians [have done].  I would also add that medical misinformers and their ilk have made a mockery of their profession. Medicine isn’t wizardry. Medical education and licensure do not transform a person into some kind of genius who can come up with and proclaim whatever they think sounds good despite the facts and despite potential harms to patients and listeners. I don’t think some doctors quite realize this, and their arrogance makes them think that their education and licensure mean something other than what it does.  Going after licensure is not enough. Doctors can and will continue to use their medical degree and grandfathered board certification status to confer legitimacy upon themselves to advance their (often commercial and political) agendas. We need a strong commitment from the public, public institutions, and from physicians about what we want medicine to be: based on good scientific evidence, prioritized on keeping the public safe from unproven, disproven, and unnecessary treatments, and free of the corrupting profit motive.  Although there is significant distrust in American healthcare, people still seem to trust doctors. But if we don’t fix the problem of physician regulation, that trust may soon be gone.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cnJlbnRhZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1L2RvY3RvcnMtd2hvLXNwcmVhZC1tZWRpY2FsLW1pc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXNob3VsZC1sb3NlLXRoZWlyLWxpY2Vuc2VzLXdoeS1kb250LXRoZXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For those few hours when it was downpouring rain on people in the nosebleeds, people with floor seats, and Taylor herself, it was something special. And truly just proves how Taylor will go all out for her fans. Because at any moment, she could have said, ""Hey, listen, sorry, we'll reschedule because this is a total wash.""  But she didn't. Because she's Taylor FREAKIN Swift.  Because according to an Instagram post by Haley Miller, not only did Taylor embrace the downpouring rain, but she did her entire show in it. Flawlessly. And at times even had fun with the crowd and splashed rainwater off the top of her piano onto the crowd, because why not?  Taylor Swift Rain Water  There was something else that everyone was talking about after waking up on Sunday morning following the late, rainy night at Gillette the night before. The fact that someone literally bottled the rainwater from Taylor's Eras Tour show the night before at Gillette and was selling it on Facebook Marketplace for $250.  First off, truly genius move. Secondly, the only thing better than someone selling actual rainwater from a Taylor Swift show is the reactions to it, starting off with realizing the jars holding the rainwater are hilarious on their own.

"religious miracle","2023-04-09","Not Discerned","{""Trebicv"", ""Vysocvina"", ""CzechRepublic""}","2023-05-22T09:45:10","Comments on Six Movies and an Essay on a Seventh One, Screened During the 63rd Thessaloniki International Film Festival (2022)  ‘Somewhere Over the Chemtrails’ [‘Kdyby Radši Hořelo‘] (2022), by Czech director Adam Koloman Rybanský (1994)  Plot:  Standa, a portly middle-aged man, is not exactly the kind of intelligent or skillful person, however, he is imbued with sincere feelings towards people. He lives with his adorable, pregnant wife Jana in a humble cottage in an isolated Czech village. He works at the local fire brigade office with his friend Bronya, the commander, who is suffering from depression as he has recently lost his wife. Repeatedly he tries to commit suicide, but he is always rescued by the timely interventions of Standa. At the central square of the village an Easter Fair is going on and everybody is having fun when suddenly a van rushes in with full speed and ploughs into Geiza, a friend of Standa who happens to be an immigrant. Bronya is convinced that the incident is a case of an ‘Arab’ terrorist attack against the village and together with his people he starts spreading fear and hatred among the village’s inhabitants for the danger lurking out there.  Comment:  Identification as a remedy for fear. Identification as the nucleus of the ‘I,’ of everything that I am. In identifying myself with the Czech ethnic community I have certainly acquired an identity whatsoever and I think that I have expelled uncertainty and anxiety once and for all. Haven’t I excluded this way, however, any other identity out of the millions that exist out there? I think I am a Czech, and hence I am not a Slovak; I think I am a Catholic and hence I cannot be an Orthodox. Identity is not a positive entity, but a negative one: identity, i.e., ‘sameness’ means per se the exclusion of all ‘otherness,’ its elimination. Amin Maalouf had intuited it correctly: ‘… because of a narrow, exclusive, bigoted, simplistic attitude that reduces identity in all its many aspects to one single affiliation, and one that is proclaimed in anger. I feel like shouting aloud that this is how murderers are made – it’s a recipe for massacres!’  Even though we cannot quite agree with Maalouf in believing that a broader, more ‘polyphonic’ identity, which would encompass more than one such ‘narrow’ and ‘exclusive’ affiliation would have more chances to bring about the much desired peace. We have to advance Maalouf’s thought at least one step further: since any identity is formed within us – be it one-dimensional or ‘polyphonic’ – hatred and war will inevitably erupt. The important Serbian anthropologist Ivan Čolović confirms it emphatically: ‘It is difficult to find a concept of culture which would be free of essentialism, of an outlook on culture as a primordial, essentially immutable national substance. Attempted multi-, inter- or trans-culturalism haven’t removed us very far from this essentialism.’  Immersed in his deep, personal depression and utter existential boredom, Bronya is desperately in need of imagining his own local, cultural, ethnic and religious poly-identity, his own nationalistic utopia that will remedy the fear which he feels oozing deep inside. It must definitely be those damn Arabs again!  read also Berlinale Through the Eastern European Lens: 5 Films Worth Checking Out Patrycja Rozwora This year marked the 72nd anniversary of the Berlinale – the Berlin International Film Festival first created for the German public back in 1951. Shaped by the turbulent post-war period and the unique situation of a divided city, Berlinale has developed into a place of intercultural exchange and a platform for the critical cinematic exploration of relevant and time-specific social issues. Out of the many great cinematic works presented during the festival, we selected five of our favourite world premiers, that amused or provoked us both on a conceptual and formal level.  The same old narrative is reconstructed at once: ‘We swear… to serve our country, the Czech Republic. We will not hesitate even to offer our own life to protect it and guarantee its freedom. We swear to love each other. To support one another with fraternal love. To defend one another to the end, with virile honour… and in full knowledge of our duties as citizens and firefighters. This is the oath we take,’ preaches a delirious Bronya; in his sermon a whole Nation has already been imagined, because what else is a nation if not an ‘imagined community’ as Benedict Anderson aptly has posed it? ‘… I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community… It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion;’ and how else can one as quickly as possible agglutinate a variegated set of still unsuspecting individuals into a coherent ‘nation’ if not by invoking some hypothetical ‘fraternal’ bonds which they supposedly share even if they don’t know it? ‘The near universality with which certain images and phrases appear – blood, family, brothers, sisters, mother, forefathers, ancestors, home – and the proven success of such invocations in eliciting massive, popular responses tell us much about the nature of national identity,’ writes Walker Connor.  And that is exactly the propitious moment when all those skinheads – so familiar to all of us by now – appear. The willing warriors of any extreme nationalistic and xenophobic delirium imaginable. The rationale for intruding innocent people’s homes has been invented again, and it pertains, as always, to a sacred order of things; it cannot be disputed by anyone: nation, religion, family…: ‘The citizens will then justify their conformism with regard to obvious infringements of human rights, disregard of fundamental democratic principles, the creation of an autocratic state, etc.,’ writes the Croatian intellectual Dubravka Ugrešić.  And that is also the exact moment when chemtrail theory literally explodes. It always flourishes on the fertile soil of fear, bigotry, and ignorance. A bizarre colleague of Standa shows him insinuatingly some weird airplanes scouring the skies, leaving behind them long chemtrails. He explains that in fact the government along with various companies go on spraying people with dangerous chemicals so that they get sick with some incurable diseases. He suggests that he uses vinegar: it has some attributes which neutralize the dangerous effects of these chemical substances. Apparently, fear, identification, ignorance, hatred and chemical spraying go together like a horse and carriage: ‘That ignorance-based knowledge, as it were, or to be more precise the clever use of the specific ignorance needed for the occurrence of miracles, is part and parcel of the perennial art of handling sacred things, mysterious signs and formulas, prophecies, holy relics, and mysteries. The power of religion, of priests and witch-doctors is based on this old know-how.’  At the end, all this ‘imaginary’ (re)constitution of the Nation, all that tedious xenophobic rhetoric, all that fake ‘fraternity’ proves to be a kind of psychological prop for a solitary and devastated old man, Bronya. Now truth has prevailed in the village again – who knows for how long? – and Bronya feels like life has lost all its meaning again. He reverts back to his old suicidal obsessions. No surprise at all, since any nationalistic narrative is in fact nothing more than a myth; and no myth can ever solve any real problem, even more so the psychological ones: ‘The concept of ‘national identity’ is a sweeping conceptual chimera that is often simply used as a description of assumed social reality or invoked as a shortcut explanation for particular forms of collective behaviour,’ asserts Siniša Malešević.  Everything then has been just a machination dictated by that same mischievous entity of our Ego, constantly inventing myths in its perennial pursuit of inner security and pleasure. Nation is nothing more than just another myth inscribed within the larger and fundamental myth – the myth of all myths – the ‘I’: ‘The idea of the nation is thus linked with the idea of my own self,’ confirms Otto Bauer.  The poor and ignorant villagers will return back to their boring daily routines, consuming the same copious quantities of beer and tobacco they used to. Something more is going to be needed though, if normality is to be established again: Bronya, for the first time in his life, will assume responsibility, and will sacrifice himself in the name of his friendship with Standa which so much he has abused so far. Hence friendship, tells us Rybanský, might be the real remedy for our maladies, especially for that apparently innate nationalistic and xenophobic hatred of ours. It would be a useful task for us to try to find several more such antidotes; to invent them in case we do not have them handy already.  read also Mălina Manovici Old mentalities are hard to replace Eleftherios Makedonas Eleftherios Makedonas interviews Mălina Manovici, the protagonist of Romanian director’s Octav Chelaru movie Balaur [A Higher Law] (2021), which was shown during the 62nd Thessaloniki (Greece) International Film Festival (04-14.11.2021).  1 – Maalouf, Amin (2003), In the Name of Identity.

Dark, moody skies with clouds so thick they seem solid. The apple trees in our backyard thrashing. A heavy blue tarp, draped over whatever project my dad was working on at the time, loose and flapping in the wind. The ocean, only a few miles from our house, roiling along the jagged shoreline. The rain arriving all in one rush like an exhaled breath. My family inside, snug and languid and unaware of my absence. My mother stretched across the couch, reading; my father in the kitchen pickling vegetables; my twin sister drawing quietly at the coffee table. A crack of thunder so loud and so in sync with the lightning flash that my mother is about to say, That must have struck something nearby. She stops because my sister’s hair is standing on end, fanned out like a sea anemone. Then my mother smells singed wood, singed earth, singed hair. Hannah is crying and my mother grabs her, but Hannah appears to be uninjured. My father rushes into the living room, knife still in hand. “What happened? Why is she screaming?” My mother smooths down Hannah’s hair and asks her what hurts. Hannah continues to sob. “Oh my god,” my mother says when she realizes there’s nothing wrong with this twin, the one safe in the living room with her and my father. “Oh my god. Where’s Rachael?”  Hannah and I were eight at the time. I was outside by the backyard oak tree. The lightning cored the oak and then an errant arm of electricity reached for me. I was out cold for several minutes and when I opened my eyes the world swam in front of me like a television channel that wasn’t in focus. Thanks to the miracle of Hannah’s electrically charged hair, my parents were there when I woke and an ambulance was already wailing in the distance. My mother loves this story. As family lore it’s irresistible: the raging storm, the twin connection, my mother’s instincts, the proof of our uniqueness, and the razor’s edge of disaster that only nicked us.  I spent a week in the hospital. For several years I had joint pain and occasional seizures in which my face went slack and my head snapped up and down like a skipping CD. I started getting migraines accompanied by blurred vision and moving colors and a strange settled sense of dread. But I was lucky to survive. The doctors and nurses told me so again and again. Still, I didn’t feel lucky. I felt exposed. I felt like someone had broken into the house that was my body and moved all my things around.  And the part of the story that my mother always left out of her frequent retellings: when my parents asked if I remembered anything leading up to the lightning strike, I told them that I had been beckoned outside by a man in a black rain cape. His voice was low and throaty. His breath smelled like damp soil. When he gestured for me to walk in front of him and his cape opened, I saw that his arm was webbed; a pink flap of flesh ran from his wrist to his waist. His shoulders were high and hunched. I wanted to resist, but was too scared of not obeying. Rainwater streamed over his face. He told me, “The smoke gets thicker the further you go.”  We lived in a small town on the Maine coast, where kids rode dirt bikes through the woods and walked without hesitation over barely frozen streams and had no fear of the dark, yawning nights that seemed to swallow everything during our long winters. Even before the lightning strike, I was the quieter, stranger twin. Afterwards, I grew jumpy and fearful, which were great sins in our town’s childhood kingdom. Hannah saved me from being an outcast. Whenever she sensed I was about to do or say something too weird she changed the subject or caught my eye and gave a quick shake of her head. When I told friends at a sleepover to keep the lamp on to ward off the Webbed-Arm Man, Hannah laughed loudly and said he was just a character from a bedtime story our mom had told us. When I hesitated to retrieve a Frisbee from a crawl space that pulsed with a sinister energy or a beach ball that floated too far from the shore, Hannah would rush past me with feigned excitement and recover the item before I could refuse.  In some fundamental way, I didn’t understand what people expected of me. Once, when I was ten, I proudly showed the supermarket cashier a dead mouse that our cat had killed. I’d been keeping it in a toy handbag. As the cashier shrieked and people in line turned away, my mother said only, “She’s a little scientist, this one!” while Hannah apologized and ushered me out the door. My mother, a librarian from New York with wild gray hair that she wore much longer than was fashionable, wasn’t perturbed by my behavior or the way the town regarded me. But my father was horrified when Mom recounted the story. He buried the mouse, still in the handbag, in the yard while I cried. Dad asked Hannah what I’d been thinking and Hannah said, “She wanted it for her bone collection,” reluctantly leading him to where I’d stored the sun-bleached skeleton of an opossum I’d found by our back fence.  Hannah was my opposite in every way. She resembled our dad: sandy-haired, athletic, and approachable. I’m more like our mother: dark-eyed with angular features and unruly curls. And Hannah always knew exactly what people expected of her, which was a different sort of burden than the one I carried. She was adored, confided in, and admired, but she had her own anxieties, which she hid from everyone but me. She worried about our father, who she claimed was stressed about money and the properties he managed. She worried that our mother found us boring. She worried about our parents’ frequent arguments, about a close friend whose brother was cruel, and I assume also about me—my fixations, my strangeness, my poor health.  I never figured out how Hannah intuited others’ secrets, but even when she told me about them, they didn’t trouble me much. My fears were visceral: that the undercurrent would drag me to sea if I went into the ocean past my knees; that our dad’s truck would fishtail in the snow on the drive to school; that there was someone crouching behind the rhododendron bush, ready to grab me every time I rushed onto the porch. I had seen the Webbed-Arm Man and I knew he was watching from whatever dusky corner of the universe he resided in. I knew that he was waiting.  Before we go any further: Hannah is dead. She drowned three years ago, when we were thirty-one. The knowledge of her death is like the fear I felt in childhood: a second shadow that’s always with me. And this shadow falls heavily over my recollections of our lives, so there’s no true way to tell this story if you don’t know that’s what I’m building towards. Besides, I’ve never liked surprises, even when they’re for other people.  Hannah and I never stopped being close, though eventually the world began to edge its way in. Amidst the many other mild mortifications of middle school, Hannah began to cultivate friendships that, for the first time, didn’t include me. In high school, she joined the volleyball team and jogged five miles every morning before breakfast. As I brushed my teeth, I would watch from the small bathroom window as she stretched in the driveway, lithe and flushed and pleased with how much she’d accomplished while the neighbors still slept. I had no talent for sports, but I developed an intense passion for geology and started a blog on the rock formations of the Maine coast. Hannah had her first boyfriend, a surprisingly tame relationship that nonetheless overwhelmed her and filled her with moony longing. But weekday evenings still found us in comfortable camaraderie in our room, debriefing the day and planning for the next one.  On our sixteenth birthday, Hannah secured her license and we discovered how much we loved to drive together. We’d meander through the woods, pointing out abandoned railroad crossings, fire towers, and leaning cabins. I felt more settled than I had in childhood, tethered more firmly to the world as others saw it, but I had few friends and I was achingly lonely when weekend evenings Hannah disappeared to parties or team sleepovers or her boyfriend’s basement.  When the time came to apply to college, our dad sat us down at the kitchen table and told us he wanted us to go to different schools. Hannah laughed and said we’d consider it. Later, I asked Hannah what the big fuss was and she told me, “He wants us to be normal,” which was how I learned he thought we weren’t.  We disregarded Dad’s advice and went to a small college within an hour’s drive of our hometown. Everything about college was a surprise. I, who’d never felt comfortable anywhere, was suddenly full of purpose. I dove with pleasure into the study of maritime history, the geology of the ocean floor, cartography in the middle ages. It seemed there was a class for everything. I even braved late-night walks alone through the dark campus, grasses rustling and strangers’ footsteps echoing through the narrow corridors between buildings, if it meant I could stay at the college’s library until it closed. I started dating a girl who worked in the interlibrary loan office and was absorbed into her group of clove-smoking, intricately tattooed friends. I took six classes at a time. I helped my professors with their research. I never turned in a single assignment late, even when my migraines nestled in my head and pulsed their jagged spikes into the tender flesh behind my eyes.  Hannah, who’d always been competent and sure-footed, suddenly lost all momentum. She’d been recruited for volleyball, but played badly and was taken off the starting line-up. Eventually, she quit the team. She began drinking more and slept with her Spanish TA. When she confessed to her chaste high school sweetheart, he refused to forgive her. She missed classes because she’d been partying, then because she just didn’t want to go. She chose subjects seemingly at random. She began staging protests with my girlfriend’s friends, becoming passionate about specific causes—veganism, the cafeteria workers’ rights, banning plastic containers—only to abandon them weeks later. She started a frenzy of volunteering—teaching ELL courses to custodial staff at the school, serving at the town’s soup kitchen, working with kids at a youth shelter.  When we were juniors, our parents divorced. I knew I should have felt more strongly about it, but all I felt was a slight sadness at the thought of our dad all alone in our old house. Hannah, on the other hand, spent hours on the phone trying to reconcile them, reckoning with my mother’s anger and restlessness, my father’s loneliness and sense of failure. Against the advice of her advisor, she went abroad to Madrid. My migraines became unbearable while she was gone and I was so exhausted I starting falling asleep in class. I didn’t think I’d survive her absence, but after only a month, Hannah had an incident with some sleeping pills and red wine that alarmed her host family, and it was decided she’d come back early. When I picked her up at the airport, she was so thin I wanted to wrap my arms around her just to give her more heft. On the ride home she told me, “It’s like I’m watching myself. I don’t even know who’s running the show.” She moved in with me and for a time we were as close as we’d ever been. I walked her through her daily routines until she’d regained her bearings and come back into herself.  Our senior year, I got lost in my thesis, a sprawling history of humans’ attempt to map the seafloor, and my girlfriend felt neglected and left me for a freshman poet. Hannah’s charm and intelligence kept her held aloft while she continued to slip and slide, never quite gaining traction. She came home one night, unsteadily drunk, and darkened when she saw me with a draft of my thesis spread across the floor. “Look at you,” she said to me. “You’re so good. You’re so focused. Do you remember when I had to check the closet every night for the Webbed-Arm Man before you could sleep?”  “You saved me,” I told her.  “Rachael,” she said, dropping to her knees in front of me, grasping my wrists. “How does a person know what they’re worth?”  When she touched me, the boundary between us fell away, as it often had when we were children. I felt her shame and emptiness like a wave of nausea. I felt her furious love for the world and her belief that she was undeserving of it. I realized that her frenzy of volunteer work was her way of trying to earn her place—not just at the college, but on this earth. I rested my forehead against hers. She had saved me; she was still saving me. “There’s no one better than you,” I told her, because it was true.  Hannah’s mention of the Webbed-Arm Man that night surprised me. Over the years, we’d stopped discussing him, and I thought she’d mostly forgotten him. I had not. My fear of him had lost its sharp edge, but I never stopped believing. I’d seen or sensed him several other times. When I had my seizures, I used wake to the harsh smell of wood smoke, which I took as a signal that the Webbed-Arm Man was close. When I was twelve, an October snowstorm knocked out the power and Mom sent me to retrieve a flashlight. The candle I was holding snuffed out just as I took my first step onto the basement staircase. I reached an exploratory hand into the sudden blackness and felt a wet flap of flesh; I scrambled back upstairs and locked the door behind me. I also occasionally caught glimpses of him under porches or in bushes or off the side of the road. And once, when I was brushing my teeth in high school, worrying over why Hannah hadn’t yet returned from her morning run, I saw him leaning against our neighbor’s fence, his eyes also trained down the road. By the time I’d gained enough courage to rush outside, he was gone and I could see Hannah turning onto our street. My dad dismissed my sightings as the product of an overactive imagination or a symptom of my epilepsy. My mother believed me, or claims she did.  My fear of him had lost its sharp edge, but I never stopped believing.  Even in college, when I’d become less skittish and more grounded, he was present in my life. Most notably, on a camping trip at Acadia National Park with my girlfriend, I’d made the Webbed-Arm Man into a campfire tale as we roasted marshmallows, embellishing the story with a series of elaborate recurring nightmares I’d never had. That night I couldn’t sleep, worrying about a group of men at the site next to ours, who’d kept trying to flirt with us and then grown surly and quiet when they realized we were a couple. It began to rain and the loamy smell of the wet soil brought the Webbed-Arm Man back to me in the form I always knew him to be: a memory and not an invention. I woke up Elise and forced her to sleep in the locked car with me. When we drove into Bar Harbor the next morning, I had a voicemail from Hannah.  “I know, I know, I know you’re fine,” the recording said. “But I just had a feeling I couldn’t shake, so please call me when you’re back in civilization, okay?”  For me, the years after college passed like rolling down a hill: effortless and inevitable. I attended grad school, where a tendency towards fixation is the most promising trait, and my research burned so brightly everything else in my life seemed to dim. I won awards. I graduated with the highest honors and started my dream job as a map librarian at the Boston Public Library. A woman named Priya took an interest in me after touring an exhibit I’d curated on mapping the cosmos, and fought her way into my vision long enough to make herself part of my routine.  Hannah took back up with her high school boyfriend and they were married within a year. Part of the reason he’d been so chaste and unforgiving all those years ago was because he was a deeply, onerously religious man. Hannah became very involved in their church, which distressed Mom to no end. But the church stabilized Hannah’s life and gave her a community who valued her generosity, even if they couldn’t see that it wasn’t earnestly in service to the lord, but born from her intense need to correct the debt she thought she owed the world. Out of some punishing instinct, she got a job organizing study abroad programs at a company based in Portland, which she was very good at despite her failure in Madrid.  Although our lives had very different shapes, she remained one of the only people whose motivations and desires were not opaque to me. Every morning we woke an hour early so we could talk on the phone as we drank our coffee. I’d close my eyes and imagine her across from me, and it always seemed that if I just reached out my arm, she’d be there on the other side of the table, ready to take my hand. Once, when I opened my eyes after the call, I was looking at Hannah and Chris’s tidy kitchen counter and had to shake my head hard before my own small apartment came back into view.  I remember almost everything about the night that Hannah died. I’d brought Priya to Maine for Thanksgiving to meet my family. Priya is Indian-Canadian, so she had no other plans, and she wanted to see where I came from and get to know the golden sister I talked so much about. Hannah and Chris picked us up at the train station and whisked us to Mom’s apartment in Portland for our day-before-Thanksgiving meal, which Mom kept calling “the first Thanksgiving” to acknowledge that we were going to our father’s the next day.  By then, my mother had moved into an attic apartment at the edge of the city. The house was at the top of a steep hill and Mom’s bedroom window had an expansive view of the bay, so in the mornings she could watch the lobster boats slinking out to sea and the clouds of greedy seagulls trailing after them. Hannah was worried that Mom was becoming eccentric—she’d developed an obsession with the Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis and painted bright pastoral scenes on every free surface of her apartment—but Mom was much happier than she’d ever been living with Dad or raising us.  Priya complimented my mother’s artwork and seemed genuinely charmed that Mom had ordered a buffet of Thai take-out because she’d forgotten to defrost the turkey. Mom offered to show Priya more of her paintings after dinner. I watched Hannah’s expression carefully for a clue as to how the interaction was going. Hannah gave me a little nod of approval, but there was sadness underneath it.  After dinner, Mom disappeared into the kitchen and reappeared with a pot of mulled wine. When she theatrically took off the lid, the dining room filled with the scent of cloves and Priya clapped. Mom bowed and then poured each of us a steaming mugful. When she slid one over to Chris, he said stiffly, “You know I can’t have that.” He was five years sober.  “Just one can’t hurt!” My mother took a showy sip of hers. “It’s delicious.”  “She does this on purpose,” Chris said to Hannah. He hated when anyone drew attention to his sobriety, highlighting his one deviation from the righteous path.  Hannah took his mug and put it next to her own. She said something softly to him that I couldn’t quite make out.  “Suit yourself,” Mom said. “But it’s the one thing I cooked tonight.” She laughed. When no one laughed with her she shrugged. “I guess if you’re drinking, Hannah, that means no luck yet on the pregnancy front.”  Hannah blushed and shook her head. She and Chris had been trying for years. Chris insisted that God would bless them when it was time.  “My friend Patty was telling me all about IVF,” Mom said. “It’s normal now. So there’s no need to be so prudish about it.”  “That’s enough!” Chris said, so loudly that Priya jumped.  “Don’t be startled, dear,” Mom said. “He’s always like this. You two have the right idea. If I’d been smarter, I’d have been a lesbian, too.”  “Mom,” Hannah said sharply. She turned to me, “How’s your new exhibit coming? Have you started installing it yet?”  “What new exhibit?” Mom asked, allowing herself to be led. “Why didn’t you tell me about it?”  “I did,” I said. “When we talked last month.” But Mom only vaguely remembered the conversation—she was often painting or out for a walk when we talked on the phone. But I was happy to explain the project again; my work is one of the few conversation topics that come easily to me.  This was the first major exhibit I was designing on my own. It focused on places that are still uncharted. I’d titled it The Last Unmapped Places, and was working sixty-hour weeks because I needed it to be perfect. Mom asked for examples, and I explained about the miles-deep cave system under farmland in Vietnam, an unclimbed mountain in Bhutan, the shifting outline of Greenland’s coast, and shantytowns in Pakistan with no reliable street maps.  Hannah had finished both her and Chris’s wine and was filling her mug again. Chris made a show of checking his watch. “You’re sure you want to have another?”  I kept talking as if he hadn’t interrupted, so Hannah wouldn’t have to respond. “The challenge is figuring out what to display, since the focus is the unmapped. But really, it’s about mystery and its tug on the imagination. Our last exhibit was on trains, and now we get to feature remote sections of the Amazon jungle seen by no one still alive on this earth.”  “How ambitious,” Chris said, draping his arm over the back of Hannah’s chair in the proprietary posture that men like him are made for. “But you should be careful. If you spend too much time scratching away at the mystery, you’ll eliminate the very thing you think you love. As soon as you find the unknown, it becomes the known.”  “Is this about God?” I said. “Again?”  “Rachael,” Hannah said. “He’s not trying to convert you. He’s just making conversation.”  “He wants to make good believers out of all of us, like he did with you.”  Priya put a cautionary hand on my knee.  “I don’t have to tolerate this,” Chris said.  “She’s just feeling defensive,” Hannah murmured.  “Don’t do this again,” Chris said. “Pick a side.”  “How can I?”  Chris stood, nearly upturning Mom’s wobbly table when he braced himself against it. “I’m going home. If you want to stay, you can call me when you need a ride.”  “Don’t be so dramatic,” I said, but I was pleased that the night would carry on without him.  “So you’re really not coming?” he asked. Hannah didn’t look at him when she shook her head.  We continued drinking, and I began to feel really good, surrounded by the women who made up the whole of my social world. At some point, Mom announced that she was going to bed, but encouraged us to stay up talking.  After she left, Hannah became confessional with Priya. She explained that we hadn’t been raised with God. She was drunk—really drunk, like I hadn’t seen since college. “I do feel awe in church,” she said. “But the God I feel, it’s as if He’s channeled through Chris, like I’m believing through him.”  “There’s nothing wrong with that,” Priya said. I could tell she liked Hannah, which was not a surprise. Everyone liked Hannah.  “Do you think it’s really okay? Sometimes I don’t know.” Hannah started to cry. Priya and I got out of our seats and crouched next to her. We each took one of her hands.  When Hannah’s crying had slowed she said, “I’m not always like this.” Then, she turned to me and said, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I feel like I don’t have any edges anymore. The way I used to feel only with you, I feel that way with everyone.”  I squeezed her hand.  I don’t remember what we talked about after that strange interlude, but we forged on and the mood lightened. Eventually Priya said that she’d like to see Maine’s famous coastline before she left, and Hannah said, “What better time than now?”  Outside, the night was clear and fresh and ripe, and it calmed me to take the sharp air into my lungs. Hannah led us to a park with a small gazebo and a wrought-iron fence. It was an almost-full moon; a funnel of light sliced across the river. We climbed down a steep stone staircase partially hidden by trees, which spilled out onto a paved path that wrapped around the cliff. I recovered my bearings; if we’d gone right we would have come across the ferry terminal and then the seafood restaurants and ice cream shops and fish markets. Instead, we turned left, towards the open ocean. We could hear waves slapping against the sea wall.  Priya took in a big breath. “I smell salt!” she said, delighted.  “The water’s so choppy.” I was surprised. “It’s not that windy.”  “Are you already forgetting the ways of the ocean?” Hannah teased. “It stormed yesterday. The sea remembers.”  When we came to an old jetty, Priya hopped out onto the rocks. She took in the gyrating peaks and valleys of the water. “It’s so beautiful,” she said. “On a night like this, it’s obvious there’s no risk of losing mystery, no matter how much you study it.”  On a night like this, it’s obvious there’s no risk of losing mystery, no matter how much you study it.  Hannah followed Priya onto the rocks. “How lovely,” she said. “What a lovely sentiment.” Then she said, so low that I could barely hear her over the tut-tut of the waves, “You will be so good for Rachael.”  And then something went wrong. A twisted ankle, the sole of a shoe too smooth to grip the rock face, or a step made unstable with alcohol. Or maybe something darker. I know. I know there’s the possibility that Hannah intended, or half-intended, to go in. The only certainty is that one moment Hannah was a striking silhouette against the blue-black sky, and the next she was in the water.  I heard the splash and the sickening intake of breath as the cold hit her. I screamed. I ran to the sea wall and dropped to my knees. I searched and found Hannah surfacing, pulled in toward the piers faster than I would have expected. She tore at the water.  I must have encouraged Hannah to swim. I must have shouted for help. Hannah, when she said something finally, was impossible to understand.  I stood up. I took off my shoes and my coat. From the jetty, Priya saw my intent and hissed with as much intensity as a slap, “Don’t you dare.”  Still, I took a step back, poised to jump. I felt how cold the ground was beneath my socked feet, which made me pause for only a moment, but it was enough time for Hannah to go under again. I lost her. I scanned the water, then caught sight of a dark figure. I wasn’t sure if I was seeing a shadow or an underwater rock or her body. “Do you see her?” I demanded. Priya was useless, sobbing and shaking.  Then, around the edges of the Hannah-shaped blot, I saw a black, shifting form that slithered through the water like heavy fog. The shadow slunk forward, somewhere between a liquid and a solid, before coming together and opening its great webbed arms behind her. The air grew thick and murky and there was a sudden dank-earth smell. There is no way for me to describe it now—it’s like describing the particular smell of a house you no longer live in—as clear and distinct as a fingerprint but you only know it when it’s around you. I’d smelled it before, all those years ago. The fear I felt was beyond fear. It was fear that the bottom fell off of.  Later, after Priya’s desperate call to the police, and the officers’ embarrassed questions, and the rescue boat and the divers and the condescending explanations about currents and riverbeds and tides, I asked Priya if she saw the thing in the water, the thing that wrapped its arms around Hannah. And Priya admitted that she may have seen something, but she was sure it was only a reflection or maybe a refraction of light. I asked her if she smelled him, and she looked at me with such deep concern that I dropped that line of inquiry.  Four days later, a water taxi driver leaned over the side of his boat during low tide and saw my sister’s body below him. In the great sorrow of that day, I lost my sense of caution and I pressed the matter again with Priya, asking what exactly she thought she’d seen that night. She snapped, “This is crazy. You think it was your childhood monster? It was nothing.”  But I’d recognized the long arms and the wing-like flaps and the sidling, confident movement. I know that I’d caught, once more, a glimpse of what it is that comes to take us away.  For years, the cloak of grief held me under its damp, pressing weight, and the only time I ever felt alert was in the archives at the library or deep in the world of a book. Talking to Priya or my parents or the throngs of school children I was expected to usher through the library collection was like interacting through muslin. I studied every detail of Hannah’s drowning, turning my memory of it inside out. Not only the what-ifs of what might have happened if I’d jumped in or the unanswerable questions around what caused the fall, but also how high the moon was, how fraught the sea. How the leafless bushes had held onto their winterberries. How the staccato thump of the waves against the seawall resembled the trapdoors in our arteries opening and closing. I tried to recall precisely that peculiar dusky smell and the way the air thickened and cracked open and the feeling that bloomed in my chest the moment I knew Hannah had passed through. This is all I can tell you. Like all stories about death, you’re left with the survivor’s incomplete tale.  Only recently have I been able to lend my attention more fully to the details of the present world. And I notice, sometimes, just before I fall asleep or when the motion-activated lights in the library archive go out, a certain flicker of movement and then a feeling of airlessness. And it’s like, if I didn’t want to, I wouldn’t have to breathe. And I wonder why the connection that passed between Hannah and me all our lives, which was the pride of our bohemian mother and the unease of our cautious father and as normal to us as eating or drinking, would be severed by death. In the darkness, I open myself up.

"religious miracle","1823-04-02","Not Discerned","{""Fayette"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T22:10:08","Another note, inspired by John W . Welch, et al., eds., Knowing Why: 137 Evidences That the Book of Mormon Is True (American Fork: Covenant Communications, 2017), and very relevant to the two Interpreter articles that I mentioned in my blog entry for last Friday:  “What Is It to Speak with the Tongue of Angels?” (143-145)  2 Nephi 32:2 seems to suggest an implicit doctrine of human deification in the Book of Mormon — a text from which, critics have alleged, the Nauvoo-period teaching of human exaltation is wholly absent.  To this, I would add 3 Nephi 28:10, where the Nephite disciples are promised that “ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one.”  In an analogy to the transitive property of equivalence known from mathematics — according to which, if a=b and b=c, it follows necessarily that a=c — if the disciples will be like the Son, and the Son is like the Father, the disciples will be like the Father.  If one is in just the right mood, the Peterson Obsession Board can be a weirdly amusing place, as well as a psychologically fascinating one. In recent days, the PO Board has taken predictably negative note of the Interpreter Foundation’s current film project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (See the photographs accompanying this blog entry, as well as those featured here, here, and here.)  Jeff Bradshaw, who serves as the Interpreter Foundation’s director of special projects and on its board, conceived the idea of a film project devoted to the emergence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the DR Congo. His fondness for the area and the stories of the Saints there comes naturally to him; between July 2016 and September 2019, he and his wife Kathleen served missions first in the Democratic Republic of Congo Kinshasa Mission office and then in the DR Congo Kinshasa Temple. He is back in the Congo at the moment, along with Russell Richins and James Jordan, who previously served as, among other things, respectively the producer and associate producer of the Interpreter Foundation projects Robert Cundick: A Sacred Service of Music, and Witnesses, and Undaunted: Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, as well as the Foundation’s short Insights videos.  We have enough money behind the project to do the filming there in the Congo, but have not as yet raised the money for post-production (e.g., editing the raw footage, adding music, dubbing, and the like). There is no plan to take the films to theaters but, otherwise, we haven’t decided how to distribute them. Perhaps the most likely scenario is simply posting them online and making them available online, as we did with Robert Cundick: A Sacred Service of Music. We have never seen them as a source of revenue; instead, they represent the sort of thing for which we use whatever revenue we generate (which comes mostly in the form of donations). We think that the story and the stories of the Congolese Saints are worth telling, and worthy of the attention of other members of the Church.  As seen from the perspective of the PO Board, though, our effort to make a series of short films about the Church and its members in the DR Congo is an “incredibly smelly” exercise in “colonialism.” It’s also “incredibly slimy.” We’re using people there as mere “props” in order to tell a faith-promoting story. (It’s their story, of course, so I’m at a bit of a loss to know how we would be able to tell their story without featuring any people in it.) Our project is mere “exploitation and priestcraft.” Our interviews of Congolese members are actually “interrogations” and “lectures.”  This is all “disturbing” to posters on the PO Board, “if not outright distasteful.” “Distasteful at best, and connivingly racist at worst.” Interpreter is on “exceptionally thin ice” with all this, because the Foundation is “exploiting” impoverished Africans for “propaganda” purposes. One commenter describes himself as feeling “unsettled” about this horrible affair, and “uncomfortable” about the fact that, unlike the denizens of the PO Board, the poor Congolese have no idea what kind of horrible people are now seeking to “exploit” them. (The verb to exploit shows up repeatedly in comments on our film project.)  The photos that I’ve shared here, says my Malevolent Stalker, glorify “leering” white males. In fact, notes another member of the PO Board, there is a distinct lack of adult male Congolese in the photos that I’ve shared — except, I suppose, for the blind tailor pictured in one of them, the jeep driver Léon, and Elder Willy Sabwe Binene and Elder Ndalamba Ilunga of the Third Quorum of the Seventy, and others — indicating to folks on the PO Board that the Church is enjoying very little success among men in the Congo. (Apparently, they’re under the impression that the photos I’ve shared heretofore offer a representative demographic sample of Congolese Church membership — which, on that assumption, appears to be mostly made up of young children.)  Damnably, Interpreter’s visiting trio of filmmakers is building no homes for people in the Congo during its roughly three-week stint there, providing no meals or clean water, nor even teaching any Church classes. “The apologists aren’t even bothering to claim that they’re doing something good for the people of the DRC.” With regard to the film project, they’re just “fooling around with drones” and, well, using that drone and their other equipment to gather footage for a set of films.  And what is Interpreter’s end goal? It is to “exploit” Africans in order to secure lucrative donations for the Foundation and, ultimately, pour moi. And, of course, to pay for our forthcoming “anti-Community of Christ Brigham Young biopic.”  One commenter at the PO Board tried a couple of times to push gently back against some of these accusations. When viewed in the context of Africa’s historic experiences with such violent phenomena as Arab imperialism and subsequent European colonialism, he observed, Interpreter’s little film project seems “comparatively benign.” I thought that concession remarkably generous of him: Our greed-driven brutality will be fairly limited.  But the bottom line, most others agreed — and “bottom line” is very much the appropriate phrase here — is that both the Church and the Interpreter Foundation are “exploiting a foreign people for financial gain.” The Church’s “business model” for Africa is a form of “neocolonialism”: It is using BYU Pathways and the Perpetual Education Fund in order to secure cheap local education for Africans. And that sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, it isn’t! The Church wants them to gain educations so that they can eventually occupy elite positions in business and government in such a way that the Church will accumulate power and influence. (One respondent grudgingly allows that the Church might be benefiting the Congolese a little bit. But he immediately points out that Mussolini supposedly made the trains run on time, and that even the Ku Klux Klan may have done some good somewhere, sometime.) The Church is setting up “franchise locations” so that it can harvest tithes from Africa that it can then feed into Ensign Peak Advisors back in Utah — which seems to be the very “definition of colonialism.” This is “so the poor church doesn’t starve to death in Salt Lake City.” And the Interpreter Foundation is following the Church’s wicked model: Our movie effort is “a purely ‘extractive’ project,” in which we’re “rolling in, filming some videos, and then heading back to the US to try and use the footage to milk donations out of people.”  PO Board commenters grant that the Church has expressed disapproval of the customary African practice of dowries, which tend to oppress young Africans economically and to discourage marriage and family formation. But don’t get carried away! This is not because the Church suddenly cares about marriage and families. No, the real motivation is that President Nelson and his cronies dislike the idea that all that dowry money stays local. Instead, they want it to come to the Church via tithing. Sure, the Church might invest a few “pennies” in Africa in order to get things going there, as seed money, but what Church leaders want is a “sustainable investment.” And “success,” as viewed from Salt Lake City, means a flow of tithes to Utah and, most importantly, to Ensign Peak Advisors. It is, plainly, “imperialism.” And, likewise, “The Interpreter Foundation is using the Congolese people to make a quick buck.” My own time, in fact, is dedicated to scheming about how to “extract the maximum dollar amount from prospective donors.”  One side issue, though: P.O. Board members want to know why I’m not there in the Congo. Hmmm? Inquiring minds, and all that. But, in fact, minds on the PO Board already know: It’s not because I’m not a professional filmmaker and would be essentially useless there. It’s not because my spoken French is, at best, mediocre. (By contrast, in addition to his two French-speaking missions in the Congo, Jeff Bradshaw served his first mission as a young man in France and Belgium and, subsequently, lived twice with his family in France.) It’s because the rural Congo lacks the five-star accommodations and dining that I require. This is “about DCP gorging himself on beef pizza or washing down two orders of tikka masala with a diet soda.”  Bad enough, you think? Ah, but it’s far worse even than that. Why am I not in the Congo? “It is,” says my Malevolent Stalker, “impossible to escape the racial implications here.” (He’s probably quite right that it’s impossible for him, at least, not to detect “racial implications here.” After all, it’s what he does.) “Has DCP traveled to any predominantly Black country?” he asks. (The answer, by the way, is Yes. And I loved both trips. I wonder whether my Malevolent Stalker has spent any time in majority-Black countries.)  But here is the really pressing question: What will the Interpreter Foundation do with the massive profits that will somehow accrue from our short Congo-related videos? Will we donate even a tiny portion of our treasure hoard to the Congolese Latter-day Saints that we’re exploiting? “I think,” says one PO Board participant who has specialized for years in making up defamatory fictions about me, “the more likely outcome is that 100% of the money they make on this project will be used for DCP’s travel, meals and his anti-Community of Christ film, 6 Days in August.”  Of course, responds Kerry Shirts, another PO Board stalwart, “if DCP donates a laptop and a few pencils, and a few scratch pads of paper, it will be outdoing the donations of the church.”  Curious, I spent about fifteen seconds this afternoon in the relevant subfolder of the Christopher Hitchens Memorial “How Religion Poisons Everything” File™, and I came up with these four irrefutable confirmations of Mr. Shirts’s claim:  “LDS Charities $1M in Aid Will Help Those Suffering in DR Congo Crisis: Donation hits milestone with United Nations’ World Food Programme” (2018)  “Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Eliminated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Latter-day Saint Charities participates with partners in global effort” (2019)  “Church Gives Supplies to War Victims in Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo: One of the 12,000 grateful recipients remarked the donation ‘has given us back a smile and hope that we lost for a while.’” (2022)  “Church Joins Forces with Catholic Relief Services and Caritas to Help Refugees in Eastern DR Congo” (2023)  There are probably other stories that I might have found, but these four should suffice for weighing the reliability of Mr. Shirts’s allegation.  Neither the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints nor the Interpreter Foundation has ever viewed the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a lucrative source of wealth — except in the sense that its people are children of God and, in themselves, a treasure beyond price. The Church’s investments in regional temples and meetinghouses, its educational expenditures, and its humanitarian efforts are given in imitation of the Savior, “who went about doing good” (Acts 10:38), and not with any eye to financial payback. (Church leaders would be crazy, as well as evil, to seek to profit from the Congolese Latter-day Saints.) Similarly, the Interpreter Foundation wants to preserve the stories of the Saints in the Congo because we value them as our brothers and sisters. We have no plan to make a buck, whether quick or otherwise, by “exploiting” them, and we have no way to do so. The very accusation, I think, tells a great deal about those who level it against us.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdGhlb3MuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2RhbnBldGVyc29uLzIwMjMvMDUvaGVhcnRzLW9mLWRhcmtuZXNzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1979-10-13","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-22T10:00:00","Music has its seasons, and people have their needs. At some point in the autumn of 1979, I became obsessed with a few bars of Mozart. I was thirteen, fundamentally cheerful but convinced I was fundamentally melancholy, and ravenous for all the music I could get my hands on, especially music that made me tearful. My father, a man who in later life would think nothing of driving forty miles on his own to hear Bach or Beethoven, had recently seen the English pianist Clifford Curzon in concert, playing Mozart’s last piano concerto, No. 27 (K. 595). I didn’t know the piece, but I knew about Curzon. My father collected pianists and their performances. Curzon had studied with Artur Schnabel and Wanda Landowska, and, above all, Curzon was English, and in those days you could feel almost patriotic about famous English musicians.  We had an LP of the concerto (I don’t recall the pianist, but it wasn’t Curzon, an intensely self-critical performer who didn’t release a version in his lifetime), and I started listening to it. I discounted the first movement, with its gracious and sprightly tunes, the piano scampering around the orchestral parts with the usual firm joy of Mozart—far too happy for me. The third movement was a dance, a 6/8 romp. But the slow movement, the Larghetto, that was what I needed. The piano opens the movement on its own, a four-bar melody of mournful beauty. It sounds stark, exposed, almost tentative. Insistent, too, because we will hear it ten times in this short movement. Thirty or so bars in, the piano finishes this first tune, and the orchestra bursts into a loud tutti. For a moment, the sound is a little boilerplate—a stately cadence unfolds, violins trilling as the basses make their moves up through A-flat and B-flat on their way back to the tonic of E-flat. It’s pretty and restrained, reminiscent of Handel. But then! Mozart, ruler of repetition, brings back the cadence, now with the second violins doing a gorgeous arpeggiated run underneath; and then he brings it back a third time, enriched now by surging mixtures of woodwind and horns. Suddenly, what had seemed formulaic is beautiful almost beyond bearing. But he isn’t quite done. A few minutes later, toward the end of the movement, Mozart returns to the same sequence, this time giving the arpeggiated run to the pianist, surely aware that this twining filigree was the real beauty, holding together all the other assembled beauties.  I dropped the stylus onto the same grooves again and again, and the passage was shimmeringly installed in my mind, to play at will. It fed my sentimental adolescent needs. (It would be embarrassing to mention which pop songs of that era performed a similar function, although, of all composers, Mozart, the machinist of popular arias, would likely be the most forgiving.) It’s a moving sequence, and I’m still unable to hear that crush of notes without emotion. But I am struck now by what I chose not to hear. Is the Larghetto mournful, really? Or does it enact something more paradoxical than that—a kind of proud dismay? That passage still provokes my tears, but they are not of grief so much as of gratitude, tears while smiling. Perhaps, then, it is the perfection of this beauty that moves me, with no specific emotion expressed by the notes themselves? The music surges romantically in a falling cascade but is actually stepping with deliberation toward the tidy inevitability of its so-called perfect cadence. To that cadence, the most formulaic of all in classical music, Mozart was almost fanatically drawn, and particularly to the rising journey of his basses up to the tonic; again and again in his work, he finds different ways to ornament the rightness of this homecoming. Yet, if he loves coming back, how he also loves to wander away! I hadn’t bothered with the first movement of this concerto, but it unfolds a wild and complex development section—that region where the music seems to be going for a bit of a tonal stroll—as he experimentally cycles through different keys, speedily trying them on and discarding them like the acquisitive dandy he was, at the average rate of about one key every two bars.  Beethoven and Mozart are the composers most mansioned in myth; contemporary scholarship has worked hard to blow these palaces down without evicting the presiding geniuses. No, there’s no real evidence that Salieri was jealous of Mozart (in this period, Salieri was a successful and established composer), or that Salieri poisoned his brilliant competitor (in different eras, the Freemasons and the Jews were also blamed for Mozart’s untimely death). Yes, Mozart could be childish, and he loved the scatological—his letters are outrageous—but he was not the “eternal child” of Romantic construction or of the movie “Amadeus,” the fizzing prodigy of heedless all-nighters and instant overtures. He had money worries and mysterious debts, but there was nothing especially painful or ominous about 1791, the last year of his life. It was lucrative and busier than ever: into this period he packed the unfinished Requiem, two operas (“The Magic Flute,” “La Clemenza di Tito”), the Clarinet Concerto, and of course the Piano Concerto No. 27, which used to be moistly admired for its “quality of farewell” but which, in fact, seems tender and resolute.  The Best Books We Read This Week Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.  Doubtless, Mozart’s sheer prodigiousness will always invite us to do what Kierkegaard called playing “the game of marveling at world-history.” He is a marvel. He was already a marvel at the age of six, when, in September, 1762, he left his native city, Salzburg, for Vienna, accompanied by his father, Leopold, and his musically talented older sister, Nannerl. He would be paraded as a divine freak of nature, a kind of reverse Kaspar Hauser, tested and examined wherever he performed. In Vienna, before the Empress Maria Theresa, he played virtuosically even when a cloth was thrown over the keyboard. When, the next year, he set out for Paris with his father, he began a travelling tour that lasted for the next three and a half years. In London, where he stayed more than a year, a lawyer and amateur scientist named Daines Barrington asked the eight-year-old to sight-read some music, and then challenged him to compose two different pieces, a song of love and a song of rage. Barrington presented his findings to the Royal Society: genius certified. The boy wrote his first symphony at eight, his first opera at twelve. Twenty years later, in 1788, he wrote his last three symphonies, Nos. 39, 40, and 41, in a single summer. Fifteen piano concertos were dashed off between 1782 and 1786. His surviving manuscripts are, for the most part, remarkably clean.  “Houston, we have a drinking problem.” Cartoon by Matthew Diffee Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop  Modern commentary, rightly complicating the narrative of easy and childlike genius, often emphasizes the “trade” aspect of composition and performance in Mozart’s day: the wrangling, the compromising, the jobbing. “Mozart in Motion” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), by the English poet Patrick Mackie, offers an exemplary intervention in this kind of cultural critique. Mozart lived at a time when composers tended to write a great deal, very fast. Like modern songwriters, they relied on conventional hooks and patterns. Aria writers like Mozart regularly collaborated with their singers; and, like modern entertainers, they were happy to leave music open to the controlled hazard of onstage improvisation. (When Mozart, the greatest master of keyboard improvisation before Beethoven, performed the premières of his own piano concertos, which was most of the time, he might leave the piano part blank, or provide only a suggestive bass pattern.) In an age when there was often little time for even a single run-through, orchestral players had to be excellent sight readers. The modern concert, with its religious silence and attention, did not yet exist; audience members came and went, chatted and flirted, ate and played cards, noisily demanded and received encores. In Mozart’s day, Vienna had no dedicated concert hall. The composer was simultaneously his own performer, conductor, band manager, agent.  And yet our understanding of these conditions makes the mysteries only more acute. How was this quantity of unworldly and imperishable music achieved in such conditions? The endlessly prolific pinnacles seem all the more astonishing, all the more unreachable, in our era of padded fellowships. George Steiner used to be aghast that we now possess the cheap freedom to listen to a difficult late Beethoven string quartet while eating our breakfast. Surely the miracle is that composers like Bach and Mozart might have written such work while eating their breakfast. There’s plenty more where this came from, they seem to be saying, in their every bar.  Mackie’s book nicely balances the proper spiritual astonishment with the proper cultural curiosity, as he goes about chronicling Mozart’s life through a series of celebrated works—among them the Sinfonia Concertante, the Fantasia in C Minor, the last three symphonies, and, above all, “The Marriage of Figaro” and “Don Giovanni.” Essentially, he describes a Mozart of contradiction and doubleness, a composer who was eager to please his audiences and who, at the same time, pushed his work into experiment and risk—a kind of spy in the corridors of the Enlightenment. For Mackie, there’s something marvellously unstable in his music, in its “gift for prophesying the future even while it was pleasing the present.” His music superbly repackaged the era’s most virtuous self-descriptions—clarity, symmetry, wit, light—only to add an unstoppable surplus: a torrential refinement, a remarkable inwardness. This conception of Mozart may sound a little abstract and overweening, and at times it can be; I wasn’t always convinced by Mackie’s claims, or always able to hear exactly what he describes. It’s one thing to assert, for instance, that Mozart’s piano concertos and symphonies “can reveal themselves as brilliantly flexible narratives of errancy and homecoming”; it’s another to go on to insist that they “can amount indeed to existential allegories of the fates of psyches and societies pitched into change.” The first insight comes from a critic who is reading music as narrative; the second from a critic who is reading music as cultural allegory.  But at his best Mackie is a sensitive and highly intelligent appraiser of musical form, with a gift for analyzing Mozart’s music as the dynamic enactment—rather than the simple expression—of larger cultural and biographical energies. Take his stirring account of Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 8 in A Minor (K. 310). In September, 1777, Mozart and his mother left Salzburg for Paris. For the young composer, now twenty-one, the expedition was another installment in his tortuous lifelong quest for commissions and regular employment. He had been working since the age of seventeen as a court musician, a favored functionary, in Salzburg; he disliked his employer, the enlightened but haughty Archbishop Colloredo. So Paris beckoned—salons, lucrative connections, a worldly, almost overdeveloped musical scene, and the last fumes of Diderot and Rousseau. Here he planned to make his mark as composer and performer, spinning riches from dazzled auditors. In fact, the trip was a terrible failure. Mozart was a poor self-promoter, quickly soured on his hosts, and complained about the smugness and musical indifference of Parisian society. Far worse, his mother died in the city in July, 1778, and Mozart had to write to his father in Salzburg with the shocking news. (The manipulative Leopold characteristically blamed his son for her death.)  But out of this abjection came one of Mozart’s most ravishing and radical piano works, the Sonata in A Minor, a piece that looks back to Bach (to my ears, the slow movement sounds at times like one of Bach’s more inquisitive chorale preludes, sometimes close to the richly ornamented BWV 641) and forward to Beethoven and even to Brahms (the amazing last movement spins away into unaccountable realms). People profess to hear Mozart’s filial grief in the dissonance and stark solitude of the sonata’s slow movement; some pianists play it swooningly slowly, though Dinu Lipatti, in the fabled last recital of his life, went through it briskly, with an even-tempered levity that seems closer to the spirit of the piece. Mackie avoids the easy biographical inference, and instead situates the sonata in the context of Mozart’s fraught relations with his patrons and auditors. He starts by picturing the provincial wunderkind in the great French metropolis. Was he a “masterful virtuoso on tour,” or just “a young man in need of a job”? A savant or a servant? He tells us about when Mozart was asked to play in grand rooms on the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where the Duchesse de Chabot and her friends treated him like the help, and continued with their drawing class.  This sonata, Mackie argues, is Mozart’s sly revenge both on his wealthy audience and on the need to court such people. It doesn’t officially break away from the aural world of the salon, but “no one could ever really mistake it for background music.” He writes well about the speedy harmonic ideas of the quick first movement, the stark but sweet inwardness of the slow movement (“the notes create space around themselves”), and the way that the final presto slides away “from anything that its audience can have expected,” dancing in a kind of tranced perpetuum mobile until the whole piece comes to an abrupt halt, as if the irritated composer were stubbornly working on the clock, and had simply timed out. Mackie claims that the music is uncertain about whom it wants as an audience; he calls the piece a “bitter hymn to the inevitability of artistic solitude.”  I thought these claims a bit far-fetched at first, maybe just a more academic way of smuggling romantic biographical inference back into the music—not the grieving Mozart, now, but the struggling one. That suspicion wasn’t helped by Mackie’s tendency to overreach: by the end of the chapter, the A-Minor Sonata is being lauded for an almost Hegelian ability “to suggest a version of modern culture capable of declaring its bleakest losses and uncertainties even while it maintains the most radiant surfaces.” But, casting around on YouTube for live performances of this piece, I came across an unwitting enactment of Mackie’s argument. In the center of a huge, empty, high-ceilinged room of the kind Mozart must have played in, with a massive glittering chandelier asserting itself over the piano, Daniel Barenboim sits, dressed in a tailcoat and gray foulard as if auditioning for “Amadeus.” He plays the A-Minor Sonata finely, of course. But now, thanks to Mackie, I could picture Mozart wreaking his revenge in Paris. Barenboim’s isolation at the piano represents our culture’s hushed devotion to the sacrality of the solo recital. But, when Mozart sat at the keyboard in a Paris salon, was anyone actually listening, and what did people comprehend, anyway? And might Mozart, in the midst of a busy room, not have felt more solitary than Barenboim in the midst of an empty one?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9tb3phcnQtaW4tbW90aW9uLWhpcy13b3JrLWFuZC1oaXMtd29ybGQtaW4tcGllY2VzLXBhdHJpY2stbWFja2llLWJvb2stcmV2aWV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Every few seconds an aeronautical sound-wave would suction the still desert air and a jet engine enclosed in insect skin, piloted by an international sporting celebrity whose face was impossible to see, zoomed by just long enough to hold a flickering perception of the vehicle’s brief physical presence. The brain-pinching whoosh entered through the right ear long before its origin appeared; by the time the whoosh exited the left ear its source was already deep into the unknowable frontier that lay beyond Turn 1. The smell of perfume overwhelmed whatever faint suggestion of combusting organic matter accidentally floated up to the loggia. It was a specifically Saudi perfume, arboreal instead of florid, and like the race car exhaust it had the nose-flooding sweetness of something burning.  The men all wore the perfume, and they were dressed almost exactly the same, in ankle-length, button-up white robes and red-on-white checkerboard headdresses held in place by a scalp-hugging black ring. One of the men I met, I was told, controlled $6 billion in real estate and commercial assets. Another was the son of a very senior diplomat, a man responsible for cutting deals with various problematic neighboring states.  Thanks to one such agreement, a Chinese-negotiated thaw in relations with Iran announced just eight days earlier, there would be no repeat of the ugliness surrounding last year’s grand prix, when Iranian-backed militants launched missiles at Jeddah shortly before the race and nearly succeeded in canceling it. The peace dividend was right here at the Paddock Club—I was told Will Smith was somewhere nearby. A white man with a sweater tied around his neck looked especially lost. Most of the white people on hand, like the European wagyu-slicers and the pair of young blond hostesses speaking Russian to one another, were there to wait on the Saudis, who might have traveled to Sochi or Monaco for an event like this before the race premiered in 2021.  In another reversal of decades of national precedent, the Saudi women were dressed with far greater individuality than the men. Their hair was often worn in long black tresses that streamed below the shoulders of tastefully concealing gowns. In a not-so-distant past, a pricey handbag was a Saudi woman’s only means of flaunting any higher status in public, a realm she could only enter when covered head-to-toe in a black abaya. The abayas are optional now, as are the hijabs. “We’d never imagined we’d be here from five years ago,” said Tala al Jabri, a Riyadh-based and U.S.-educated investor in Saudi-based tech startups, who, like most of the other younger women on hand, looked like she was dressed for a cold day in Beverly Hills.  Among the identically costumed men there is still a Saudi vision of egalitarianism on display, one that obscures everyone’s role and wealth in order to maintain a hierarchical reality. In photos on display at the Murabba Palace museum in Riyadh, King Abdulaziz, also known as Ibn Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, is dressed in almost the same robes as his servants. Abdulaziz and his six successors are buried in graves that are nearly unmarked and barely ever visited, in accordance with Salafi practice.  2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, JeddahAndrea Bruce  Saudi-style equality—namely, the equality of shared subjecthood, applicable to royals and commoners alike—reigns in one other obvious way at the Paddock Club. No amount of money or power will buy you a single drop of alcohol. “The beer is coming,” an official assured me as we drank guava juice out of sleek glass stemware. “We need it for business, for tourists.” The possible introduction of alcohol into a conservative tribal monarchy of 35 million whose government is responsible for overseeing the two holiest sites in Islam seems a prospect with no easily predictable outcome. But my interlocutor, like the government he worked for, was confident in his read of the current national mentality. “Most Saudis are convinced the alcohol ban is not for a religious reason,” he claimed. “In some schools of Islam, under 5% [alcohol by volume] is acceptable.”  The question of just how much change the Saudi crown can declare without threatening the integrity of the system it built has been dramatically answered in recent years. Since 2016, the palace, under the leadership of 37-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely referred to as MBS, has embarked on a bold program of social and economic reform. As Syria and Libya burned, ISIS consolidated control of northern Iraq, and the Egyptian military crushed the country’s brief spell of elected Muslim Brotherhood rule, Saudi women saw the rapid disappearance of such mainstays of national policy as the driving ban, compulsory hijab, male guardianship laws, and employment prohibitions. A nationwide ban on cinemas was lifted in 2018. The once-ubiquitous religious police still technically exist, but they are almost never seen in public anymore and have lost all of their formal powers. Saudi Arabia no longer exports fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam, long its state ideology, and has largely ceased the promotion of Wahhabism even within its own borders. The country began offering tourist visas for the first time in 2019, reversing a long-standing official fear of the contaminations of the outside world.  The palace has courted even greater dangers in the economic realm. The government introduced a value-added tax, essentially the first tax regime in the country’s history, and then raised the rate from 3% to as much as 15% while slashing subsidies on energy and food. The government’s sovereign wealth fund has led a massive shift in state investments, pivoting the public sector away from its usual focus on extractive industries and into new realms like tourism, real estate development, entertainment, logistics, and hazily innovation-related projects involving things like cryptocurrency trading and the construction of a cube-shaped Sim City arcology in central Riyadh.  Old trading families and the once-influential import sector have lost much of their former prominence. “Economic power in the private sector is changing hands,” explained Mohamed Alyahya, a Saudi political commentator and fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.  The days of the palace using endless supplies of oil money and religious conservatism to drug Saudis into a mutually reinforcing culture of indolence and obedience are over. Share →︎ Twitter Facebook Email Print Link Copied link  MBS’s reforms, whose effects are plainly visible in every area of Saudi life, amount to a wholesale rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract. The days of the palace using endless supplies of oil money and religious conservatism to drug Saudis into a mutually reinforcing culture of indolence and obedience are over. In its place, the population is now meant to derive its sense of direction and meaning from a rebooted idea of Saudiness, while its wealth will now come from exciting new economic sectors. It will be possible for the government to create these sectors now that it has purged the kleptomania of the former order, mostly through the detainment of over 400 allegedly corrupt members of the royal family at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in late 2018.  With many of the old subsidies and handouts eliminated, the relationship between the state, the subject, and the market is no longer mediated through oil-financed social bribery: “It is a big mind-shift we’re trying to induce, of becoming productive citizens,” explained a young Saudi woman who worked on the reform package during her career as a private consultant, and is now studying for a graduate degree in the United States. “A productivity mindset, which is the essence of the vision, has been achieved,” she claimed.  The population has thus far accepted MBS’s changes with astounding equanimity—a possible result of having been trained for decades in obedience. There have been no tax riots or bread riots. There was no visible rearguard action by the old order, or at least none that inflamed or incited any divisions within society at large. Saudis went to work as shopkeepers and Uber drivers with little apparent complaint—not that public complaining is socially tolerated or even all that legal in Saudi Arabia—with some treating participation in the new economy as a kind of patriotic duty.  MBS is gambling that the fruits of openness and modernity can be reaped on Saudi terms, and that prosperity, stability, and a recharged, secularized sense of national purpose won’t shatter existing norms or generate dangerous civic appetites. The reforms have created a rising class of ambitious executives, entrepreneurs, and artists, and for now almost everyone seems to accept the idea of a national horizon defined by the wisdom and vision of a single family, and perhaps even a single man. His program has created an atmosphere muggy with floating potential, as the palace carries out an uncertain experiment on tens of millions of people. MBS’s subjects could be the engine and the beneficiaries of the only successful 21st-century governance project in any populous Middle Eastern state—or they could mark the disastrous limits of utopia declared from on high.  The young former consultant who worked on the reforms described them as “fast-paced social nudges, rather than shocks.” Some nudges are less subtle than others, and one of them comes in the form of a vast and mostly empty construction site surrounding an isolated gray slab south of the Jeddah race track. “Here they are building the world’s tallest tower,” a young government official told me, referring to the slab. “Here is the megaproject, downtown Jeddah. It is one of the five megaprojects.”  The word “megaproject” fails to fully capture the awesome scope of reform-era Saudi ambition. Saudi Arabia has become perhaps the only country on earth where the term “gigaproject” is employed without irony. Behind the future downtown was a glorious sunset, yellow fire turning palm trees into arching shadows, with the light breaking through a sky of soft neon blue. There were no human beings anywhere near the deserted base of the future tower, in the empty center of a city of nearly 4 million.  Who will live and work in this high-rising city-within-a-city an hour-and-a-half from Mecca and 10 minutes from the excitement and inconvenience of an annual Formula 1 grand prix? The answer, broadly speaking, is young Saudis, the roughly 40% of the country that’s under the age of 25. “This is going to have a very young population,” promised one official who showed off a model of Diriyah, a city-size planned sector of Riyadh built in traditional clay-colored crenelated north Arabian architecture. If completed, Diriyah will have 500 times the square footage of Manhattan’s Hudson Yards project.  Significant portions of Diriyah, including an attractive dining and retail district opposite the ruins of Turaif, the place where the Saud dynasty was launched in the 18th century, have already been built. The neighborhood-in-progress is where nationalism, development, and high-end consumption have already merged into a tangible whole. An Ivy League-educated Saudi financier in his mid-20s I met suspected that 10 years from now most of his social circle will have relocated to Neom, the futuristic megacity-by-decree planned for an empty stretch of Red Sea coastline 100 miles south of Eilat.  ‘In a not-so-distant past, a pricey handbag was a Saudi woman’s only means of flaunting any higher status in public, a realm she could only enter when covered head-to-toe in a black abaya’Andrea Bruce  There have also been policy “nudges”: For instance, the Saudi government has implemented a new requirement that any company whose largest regional client is the Saudi state must have its Middle East headquarters somewhere inside of Saudi Arabia itself, which is part of a broader attempt to force large corporate offices to relocate from the United Arab Emirates. Other nudges have come in the form of capital, much of it from the government’s $620 billion Public Investment Fund. In another bid to keep young people engaged and employed, the state has taken a marked interest in every manner of tech play, pouring money into online retail and ride-sharing. The Central Bank has started its own “fintech sandbox,” which will make it easier for nontraditional financial institutions to operate in the country, explained Tala al Jabri, the startup investor. “I would not be investing in startups if I didn’t think they had a culture to disrupt markets,” she said as we both ignored the action below us on the Corniche Circuit. “Startups believe the government has their back,” al Jabri continued. “They think they can succeed because they think the government wants them to succeed.”  Many of the big winners of the reforms are private companies working in sectors that the government now prioritizes. This includes defense manufacturing. When I met Hmoud Alshethre, the youthful and modest executive director of alliances at the Riyadh offices of Intra Defense Technologies, he was dressed in the standard-issue white robe, with a model of a handheld drone perched behind him. A succession of large, white South African men came in to briefly interrupt a generously long discussion held over dates, nuts, and an endless supply of lightly spiced Gulf-style coffee. Intra’s small unmanned aircraft can survey the country’s isolated desert frontiers and oil pipelines, which are often the targets of Iranian-backed sabotage.  “We have a very reasonable government here,” Alshethre explained. The ultimate proof of the government’s “reasonableness,” in Alshethre’s telling, was that it had sensed an incipient popular urge for a different kind of life: The reforms are working, he said, because “people are willing to change.” As evidence, he showed me a government smartphone app called Tawakalna, which aggregates every imaginable official document and service. Tawakalna lists your passport information, traffic violations, and vehicular paperwork; the ownership of a car can be transferred through the app, as can power of attorney and commercial registrations. It has copies of your birth certificate and your real estate deeds, your health information, your international travel record, and a digital kiblah for locating the direction of Mecca during prayer. This is a level of government power over the individual that few democratic citizens would tolerate, merged with a logic and seamlessness that few democratic governments seem capable of delivering these days.  But the most important thing about Tawakalna is that it proved Saudis could rapidly accept a digitally based and state-controlled civic existence. “The government could launch an app and assure that 80% of the population would use it,” Alshethre claimed.  Citizens in a democracy, including the elected leadership, must resign themselves to the wondrous and horrible reality that public space is basically unmanageable, and that the state probably can’t forcibly eliminate things one might think are unspeakably evil, like gun ownership or abortion or the fentanyl trade. The Saudi government takes the opposite approach: The state exerts a tight grip over the public realm while respecting its subjects’ traditional sovereignty over the home. Private spaces are still considered sacrosanct—the police don’t go hunting for alcohol or sexual deviancy beyond locked doors, and unless you’re a jihadist, there is no Mukhabarat that seeks to penetrate the inner spaces of your true self. “There are consequences for expression here,” as one Riyadh intellectual put it, “but not for thought. You can think whatever you want.”  Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t pretend to be a Jeffersonian democrat, and nobody pretends to have voted for him. Share →︎ Twitter Facebook Email Print Link Copied link  The system’s essential clarity explains why the Saudi leadership is so convinced that the population will continue to trust in its guidance and vision even as society becomes freer and more exposed to the outside world. There is mass deception at work in most autocracies, which retain the ceremonies of democratic procedure and other performances of civic openness in order to hide which section of the regime or the security services actually holds power—or to create the constant sense of terror that comes with living in a place where the rules are strategically obscured. There are no comparable lies at play in Saudi Arabia, according to Alyahya. “Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t pretend to be a Jeffersonian democrat, and nobody pretends to have voted for him,” he explained.  The system functions not only because of what it can provide, but because the expectations and lines of authority are so clear. They have only gotten clearer lately. I asked Tariq Alhomayed, the former editor of the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper and a host on Saudi television, about what first made him think the reforms weren’t an illusion or a ploy. There was the consistency of the government’s messaging, Alhomayed replied, along with the speed of new development projects. “But the main thing was the Ritz,” he said.  In the fall of 2018, the new crown prince detained 400 of his relatives at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh and pressured nearly all of them to turn over billions of dollars that they had allegedly embezzled from the state. At the time, the Ritz gambit seemed like an arbitrary and maniacal power grab. But much was accomplished. MBS broke the old economic elite, allowing a new one to arise in its place. The Ritz was part of the crown’s indigenization push: The crackdown fell hardest on figures who had expatriated the people’s wealth, spending their money on yachts and fancy real estate far beyond the kingdom’s borders.  The Ritz gambit showed that the crown prince could act decisively against perceived enemies, including within his own family. Some of them had publicly aligned with U.S. intelligence agencies that saw the reforms as a threat to their own longstanding, quasi-corrupt relationships inside the kingdom. The Ritz also encapsulated the sensitivity to the public psyche that has made the reforms so risky and yet successful so far: MBS was announcing to his subjects that their own government had been stealing from them for decades with total impunity—and, by implication, with the blessing of the crown—while also assuring them that the problem was on its way to being solved.  The Ritz itself is an opulent and isolated megacomplex towering over the beige desert fringes of the downtown sprawl. It is built in a Louis XIV aesthetic, the look of late European monarchy, with filigrees and columns and porticos damming the invisible floodwaters. The interior is cladded in especially severe Islamic patterns, stark and eye-straining networks of latticed domes and interlocking geometries. Statues of four white horses on their hind legs rear over the junction between the lobby and the main dining room, proclaiming an innocent tribute to the Arabian stallion as well as the apocalypse.  A Saudi friend who took me to the hotel explained that it had originally been built as a royal guest house, to accompany the pineapple-domed conference center located one compound over. The palace that contained the actual Saudi royal court was nearby too, though it was far enough off the main highway to be unseeable to a casual visitor. In a more-than-symbolic demonstration that the crown didn’t consider itself exempt from the market-bound logic of the reform package, MBS ordered that the free VIP hotel instead be used as a for-profit facility, with the future operator paying a royalty to the government.  It was lunch inside the dining room, where armies of uniformed Filipino and Pakistani migrant laborers, almost all of them men, attended to a cornucopia of global cuisines arrayed across a vast mileage of bars and buffet tables, with the dull desert light pouring through the back windows of a space too massive to see all at once. A bass and guitar murmured while a woman without a hijab sang in French, every element of it a violation of Salafi injunctions regarding music, art, and gender roles. My friend pointed out a middle-aged couple, a woman in a black abaya across from a man whose headdress lacked the usual black ring. This omission symbolized humility before God and served as the local way of announcing yourself as a committed Islamic fundamentalist. A tall glass of a ruby-colored substance accompanied his expensive lunch.  For my friend, this surreal mix of the forbidden and the permitted at the site of MBS’s greatest administrative masterstroke summed up Saudi Arabia’s entire present situation. “The religious guy with fake sangria and a band playing,” he summarized, as he noticed me tapping away at my iPhone notes. “There’s your scene.”  Yet the Ritz turns out to be one of the least representative places in the entire city. Riyadh is the epicenter of the reform era’s goal of reorienting the Saudi economy around technology, services, and internal consumption. As a result, the young people moving back from Dubai or newly returned from Harvard actually have places to go and things to do now—hookah lounges, which offended the sensibilities of the religious conservatives who ran Riyadh for decades, were finally legalized in 2019. There is remarkably good arrabbiata and risotto on offer for $30 a plate, along with English speakers in their mid 20s to eat it with.  read more from tablet saudi arabia  “There’s so much more drama in American social circles than in Saudi social circles,” one lunch companion, a recent Ivy graduate now working in the newly sprouted forest of sky-high squiggles and cantilevers that forms Riyadh’s King Fahad Financial District, recalled of his time back in America. Dressed in the usual white robe, he blamed it all on American dating culture. We were joined by a woman in discrete Western-style dress and no hijab, who was also back from a fancy education stateside and working for an investment bank in Riyadh. “In America,” she said, “you have to watch what you say ... we have to give them tolerance, but there was no tolerance back to us.” Everyone in America, she said, “is super sensitive.” The young man agreed: Educated Americans were in fact so sensitive that they didn’t have the ability to debate anything except by indirection. “In American society you can never say something is bad: You say that it’s bad for children. In Saudi you’d appeal to religion, not to children’s welfare.” In another city we might have been drinking a white wine made for dry and sunny afternoons. At this restaurant our best option was a mysteriously ash-clouded lemonade infused with charcoal. I pointed out that New York City banned activated charcoal as an ingredient in foods and beverages in 2018.  Today, Riyadh is the second-largest city in the Arab Middle East by population, smaller than permanently dysfunctional Cairo and slightly larger than war-rattled Baghdad. After a brief 1960s flirtation with density and walkability overseen by a Greek urban planner, the infinite space of the desert was divided into giant kilometer-by-kilometer squares and the new oil economy ballooned the city into its current endlessness of shopping malls, walled villas, and eight-lane roads. The old downtown, the one place in Riyadh with lively street life, is now a bustling neighborhood of Filipino and Pakistani migrant workers. Everywhere the traffic design verges on the vindictive: The main arteries are split between a tangle of service lanes, protected turning lanes, underpasses, exits, and entries that dismay, flummox, and terrify people who are familiar with it all. Because these highwaylike streets lack any logical turnaround points, it is common to wind up on the wrong side of the road and have 20 minutes added to your journey.  Given the psychic stress of just getting around, it is a miracle, or perhaps a triumph of tribal-based desert social solidarity, that the people of Riyadh are so unfailingly easygoing and so lacking in any visible suspicion or aggressiveness once they’re off the roads. It is perhaps the only major Middle Eastern city where bargaining in the souks feels impolite.  In Riyadh the current lack of dedicated public space, along with Salafism’s hostility toward any shared public aesthetic experience, has displaced much of the artistic energy into interior design. Riyadh is glutted with sleekly decorated coffee shops that don’t open until the early afternoon, and sometimes not until the late afternoon, since the city is nocturnal even in the winter. There are a conspicuous number of kitchen supply stores; the souks offer elaborate jewelry that’s barely ever worn in public, along with oceans of perfume and incense. It is an economy set up around things a visitor will not see unless they’re invited into a private home.  The public Riyadh is a pale outer layer of the private city, which is an almost complete inversion of life in New York, or even in Cairo. The homes themselves are inscrutable from the outside, walled-off domains with servants, endless coffee services, and majlises, courtlike traditional living rooms where friends and family lounge for hours on elegant floor cushions. Among the Riyadhi elite, it is common to have an entire separate, villa-size majlis where nobody actually lives.  The visible security presence in Riyadh is light both by regional standards and any standard, although things like the total public absence of alcohol or the state-mandated calorie counts on every single restaurant menu confirms the authorities’ thoroughgoing control. There are plentiful signs of an enduring conservatism, like separate women’s entrances for banks (newly optional), curtained-off booths at restaurants, and a relative lack of mixed company even at the hipper and newer coffee houses. The reforms have not yet destroyed the existing social system. And yet, they are meant to turn Saudis into workers and taxpayers, and to change their attitudes toward everything from romance to art to foreign travel.  Perhaps MBS’s project goes even further than that. In JAX, a government-created arts warehouse district near Diriyah, there is an elaborate exhibition previewing Neom, the planned city under construction on the northwestern coast of the Red Sea. Most of its millions of projected inhabitants will live in The Line, a single 100-mile structure, 660-by-1,500 feet, extending into the desert. What will be contained within it is scarcely imaginable, even by teams of world-renowned architects. The concept models at the JAX exhibition are baffling entanglements of walkways, staircases, upside-down skyscrapers and parkland stretching toward an uncannily indoor vanishing point. “This is a cognitive city that will not only adapt to your needs but learn to anticipate them,” a soft and robotic female voice promised during an introductory video. It is “a portal connecting the digital and the physical, conceived by the visionary mind of his highness, Mohammed bin Salman.”  Charlie Puth and Swedish House Mafia concert, 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after-party, JeddahAndrea Bruce  There were no houses of worship depicted in The Line, no women in hijabs, no men in robes walking among the indoor rivers and hanging towers. Present-day Saudi Arabia is car country, but in Neom the whole city is on a single train line, and everything is meant to be walkable within 15 minutes. In The Line, your community would be defined by the people you lived near, not by your family or your origins.  “In essence, we are building a newly composed biome,” one video informed me. What, if anything, did this mean, and was it meant to mean anything? Would the cantilevered parks become a suicide hazard? There couldn’t be anything less Saudi than The Line, I thought, a place with no walled villas, a dream in the mind of an obscured, humanized God, the god of architects or urban planners, or maybe of especially grandiose kings. Even Diriyah, despite its traditional-style architecture, represents a stark rejection of spacious homes walled off from forbidding highways—the kinds of places where the children might stick around until they get married—in favor of denser blocks of apartments and single-family houses. Diriyah will be connected to downtown Riyadh by a thick greenbelt planted with 20 million trees, which will have a pedestrian and bicycle highway named after the crown prince. Six million of those trees have already been planted, I was told.  In my discussions with Saudi officials, they always emphasized the speed of the reforms: The idea is to fund a massive economic and social transition while oil is still in high demand, and then build an entirely new economy in time for the 40% of the population that’s now under 25-years-old to actually have something meaningful and productive to do with their lives. Part of the reason Saudi Arabia signed on to the recent Chinese-brokered diplomatic normalization with Iran was to pause the onslaught of Tehran-supported drone, missile, and cyber attacks against the kingdom, securing the peaceful conditions under which the crown’s development package could be implemented. Several officials pointed out to me that speed was important because it meant the changes could rapidly become tangible to ordinary Saudis. This marked another curious instance of the monarchy showing a kind of backhanded concern for what its subjects think: The government recognizes that its citizens will not automatically trust that the country is changing unless they can see the changes themselves.  In Riyadh, Saudis can experience the permanence and seriousness of the reforms at Boulevard World, an Epcot-like circuit of nationally themed zones circling an ameboid artificial lake. I walked around it gobsmacked for hours, listening to tabla players at the fake Taj Mahal, watching a costumed procession through fake Morocco, dangling in a cable car over the robin’s egg domes of fake Greece, and perusing the Naruto figurines in fake Japan. I considered eating at the Nathan’s Famous in fake America, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. In Dubai, the malls and theme parks are pitched at tourists, but at Boulevard World I went long spells without seeing even one other Westerner. Entire large families were out together, the adults in robes and abayas. Any dating was so discreet as to be invisible.  At AREA15, an amusement park version of a warehouse rave located a few buildings over from a fake Mayan pyramid, women in abayas and their robe-clad husbands watched a hijab-less female DJ bop to a bass-heavy mix of an Arabic wedding song. Strobes and lasers flashed. The turntable podium helpfully read “AREA15 Riyadh,” perhaps so that Instagrammers might broadcast to their countrymen and to the rest of the world that yes, this really is happening—the changes are real, or else this wouldn’t be possible.  Like so much else in reform-era Saudi Arabia, Boulevard World is credited to the unique vision of some prince or another. It was built in a mere 81 days according to Ahmed Al Mehmadi, the chief marketing and communications officer for the Saudi Arabian government’s General Entertainment Authority. We met in the back of a hotel conference hall that had been converted into a vast office during Riyadh Season, an annual series of events focused on the capital during the milder winter months. There were “14 zones of activation” during Riyadh Season, Al Mehmadi explained. Behind him was row after row of young adults in a mix of Western and Middle Eastern business-casual dress whose age seemed to average out to 25 at most.  Al Mehmadi, raised partly in London and educated in Riyadh, wore a long white robe, and had a prayer rug and a small statuette of a white Arabian stallion on his desk. Boulevard World, he said, was home to the world’s largest statue of Grendizer, a character from a globally popular anime franchise that he’d loved as a child in Saudi Arabia in the ’90s.  I asked Al Mehmadi if there was some deeper message to Boulevard World. Maybe the place is telling Saudis not to fear other nations or cultures after a long spell of paranoiac conservative governance? It was much simpler than that, Al Mehmadi replied. “We’re telling people you can enjoy your life, you can enjoy being here.”  Saudis didn’t have to travel to Dubai to go to a theme park anymore. And no one had forced anyone to go to Boulevard World—this was something Saudis had apparently already wanted, and the government had now given it to them. By this point, “People are used to a certain way of living,” Al Mehmadi said of the reforms. “It can’t go back.”  For now, the Saudi system has brought newfound normalcy to 35 million people in a time when the Arab republics collapsed into mayhem and every regional democratization effort foundered, backslid, or failed. But even if the reforms stick, at some point, maybe 30 years from now—which is both a long time and also less time than it seems—the majority of Saudis will have no strong memory of how oppressive their country used to be. For the reforms to have really been successful, those future Saudis will have to believe in the monarchy for reasons other than the half-forgotten opening of an earlier generation. Something larger has to endure.  To that end, a multi-square-kilometer dust pit east of downtown Riyadh, now a construction site of terrifyingly Pharaonic scope, will be the location of King Salman Park. A futuristic collection of museums and cultural institutions called the Royal Arts Complex will run through the park’s central axis. The government has already launched two arts biennales, one held under the canopies of the former hajj terminal at the Jeddah airport, and one in the desert city of al-Ula, near a notable collection of ancient Nabatean ruins. A cultural ecosystem, along with a burgeoning local fine art market, has been decreed into existence. “If you’re developing an arts sector,” one government official pointed out, “a biennale is the end of the value chain.”  ‘People are used to a certain way of living. It can’t go back.’Andrea Bruce  Art existed in Saudi Arabia before the reforms, just as art has existed in every human context across all of time. As the internationally known Saudi artist Abdulnasser Gharem explained to me, a would-be artist in his country used to encounter the paradoxes of the state’s fundamentalist ideology even as a young child. “From the first day of elementary school, when they were teaching us to practice the execution of images in schoolbooks,” he recalled, “we had to draw a line across the necks of all creatures with a soul, and the heads of images of animals and people. The teachers said: To create an image is the job of Allah. If you leave it to exist, you are going to be punished and go to hell. I was only 6 years old. And I was wondering why I had to do this, because those images were there on the paper. The government had printed them.”  Gharem joined the military to “hide from being an artist,” he told me. He spent 25 years as an armory and supply specialist and retired as a lieutenant colonel. Then he became perhaps the leading conceptual artist in Saudi Arabia, someone who gained global renown while working within the strict limits of a system he intimately knew, and to which he remained loyal. A decade before the reforms, his ghostly photographs of the mushroom-topped, nonnative trees that were often planted along city streets became a comment on how unnatural, constructed, and imposed the national commons had become. In another photo from the early 2000s, a Quranic word meaning “path” repeatedly appeared on a bridge where villagers had died during a flash flood, sheltering there on the advice of a local sheikh. Obedience can either rescue you or kill you, the work suggested.  Gharem’s studio is in a high-ceilinged villa in a Riyadh neighborhood that had been trendy in the ’60s and ’70s, during the city’s initial period of rapid expansion. The house has a crystalline wall of high windows, a cactus garden, and that most essential of Riyadh amenities, a wall that blocks any view from the outside. In the studio there are intriguing mounds of found objects awaiting some artistic use. Why the pile of antique luggage? “I was in the military for 25 years,” was Gharem’s full explanation. A multivolume set of religious texts, the ones where the spines combine to spell out a Quranic phrase in Arabic, sat near books dedicated to the works of Richard Serra, Ai Weiwei, and James Turrell. Gharem himself had a wiry frame and bushy gray hair. He wore turquoise shoes and a florid button-up shirt, and smoked liberally.  “I belong to freedom of thought more than freedom of expression,” Gharem explained. “The freedom of thought is a human right, and a person’s free actions occur primarily in the mind and not in nature.  “As an artist,” he added, “you can’t fall back on where you belong.”  Thanks to the reforms, someone like Gharem, who believes that an artist can never become overly captive to their surroundings or to their own identity, is now in the strange position of having to be skeptical of something that’s directly helped him. “You can be an artist—not hiding like before,” he said of the changes he’s seen since 2016. “The government gives us infrastructure we never would have dreamed of when we were young.” In an earlier time, “You never would’ve told your neighbor you were taking your daughter to a private piano teacher.  “Today we are living a grand narrative: The enlightenment that we were waiting for has begun from within,” he continued. “Despite the fact that some perceive it as a harsh enlightenment, there is great progress.”  ‘The great majority of Saudis still didn’t know who Swedish House Mafia was, but there were relatively privileged teenagers on hand whose lives would probably never be the same again.’Andrea Bruce  Dubai, the Gulf’s reigning logistics and financial hub and one of the Middle East’s few real bastions of cosmopolitanism, is often seen as the value proposition for what a more liberal Saudi Arabia could be. But one important commonality between Dubai and whatever Saudi Arabia is becoming is that neither are democratic accomplishments. What disturbs an American visitor about Riyadh, and Dubai for that matter, is the possibility that for the time being, liberal idealism has little it can credibly add to the market-driven vision of order, harmony, and ambition that surrounds them. The enlightenment might be harsh. Did that mean it couldn’t also be real?  After the Formula 1 qualifier was over, there was an after-party where Charlie Puth performed in front of tens of thousands of teenagers cloaked in darkness. No, this wasn’t some different and less-famous person named Charlie, I realized shortly after arriving midset. One of the world’s biggest pop stars and TikTok icons seemed to really be enjoying himself up there, dressed in a red leather jacket with cream-colored sleeves. “Your food is the best food I’ve ever had in the entire world,” he gushed, with visible surprise at how nonmedieval his host country had proved to be. He read signs in the crowd between numbers: “‘Hii, with two i’s. Yes, hello!” He sang “Loser,” a song about dating and alcohol abuse, here in a dry country where quasi-arranged marriages are still common. “Thanks for being one of the most impressive crowds we’ve ever played for,” he beamed. Next up was Swedish House Mafia, who headlined Coachella last year. “I don’t know how they’re going to dance to Swedish House Mafia without any drinks,” wondered a Frenchman watching next to me on the VIP deck, before correctly predicting that Sergio Perez would win the next day’s grand prix.  The robe people, the well-connected types in their mid-30s, dominated the sedate and uncrowded club section, which loomed over a festival-sized pit. I set out for the lower shadows, curious as to which Saudis belonged in the less rarified strata of concertgoers. What I saw were thousands of young people practicing at being mirror images of American teens: The boys wore Death Row Records hoodies and fake Balenciaga, and I spotted dew rags, tight leather jackets, cornrows, and a shirt coated in black sequins. Travis Scott, popular in Saudi Arabia, was headlining the post-race show the next night.  The girls mostly wore jeans; exposed belly buttons were about as common as hijabs, which is to say the number of both was noticeably higher than zero. There was plentiful, unashamed mixed company, although I did see a couple jerk their heads away from each other mid-kiss, realizing they were now under the floodlights near the exit of the hulking amphitheater. What will happen in a few years when half the guys here are drunk? I wondered. Maybe half of them were already drunk and their cultural environment had made them adept at keeping it secret. It was awfully dark up front.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhYmxldG1hZy5jb20vc2VjdGlvbnMvaXNyYWVsLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0L2FydGljbGVzL2JpcnRoLW9mLWEtbmF0aW9uLXNhdWRpLWFyYWJpYS1hcm1pbi1yb3NlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"religious miracle","2023-05-21","07:00:00","{""Nagoya"", ""Aichi"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-22T16:12:37","It was a crisp Sunday morning in late January. I stood with a group of pilgrims lined up before a village shrine at the base of Mount Ontake. Our white robes pressed down fleeces and bulky jackets that threatened to spill out from their cotton sleeves. Suddenly, we were ordered to prostrate and bow our heads to the ground. I felt grateful to have worn ski pants as I rested my knees on a footpath of uneven cobblestone and snow. A shrill voice pierced the air, and we listened with rapt attention. This was the first oracle of the day.  The group comprised young men and women, couples, friends, and elders. We shared deep bonds forged out of neighborhood parish gatherings, chartered bus rides to Ontake, and strenuous ascents up the mountain. This and other séances over the course of the day would provide us with close encounters with Buddhist divinities and departed loved ones. Having left behind our ordinary lives in the metropolis of Nagoya, we were assembled here for another day of shared miracles on one of Japan’s most sacred peaks.  Oracle and séance are not rituals that readily align with modern notions of Buddhist practice. Those notions, however, were conceived by 19th-century intellectuals, many outside the tradition, who put forth a narrow vision of the Buddhist path. Amidst the harsh environment of a winter mountain, the pilgrims in this group were proving just how narrow that vision is.  Rising above 10,000 feet at the southern end of Japan’s Central Alps, Mount Ontake is massive in terms of elevation and surface area. It is also an active volcano, a trait that hikers and devotees were tragically reminded of when a deadly eruption killed sixty-three people there on September 27, 2014. It would take several years before pilgrims felt safe returning to the mountain.  But today’s group had been visiting the mountain long before the eruption. While some members had recently joined, others were carrying on a tradition that stretched back generations in their families. Today had begun with quiet, individual prayers at Shusshō Motogumi, the group’s temple in Nagoya, shortly before 7 a.m. Boarding a chartered bus, we journeyed several hours along highways and roads that eventually led us along a broad river valley rising into the mountains.  The first dramatic event I witnessed that morning occurred at the village of Satomiya, which serves as the traditional entrance to the Ontake massif. In this familiar ritual, a lead guide acts as a vessel for a deceased visiting spirit or mountain deity, and an assisting guide orchestrates the encounter to ensure the safety of the spirit medium. On this particular occasion, the mythological Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami entered the body of our lead guide (whom I’ll call Tanaka-san). They welcomed us and noted that the weather would be calm for the day. Assisting guides performed rapid-fire mudra signs, dialogued with the visiting deities, offered saké, and instructed us on when to prostrate, rise, and so forth. Throughout this séance, Tanaka-san stood bolt upright and held a festooned paper wand (gohei) in front of his face to conceal the deities from the human world.  Witnessing the presence of the divine, everyone in the group bowed and listened intently. The encounter seemed to take us out of our mundane reality and into intimate proximity with the sacred. After the deities’ farewell and the medium’s return to consciousness, life resumed. Jokes, banter, smartphone selfies, and stumbles across an icy road back to the bus.  The next event was equally dramatic, if not harrowing. Above the road were narrow steps leading to a waterfall flowing through curtains of ice. Tanaka-san stripped down to a loin cloth and submerged himself under the waterfall, a regular practice in Japanese pilgrimage but not so common in the dead of winter. As one element in a regiment of ascetic cultivation (shugyō), it is intended to purify and align the practitioner with the gods (in this case, the wrathful Fudō Myōō, known in India as Acala).  As Tanaka-san locked hands in prayer, the group vigorously chanted the Heart Sutra and other incantations to ensure his protection. Afterward, he was embraced with towels and escorted to an outdoor changing stall.  Lunch was followed by an ascent up snow-laden steps to a cluster of memorial stones. The lower slopes of Ontake are populated by thousands of tall memorial stones dedicated to the spirits (reijin) of former guides. They provide a contact zone for meetings between the living and the dead, or in Japanese, this realm and that realm. As we gathered around one stone and adorned it with flowers and photos of a deceased member, a séance began. In an instant of transformation, Tanaka-san was washed over by the gentle voice and mannerisms of one of their departed guides. She came in kindred spirit, delivering messages and counsel to dear friends. Some wept, others smiled in reassurance. A few laughs erupted when she offered a word of welcome to the visiting foreigner (“Gaijin-san”). An assisting guide discreetly whispered an introduction into Tanaka-san’s ear to acquaint us.  Ontake has a long history of Buddhist itinerants frequenting its slopes to perform ascetic rituals, including seclusion and fasting, chants under waterfalls, and prayers to the mountain’s pantheon of buddhas and local gods. Ordinary pilgrims did not venture up its higher reaches until two ascetics guided their followers up the mountain in the late 18th century: Kakumei (1718–1786), traveling from the Kansai region in 1784, and Fukan (1731–1801), arriving from Kantō in 1794. Generations of pilgrims have since traced their roots back to them. Over time, they formed pilgrimage associations that collectively worshiped the mountain and its resident deities. Under the leadership of pilgrimage guides (sendatsu), they conducted services at neighborhood temples and on the mountain. It is important to note, here, though, that women were historically barred from climbing many sacred peaks, including Ontake, as misogynistic discourse over notions of female impurity led to fears of invoking the mountain gods’ wrath should they enter. Although the government banned these restrictions in 1872, ideas about impurity, especially menstruation, continue to surface, and religious institutions remain androcentric.  Worship at Ontake has typically blended Buddhism, Shinto, and Shugendō (Japan’s premier mountain-based tradition). Ascetic priests and itinerants historically performed services on behalf of various deities and spirits centered on appeasement, gratitude, and teachings of the Buddha. They prayed to divine embodiments of the natural world (boulders, waterfalls, trees, mountains), ancestral spirits, numinous dragons, and even vengeful ghosts (who required pacification). In doing so, they brought local deities and those who worshiped them into the Buddhist worldview.  Local mountain deities were believed to dwell in symbiosis with the Mahayana pantheon of awakened buddhas and bodhisattvas. Collectively, they provided water to the plains below via the mountain streams, and when summoned by the spiritually advanced, they granted mountain priests heightened abilities in divination, healing, and merit accumulation. As pilgrimage to sacred peaks became widespread in the 18th century, more and more people ventured to higher elevations to meet and pray to the divinities themselves.  Then, religious sites in Japan underwent a radical transformation in the late 19th century. The Meiji government (1868–1912) promulgated the separation of Buddhism and Shinto in 1868, a policy that had sweeping effects on religious communities nationwide. In response, the Ontake pilgrimage associations nominally became Shinto organizations, but this did not stop them from engaging in Buddhist practices and beliefs. In their parish temples and on the mountain, they continued to invoke buddhas and bodhisattvas in prayer, chant sutras, perform mudras, and wear prayer beads. In the subsequent century and a half, pilgrimage continues to encompass elements of Buddhism and Shinto. Because neither tradition is maintained by a strong sense of personal, communal, or institutional identity, the majority of practitioners do not see this type of synthesis as problematic.  In the early 20th century, the Ontake pilgrimage rivaled that of any other mountain in Japan, including Mount Fuji, drawing tens of thousands of pilgrims from Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, and beyond every summer. That said, annual government survey statistics reveal a long-term decline since at least the 1970s, which can be attributed to the country’s aging population, occupational shifts away from self-employment and small businesses (operated by many devotees), and disrupted community and family networks as younger generations gravitate from towns and villages toward the major cities.  My introduction to Ontake worship had come from vivid, if not unsettling, accounts dating back to the late 19th century. As visitors from Europe and the United States landed on Japanese soil with increasing frequency, some chronicled their explorations for a Western readership captivated by the Far East. These impressions provided illuminating windows into Japanese ritual life but, at the same time, eerily placed their subjects in realms of the exotic and nonmodern. The Bostonian businessman, author, and astronomer Percival Lowell began his famous book Occult Japan: or The Way of the Gods, an Esoteric Study of Japanese Personality and Possession (1894) with a description of a “strange” and “ungodly” séance on the summit of Ontake. He summed it up in sweeping fashion: “There proved to exist a regular system of divine possession, an esoteric cult imbedded in the very heart and core of the Japanese character and instinct, with all the strangeness of that to us enigmatical race.”  Two years later, Walter Weston, a British Anglican minister celebrated as the founder of modern alpinism in Japan, offered another account. While many of his writings portray mountain worship in Japan in respectful terms, he, too, mused on the “weirdness” of a series of Buddhist mudras performed on Ontake in a similar séance: “Each twist, each knot, has its own meaning, and resembles a sort of dumb alphabet, spoken with all the expression that physical action can put into it. For language it is really meant to be addressed to those invisible powers of evil against whose malevolence the pilgrim is appealing for protection.” At first glance, the accounts of Lowell and Weston reflect a sense of cultural superiority and Orientalism common at the time. On a deeper level, however, they represent formative ideas about what constitutes acceptable forms of religious faith and what gets excluded.  Defining religion as a distinct component of the human experience, 19th-century Western intellectuals naturally drew from their Protestant values and Enlightenment ideals, privileging textual authority over lived religion, belief over ritual, and spirituality over materiality. Popular practices outside formal institutions—divinations, exorcisms, and séances like the ones on Mount Ontake—were deemed superstitious and needed to be expunged from religion.  Under this thinking, theologians like Edwin Arnold, Henry Olcott, and Paul Carus attempted to “correct” contemporary Asian Buddhism, promoting their vision of a rational, ethical, and scientific tradition at its core. In Japan, interlocutors like the cosmopolitan Zen priest Shaku Sōen joined this movement at events like the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. As scholar Donald Lopez puts it, there was no place for superstition and unenlightened behavior in this new convergence of Buddhism and science.  Protestant Buddhism and its paternalistic impulses do not die quickly. Nor does its bedfellow, Orientalism. And long after the dismissive remarks of 19th-century visitors to Japan, there has still been little attempt to understand the ritual life of Ontake pilgrimage. As I witnessed on Ontake firsthand, however, these practices and the surrounding communities reveal a broader, more inclusive scope of how we might understand the Buddhist path.  The culmination of the Sunday in January came at a goma temple in a series of powerful rituals. The goma is an empowering fire ritual that traces back to ancient India, where it was adopted into Buddhism. Tanaka-san, taking bundles of wooden sticks purchased by parishioners and dedicated to themselves and their loved ones, sat cross-legged before the altar and built a lurching Jenga-like tower that rose to his eye level. Flames spiraled into the air, higher with each successive build, licking the ventilation shaft in the ceiling. On two occasions, flaming sticks pitched off the tower and dropped onto his lap and between his seat and the altar. Smoke encircled the room as the group vigorously chanted sutras and mantras, rattled bells, and blew conch-shell trumpets to help control the fire while enhancing its efficacious benefits. One parishioner collected our prayer beads so Tanaka-san could wave them through the fire, purifying and emblazing them with healing powers that we could rub onto aching limbs and joints.  As the fire dimmed, all fell quiet. A deity had once again taken over the body and voice of Tanaka-san. Springing from the seat cushion in a deft 180-degree turn, Nyoirin Kannon faced us and announced her presence. Typically female in Japan, Nyoirin is one form of the bodhisattva Kannon (Ch. Guanyin, Skt. Avalokiteshvara). She is especially popular among women and parents for fertility, childbirth, and healthy children. Embodying her, Tanaka-san sank into the form of a tender, feminine figure gracing the room with her divine presence. All leaned forward in quiet anticipation.  We were tapped to line up to commune with Nyoirin Kannon one at a time. She spoke to each person with the compassion emblematic of a loving bodhisattva. Each encounter brought an intimate exchange of soothing whispers, healing rubs to arms and thighs, and responding nods of recognition and gratitude. As a participant observer, I felt somewhat uneasy when called forward myself. I politely nodded through most of her counsel, yet was taken off guard when she informed me of my grandmother’s presence by our side. Nyoirin’s departure was sad and protracted, like a parent saying goodbye to a child. She thanked me for making the trip from Fukuoka and invited me to return for the group’s summer ascent of Ontake.  I reflected on the day on my return home. Its events were not simply empty rituals passed down from the previous generation and now upheld out of familial obligation. They did not feel like superstitious forays into the strange and exotic, as earlier Western intellectuals would have us believe. Instead, this brief Sunday pilgrimage conferred simple, if not powerful, touchstones of joy. The chance to reconnect with a departed loved one, to pray for an auspicious year, to be surrounded by a caring community, to share a delicious meal—as well as several gifts rare in this world—visits from distant deities, healing hands, and for a few, the ability to host spirits of the divine in their bodies.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdHJpY3ljbGUub3JnL2FydGljbGUvYnVkZGhpc3Qtcml0dWFsLW1vdW50LW9udGFrZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-21","10:00:00","{""Ife"", ""Osun"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-22T15:50:54","By Adewale Adeoye  I’m not a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. But I think Mr. Adedamola Adetayo who condemned the church in a recent Facebook post after his tour around the Redemption City was wrong.  Adetayo in his piece overlooked and undermined the vision of administrators of the church which is their legitimate right.  He scratched the surface of the positive values of the church while focusing on appearances and assumptions. He expressed shock that RCCG has a retinue of armed guards and probably should have left the site for the Angels to guard  But he is oblivious of the scripture that instructs us to watch and pray. The emphasis is to first watch and then pray.  When King Herod wanted to kill Jesus Christ, God did not tell Joseph to just start praying. He asked him to take a flight to Egypt with the boy Jesus. And he did fly.  God is a man of science, art, and literature. He is also a man of peace and war. He was the commander of the soldiers of David. And he helped them to procure ammunition. David had cause to run after those who plundered his goods and his family. And the Bible tells us that he recovered all that the enemy took from him  God knows the value, strategy, and tactics of defense in a war situation. He is the greatest War hero and the greatest peacemaker.  Adetayo forgets so many things that are done to protect the state of Israel. He forgot so many steps taken by Israel and Saudi Arabia to sustain those countries as the world’s religious tourism hubs.  He forgot so many security put in place to protect the monuments from theft. And these are God’s own countries.  Why should RCCG leave the protection of its vineyard for God and prayers when God had given man wisdom to procure the necessary equipment to ward off invaders?  It will be foolishness for a man to pray and hope for food without tilling the soil.  Nothing wrong with monuments  There is nothing wrong with the monuments built at RCCG. King Solomon built mansions and houses of gold, through the Labour of mankind so also Egypt built mountains on earth through the sweat of men and women. They are today, some of the wonders on earth.  Baba Adeboye has built monuments that will stand for generations, monuments that will survive him. They were not built in his name. But in the name of an institution that will witness generations of successors long after Baba Adeboye is gone to rest.  It requires a lot of wisdom, a lot of energy, a lot of skill, and knowledge to build such monuments, one of the finest and most expansive vineyards in human history.  I think Adetayo should visit Rome and see monuments built with billions of dollars and sustained over generations.  Baba Adeboye does not need to live in poverty to establish his stardom. He has no business living like a pauper when God has built a city for him.  He was already a Professor before leading the RCCG, a man of immense knowledge whose wealth lay in his wisdom to control and be in charge of over 50 million people all over the world. He is the President of the RCCG country.  Our Lord Jesus was not a poor man. King David was one of the richest men of his time.  RCCG has transformed virgin land into prosperity, the institution has created jobs for millions of people all over the world and its preaching of Christian values is of inestimable contributions to human civilisations.  What Baba Adeboye has built is also a Faith driven tourist resort with 24/7 provision of light and water, good roads, medicare, green, clean, and lurch environment, something the Nigerian state, with all her resources, could not achieve.

With millions of visitors trooping into the camp every year, It’s a huge resource avenue for the Nigerian Government if the political leaders are wise enough to know how to tap into this monumental achievement of the Church.  Mere construction of a toll gate on the Ibadan Lagos expressway will earn the state millions of Naira during each Holy Ghost service. The RCCG cannot help a Government that is not thinking.  I once visited a temple in Chiangmai Thailand. Each visitor must pay 1 dollar at the gate. The fund goes to charity and tax paid to the Government. I witnessed the same in Costa Rica, during a visit.  Many people from Asia, Europe, and the Pacific visit Nigeria today because of RCCG. If there is any dominion any black man has over the white or Asians, it is through the RCCG and a number of other religious sites.  Millions visit RCCG today the way they visit Jerusalem. Why should a people scorn such an enterprise? A good and wise Government would have built a Five Star Hotel near the RCCG headquarters. There is always the Economy of Faith which great nations explore to maximum advantage.  Scholars all over the world are writing their dissertations on RCCG. The RCCG is building hundreds of branches all over the world, creating jobs, if for anything, and creating something morally defensible about Nigeria’s external image, against our appalling reputation.  There are millions of Nigerians that live and sustain their lives from sales on the day of the Holy Ghost Service.  Church a blessing to humanity  The Church is not an impediment to human progress. It rather adds value to it. The RCCG has added value to human economic, spiritual, social, and cultural livelihood. It has not in any way diminished our humanity the way state institutions have done.  To say RCCG took land from the poor is preposterous. The villagers have lawyers. They are not illiterates. I believe there was diligent negotiation and due process before the land was sold.  We should focus on the rotten institutions of the state instead of throwing arrows against faith-based institutions. These institutions’ ability to thrive in our almost comatose country should be commended.  And to think they still continue preaching values is itself a miracle. If there are infractions on the law by RCCG, that is another debate. And that will be for another time. But we should not shy from giving applause where it is due.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY2h1cmNodGltZXNuaWdlcmlhLm5ldC9yY2NnLWhhcy1pbXBhY3RlZC1odW1hbml0eS1lbm91Z2gtb2YtdGhlLWF0dGFja3MtYnktd2FsZS1hZGVveWUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9jaHVyY2h0aW1lc25pZ2VyaWEubmV0L3JjY2ctaGFzLWltcGFjdGVkLWh1bWFuaXR5LWVub3VnaC1vZi10aGUtYXR0YWNrcy1ieS13YWxlLWFkZW95ZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2022-11-01","Not Discerned","{""NorthCharleston"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T09:58:00","EXCLUSIVE - It's one the biggest questions facing Republican Sen. Tim Scott as he jumps into the race for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.  Will Republican voters be receptive to what Scott calls his ""optimistic, positive message anchored in conservatism.""  Scott, who on Monday will formally declare his candidacy for the White House at a campaign kick off event at Charleston Southern University, his alma mater, said in an exclusive interview with Fox News just ahead of his 2024 launch that GOP presidential primary voters are hungry for a what he's preaching.  He’ll join a GOP White House field that includes former President Donald Trump, who announced his third straight presidential run in November and remains the clear front-runner in the Republican nomination race.  WHAT TIM SCOTT TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT REINSTATING TITLE 42  Trump has continued to relitigate his 2020 election loss to President Biden as he repeats his unproven claims that his defeat was due to an election ""stolen"" through ""massive voter fraud."" And the former president’s listing of his many legal grievances also became a campaign staple this year.  Asked by Fox News if Republican voters are receptive to his positive message, Scott pointed to his recent stops in the two states that kick off the GOP presidential nominating calendar and emphasized ""what I’ve seen in Iowa and New Hampshire is that voters are thrilled to have a conversation about optimism, a conversation about how to move this country forward together.""  ""I’m stunned at the hunger for something positive as long as its anchored in conservatism. As long as you have a backbone,"" he added.  Scott, a rising star in the GOP and the only Black Republican in the Senate, is launching his campaign in North Charleston, the town where he grew up.  ""Here’s a kid that grew up in North Charleston, South Carolina, mired in poverty, in a single parent household. To think about one day being the President of the United States just tells me that the evolution of the American soul continues to move toward that more perfect union,"" the senator stressed.  ""There’s not a better place to have a conversation than on a campus with a spirit of academic excellent and a Christian environment and that Charleston Southern University. So I’m glad to be here at the home of the Bucs,"" Scott added.  Scott's campaign kick off comes three days after he filed with the Federal Election Commission, which officially launched his presidential campaign. Scott's move came as he launched a $6 million ad blitz into the summer in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Scott kicked off a ""Faith in America"" listening tour in February. That tour has taken the senator Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as his home state of South Carolina, which holds the third contest in the GOP primary and caucus lineup. Scott will return to Iowa and New Hampshire on Wednesday and Thursday, following his campaign kick off.  WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE  He joins a growing field of GOP White House hopefuls who are challenging Trump.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose anti-woke crusade has made him popular with conservatives across the country, is expected to officially file paperwork this week with the FEC to launch a presidential campaign, with a formal announcement to follow. DeSantis is second in the Republican primary polls, behind Trump but far ahead of the rest of the field.  That field will also include former Vice President Mike Pence, who's expected to launch a campaign in the coming weeks.  Scott will also face serious competition from Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations and former two-term South Carolina governor who launched a 2024 presidential campaign in February. Haley, who’s spending plenty of time on the campaign trail in the early voting states, and Scott share many of the same allies and donors.  Also in the race are former two-term Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, multi-millionaire entrepreneur, best-selling author and conservative commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, Michigan businessman and 2022 gubernatorial candidate Perry Johnson and conservative radio talk show host and former California gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder.  Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire are seriously mulling presidential bids, with announcements likely in the coming weeks, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie expected to announce in the coming days whether he'll launch a second GOP presidential campaign.  Scott, who cruised to re-election last November to what he has said will be his final six-year term in the Senate, is expected to court evangelical Christian voters, who play an outsized role in GOP politics in Iowa and his home state.  Another question for Scott, who's currently polling in the single digits with the rest of the pack, trailing DeSantis and far behind Trump, is how he can broaden his support and rise in the polls.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""I think after the announcement I think the polls will start to change,"" Scott told Fox News. ""I think there’s an enthusiasm that will continue to spread throughout the country.

So we’ll spend the time, stay on the campaign trail, and make sure we have the message that works.""  While Scott doesn’t have the same national standing with conservatives that Trump and DeSantis enjoy, he’s known as a ferocious fundraiser who had roughly $22 million in his campaign coffers at the end of March, which can be transferred to his presidential campaign. The fundraising war chest could give Scott a head start over some of his rivals for the Republican nomination.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RpbS1zY290dC1zYXlzLWdvcC12b3RlcnMtaGF2ZS1odW5nZXItcG9zaXRpdmUtY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLW1lc3NhZ2UtZGVjbGFyZXMtMjAyNC1jYW5kaWRhY3nSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvdGltLXNjb3R0LXNheXMtZ29wLXZvdGVycy1oYXZlLWh1bmdlci1wb3NpdGl2ZS1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtbWVzc2FnZS1kZWNsYXJlcy0yMDI0LWNhbmRpZGFjeS5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1776-07-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:30:19","“And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.”  ― Thomas Jefferson, The Declaration of Independence  The Big Picture –  By Glynn Wilson –  WASHINGTON, D.C. — From the very beginning of this brave new experiment in government by the people we seemed to want to rely on some form of Divine Providence for our ultimate success.  Even if there is such a thing, and it is highly doubtful, it appears now to be leaving us abandoned and alone on this lonely planet, where we are as divided about what that even means as we are about which party is more likely to save us from our own selfish destruction. We can’t even agree that we need to borrow more money to keep funding this experiment. Some seem content to leave our fate in the hands of this Divine Providence, even though even Jesus supposedly said, “God helps those who help themselves.”  To get a glimpse of what I mean look no further than Wyoming, where Republican Susan Stubson writes about the destructive rise of Christian nationalism — the belief, as recently described by the Georgetown University professor and author Paul D. Miller, that “America is a ‘Christian nation’ and that the government should keep it that way.”  “Gone are the days when a lawmaker might be circumspect about using his or her faith as a vehicle to garner votes,” she says, talking about the time gone by when even the Southern Baptists were strong believers in the separation of church and state outlined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  “It’s been a drastic and destructive departure from the boring, substantive lawmaking to which I was accustomed,” she says. “Christian nationalists have hijacked both my Republican Party and my faith community by blurring the lines between church and government — and in the process rebranding our state’s identity.”  What Christian Nationalism Has Done to My State and My Faith Is a Sin  In theology, Divine Providence, or simply Providence, is defined as God’s intervention in the Universe. The term Divine Providence (usually capitalized) is also used as a title of God. A distinction is usually made between “general providence”, which refers to God’s continuous upholding of the existence and natural order of the Universe, and “special providence”, which refers to God’s extraordinary intervention in the life of people. Miracles generally fall in the latter category, at least according to Wikipedia.  Etymology  “Divine” evolved in the late 14th century to mean “pertaining to, in the nature of or proceeding from God or a god.” This came from the Old French devin or devin, with a similar meaning, and that from the Latin divinus, meaning “of a god”, in turn from divus, with similar meaning, which was related the Latin deus, meaning god or deity. The word providence comes from Latin providentia meaning foresight or prudence, and that in turn from pro-, ahead” and videre, to see. The current use of the word in the secular sense refers to foresight, or “timely preparation for eventualities”, or (if one is a deist or an atheist) “nature as providing protective care.”  The term Divine Providence was not only used by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. It was often cited by George Washington as well. I know quoting the founding fathers these days is less than politically correct, but I can’t help myself.  “The Man must be bad indeed who can look upon the events of the American Revolution without feeling the warmest gratitude towards the great Author of the Universe whose divine interposition was so frequently manifested in our behalf,” Washington wrote in a letter to Samuel Langdon on September 28, 1789.  It must have seemed like Divine Providence to Washington who should have lost his army and the Revolutionary War on multiple occasions, only to somehow survive to fight another day and ultimately win a war that appeared unwinnable, like that fateful Christmas Night in 1776 when General Washington led 2,400 hungry, ramshackle soldiers across the half-frozen Delaware river in the midst of a storm to mount a surprise attack on Hessian forces in Trenton, New Jersey. It marked a crucial turning point in the Revolutionary War, proving that the underfunded, scrappy Continental army was capable of winning — and became the stuff of American legend, in part due to “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” a monumental painting by German American artist Emanuel Leutze, according to Smithsonian Magazine.  Veering from the Enlightenment’s deistic view of God as uninvolved in the world, many early Americans’ recognized a biblical God or “Divine Providence” who intervenes in the lives, events, and affairs of men. In the midst of a fallen world corrupted by sin, this God supposedly cares for and guides people by His wisdom and love and for His divine purpose, all evidence to the contrary.  What does this so-called divine providence have to say about Vladimir Putin and his ruthless attack on Ukraine, or the lying lies of Donald Trump? Wouldn’t a just God strike them both down with a bolt of lightening, in Trump’s case on the 18th green one stormy Monday at Mar-a-Lago?  What of all the hunger and painful suffering in the world, the poverty and discrimination?  This perspective was acknowledged by the early church, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin, and the colonial American Puritans and Awakeners, at least according to some who promote this optimistic view of the world.  In 1785, James Madison argued against the state support for churches, however, writing a Memorial and Remonstrance that when religious and civil power were intertwined, “What have been its fruits?” Madison asked. “More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.”  This is certainly no less true today.  After all, even if you believe in some form of Christianity or Catholicism, which kind? That of the U.S. Supreme Court, with six Catholic justices? Or the version practiced by the President of the United States himself, Joe Biden, who takes a more liberal view?  Discussing the ongoing debate over raising the debt ceiling, which is about to crash Congress and force the country into a recession — which could very well lead to a global depression from which we may never escape again — Biden suggested, and rightly so, that some Republicans were trying to crash the economy by not raising the borrowing limit, in order to hurt Biden’s hopes of winning re-election. If the nation were to default, Biden said, “I would be blameless” on the merits — meaning that it would be Republicans’ fault.”  But, he said, “on the politics of it, no one would be blameless. I think there are some MAGA Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would do to the economy, and because I am president, and the president’s responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame.”  Biden and McCarthy Set to Resume Negotiations on Debt Limit  The right’s contention that we are a “Christian nation” that has fallen from pure origins and can achieve redemption by some kind of return to Christian values is based on wishful thinking, not convincing historical argument. Writing to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1790, President Washington assured his Jewish countrymen that America “gives…bigotry no sanction.” In a treaty with the Muslim nation of Tripoli initiated by Washington, completed by John Adams, and ratified by the Senate in 1797, the Founders declared that “the government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion….”  Yet old Judge Roy Moore down in Alabama still insists that the only thing that can save America is to put God back on top over government, even though it was never intended that way by those who risked their lives to create this country out of a corrupt monarchy.  If there is some Divine Providence somewhere out there in the universe hiding behind the Pillars of Creation — or a more advanced form of life from a more altruistic species than us — now would be the time to intervene in the affairs of blind, stupid, selfish men. Heed the prayers of the multitudes and save us from ourselves.  If you do nothing, as usual, dog help us. I’m almost done with trying. The rest will be up to you all.        ___  If you support truth in reporting with no paywall, and fearless writing with no popup ads or sponsored content, consider making a contribution today with GoFundMe or Patreon or PayPal.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FtZXJpY2Fuam91cm5hbC5uZXQvMjAyMy8wNS9pcy10aGVyZS1hLWRpdmluZS1wcm92aWRlbmNlLXRoYXQtY2FuLXNhdmUtdXMtZnJvbS1vdXItb3duLXNlbGZpc2gtZGVzdHJ1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-22","11:15:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T20:59:16","Vatican City, May 22, 2023 / 11:15 am (CNA).  The Catholic Church is one step closer to canonizing a surfing saint. Pope Francis recognized the heroic virtue of Brazil’s “Surfer Angel” Guido Schäffer in a decree issued by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on Saturday.  Schäffer was a seminarian, a doctor, and a surfer who drowned while surfing in 2009 off the coast of Rio de Janeiro at the age of 34 before he could fulfill his desire of being ordained to the priesthood.  The Brazilian seminarian, known locally as the “Anjo Surfista” or “Surfer Angel,” used to begin each of his surfing lessons with a prayer and was known for his work with the poor, providing medical care to Rio’s “favelas” (poor, working-class neighborhoods) alongside the Missionaries of Charity.  With the decree, Pope Francis declared Schäffer “venerable.” The Church will now need to approve a miracle attributed to his intercession before he can be beatified.  Born in Brazil on May 22, 1974, Schäffer grew up near the sandy beaches of Rio’s Copacabana neighborhood. His father was a physician and his mother was very active in a charismatic renewal movement in their Catholic parish, Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, and instilled in him a love of Scripture and prayer.  As a student, Schäffer was an active member of a charismatic prayer group called Canção Nova (New Song), founded by Father Jonas Abib. Schäffer later co-founded, together with his girlfriend and a priest known as Father Jorjão, the prayer group “Fire of the Holy Spirit” at a parish in Ipanema the year he graduated from medical school.  During his medical residency from 1999 to 2001, Schäffer worked as a general practitioner at the Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia. He also began volunteering with a Catholic group that provided pastoral ministry to the sick at the hospital.  While on a retreat, Schäffer was moved by a line in the Bible: “Do not turn your face away from any of the poor, so that God’s face will not be turned away from you” (Tobit 4:7). He asked for God’s forgiveness and prayed: “Jesus, help me to care for the poor.”  One week later, he met Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity and soon began working with them to offer medical care in some of Rio’s poorest neighborhoods. He invited other doctors from his hospital to join him and also brought young people from his prayer group and hospital ministry to volunteer.  Sister Caritas with the Missionaries of Charity recalls how Schäffer talked to each of the people he served about Christ, taking care of “both their body and their soul.”  “He used to pray with and for each of them, always inviting them to receive the sacraments as a source of grace and communion with God,” she said.  “His only concern was to save souls to God — guiding as many people as he could to a personal experience with Christ.”  While he was volunteering with the Missionaries of Charity, Schäffer read “Brother Francis of Assisi” by Ignacio Larrañaga, which became a great inspiration for him.  St. John Paul II’s visit to Rio de Janeiro in 1997 and Schäffer’s pilgrimage to Europe for the beatification of Brazil’s protomartyrs in 2000 also played a decisive role in his life-changing decision to leave his profession as a doctor and leave his girlfriend to respond to a call to enter the priesthood.  Schäffer began studying philosophy at the São Bento Monastery in 2002. In between seminary classes, he volunteered at a local hospital. He moved to the Archdiocesan Seminary of São José in Rio de Janeiro in 2008, where he devoted himself to evangelization while continuing his medical volunteering and surfing.  Big wave surfer Rodrigo Resende was impressed by Schäffer’s love for the poor and inner peace. He told the Brazilian publication Veja Rio: “I have never seen someone treat the marginalized with such respect. The inner peace that he radiated was impressive.”  While surfing with friends off of Rio’s Recreio dos Bandeirantes beach on May 1, 2009, Schäffer hit his head on his surfboard and drowned.  In 2019, the beach where he suffered his fatal accident was officially renamed in his honor: Praia do Guido.  Father Jorjão, who has since written a book in Portuguese about his life, reflected: “I have never seen someone with so much faith and at the same time so normal. Anyone who knew him was sure they were dealing with someone from God.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljd29ybGRyZXBvcnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvYS1zdXJmaW5nLXNhaW50LXBvcGUtZnJhbmNpcy1yZWNvZ25pemVzLXRoZS1oZXJvaWMtdmlydHVlLW9mLWd1aWRvLXNjaGFmZmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2018-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Leeds"", ""Leeds"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-22T15:27:00","A year ago today Brentford and Leeds supporters were bemused to see the Brazilian winger sink to his knees on the turf following the Whites’ great escape from relegation, then progress from one end of the pitch to the other. Raphinha scored a vital penalty in a victory that kept Jesse Marsch’s men in the top flight by the skin of their teeth on the final day of the season. He leapt into the away section at full-time to celebrate with fans and then made his pilgrimage along the pitch.  The ‘knee walk’ has long been a religious gesture of gratitude for a promise made to God or some Saint. A spokesperson for the Diocese of Leeds told the YEP last year: “Enduring the discomfort of kneeling to pray, walking on the knees, or walking barefoot are all part of a very long Christian tradition of worship and showing thankfulness and humility before God. People of many cultures and faiths remove their shoes or kneel in a holy place. It’s certainly always been an element Catholic pilgrimages. We have an Annual Diocesan Pilgrimage to England’s National Catholic Shrine at Walsingham, where some pilgrims walk the last mile barefoot. At the site of Our Lady of Fatima’s Shrine in Portugal, pilgrims walk or crawl the last couple of hundred metres of hard marble pathway on their knees.

It’s also a small way some can feel solidarity with the hardships and humiliations of people experiencing poverty or oppression across the world – or simply just a way of humbly giving thanks for prayers answered. Whatever Raphinha’s personal reasons, may God bless him and all who are dear to him!""  And in scenes captured by journalist Nacho Jiménez on Saturday night, Raphinha has once again made his knee walk having this time achieved his goal at the opposite end of a league table. Barcelona were comfortable LaLiga winners, with the former Whites star scoring seven goals and making seven more in his 34 Spanish top flight appearances. It wasn’t quite a perfect debut campaign for Raphinha however. Champions League football was a big part of his move to Camp Nou and though he started four of their six games in the group stages, they progressed no further. Falling into the Europa League brought little joy either, as a loss to Manchester United prevented them from reaching the last 16.  But despite persistent rumours of a potential return to the Premier League this summer, Raphinha is adamant that he is loving life with the Catalan giants and wishes to remain there for ‘many more years to come.’  Without the services of the Brazilian international Leeds have once again struggled this season and find themselves in need of a miracle on the final day. Only a win over Spurs, and a positive result for Bournemouth at Everton, will be enough to keep the Whites up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Jrc2hpcmVldmVuaW5ncG9zdC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9sZWVkcy11bml0ZWQvcmFwaGluaGEtdHVybnMtZmFtb3VzLWxlZWRzLXVuaXRlZC1yZWxpZ2lvdXMtYWN0LWludG8tdHJhZGl0aW9uLWFzLWJhcmNlbG9uYS1jZWxlYnJhdGUtbGFsaWdhLXRpdGxlLTQxNTI4OTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","2023-05-22T00:00:00","Shavuot, or Pentecost, is one of the most important feasts and times of our Judeo-Christian faith.  Pentecost is the timeframe where the Torah was given to Moses on top of Mount Sinai, and years later, is also the same timeframe where the promise of the Holy Spirit was released in the upper room in Acts 2. Pentecost is a time where the nation and kingdom of God is birthed.  God is birthing something new again.  Another Move of God  In this Pentecost season, expect these seven prophetic promises to be fulfilled:  1. Peace upon Israel. “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you!” (Ps. 122:6).  Nearly every year around this Pentecost season, we see something significant take place in the Holy Land. This is not a coincidence but has to do with God’s sovereign timeline of appointed feasts and seasons.  Even in this time of turmoil and crisis among Israel and the surrounding nations, expect peace to come upon Jerusalem! Expect a ceasefire and a demolishing of all enemy forces!  2. Promotions in the Spirit. “When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting” (Acts 2:1-2).  After a period of 10 days from Christ’s ascension and prophecy of promise, there was only 120 who remained in the upper room in Jerusalem out of the initial 500 who had seen and heard.  God is promoting you in the Spirit to receive what you’ve paid the price for. Those who have pressed through and pushed past the attacks will gain double favor and honor!  3. Positions of authority. Moses was called up to Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments, the Law of God, and Peter stood up amongst the crowd and preached with authority before all.  In this Pentecost season, God is anointing certain individuals and ministries to rise up with a new seat of authority and power.  4. Prayers accelerated. “There appeared to them tongues as of fire, being distributed and resting on each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to speak” (Acts 2:3-4).  Pentecost is a time of awakening and renewal. The Holy Spirit baptized the Acts church to speak in heavenly languages.  Your prayers will be effectual and will accelerate God’s kingdom purposes.    5. Power to dismantle demonic forces. “Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added to them” (Acts 2:41).  On the day of Pentecost, 3,000 souls were swept into God’s kingdom from the blindness and the spirit of the age.  Pentecost is the promise of God’s might and power that lives within each and every individual, to dismantle and disrupt all evil forces that surround you.  6. Purity of God’s purposes. The baptism of the fire of the Holy Spirit stands for God’s purity and holiness. God is purifying the church from having mere good religious services to becoming a glorious bride of power and beauty.  God is purifying His people from false alignments, connections and idolatrous religious forms and traditions.  7. Prosperity of God’s people. Every biblical feast has to do with harvest. It is a time of celebration and feasting on God’s abundance, goodness and provision.  This Pentecost season will bless and benefit the people of God with a long and overdue harvest of prosperity and jubilee joy!

"religious miracle","1996-12-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T17:26:01","WASHINGTON — It’s been almost 30 years since a rainbow-hued image on the windows of a Clearwater, Florida, office building drew huge crowds for what many saw as a likeness to an outline of the Virgin Mary.  Spotted in late December 1996 and covered by a local TV station, the image was described first as a Christmas miracle and then fondly as Our Lady of Clearwater.  Crowds came in droves. They prayed, lit candles, and left flowers. Within months, more than 500,000 visitors came to see the image. The city had to install portable restrooms and sidewalks, and a team of local police officers, dubbed “Miracle Management,” was assigned to help with traffic control.  Explanations of the image — at least 50 feet high and more than 20 feet wide — ranged from glass distortion, chemicals in the glass, corrosion of a glass coating, or a stain caused by the building’s water sprinkler, but believers didn’t buy that and instead described the image as a spiritual sign.  At the time, a spokesman for the St. Petersburg Diocese told The Tampa Bay Times: “People should exercise a great deal of heavy skepticism” about the image. The diocese also described the image as a “naturally explained phenomenon.”  There has been no formal investigation by the Catholic Church of apparitional claims with this image.  Five months after it initially made headlines, the image was temporarily defaced by liquids that had been flung at it that cleared a month later after a few big thunderstorms.  Gradually, crowds began waning, and then they did even more so in 2004 after an 18-year-old shattered the top window with a slingshot and ball bearings, breaking the panels that had appeared to be Mary’s head. The panes were restored, but the top of the image was no longer there.  A few years after the image was first seen, the building was leased to a Catholic group called the Shepherds of Christ Ministries, which eventually purchased the building and, at one point, converted the office space into a rosary factory. The group describes itself as a “movement dedicated to the renewal of spiritual life.”  According to its website, the group primarily focuses on the “spiritual welfare of priests.” They publish spiritual books, newsletters, and audio cassettes and promote the rosary, eucharistic adoration, and prayer groups.  Now the Florida office building, named the Mary Image Building, houses a religious gift shop and prayer rooms. The group installed a huge crucifix outside, a statue of Mary, and two grottos.  Doris Jones, president of Shepherds of Christ Ministries, spoke to The Tablet from Indiana, where the group is currently headquartered, on May 11.  “We’re still there,” she said of those praying outside the Clearwater building. She said a small group of people shows up each day outside the office building, and they join in prayer together three times a day.  On the fifth day of each month, there is a special day of prayer at the location when they are joined by a woman who claims to be a visionary and said she has received words from Mary about this specific image.  “Mary is still on the building, even though her head is not there,” Jones said.  She said the image “means a lot to people” and that many who continue to come back are “turning to Mary, asking for help.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhldGFibGV0Lm9yZy9wZW9wbGUtc3RpbGwtcHJheS1hdC1mbG9yaWRhLXNpdGUtd2hlcmUtbWFueS1iZWxpZXZlLW1hcmlhbi1pbWFnZS1pcy1kaXNwbGF5ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2019-05-19","Not Discerned","{""NewYorkCounty"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T19:18:19","Rev. Tim Keller, a pioneering pastor of the multi-site megachurch phenomenon and author whose 28 books on every aspect of Christian life—birth to death, sin to forgiveness—sold in the millions, died May 19. He was 72 and completed his last two titles while enduring treatment for pancreatic cancer.  The New York Times called Keller, a conservative Christian in the Presbyterian Church in America, a ""theorist of Christianity who performed a modern miracle of his own — establishing a theologically orthodox church in Manhattan that attracted thousands of young professional followers."" Keller, who began his career pastoring in Virginia and teaching theology, began his New York City ministry in 1989, launching Redeemer Church. Before retiring from his senior pastor role in 2017, he grew it into a model of the megachurch multi-site worship phenomenon. For decades he spent Sundays giving three or more sermons a day at Redeemer’s multiple sites. ""The core of the multisite concept is that a church must 'reverse the flow.' Instead of drawing people to the church, take the church into their world,"" he told USA Today in 2009 when Redeemer was about to add additional sites and expand internationally.  And all the while he wrote. A PW profile in 2021 tallied his bestsellers. His first title, The Reason for God: Belief in the Age of Skepticism (Dutton, 2008) hit number five on PW’s Bestseller List and sold more than 150,000 copies in its first year. That was followed by more than 20 titles on everything from love to suffering, Christmas to church planting. He hit PW’s list twice more, with Prodigal God (Dutton, 2008) and Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God (Dutton, 2014), both of which surpassed 100,000 copies sold. Keller's last book, written during the difficult days of treatment and released in November, is Forgive: Why Should I and How Can I? When the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association gave him its highest honor, the Pinnacle Award, last year and he accepted the award via video.  Brian Tart, his sole editor from Keller's first book for the Dutton imprint up through Tart's current role as president and publisher of Viking Penguin, said Monday, “Tim had one goal in mind with each book he wrote—to spread the joy and truth of the Gospel to as many people as possible. He was as rigorous and disciplined an author as I have seen, but he was also playful, engaging, humorous, and optimistic about every aspect of his writing. He will be remembered as one of the most influential Christian writers of this age. It has been an honor to publish his books.”  Tart spoke with PW in 2021, when Viking published Keller's book, Hope in Times of Fear: The Resurrection and the Meaning of Easter, about Keller's ability to reach people where they were in life. He said ""That Tim is talking about cancer makes his personal journey to God helpful to people. He is saying ‘I’ve been through a dark time, we all been through a dark time, and yet I feel this great reservoir of hope.”  Collin Hansen, v-p and editor in chief of The Gospel Coalition and author of Timothy Keller: His Spiritual and Intellectual Formation. (Zondervan, out now) told PW, ""When you read a Tim Keller book, you notice the way he weaved between our cultural moment, biblical theology, and pastoral application."" Hansen pointed to four Keller books that stand out to him: ""The Reason for God and The Prodigal God made him famous. The first compiles his answers to common questions fielded over decades in ministry. The second could be considered his spiritual autobiography, his retrospective on the grace that first transformed his life in 1970 as a college student. Next, I'd turn to Center Church, his textbook on ministry that somehow tells you everything you need to know without telling you what to do. Finally, his most forward-thinking book is Making Sense of God. Decades from now he'll still be teaching us, because he anticipated the challenges for Christian ministry in the post-Christendom, post-Enlightenment West.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdWJsaXNoZXJzd2Vla2x5LmNvbS9wdy9ieS10b3BpYy9pbmR1c3RyeS1uZXdzL3JlbGlnaW9uL2FydGljbGUvOTIzNzMtcGFzdG9yLWFuZC1iZXN0c2VsbGluZy1hdXRob3ItdGltLWtlbGxlci1kaWVzLWF0LTcyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2019-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T19:53:08","A new sculpture of a pregnant Blessed Virgin Mary was unveiled and blessed by Cardinal Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington, in front of Theological College, the national seminary of The Catholic University of America, May 17.  Called “Advent” or the “national life monument,” the large bronze statue was presented to the University by acclaimed Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz to be a symbol of “the value and sacredness of life” in the nation’s capital.  Pointing to the image of the Madonna cradling her visible unborn child, Schmaltz told those at the dedication that he wants the image to bring hope to everyone, including people who hold an ambiguous position on life and abortion. Schmalz said he believes that beauty will save the world, and he hopes it can save unborn children as well.  “I thought, if I could create a piece that would just be beautiful … if you would look at it and say, ‘you know that is absolutely beautiful’ — that’s a good use of art work,” said Schmalz. “I look at it as a Madonna and child but hopefully even non-religious people can just simply look and see their mother, or see their future and hope.”  Schmalz said the swirling folds of the bronze statue’s abstract drapery are meant to draw the eye to the stainless steel center womb holding the unborn Christ. For this focal point the artist said he chose a mirrored stainless steel to prominently reflect light to passersby, either from the sun during the day or spotlights at night.  “(I wanted) to show the mysticism and the miracle, the amazing idea of human creation within this sculpture,” said Schmalz.  Cardinal Gregory thanked Schmalz for his generosity and for sharing his artistic gifts before he blessed the statue.  “‘Advent,’ as a pregnant Madonna, transcends bronze revealing a deeper significance, deeper truths of God and of us, and his love for each of us, graced as we are in his image and likeness,” the cardinal said.  The original life monument is installed in Church of San Marcello al Corso in Rome. The University’s version, a gift from Schmalz and his patrons Michael and Carole Ritchie, is prominently placed on the front grounds of the Theological College in the Bleichner Sculpture Garden.  This is the second statue by Schmalz to grace the University property. In 2020, Schmalz gifted the University a second casting of his sculpture “Angels Unawares,” an image of migrants and refugees. The original is located in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.  Others in attendance at the dedication were Cardinal Marc Ouellet, prefect emeritus of the Dicastery of Bishops; Monsignor Walter Rossi, rector of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception; Father Dominic Ciriaco, P.S.S., rector of Theological College; Father Daniel Moore, P.S.S., United States provincial superior of the Society of St. Sulpice, and members of the University community.  Theological College is a national Roman Catholic Seminary, affiliated with The Catholic University of America, that is owned and operated by the Society of St. Sulpice.  In his opening remarks, Father Moore said the statue is a reminder that Christians perpetually live in Advent, or a season of hope.  “(The sculpture) ‘Advent’ conveys an immediate understanding of joy, hope, expectancy, and promise, liturgically, theologically, and humanly,” he said. “(It) moves us beyond the immediate — the present — to the past and our future, grace-filled realities and possibilities.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMuY2F0aG9saWMuZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9uZXctbWFkb25uYS1zY3VscHR1cmUtaG9ub3JzLXRoZS1zYW5jdGl0eS1vZi1odW1hbi1saWZlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T17:02:45","Is Special Divine Action miraculous?  Patheos ST 4144 Miracles 4  From 1987 through 2002, I worked with colleagues on the Divine Action Project (DAP). This project was co-hosted by the Vatican Observatory in Rome and by the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences (CTNS) in Berkeley. We asked: is special divine action miraculous? We answered: no, not necessarily.  DAP question-askers included astronomers, physicists, and biologists along with Thomistic philosophers, Whiteheadian philosophers, systematic theologians, and ethicists. Together we represented Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Russian Orthodoxy, and atheism.  Saint John Paul II, the pope during that era, was intensely interested in the interaction between Christian theology and natural science. At each DAP meeting in Rome, the pontiff greeted us warmly and encouraged our work. To initiate the project, the Holy Father wrote a most insightful foreword to the first volume of our research essays, Physics, Philosophy, and Theology: A Common Quest for Understanding (R. J. Russell 1988).  Here’s what’s important for this Patheos series on miracles: God acts in nature’s world providentially but not necessarily in an interventionist or miraculous way.  So, we tendered the notion that a miracle might not be an intervention into natural processes. We tried to avoid the darkness cast by David Hume’s long shadow. Since Hume’s denial of miracles in the 18th century, theologians have felt compelled to look for gaps in nature’s closed causal continuum wherein God could slip in special action (Tracy 2001, 237). But, according to our DAP scholars, no gaps in nature’s laws are needed to account for God’s providential action.  Notice how open theist Thomas Jay Oord defines miracle so as to avoid entanglement with the laws of nature. “… a miracle is an unusual and good event that occurs through God’s special action in relation to creation” (Oord 2019, 196). We can expect contemporary theologians to avoid violating laws of nature like we can expect our cat to avoid the water in the bathtub.  Where does that leave miracles? Miracles are certainly examples of special divine action. But are miracles natural? Supernatural? Supranatural?  From Newton’s Determinism to Copenhagen’s Indeterminism  Recall from our previous post how David Hume (1711-1776) accepted as dogma the worldview derived from Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727). This is the mechanistic worldview in which the laws of nature function like the gears in a Swiss watch. It’s the clockwork universe. Everything is determined by natural law. There is no room in such a cosmic clockwork for an extra gear or an unpredictable movement. There is no gap within which God can intervene with a miracle.  But a century ago, Newton’s mechanistic model was supplemented with a new understanding of physical reality, namely, quantum mechanics. At the most fundamental level of physical reality—at the level of sub-atomic physics—Newton’s laws of motion do not apply. Repeated experiments demonstrate how electrons and photons do not behave like gears in a Swiss watch. They are unpredictable, at least as individual events. Niels Bohr (1885-1962) and his Copenhagen colleagues found they had to appeal to indeterminism to describe sub-atomic quantum mechanics.  Suddenly, David Hume’s worldview with its closed causal nexus of natural laws lost its boogie-man power to frighten theologians. Even though quantum physics does not open up gaps in natural law, to be sure, looking at nature through the lenses of the new indeterminism nicely accommodates non-interventionist divine action.[1]  Robert John Russell’s non-interventionist objective divine action theory  Right there, where the behavior of sub-atomic particles is underdetermined by past causes, God can act without breaking a law of nature. God can act in the physical world without intervening within the very world that God has created and continues to create.  This is the position developed by Robert John Russell during the course of DAP. Russell calls his theory NIODA, Non-Interventionist Objective Divine Action. And, because atoms are everywhere, God’s purposeful action at the sub-atomic level ramifies throughout the creation. There is no event that you and I experience that is immune from God’s gracious providence.  “God has created a universe ex nihilo such that some natural processes at the quantum level are insufficiently determined by prior natural events. One could say that nature is ‘naturally’ indeterministic. Thus God does not suspend natural causality but creates and maintains it as ontologically indeterministic. God does not violate the laws of quantum physics but acts in accordance with them. In essence, God creates the universe such that quantum events occur without sufficient natural causes and acts within these natural processes and together with natural causes to bring them about” (R. J. Russell, Divine Action and Quantum Mechanics 2001, 295).  Russell names his divine action theory NIODA.  “I call this type of divine action non-interventionist view of objective special providence or non-interventionist objective divine action (NIODA)” (R. J. Russell, Cosmology from Alpha to Omega: The Creative Mutual Interaction of Theology and Science 2008, 117).  Unlike Hume, Russell’s theological account of divine action in nature’s world avoids any conflict with the scientific account of physical causality.  “NIODA in no way runs into conflict with science since it bases its philosophical interpretation of the processes of nature in the theories of the natural sciences” (R. J. Russell, Cosmology from Alpha to Omega: The Creative Mutual Interaction of Theology and Science 2008, 140).  What we need to note here is that Russell has provided us with a sound account of divine action that is neither interventionist nor miraculous. “NIODA is a distinct category from that of miracle,” he says. Russell has identified God’s providential care in terms of “special acts of God that are objective but not miraculous” (R. J. Russell, Cosmology from Alpha to Omega: The Creative Mutual Interaction of Theology and Science 2008, 128-129). It is important to note that Bob Russell does not appeal to quantum indeterminacy to explain miracles.  Does this mean Russell denies miracles? By no means. For Biologos Russell has penned, “Miracles and Science: A Third Way.” What Russell has demonstrated is the plausibility for understanding SDA in a non-interventionist form. Miracles belong in another category. That’s all.  Before we leave Russell, let me share with you a limerick I wrote for Bob’s retirement in 2022.  Quantum mechanics makes physics indeterminist,  Rendering NIODA objectivist but not classicist.  Newton’s world is very odd,  ’cause there’s no room for God.  So, Bob Russell’s a non-interventionist non-fundamentalist.  How are miracles one form of Special Divine Action?  So, we ask: do miracles count as one form of special divine action?[2] Does SDA come in two forms: in a non-interventionist non-miraculous form and an interventionist miraculous form? If so, what’s the difference?  This is one perceptive question posed by Donghwi Kim. As I mentioned in an earlier column post, Donghwi is writing what I deem to be a brilliant doctoral dissertation on this topic, Miracles Reconsidered: A Fresh Assessment from Philosophy, Science, and Theology (Kim 2023). Here is Kim’s definition.  A miracle “is a unique occurrence that happens due to divine will, which is a temporary and inexplicable exceptionto the ordinary course of nature for the purpose of showing that God has acted in history and nature”(Kim, 2023, 432).  Almost Doctor Kim alerts us to the work of DAP philosophical theologian Thomas Tracy. Like St. Thomas Aquinas before him, Thomas Tracy identifies two forms of divine action: direct and indirect. God’s direct action establishes the world in being. That is, God creates our world ex nihilo, out of nothing. But God also engages in continuing creation, in creatio continua. Here in the world’s everyday activities, God works indirectly through natural processes.  God’s indirect action applies to miracles, according to Tracy. Consider the miracle of crossing the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds) in Exodus when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. Here is Tracy’s account.  “When a strong east wind pushes back the water in the shallows of the Sea of Reeds and allows the fleeing Jews to escape from their pursuers, we can say quite straightforwardly that this wind was ‘sent by God’” (Tracy 2001, 241).[3]  The east wind is natural. Deliverance of the escaping Hebrews is no less an act of divine grace because the wind is natural.  Does the parting of the Red Sea by a natural cause count as a miracle? You betcha it does.  Should we add the supranatural to the natural?  Kim is almost, but not quite, happy with Tracy’s account. “I would argue in the same direction of Tracy, but slightly differently,” comments Kim.  “SDA miracles can be equally understood as acts performed by God at a particular space and time, but a miracle as an act distinct from God’s normal activity of the universe should be differentiated from SDA in that, for an observer, a miracle is an objective event that would appear as an intervention, far beyond the natural processes” (Kim 2023, 157).  Kim does not require that a miracle violate a law of nature, to be sure. Yet reducing a miracle to indirect natural causation is unsatisfactory for Kim. So Kim adds a component to a miracle beyond ordinary SDA. Kim requires that the miracle appear to be more than what nature alone can deliver. He adds a supranatural—above natural process—component make clear that the event is a special divine act.  In sum, Kim thinks of “miracles as supra-natural and not contra-natural”(Kim, 2023, 434).  What’s the difference between natural, supernatural, and supranatural?  A century after Hume the French scholar, Ernest Renan, published his life of Jesus, Vie de Jesus (1863). Renan took no interest in miracles because he rejected the very concept of the supernatural. “We reject the supernatural for the same reason that we reject the existence of centaurs and hoppogriffes; and this reason is, that nobody has ever seen them”(Renan, xi-xii). It looks like we need to get more precise on the relationship of the natural to the supernatural or even the supranatural.  Donghwi Kim likes Paul Tillich on this matter. Tillich clarifies so many issues to the benefit of every theologian. Does Tillich help here?  Naturalism is the belief that nature and only nature exists. Naturalists don’t like supernaturalists. Why? Because supernaturalists posit the existence of a second reality. That second reality is usually a spiritual substance thought to be more fundamental than the physical. Supernaturalists are typically substance dualists. Miracles occur, allegedly, when the supernatural intervenes in the natural. Miracles are supernatural events that are contra-natural, according to supernaturalists.  Tillich avoids both naturalists and supernaturalists. There is only one reality, according to Tillich. But that one reality is multidimensional. Does the one reality include what transcends nature? Yes.  The problem with supernaturalism, to repeat, is that it posits two realities, one physical and one spiritual. And God is placed in the spiritual. But, says Tillich, this fails to understand that the divine is not separated from physical nature. Rather, “to call God transcendent…does not mean that one must establish a superworld of divine objects. It does mean that, within itself, the finite world points beyond itself. In other words, it is self-transcendent” (Tillich 1951-1963, 2:7.).[4]  Does the term, supranmatural, help us here? The term, supranatural, is employed by many Tillich disciples to refer God as transcendent yet not remote.  Kim says that ‘supranatural’ (übernatürlich in German) is more inclusive than ‘supernatural’ in that “it does not simply mean ‘above’ (or ‘beyond’) nature but includes…what is natural” (Kim 2023, 4,n.10). To my reading, Kim wants to add supranatural to what is natural to avoid appealing to what is supernatural. This is the way Kim distinguishes a miracle from other SDAs.[5]  So, I ask: is Kim a compatibilist or incompatibilist?  God works in, with, and under natural processes  As we move step-by-step from non-interventionist divine action in the direction of miraculous divine action, we must entertain the notion of compatibilism. Might God’s special action in nature’s world be compatible with nature’s own laws and processes?  One DAP biologist and theologian, the late Arthur Peacocke, would answer affirmatively. Peacocke borrows the Reformation Lutheran doctrine of the real presence in the Sacrament of the Altar, where Jesus’ body and blood are present in, with, and under the bread and the wine. Peacocke applies this sacramental formula to SDA in general. For Peacocke, God acts in, with, and under natural processes without abrogating those natural processes.  “Particular events might occur in the world and be what they are because God intends them to be so, without at any point any contravention of the laws of physics, biology, psychology, sociology, or whatever is the pertinent science for the level of description in question” (Peacocke, God’s Interaction wiht the World: The Implications of Deterministic Chaos and of Interconnected and Interdependent Complexity 1995, 283).  With Peacock might we ask: are God’s miracles compatible with natural processes? Or must we like Hume demand that a miracle abrogate one or more natural law? Must God’s action be incompatible with nature’s processes?  To be consistent, it seems to me, Peacocke would affirm that all divine action is continuous with natural processes. He would not add Kim’s requirement that a special event include a supranatural component. Peacock sees the issue but stops short of taking a definitive stand.  “Can we rule out the possibility that God might intervene, in the popular sense of the word, to bring about events for which there can never be a naturalistic interpretation?….We may well conclude from the historical record, given the growing ability of the sciences to give intelligible naturalistic explanations of an increasingly wide range of phenomena, that there are in the end no events that pass through this sieve, but considerations of this possibility can never be entirely precluded” (Peacocke, Theology for a Scientific Age 1993, 183).  Peacocke, like Tracy, grants that SDA works in concert with natural laws and processes. But, it’s not completely clear that a miracle is simply one more special divine act. Kim wants to add a supranatural component to a miracle. Peacock wants to avoid adding something supranatural, but he stops short of precluding it.  Conclusion  Kim might not be satisfied with the view that God works exclusively “in, with, and under” natural processes. Kim is an incompatibilist. That is, in the case of a miracle, divine action is incompatible with nature’s action. At least on some occasions. “My theory of miracle thus tends to take an incompatibilist position,” writes Kim. “Miracles, are, I believe, events that are performed beyond (or transcending) the normal course of nature, in terms of the correlation between miraculous divine action and the natural order”(Kim, 2023,l 433).  Regarding special divine action in general, I belong in the compatibilist camp. Like Tracy and Peacocke, I affirm that God works compatibly “in, with, and under” natural laws and natural processes. Yet, there are special moments when the new creation breaks into the old creation with dramatic impact. Even if such break-ins seem like miracles to us, they proleptically anticipate what will be new laws of nature eschatologically considered.  ▓  For Patheos, Ted Peters posts articles and notices in the field of Public Theology. He is a Lutheran pastor and emeritus professor at the Graduate Theological Union. He co-edits the journal, Theology and Science, with Robert John Russell on behalf of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, in Berkeley, California, USA. His single volume systematic theology, God—The World’s Future, is now in the 3rd edition. He has also authored God as Trinity plus Sin: Radical Evil in Soul and Society as well as Sin Boldly: Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls. See his website: TedsTimelyTake.com.  Watch for his new 2023 book, The Voice of Public Theology, published by ATF Press.  ▓  Notes  [1] Roger Olson asks, “ Can a modern scientist believe in God and miracles? ” He answers affirmatively. “Now, obviously, readers are going to want names. Here are some. Look them up. Ian Hutchinson of MIT, Ard Louis of Oxford University, Denis Alexander of Cambridge University, Francis Collins of the Genome Project and National Institutes of Health, John Polkinghorne of Cambridge University (retired/deceased).”  [2] Writing for BioLogos, Sarah Lane Richie helps us distinguish general from special divine action. “In academic discussions of divine action, it is common to begin with the supposed distinction between “general” and “special” divine action. General divine action, or providence, is taken to indicate God’s initial act of creation ex nihilo, together with the assumption that God is undergirding and preserving the natural laws that God has set in motion, as it were. This is in marked contrast to “special” divine action, which is depicted as the specific actions God undertakes—either in response to human needs and prayers, or to bring about some divinely intended purpose. Miracles would fall into this category as well.”  [3] Perhaps the miracle is in the timing. Donghwi Kim finds the work of Colin J. Hymphreys illuminating here. The east wind creating dry land within the Red Sea is not miraculous. It’s natural. But the east wind blew at just the exact time the Israelites needed to escape from the Egyptian army. “What happens in the Exodus story is you have event after event after event which occur at just the right time” (Kim 2023, cited p.200).  [4] Patheos columnist James McGrath examines divine action in light of the propensity within science to perceive that nature transcends itself. “What strikes me again and again is how the universe seems to contain such order, beauty and transcendence that it seems to point beyond itself, and such regularity, chaos, law, and intelligibility that it seems to require explanation in scientific terms. For me, it is the desire to do justice to both these aspects of our existence, the simultaneously explicability and mysteriousness of the universe, that keeps me exploring both science and spirituality, both reason and religion, as ways to get to know it and myself better.”  [5] This may not be the way Tillich would proceed. For Tillich a miracle is a sign-event. The miracle points to transcendent reality, to be sure. But it does not exceed let alone violate natural laws or processes. “Miracles cannot be interpreted in terms of a supranatural interference in natural processes” (Tillich 1951-1963, 1.116).

"religious miracle","1944-07-20","Not Discerned","{""BordaDaMata"", ""MinasGerais"", ""Brazil""}","2023-05-22T16:01:58","by Cindy Wooden  VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Pope Francis formally recognized the martyrdom of an Italian priest shot by Nazi soldiers after they discovered he was helping his parishioners hide about 100 Jews.  The martyrdom of Father Giuseppe Beotti, who was arrested and shot July 20, 1944, in Sidolo in northern Italy, was one of nine decrees in sainthood causes Pope Francis signed May 20.  The help Father Beotti “offered to many Jewish people persecuted by the Nazi-Fascists played a decisive role” in his death, according to the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints.  “To give them refuge, the priest had mobilized all the parishioners” and helped them hide and feed about 100 Jews, the dicastery said. “The Germans searched his house, but found nothing,” but they continued to hold him while they gathered information about his activities.  The recognition of his martyrdom clears the way for his beatification.  The eight other decrees signed by the pope involved the recognition that the candidates heroically lived the Christian virtues. A miracle attributed to the candidate’s intercession would be needed for beatification.  The eight are:  — Father Simon Mpeke, known as Baba Simon, a missionary and promoter of interreligious dialogue in Cameroon. He was born “around 1906,” according to the dicastery, and died Aug. 13, 1975.  — Spanish Piarist Father Pedro Díez Gil, a famed teacher and spiritual guide, who was born April 14, 1913, and died Dec. 14, 1983.  — Italian Capuchin Sister Edda Roda, who led missions throughout Italy. During one of her travels, probably in 1994, the dicastery said, she was beaten and raped by three men but told no one except her cousin. A year later, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer and died in 1996 at the age of 55.  — Discalced Carmelite Sister Maria Luiza Rezende Marques, who was born Dec. 24, 1915, in Borda da Mata, Brazil, and died Nov. 14, 2005, was a popular spiritual director and, according to the dicastery, worked hard to ensure the monasteries she led lived the decrees of the Second Vatican Council.  — Arnaldo Canepa, a lay catechist in Rome and founder of the Federation of Rome Oratories, places where teens and young adults could play, learn and pray. He was born Sept. 24, 1882, and died Nov. 2, 1966.  — Guido Vidal Schäffer, a physician and seminarian born in Brazil May 22, 1974; he was known as an avid surfer and surf instructor who always led his students in prayer before getting in the water. He died in a surfing accident in Rio de Janeiro May 1, 2009, shortly before his 35th birthday.  — Maria Cristina Ogier, who was born in Florence, Italy, March 9, 1955. She suffered from a brain tumor as a child and was not well for much of her life. In the midst of Italy’s debate to legalize abortion, she convinced her father, an obstetrician, to get involved; he founded a center that inspired the national pro-life movement. His daughter died in Rome at the age of 18.  — Lorena D’Alessandro, born in Rome Nov. 20, 1964, had bone cancer that led to her having her left leg amputated at the age of 12. She was active in her parish, helping to prepare children for their first Communion. She died in 1981, at the age of 16, from cancer that had metastasized in her lung.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly90aGVsZWF2ZW4ub3JnL3BvcGUtYWR2YW5jZXMtc2FpbnRob29kLWNhdXNlLW9mLWl0YWxpYW4tcHJpZXN0LXNob3QtZm9yLXNhdmluZy1qZXdzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2017-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Ratnagiri"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T14:04:25","In the first week of May, Organiser reported a case from Maharashtra where Missionary preachers were trying to lure innocent Hindus to convert to Christianity. In the same story, we compiled numerous tactics used by missionary preachers to lure other religious people. In this article, we will be talking about the ‘social media’ tactic used by the missionaries.  On May 22, we came across this video on Facebook, posted from a handle named Yeshu Satsang. In the 47-second viral video, a man introduces himself as a Hindu Brahmin, Vishal Sharma. Sharma shares how he remained confused throughout his life until he followed the path to Jesus. He shared; he did not feel the same spirituality towards any deity except Jesus. He urges people to message them so that they can teach, the life-changing lesson to others as well.  Watch the video here  The page Yeshu Satsang on Facebook has 16,000 followers and its ‘about’ section does not has any detail about the people running it, except for the fact that it is a community page. The first post on the page tells how Jesus faced all the punishments to save humans.  Well, this page is luring innocent people to Christianity and even forces them to convert.  It is to be noted that, the primary country/region location of the people who manage this page includes: the United States (10), India (2), Myanmar (1), and Taiwan (1).  In the Train Story reported by Organiser, one can see a video clip where two Hindu women are confronting a missionary preacher who was busy grooming innocent Hindus to convert. In the viral video, the Hindu woman told the preacher, that she knows how missionary conversion activities are rampant in India. She added the preacher should worship their god at their home only; the train is not a place to tell others about god.  The preacher responds by saying, “We are preaching the message of God because we care for Hindus”.  The woman behind the camera tells, “Hindus have gone out of their mind, as they believe in frauds like you to give up their Sanatan Dharma. It is high time, we Hindus are already fighting for our existence, we will not let you run your propaganda in public places.”  She added, “Have you ever seen a Sanatani spreading his religion, forcing his religious beliefs on others like you are doing, Do not take benefit of our silence”.  “We have 108 Crore gods and goddesses in our Dharma, we don’t need any other deity to worship. You, people,  are running your propaganda in exchange for money. This is not allowed in the constitution, don’t brainwash innocent Hindus stop this,” the woman said.  Well, this is not it, there has been a number of practices observed by the preachers selling lessons of Jesus. We compiled some of them here, read:  Grooming by texts and pamphlets  Missionaries send letters to entice locals to convert or produce pamphlets that as this one from Mumbai, A local church in Dharavi (Mumbai) distributed pamphlets bearing the following text: ‘Jesus says I am the path, the truth, and the life. He who has faith in me will live even after death. Jesus cures diseases and relieves from black magic.’ They also distribute Bible and other religious texts at public places like railway and bus stations, busy crossings, or signals. The goal is to ensure that people read these books which are free of cost and are ultimately encouraged to accept Christianity.  The idea of heaven and hell  In their plays, these missionaries promote subtle messages that indicate those who convert to Christianity will instantly be welcomed in heaven, while those who do not are doomed to rot in hell. Hinduism doesn’t base its entire philosophical premise on the concept of hell or heaven; instead, the focus is on the karmic cycle and Aham Brahmasmi.  Missionary services  The biggest of all remains their conversion and soft grooming in missionary human service centres. Be it orphanages, child homes, old age homes, schools, trusts, hospitals or any other institutions. Organiser has reported from time to time, instances where illegal conversion activities were going on under the banner of shelter homes and schools.  Prayers and meetings in tribal belts  The recent practice that has come to light, especially in the tribal regions of the country are prayer meeting. Ironically, these missionaries have captivated unassuming people from the lower to middle classes suffering from health and mental issues.  Drawing similarities between Christianity and Hinduism  Reading verses from the Bible is known in Kerala as Vedapathan (recital from the Vedas). Tirthakshetra (Pilgrimage Site) has been displayed over some of the churches. Throughout southern India, many Churches have renamed themselves Ashrams. Ironically, priests and nuns have popularized themselves as Acharyas and Sadhvis. Most often, they decorate their premises with oil diyas instead of candles. Some of the organizations have employed Hindu terms like Ishavani and Shrivani rather than Nobelium because this develops a better connection with the people and makes them see the similarities between Christianity and Hinduism.  Enticement  The promise of a job, a better future, health benefits and education, is in general the basic alluring tactic that is used by the missionary people. Organiser reported a case from the tribal belt of Madhya Pradesh, where a man was offered all of this in exchange for conversion. Enticements are given to people affected by calamities natural calamities like tsunamis, and earthquakes. In Tamil Nadu also, this Tsunami was used as an opportunity for conversion.  Miraculous activities  ‘In Kerala, especially in the localities of poor Hindus near the coastal belt, the church has kept ‘miracle boxes’. Hindus there are asked to write their wishes on a piece of paper and drop it in this box. Innocent Hindus write things such as ‘I want a fishing boat, I want money to pay school fees of my children’, and drop them in these ‘miracle boxes’.  Christian Conversion and Punjab  The fraudulent missionaries in Punjab use dubious techniques like shows of miracles and giving guarantees of cures for terminal illnesses etc., to attract innocent people most of the lower segment of society and mislead them into conversion. In many cases, the lure of migration is used as the bait. There are also reports of the use of force to engineer conversion.  Since the church has a massive following from among the Dalit community which has been converted to Christianity in Jalandhar, the idea behind a new party is being seen as an attempt to tap this vote-bank in the Jalandhar bypoll.  Surprisingly, Punjab, unlike many other States of the country, does not have an anti-conversion law. Even though there is demand for the same from some quarters, the larger opinion goes against the same since the region has, for millennia, been a hub centre of religious diversity and the peaceful co-existence of many communities and religions. If somebody wishes to convert out of conviction it will not be contested in Punjab, the conflict is with regard to the use of dubious means.  There is a strong need to curb the activities of devious elements who are misleading people for personal gains and in a manner that is not condoned by their own Church. In such cases, the intervention of the Government on grounds of deceitful and fraudulent activity is within the ambit of the law which provides for the Government to book people for superstitious practices in the name of religion; this clause should be used extensively by the State Government. The upcoming Christian Deras also need to be kept under scrutiny to ensure that they do not become centres of criminality, exploitation and extortion as was the case with many others before them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL29yZ2FuaXNlci5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi8xNzUwOTAvYmhhcmF0L3JlbGlnaW91cy1jb252ZXJzaW9uLW5vdy1taXNzaW9uYXJpZXMtdXNpbmctc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXRvLWNvbnZlcnQtaW5ub2NlbnQtaGluZHVzLXRvLWNocmlzdGlhbml0eS_SAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9vcmdhbmlzZXIub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvMTc1MDkwL2JoYXJhdC9yZWxpZ2lvdXMtY29udmVyc2lvbi1ub3ctbWlzc2lvbmFyaWVzLXVzaW5nLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS10by1jb252ZXJ0LWlubm9jZW50LWhpbmR1cy10by1jaHJpc3RpYW5pdHkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-04-09","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","2023-05-22T17:00:13","By Dr. Ben Stubblefield  Visiting assistant professor of Christian Studies, University of Mobile  DO YOU LOVE ME?  John 21:15–23  Do you? (15–17)  In many ways, John’s narrative reaches a natural conclusion in 20:30–31. This is why scholars refer to chapter 21 as John’s epilogue, bookending the prologue of John in 1:1–18.  Chapter 21 opens with a scene of the disciples fishing. I think it is reasonable to suggest that the disciples are flirting with returning to their former ways of life.  They are elated in the resurrection but unsure of what they are supposed to do next. So they turn to fishing because they are, after all, by trade fishermen. But they catch no fish until Jesus’ miracle, at which point Peter hurries to shore.  This miracle is important because it mirrors the event described in Luke 5 early in Jesus’ ministry when He calls the men to become His disciples. More importantly, it is after that great catch that Jesus initially commissions these men to lay down their nets and become “fishers of men” (Luke 5:10).  It is likely that Jesus performs this miracle after His resurrection in order to reorient, reclaim and remind His disciples of what He has called them to do. He is not done with them yet. They cannot go back to bringing fish into nets when the Lord has anointed them to bring people into the Kingdom.  As the lead apostle, Peter, who has betrayed the Lord most deeply, must undergo a similar kind of reclamation.  It was three times and over a charcoal fire that he denied the Lord. Thus, Jesus extends to him a redemption over a charcoal fire (v. 9), asking him three times if he would love, instead of deny, Him.  Will you? (18–19)  Our Lord continues to commission and prepare Peter for a future of difficulty and death.  Few of us would want to consider what kind of death looms ahead of us, and it would be difficult to get catalyzed to serve a King with faithfulness who forecasts our martyrdom. But that is exactly what Peter hears from Jesus, and that is exactly the kind of leader for the Church that he becomes.  The Lord calls to Peter, “Follow me!” Those are the same words with which Jesus began summoning His disciples, and they are fitting words with which to end His instructions to them.  At the core of Christ’s ministry, that is His invitation.  What about …? (20–23)  Here we might understand Peter to be complaining about his prognosis, but I think it is better to understand him as curious. John is very close to Jesus (13:23–25; 19:26–27). So if fellowship with Jesus will lead in time to Peter’s death, it’s normal to wonder what might happen to John.  But Jesus redirects Peter to consider his future in the Kingdom and no one else’s. Comparisons cause controversy, jealousy and greed. The Lord, therefore, reminds Peter that his job is to follow and let Him handle John.  It may seem a strangely trivial way to end a Gospel, but this moment was crucial for the early church. As Christianity expanded, there was clearly an opportunity for squabbling among its central leadership.  The early apostles could have hindered the growth of the Church by fostering their own sense of self-importance. Instead, they saw themselves as followers of Christ with a particular calling and mission to fulfill. How helpful would such an attitude be for us.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWxhYmFtYWJhcHRpc3Qub3JnL2V4cGxvcmUtdGhlLWJpYmxlLXN1bmRheS1zY2hvb2wtbGVzc29uLWZvci1tYXktMjgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"religious miracle","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Cascia"", ""Umbria"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-22T11:39:15","Seek Santa Rita, Patron Saint of Impossible Causes, who despite bitter suffering, worked countless miracles and was always full of joy, suggested Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, the Vatican's Prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, during the Mass he celebrated for the beloved Saint's Liturgical Feast, today, 22 May, in Cascia, Italy.  By Deborah Castellano Lubov  Seek Santa Rita, convinced that as Patron Saint of Impossible Causes, she can continue working her miracles today.  This was an invitation offered by the Vatican's Prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, during the beloved Saint's Liturgical Feast, today, 22 May, during his homily in Cascia, Italy. Rita was born in 1381, near the Umbrian town of Cascia, in the village of Roccaporena.  The Cardinal expressed gratitude for the invitation to celebrate the Eucharist with the faithful of Cascia, and all the pilgrims who traveled there, on the feast of this saint, who is ""so universally known, loved, and invoked.""  In preparing for this event, he recalled his review of the records printed for her canonization, as he praised the intense life of the saint, who was a spouse, widow, and consecrated, and her stigmata.  He recalled how Pope St. John Paul II emphasized that the stigmata shining on her forehead is ""the authentication of her Christian maturity."" The Lord, he continued, ""gave Saint Rita the grace 'to bear in her heart and on her forehead, the signs of Christ's love and passion.'""  Before Rita was a religious sister, she had been in a terrible marriage, where her husband was abusive. He died, but also dying were Rita's two sons, shortly after her spouse died, leaving her alone.  United to Christ, like the branch to the vine  The Cardinal recalled how the Gospel passage tells of Jesus reminding us that we must be united to Him like the branch to the vine.  ""Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing"" (Jn 15:4-5).  The Cardinal said, ""St Augustine, and with St Rita we are certainly in an Augustinian context, preached that 'we all together, united to our Head, are Christ,"" and that ""without our Head, we are worth nothing."" ""Why?"" Semeraro asked, ""Because with our Head, we are the vine; without our Head, we are broken branches, destined not for some work of the farmer, but only for the fire.""  That is why, Cardinal Semeraro stressed, the Lord says in the Gospel: ""I am the vine, you are the branches, my Father is the farmer; and He adds: without Me you can do nothing'.  Despite bitter suffering, a model full of joy  We must apply what St Augustine said, the Vatican Prefect insisted, to all of us, underscoring that, in this way, St Rita is a great model for us, as she lived the charity of Jesus Christ toward her neighbours.  He recalled how Rita once saw a poor man in the winter who trembling for lack of clothes, and gave him one of her garments.  From the Gospel proclamation, we also heard another word: ""I have told you these things that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full""  Pope Francis' Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium ('The Joy of the Gospel'), the Cardinal recalled, opens with these words: ""The joy of the Gospel fills the heart and the whole life of those who encounter Jesus. Those who allow themselves to be saved by Him are freed from sin, from sadness, from inner emptiness, from isolation. With Jesus Christ joy is always born and reborn"" (Evangelii gaudium, no. 1).  Despite the bitter suffering caused to her by the stigmata, he underscored, she personified this, as she was always full of joy.  “Despite the dramas and sorrows that accompanied the events of her life, she 'had joy in her heart and spread it around her.”  Impossible causes, miracles  The Vatican prefect recalled her ability to bring miracles in the seemingly most impossible of circumstances.  One day in the month of January, a cousin of St. Rita's came to the Convent to visit her briefly, at a time of great suffering. The cousin asked St. Rita if she could do anything to help her, to which Rita welcomed the offer to ask her cousin to bring her a rose from the garden from her old home in Roccaporena.""  Considering it was wintertime, the climate in Roccaporena would have been very cold. Despite trying to manage Rita's expectations by voicing her skepticism that she would find a rose, Rita responded that ""nothing is impossible for God.""  Site of Devotion for Santa Rita  This reassurance encouraged the cousin to go to the garden, where she would see and pluck a perfect rose, which she would bring to Rita in Cascia. To commemorate this miraculous event, each 22 May, roses are blessed each year in all the churches of the Augustinian Order on the feast of St. Rita, according to Catholic tradition.  Another miracle took place in January, when St. Rita asked her cousin to bring two figs from the garden. Again, the cousin would find, on a frozen fig tree, beautiful figs and bring them back to Santa Rita.  Cardinal Semeraro concluded his homily by urging all faithful to turn to Santa Rita, and invoking, through her intercession, the same joy for us, our families, for the diocesan Community, and the entire Holy Church.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhdGljYW5uZXdzLnZhL2VuL2NodXJjaC9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDUvdmF0aWNhbi1zYWludHMtcHJlZmVjdC1jYXJkaW5hbC1zZW1lcmFyby1wcmFpc2VzLXNhaW50LXJpdGEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If it wants to remain a democratic state, it cannot forever rule over five million Palestinians and deny them citizenship and the rights that go with it.  NEW YORK – Religion and miracles often go hand in hand, so it should come as little surprise that the Jewish State, which just marked its 75th birthday, is something of a miracle. In some ways, Israel’s very existence is miraculous, as the newborn state only narrowly avoided being strangled in the crib by the much larger armies of its Arab neighbors, which invaded in May 1948.  Since then, Israel has weathered many more wars, along with a host of lesser attacks. But the larger story is that Israel has not only survived but thrived.  Today, it is a country of nearly 10 million people. It is a democracy in a part of the world dominated by authoritarian regimes. Despite not having any natural resources to speak of, its economy, boasting a world-class technology sector, is booming. Annual GDP per capita is around $55,000, putting it among the world’s top 20 countries, ahead of Canada, Japan, and much of Europe.  Israel’s extraordinary accomplishments are one reason that many of Israel’s Arab neighbors have come to accept its existence. Israel now enjoys formal peace with Egypt and Jordan as well as with Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. It has informal and growing ties with other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, as the region’s focus adjusts to a reduced American presence and with Israel seen as an important partner in efforts to confront threats posed by Iran.  But Israel’s future remains uneasy and uncertain.  First, there are the continuing external threats. This includes Syria, which has become a safe haven for Iranian proxies amid its civil war, and Lebanon, where Hezbollah has established what is effectively an Iranian-backed state within a state just across Israel’s northern border, with more than 100,000 rockets pointed south. As for Iran itself, the Islamic Republic now can produce in a matter of weeks enough enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs, meaning it is nearing the capability to threaten Israel with an attack.

This is largely the result of the June 1967 Six-Day War, a conflict that changed Israel’s trajectory.  There are now some five million Palestinians living in lands occupied by Israel. Negotiations to create a separate Palestinian state came close to succeeding on several occasions. I would argue that Palestinians’ refusal to accept what was offered (however imperfect) reflected a colossal failure of leadership; but however we reached this point, it is clear that prospects for a two-state solution are increasingly remote given Israeli and Palestinian politics alike.  This is obviously bad for Palestinians, but it is also bad for Israel’s democracy and security. Continued occupation will require a major, and perpetual, military presence and weaken Israel’s standing in the world.  A third challenge is internal. Israel was founded largely by Jewish refugees from Europe. Subsequent large waves of immigrants came from the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. Today’s Israel is made up of these immigrants and their descendants, along with Christians and Muslim Arabs (often called Israeli Arabs or Israelis of Arab descent) and their descendants who were living within Israel’s modern borders before and after 1948.  The result is that Israel is approaching fundamental choices about its identity. If it wants to remain a democratic state, it cannot forever rule over five million Palestinians and deny them citizenship and the rights that go with it. But if it wants to remain a Jewish state, it cannot rule over a country that adds five million Palestinians to its existing population of two million Israeli Arabs. Something has to give.  There is one additional dynamic: the rapid growth of the ultra-orthodox Jewish population, which now includes some 1.3 million, or 14%, of Israelis. Their religious views exert a major influence on their views about how Israel ought to be organized and run.  While military service is mandatory for Israelis, there is an exception for the ultra-orthodox, most of whom choose not to serve. Many of them study and pray rather than work or otherwise contribute to the economy. Through the political process, they seek to bring about a society in which religious interests, as they perceive them, take precedence over the desires of secular Israelis. Demographic trends suggest that they could eventually succeed.  The result is that Israel at 75 faces challenges that are no less existential than those posed by the invading armies during its early history. Recent protests over proposed changes that would increase political control over what has been a highly independent judiciary highlight that Israel is a polarized democratic country. Alas, it is far easier to describe the problems than to suggest how they might be resolved.  All this has created a new issue. Israel has accomplished most of what it has through its own efforts, but it has been aided for most of its history by the substantial economic, military, and diplomatic support of the United States, and by the philanthropy of American Jews. It is increasingly unclear whether such support will be as forthcoming if Israel is viewed as undemocratic and embracing religious extremism.  All this will worry Israel’s many friends around the world who admire the country’s achievements and wish it well. Less certain is whether it will also worry Israelis enough for them to make some difficult but necessary choices.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm9qZWN0LXN5bmRpY2F0ZS5vcmcvY29tbWVudGFyeS9pc3JhZWwtYXQtNzUtYmlnLWFjaGlldmVtZW50cy11bnNvbHZlZC1wcm9ibGVtcy1uZXctY2hhbGxlbmdlcy1ieS1yaWNoYXJkLWhhYXNzLTIwMjMtMDXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There aren’t many who excel in all of the above. And there are even fewer whose words measure up to their work behind the camera. Although Jerry Jacka was humble about his writing skills, and he’d be the first to tell you that his wife, Lois, could write circles around him — she can write circles around most people — his command of vowels and consonants was on par with his ability to capture a sunset over Walpi village. As you’ll see, Jerry could photograph anything, and he could write a nice story, too.  There is an uncanny balance between man and nature in the Hopi country. In summer it is hot and dry — very dry. Through the day, hot dry breezes sap the moisture from soil and vegetation. Later in the afternoon, giant thunderheads peer over the mesas, only to spread a few light showers upon the parched land; then they retreat to the north and east, hoarding their precious cargo of rain.  Dry as it may be, green patches of corn grow everywhere … on sandy hills and plains, on the banks of dry washes and even in the very bottoms of dry sandy creek beds. There are also fields of squash, beans and melons; but most of all, corn.  How do the Hopi people grow this corn? How long have they farmed this land? And why do they continue to farm under these most difficult conditions? For answers we must go to the Hopi villages, look into the heritage of the people and into the depth of their spiritual understanding and reverence for life.  Perhaps the single most important factor underlying the success of the Hopi farmer is his adaptability to the environment. The Hopi have learned to respect and live in close harmony with their land. To them, everything in nature is important and part of a well-balanced plan. The sky, with its stars and clouds; the Father Sun, the Mother Earth and all things which live upon it; even the sand and stone have significance.  Corn is a tradition and a way of life among the Hopi. These green stands of corn are a product of centuries of farming experience, handed down through the many generations.    Hopi farmer Leslie Koyawena hangs harvested corn for drying. In 1978, the tribe’s harvesting process was similar to the one used 1,000 years earlier, Jacka wrote.    They are the result of careful planting practices and patient, continuous care of the fields, not unlike the loving care a Hopi mother gives her child. But this is not all. In order to be successful, the Hopi farmer would be the first to admit, he must also have the help of a power much greater than that of mortal man. This is acquired through religion, ceremonies and prayers.  Evidence of this deep abiding faith can be heard in the distant rhythmic sounds of a drum and the song of the kachinas, which, on a still day, might be heard coming from the mesas overlooking the fields. Too, there are pahos (prayer sticks), which are carefully placed in shrines, some in fields and others in various sacred locations throughout the land — the Hopi’s constant prayer for rain, good crops and all that is good ... for all people.    He (the little chipmunk) took his sacred corn meal in his right hand and stood over the plant and said his prayers in silence. Then, he threw the meal high up toward the sky. Then the others followed.  — from Truth of a Hopi, by Edmund NEQUATEWA    The origin of Hopi corn has its roots in prehistory. In the legendary underworld of Hopi genesis, corn was used prior to their emergence on the face of the Earth. Scientists, however, have yet to affix a date to man’s first use of corn in the Southwest, though archaeological evidence dates the use of a very primitive type of corn as far back as 2500 B.C. This “pod corn” was very small and each kernel was individually sheathed, unlike the modern-day variety, which has an individual husk over the ear.    On the fourth day all the tribes came together — Navajo, Supai, Paiute, Apache, Zuni, Utes and the Bahana (white man). When they came up, the chief had all the different kinds of seeds of corn and grain, of melon and fruit, laid out for them to choose. Then he asked the different tribes to step forward and take their choice.  The Navajo slipped forward hurriedly and picked out the largest ear of corn, which he thought was the wise thing to do. But the chief and the others knew that the long ear of corn could not last long and was not easily raised. Afterward the rest of the tribes took their choice in turn.  The Hopi took the shortest ear of corn and also squash and beans. The Apache didn’t take any, for they said they would rather live on game. Supai took some peaches — he preferred the fruit most. The Zuni took corn and wheat. Paiute didn’t take any — he, too, said he would rather live on wild game and fruit. Utes didn’t take any either. The Bahana took his choice last and was rather slow and considered well and finally he took some wheat which was not so heavy and he could carry more of it than the corn.  — from Truth of a Hopi    With time, new and more adaptable varieties of corn began to appear, and by the time of Christ, corn was probably beginning to be cultivated widely throughout the Southwest. It was during this period that cultures in the Southwest began to change. Agriculture, in particular the growing of corn, enabled a people who once were forced to devote most of their time to food-gathering to pursue new interests and rechannel energies to more diversified activities. These ancestors of the Hopi experienced the beginnings of new lifestyles and slowly, the era of the great pueblos blossomed. Undoubtedly, the importance of corn grew along with these new cultures.    There is my field. It is by an old ruin. This is where my clan people once lived. They grew corn here … as I do now.  — Hopi Farmer  The growing of Hopi corn today, although heavily influenced by the white man, bears remarkable similarities to the process used 1,000 years ago.  Most fields still are under control of the clans, having been passed down through generations of female lineage. Since the Hopi Society is matrilineal, field ownership is vested in the women. New farming plots may be utilized, but only with the sanction of clan leadership.  Hopi corn fields today range in size from one-half acre to ten or more acres. Site selection is usually based upon the capacity of the soil to retain water and the availability of water from surface runoff.  The choice of plots and growing techniques vary slightly between farmers of the three Hopi mesas, this being due, in part, to variance in general terrain. However, great differences occur at Moenkopi (meaning “place of the flowering stream”), a village on the far west end of the reservation where Hopi farmers are able to irrigate their crops, and at the villages of Hotevilla, Bacobi, and Sheep Spring, where terraced gardens are spring-fed.  Prior to planting, men, women and children clear the fields of weeds by hand. With few exceptions, Hopi farmers do not enjoy the luxury of mechanized farm equipment, or even a horse or mule. Those few who do own tractors often use them only for initial field preparation, carrying out the planting and subsequent tasks by hand.  Planting time, itself, is determined by the position of the rising sun in relationship to fixed landmarks on the eastern horizon. In fact, this centuries-old method of determining “time” is used to begin ceremonies and other major events as well.  The person responsible for keeping track of the sun’s path is called the Sun Watcher or Sun Chief (Tawawunitaka). When the sun is right, the Sun Watcher informs the appropriate leader or “crier” who announces the beginning of the event.  At Second Mesa, the village chief (Kikmongwi) of Shongopovi is the Sun Watcher. From high on top of the village roofs, he sings a prayer song that announces the beginning of the planting season. The bear clan is the first to plant at Second Mesa. Members of the other clans, men and boys alike, join in a “planting party” to assist this “chief clan” with their initial planting. Then the other clans can begin their planting.  Each year there are two plantings of corn. The first or “early” planting is usually in mid-April. This crop produces some corn for general use and, perhaps of more importance, it furnishes corn and green corn stalks for the Niman kachina ceremony or Home Dance in July. This is the last of the major ceremonies of the Hopi kachina cycle. The dance, itself, acknowledges the sources of heat, moisture, germination and magnetic forces of the air. The main corn crop then is usually planted in late May or early June.  The traditional planting stick is still used extensively. It is usually made from the stalk of salt brush two to three feet in length and sharpened to a wedge-shaped point at one end. Evidence of the planting stick in the Southwest has been found, placing it as far back as 300 to 400 B.C. It is likely that it is as old as domesticated maize itself. In some cases, today, wood planting sticks are being replaced by short lengths of pipe or metal rod, flattened to a point at one end.  Considering the method used, the Hopi farmer plants his corn with remarkable speed. The crop is usually planted in rows, each about four paces apart. First a thin layer of soil is removed, either by hand or hoe, leaving a shallow indentation. Then, with the aid of the planting stick, a small hole is dug in the ground, usually to the depth of eight inches or more, until moist sand is found. When the hole is at the desired depth, the soil at the bottom is loosened with a few last strokes of the stick, and a handful of kernels, usually eight to twelve, is placed in the bottom of the hole. The moist soil removed from the hole then is replaced directly on the kernels and the hole is filled with the remaining soil.  The original caption for this photo of Hopi farmer Leslie Koyawena included this quote: “With corn ... we pray for all life, all people, not just Hopi.”  Two key factors in a successful planting are surrounding the seed with moist soil and sufficiently warm temperatures, both of which are necessary for germination.  Planting is done by the men and boys of the clan. Quite often, Hopi men will farm several fields alone or with the help of one or two boys. Occasionally, planting parties made up of groups of farmers, families and neighbors will assist one another in planting larger fields.  Occasionally a corn planting dance is performed by the kachinas. Following this, they proceed to the fields to plant corn. The planting usually concludes about noon when the kachinas return to the village to dance until sundown.  When planting is finished, a feast is given for all who took part in the day’s work. The supper table is plentifully stocked with a large variety of food, including fresh baked bread, piki, fry bread, mutton or beef stew, hominy, beans, pies, cakes, coffee — and more. Frequently, a bowl of water is placed with each table setting. Each person sprinkles a liberal amount of sweet corn meal in the water which then serves as a beverage.  At this point, the Hopi farmer’s work has actually just begun; for nature challenges his skill with a number of obstacles, any of which can easily destroy an entire crop: the moisture-robbing winds can be a constant threat to the small shoots as well as the mature ears of corn; worms, kangaroo rats and gophers often attack the plant roots from below; rabbits and prairie dogs may nibble away at the top, while armies of ants tackle the entire corn stalk — even the seemingly immortal weeds may appear once again. And then, there is the rain ... either not enough or a cloudburst which can wash away an entire field of young corn.  The Hopi farmer deals with these problems in two ways. He utilizes his skills and ingenuity as a farmer, taking advantage of his own past experiences, plus those of his forefathers. And, of equal importance, he relies upon his religion. The entire growing cycle, from planting to harvest, is paralleled with a series of ceremonies and prayers.  When the planting is over, you go pray for rain — every day. That’s why we perform all kinds of ceremonies. Even the social dances ... the ladies are praying for things that benefit our children, especially the rain. The rain is the main thing. Rain can help our life. When our crops are up, we feed our families and feed our people.  — Hopi Farmer    As it is throughout the world, and for countless ages of the past, the harvest is a time of thanksgiving … and more hard work. The Hopi harvest is quite often a family affair, where young and old alike help. Other times a farmer may gather his crop alone over a period of days or even weeks, as time allows. The ears of corn may be picked, sheath and all, to be dried or husked in the field before they are taken home. Or as happens occasionally, the entire corn stalk will be picked for use in ceremonies, such as when Niman kachinas carry green corn stalks into the village plaza as ritualized gifts for family and friends.  After the harvest, colorful Hopi corn may be seen drying on rooftops and tables or hanging from rafters throughout the villages — a truly beautiful sight, and no doubt a rewarding one to those who have worked so hard. Again, there is feasting.    Norma Ami grinds corn for piki, a paper-thin bread.    When the drying period is over the kernels are shucked by the women and the healthiest corn is set aside for future plantings. Other kernels are ground into meal for ceremonial use and for bread, cakes, mush and piki (a wafer-thin bread made of a batter of blue corn meal and ashes).    Early in the morning my mother used to grind the corn with her stones and make the corn meal out of it. And make the blue marbles, you know, Povolpiki … It’s good. But now we haven’t got much Hopi food. Now we eat like the bahana … eggs, potatoes, food from cans. My grandma, she used to have peaches, dried peaches to boil … and with the white corn meal she would make pikami ... but no coffee.  — Hopi Farmer    In ceremonies, the use of corn and corn symbols seem endless. Corn meal is a symbol of fertility and friendship, and also serves as ceremonial body makeup. Corn stalks are used during kachina ceremonies and corn husks in the making of pahos and parts of various ceremonial dress. An ear of corn will be placed with a newborn baby, symbolizing a spiritual relationship with the Earth, and one is given to each child at the time of initiation. Ears of corn also are carried by kachina dancers and are used extensively in a host of other ceremonies. Corn pollen, itself, is used symbolically in christenings, and young Hopi girls grind corn for four days as part of their initiation into womanhood. Symbols of corn appear on garments, headpieces and wands used during ceremonies and on altars.  While some of its meaning has been lost in time, additional knowledge concerning the ceremonial uses of corn is closely guarded within the confines of the pueblo kivas and by those entrusted with the perpetuation of religious life. Thus the complete story of Hopi corn — and its special value to other Indian tribes, as well — will probably never be revealed.    This old man at the rock under the fir trees would sprinkle  corn meal on the trees and they would grow about an inch  or two, and by the time the kachinas got there, they were quite tall trees …  — from Truth of a Hopi    Nurtured over the centuries into a nourishing and beautifully variegated maize, corn has had a strong influence on the people of this land. Perhaps no other single item has played so important a role in the development of a culture, a role that continues to be important even today.  Why does the Hopi farmer in this 20th century continue to plant his corn in sandy washes, on hills and plains with the aid of a planting stick? Why does he continue to struggle with the obstacles that make his task so great?    With the corn, we pray from it for rain. We pray from it for all life … all that is living … pray for the benefit of the people, all people, not just Hopi.  — Hopi Farmer    HOPI FARMING TODAY  Although Hopi people have been farming their land in much the same way for centuries, things can change. To get a sense of what may have shifted in the 40 years since this story first appeared, we asked Steven Lomadafkie to take a look. Mr. Lomadafkie is a teacher and the greenhouse manager at Moenkopi Day School, where, among other things, his students nurture cottonwood seedlings for restoration projects on Hopi tribal land. Here’s what he had to say after reading Jerry’s story:  “I was impressed with Mr. Jacka’s knowledge, and his understanding of how important heirloom Hopi corn is to the Hopi way of life. I also appreciated his sincerity. I believe stories like The Miracle of Hopi Corn can inspire future generations of Hopi farmers to carry on the traditional way of farming in this harsh environment. Of course, tractors are almost the norm in farming the land today, but there are some farmers who hold on dearly to and pass along the knowledge of traditional farming methods. For me, personally, this story has inspired me to continue the traditional way of farming. It’s worked for thousands of years, so why not today?”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyaXpvbmFoaWdod2F5cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJhY2xlLWhvcGktY29ybtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I thought I saw a foot, but I just paused because, you know, it’s not every day you look into a coffin,” she recounted. “So there’s kind of a sense of a little bit of hesitation — what am I going to see?”  Mindful of the crack and the dirt in the coffin, the sisters carefully removed the body. The skeletal remains should have weighed about 20 pounds. Instead, the sisters were lifting what they estimated to be a body weighing “between 80-90 pounds,” the abbess said.  Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster's former grave at the monastery for the Benedictine Sisters of Mary, Queen of the Apostles, in Gower, Missouri. Credit: Kelsey Wicks/CNA  The sisters have since produced a fact sheet to answer questions about the exhumation.  “Not only was her body in a remarkable preserved condition, her crown and bouquet of flowers were dried in place; the profession candle with the ribbon, her crucifix, and rosary were all intact,” the sisters reported.  “Even more remarkable was the complete preservation of her holy habit, made from natural fibers, for which she fought so vigorously throughout her religious life. They synthetic veil was perfectly intact, while the lining of the coffin, made of similar material, was completely deteriorated and gone.”  Abbess Cecilia stressed that the preservation of the habit is a large part of what she sees as miraculous, because the habit is “a beautiful sign that this life is not all there is.”  “People see us and it’s like ‘Oh, she’s a sister, oh she’s wearing that because she’s giving her life, she believes in God. Maybe I should think about God,’” she said, noting that the habit is “a sign of the things to come, of the supernatural and of our last end: heaven, hell, purgatory.”  “This is not possible,” she said of the incorruptible sister’s body. “God is real. He protected that body and that habit to enkindle our faith, to rekindle it, to bring people back to the faith.”  (Story continues below)  What comes next?  “You can’t Google ‘what do you do with an incorrupt body?’” Abbess Cecilia said, “so we started with the basics, just cleaning her with hot water because clinging to her face was basically a mask of thick mold.”  This process as well as exposure to the air caused the body to lose some but not all of its volume, and as a result a darkening of the skin also took place.  For the time being, the sisters have crafted a wax mask for Sister Wilhelmina’s face. One of her eyes — both were found to still exist, along with eyelashes and eyebrows — was sunken in by the weight of the dirt within the casket. The sisters also coated her hands with wax.  The body will be laid out in the sisters’ chapel until May 29, when the sisters plan a rosary procession. After the procession, Sister Wilhelmina’s body will be encased in glass” near the altar of St. Joseph in the chapel in order to “welcome her growing number of devotees,” according to the sisters’ fact sheet.

"religious miracle","2000-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Cannes"", ""ProvenceAlpesCoteDAzur"", ""France""}","2023-05-22T00:44:41","Photo via A24  Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh has arrived at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, to the delight of pretty much everyone. In an interview with Variety, she discussed her first experience at the festival and why she feels optimistic about the direction of the film industry.  Considering that last week’s coverage of Cannes was dogged with controversy over the French celebrating Johnny Depp and other alleged abusers, as well as some disappointing notes for the new Indiana Jones movie, Yeoh’s presence feels like a ray of sunshine — in a literal sense for attendees, as her interviewer credited Yeoh with finally bringing some good weather to the Palais des Festivals when she flew in over the weekend.  Among the many topics discussed, Yeoh dug into her first experience with the festival, which took place 23 years ago when she attended Cannes to promote Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Yeoh discussed what an overwhelming visit it proved to be, noting, “Cannes is a great place, but it can also be very brutal. If they don’t like your film, they tell you right away.”  Luckily, there was a standing ovation right in the middle of the film’s first screening, following an early action scene where Yeoh runs up the sides of walls and across rooftops. The film went on to become a box office success and was eventually nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.  When asked about the state of the film industry today, Yeoh explained, “We fight for women continuously. We fight for equality. We fight for diversity. … But it also has to come from the top. If it doesn’t come from the top, it’s very hard for it to trickle down to the bottom.” However, Yeoh noted, the success of her recent films has forced Hollywood decision-makers to support the same things she does.  “It started with Crazy Rich Asians,” she said, adding that the movie’s success set a “small fire” that kept growing. According to Yeoh, it had been 26 years since a “homegrown American movie” had an all-Asian cast, with The Joy Luck Club. The box office success of Crazy Rich Asians helped studios realize that Americans are willing to watch primarily Asian casts. Then, Yeoh noted, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was a success for Marvel, bringing the first Chinese superhero to the mainstream. Yeoh said that Shang-Chi “opened the door even wider.”  Her most recent success, of course, is last year’s Everything Everywhere All At Once, which was a hit at the box office and snagged several Oscar wins — including Best Lead Actress for Yeoh herself (the first time an Asian performer has won) and Best Picture. With that film, Yeoh said, “we just kung-fu’d our way through that glass ceiling.”  Even jet-lagged and forced to confront an onslaught of camera flashes, Yeoh was every bit as energetic and composed as expected. Beyond being a consummate professional who thankfully steered the Cannes narrative in a positive direction, she also revealed some worthwhile thoughts about the gender divide in Hollywood: “In the past, I’ve found that women are very critical of themselves,” she said, noting, “Men are not. Women, we nitpick at maybe our good things, even.”  But that might be changing, according to Yeoh. She said, “[E]specially in the last few years, you can see that women are speaking out a lot more for themselves.” Let’s make that the thesis of this year’s Cannes, shall we?

"religious miracle","2016-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T01:36:19","Photo via HBO  An actor who previously portrayed Marvel fan-favorite Ghost Rider is willing to consider a rebirth in the MCU. No, not Nicolas Cage.  Gabriel Luna played the Robbie Reyes version of Ghost Rider on Season 4 of Marvel’s ABC series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In a recent Forbes interview, Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate, The Last of Us) said he’s now willing to revisit the character after years of telling fans he wanted to move on.  Luna explained:  “My stock answer used to be, ‘I loved what we did. I’m very happy with what we accomplished, and I can be happy leaving it on the shelf and admiring what we did and have the audience remember it fondly, the way they do. To do the character again just gives me another opportunity to screw it up.’“  However, only recently has Luna begun realizing just how popular Reyes is:  “I love that character. It was really special. It had only come into existence in 2014 [Robbie Reyes’ Ghost Rider], created by Felipe Smith, and then it was in 2016 that we did the show. And literally not a day goes by that somebody doesn’t ask me about it.  And how is Luna feeling these days about wearing bringing back the flaming skull and anthropomorphic chains?  “It feels like the demand may be there, and if the creative is there and it makes sense … I think with Marvel right now, it’s so intricately woven that it would be a few years out if they started to think about it, to do the character. I’m always open.“  Why the back-and-forth? The way Luna explains it, he feels an extra connection to a character when there’s more source material to pull from besides a shooting script. But that can also make the character more intimidating to embody:  “With characters like Robbie, the Ghost Rider, and Tommy [The Last of Us], they’ve been established. And I’ve been able to access the source material, fall in love with it in a lot of ways, and sometimes when you love something that strongly, it may interrupt your process and what you’re trying to accomplish.“  Now, it seems the more pressing question isn’t Luna’s willingness to return, but whether the character from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D even lines up with the current version of the MCU. At this point, it’s still unclear if Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D is considered canon, given that one of its biggest plot points would seem to negate major character deaths in the films.  However, now that the multiverse is open — at least that version of New York City with the pizza balls — maybe Reyes doesn’t need to line up with anything that came before. Perhaps he can simply roar through a wormhole on his bike, and fans of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D get a little callback while the rest of Marvel fandom gets a cool new character. Thanks to an economy that’s dead set on rapidly monetizing anything at all that people recognize, rest assured there’s always a way to bring back our heroes.

It will be nuked when The Flash debuts, and, because looking back and avoiding letting go is something fans of any franchise do regularly, those who love these works are debating just where it went irreversibly downward.  As of this story’s writing, the above thread on Reddit has more than 1,000 comments and 2,000 votes on it. One argues that Justice League was the final nail in the coffin, as, if casual audiences do not care about a team-up film, they will ignore solo releases, but, one fan is not as certain. In their view, while the film was a disaster, had it been given more time in the oven, it would have hit.  Elsewhere in the discourse, critics say there was no specific final straw and it was more or less a series of bad decisions which led to the coming reboot of the mega-franchise. They say Suicide Squad was massively mishandled and making movies on more obscure characters first was a mistake, and, one fan says the recent Black Adam was the end of the road with its Superman fiasco.  Few fixes are circulating in the comments like the original poster asked for, but, apart from more time, there are suggestions Snyder being involved is what sunk it all, as he is not seen by some to understand superheroes, and, elsewhere, one blames what came immediately before Man of Steel in 2013. Essentially, Nolan made executives crazy and they hewed to his ideas too much.  The Flash releases June 16 after years of delays. Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen.

The word “Incarnation” is derived from the Latin word “incarnatio”, which literally means “to make flesh”. It is one of the fundamental beliefs of Christianity and is based on the teachings of the Bible.  Why is the Incarnation of Christ important?  The Incarnation of Christ is essential to Christianity because it affirms the deity of Jesus Christ and his humanity. Jesus was fully human, experiencing all the emotions, physical pain, and challenges that people encounter during their lives. At the same time, he was fully divine, displaying supernatural power, knowing the mind of God, and claiming to be the Son of God. The incarnate Christ provides a bridge between God and humanity and reconciles humanity with God.  Is the Incarnation of Christ supported by the Bible?  Yes, the Bible extensively teaches the Incarnation of Christ. According to John 1:14, “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.” The Gospel of Matthew also teaches the Incarnation, saying “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”). (Matthew 1:23).  What does the Incarnation of Christ teach us about God?  The Incarnation of Christ teaches us that God is a God who loves us enough to come down and be with us. It reveals God’s compassion, grace, and mercy, and shows that God is not a distant or cold deity, but one who is intimately involved in human affairs. God’s decision to become human serves to demonstrate that he identifies with humanity’s struggles and frailties, and he is willing to suffer and die for the sake of his people.  How did the Incarnation of Christ impact the world?  The Incarnation of Christ has significantly impacted the world in various ways. It has served as the foundation of Christian theology and provided hope and assurance of salvation to believers. The Incarnation has also inspired countless acts of charity, compassion, and love, and has helped shape Western ethics and culture. The life and teachings of Jesus Christ have served as models of selflessness, love, and humility, and has inspired people to live by these principles.  How does the Incarnation of Christ relate to salvation?  The Incarnation of Christ is intimately related to salvation because Jesus came to save humanity from sin and restore the relationship between God and humankind. By becoming human, Jesus was qualified to live a perfect and sinless life and serve as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. The cross represents how the Incarnation of Christ leads to salvation, as it was on the cross that Jesus paid the penalty for our sins fully.  Why did God choose to become human?  God chose to become human to show his love for humanity and to reconcile humanity with Himself. God knew that humanity needed a Savior, and rather than sending a prophet or a messenger, He chose to become human and take on the infinite majesty of the heavenly Father in human fragile life.  What does the Incarnation of Christ mean for Christians today?  The Incarnation of Christ continues to have significance for Christians today. It provides assurance that God is with us, and that Jesus understands our challenges and struggles. It also provides hope that there is life beyond death and that believers have a future with God. The Incarnation of Christ offers a comforting reminder that believers have a personal connection with God and that they are an integral part of God’s plan of redemption.  What are some common misconceptions about the Incarnation of Christ?  One common misconception of the Incarnation is that Jesus Christ was not fully human, as he was also fully divine. However, the Bible teaches that Jesus was fully human, experiencing all the emotions, physical pain, and challenges that people encounter during their lives while fully divine in nature. Another common misconception is that the Incarnation helps qualify our good works as acceptable before God. But the salvation by the Incarnation of Christ comes only through faith in Jesus Christ, for salvation is not by works but by grace.  What are some critiques of the Incarnation of Christ?  Critiques of the Incarnation of Christ come from different belief systems, some of which argue that it is illogical and contrary to the principles of rationality. Some also argue that it’s impossible for a perfect, immaterial God to be united with a flawed, material human body, which makes Jesus’ dual nature as both divine and human, a logical contradiction. Most of these disputes draw on metaphysics or theology, leading to debates among different religious groups.  What is the role of the Incarnation in Christian worship?  The Incarnation plays a vital role in Christian worship as it reminds us of the unique relationship with God that believers have through Christ. The Incarnation is also a key focus during the Christmas season and is often celebrated through various liturgical practices such as carols and nativity displays. In worship, the Incarnation is used to explore Christian spirituality, especially the themes of forgiveness, redemption, and salvation.  What can non-Christians learn from the Incarnation of Christ?  The Incarnation of Christ provides valuable lessons for non-Christians on the nature of God and His relationship with humanity. It teaches that God is love, and that love led Him to become human. The Incarnation also teaches that God is personal and interactive, as seen in Christ’s teachings and miracles, inviting non-Christians to interact with God not to condemn but to save by grace. Finally, it promotes peace, unity, and forgiveness among humanity in a world torn apart by divisions, hatred, and enmity.  What implications does the Incarnation have for our daily lives as Christians?  The Incarnation of Christ has significant implications for our daily lives as Christians. It reminds us that our lives should be marked by love and selflessness since Jesus sacrificed himself out of love for humanity. The Incarnation also invites us to a deeper understanding of our relationship with God, encouraging us to draw closer to Him and live a life honoring Him. Moreover, it reminds us of the future hope of dwelling with God, encourages us to extract others from their humiliation, and reminds us that we should do all we can to promote peace and justice in this world.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the Incarnation of Christ is one of the most profound theological concepts in Christianity that teaches that God became human in the person of Jesus Christ. The Incarnation provides a bridge between humanity and divinity and reconciles humanity with God. Furthermore, it has profound implications for our daily lives as Christians, promoting a life of love, selflessness, and service. While there are misconceptions and critiques of the Incarnation, it remains one of the core beliefs of Christianity today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2J0aW1lcy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtbWVhbmluZy1vZi10aGUtaW5jYXJuYXRpb24tb2YtY2hyaXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Seville"", ""Seville"", ""Spain""}","2023-05-21T17:49:02","In 2019, and after a successful Kickstarter campaign, Blasphemous came to consoles and PC.  The launch was not as fine as those responsible, the Seville studio The Game Kitchenthey would have liked it, so they continued working on numerous patches and free downloadable content (including the Spanish dubbing) until it became what it is today: one of the best spanish games ever.  That particular penance, an unmistakable sign of devotion to his work, has become the absolute trust in Blasphemous 2the sequel that arrives this summer and that we were able to test a few days ago in a place as appropriate as the Casa de Pilatos, in Seville.  Blasphemous 2 exudes confidence. Not only the game, but also those responsible: Enrique Cabeza (creative director), Paco Ureña (main programmer), Mauricio García (CEO of The Game Kitchen), Maikel Ortega (combat designer), Enrique Colinet (level designer), Jesús Campos (pixel artist and concept artist), Carlos Viola (composer)…  A few minutes of relaxed chat was enough to realize that everyone fully trusts the new son of Miracleas well as to discover how some of the most remembered moments of the original were born (such as the fight against Crisanta), the influences behind its stunning artistic style or why spikes have become a recurring joke in the community.  But it is not about blind faith: if the rest of the game maintains the level of this first hour that we were able to test, Blasphemous 2 will be the answer to our prayers; A real blessing for video game lovers.  Blasphemous 2 Impressions: A Miraculous Sequel  From the moment we started the game and began to control the Griever, the improvement over the first Blasphemous was more than evident. The character is more agile and the controls are more responsiveso chaining jumps, dodges, and attacks is now infinitely more satisfying.  It was not the only big change noticeable in these first minutes of the game, because after checking the improvement in the controls Blasphemous 2 made us a decision: what weapon should we choose? After losing his trusty sword Mea Culpa at the end of Wounds of Eventide, the Griever needs a new tool with which to dispense divine justice among the creatures that have arisen from this second Miracle.  For this purpose, we can choose between three options: a slow but powerful war censera combination of rapier and dagger that allows fast attacks and the balanced prayer sword. The good thing is that we choose the weapon we choose, as we progress in the adventure we can obtain the others (and switch between them at any time by pressing a button).  What’s more, if we want to go through the map of Blasphemous 2 in its entirety, it is probably necessary to get all three, since some of these weapons possess unique capabilities. The censer, for example, can be used to hit some bells that, with their ringing, make liquid metal platforms appear with which to reach new places.  As if having three weapons with different move sets wasn’t already a full blown upgrade, each of them will also have its own skill tree to further increase our options in combat.  We went with the rapier and dagger and found that, in addition to offering fast attacks, they are geared towards those who prefer to always be on the move, extending moves like the dodge and parry with powerful attacks. To top it off, if we made successive attacks without taking damage, both blades would be charged with electricity.  And although this may be our doing, it has given us the impression that the use of prayers (magic, speaking badly and soon) has improved. In the first Blasphemous we didn’t quite get the point, but in this demo we went to them numerous times, especially when we were overwhelmed by enemies.  It is time to talk about the design of the world, as it is another aspect in which we quickly appreciate an improvement. Speaking with members of The Game Kitchen, they told us that unlike the first Blasphemous, which they defined as a non-linear action platform game, Blasphemous 2 is a full-fledged metroidvania.  One change that we welcome with open arms in that regard is that there are no limitations on equipping movement skills. Instead, each skill learned is fixed and becomes available to the Griever at all times. In this demo, the first one we unlocked allowed us to grab, bounce, and slide off walls.  We have talked on many occasions that, despite the popularity of the genre, it is not easy to make a metroidvania. However, in this first hour of play Blasphemous 2 has shown us that it knows very well what it does.  After passing what we could consider as the tutorial zone, the world began to open up and we soon had several possible unexplored paths, achieving that feeling of a huge map with a multitude of different routes that is only available to a few (Hollow Knight is the first game that comes to mind when thinking about this type of design).  But the world of Blasphemous 2 is not only bigger, it is also denser; each location is full of novelties and surprises, such as rewards, NPCs, collectibles… We also notice new mechanics related to the scenarios, such as mirrors to teleport, levers that operate devices for a limited time or the aforementioned bells.  To give you an idea of ​​the amount of news that there is in Blasphemous 2, at the end of the game session we shared our impressions with those of other colleagues in the press, and each had a different experiencereached different locations, fought different enemies and discovered secrets that the rest of us had not seen.  Of course, we can’t talk about Blasphemous 2 and not mention its visual section, which again bets on a wonderful pixel-art style. Dark fantasy and religious iconography are still the norm, but this time we find references to other areas of the Peninsula (such as the cathedral of Cádiz) and a somewhat more colorful and bright style.  And the animations, which were already very good in the first one, they are even better in Blasphemous 2. In addition to not skimping on (gory) details, we have been surprised by how much they have gained in fluency. The executions are once again the most impressiveand the way in which the Penitent uses his new arm to end the life of enemies is striking.  It should also be noted that there are again moments in which the story is narrated through video scenes, although instead of betting on pixel-art, they are now made with a cleaner artistic style and more traditional animation. One of these scenes was a clear tribute to the work of FromSoftwareintroducing what will undoubtedly be the bosses to defeat in this sequel.  We leave the sound section for last, where the melodies of maestro Carlos Viola once again accompany the steps of the Penitent with that unmistakable flamenco touch. We were left wanting to face another boss to listen to his songs, because in the first they were one of the high points (Baile de Violetas, from The Stir Dawn DLC, is one of our favorite pieces).  But without a doubt the great news related to the sound section is that Blasphemous 2 will arrive dubbed into Spanish at launch. In this demo we played with the voices in Spanish and their quality is once again simply superb, highlighting the use of accents (and not only the Andalusian one).  Although it is still early to talk, after that hour of play (which flew by) It’s hard for us not to be excited about Blasphemous 2. The improvement compared to the first one is brutal and we have seen signs of being before a very great metroidvania… maybe even one of the best. We are looking forward to the summer so that the penance begins.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1ZXRpci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9ibGFzcGhlbW91cy0yLWltcHJlc3Npb25zLWEtbWlyYWN1bG91cy1zZXF1ZWwv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucnVldGlyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2JsYXNwaGVtb3VzLTItaW1wcmVzc2lvbnMtYS1taXJhY3Vsb3VzLXNlcXVlbC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","-0004-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T13:34:21","What Does the Bible Say About the Three Wise Men (Magi)?  The story of the three wise men, also known as the Magi, who followed the star to find the newborn baby Jesus, is a beloved Christmas tradition. While it has been romanticized in modern depictions, the biblical account of the Magi is a fascinating exploration of faith, prophecy, and God’s plan for humanity.  Who were the Magi?  The Magi were likely astrologers or magicians from Persia or Babylon, who were known for their knowledge of the stars and their interpretation of dreams. They were probably not kings, as they are often depicted, but rather learned men who were highly respected in their culture.  How many Magi were there?  The Bible does not specify how many Magi there were, only that they brought three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The tradition of three Magi likely originated from the number of gifts given.  Why did the Magi visit Jesus?  The Magi saw a star in the sky and believed it to be a sign of the birth of a new king in Israel. They traveled to Jerusalem to inquire about the king’s whereabouts and were directed to Bethlehem by King Herod, who sought to kill Jesus. The Magi found Jesus and presented him with gifts, recognizing him as a king.  What is the significance of the gifts?  Gold was a symbol of kingship, frankincense was a symbol of priesthood, and myrrh was a symbol of burial. The gifts symbolized Jesus’ identity as the Son of God, who was born to be king, priest, and savior.  Did the Magi visit Jesus in the stable?  The Bible does not specify where the Magi found Jesus, only that they arrived at a house and found him there with Mary. It is possible that the family had already moved from the stable to a more permanent dwelling by the time the Magi arrived.  What was the significance of the star?  The star was a miraculous sign that appeared in the sky to guide the Magi to Jesus. It signaled the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah and served as a reminder of God’s faithfulness to his promises.  Did the Magi participate in the slaughter of the innocents?  It is unclear whether the Magi were present for the slaughter of the innocents, which Herod ordered after realizing that he had been tricked by the Magi. However, it is unlikely that they would have participated in such violence, as their mission was to honor the newborn king.  What is the origin of the tradition of giving gifts at Christmas?  The tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is thought to have originated from the Magi’s gifts to Jesus. It has also been influenced by other traditions, such as the Roman Saturnalia festival, which involved giving gifts to friends and neighbors.  Are the Magi mentioned in any other religious texts?  The Magi are not mentioned in any other religious texts, although the story of the star and the gifts has been retold in various forms throughout history.  What can we learn from the Magi?  The Magi’s journey to find Jesus teaches us several important lessons. It reminds us to seek God with faith and perseverance, to recognize and honor Jesus as king, and to offer our gifts and talents to serve his purposes.  How does the story of the Magi fit into the larger narrative of the Bible?  The story of the Magi is part of God’s larger plan to redeem humanity through Jesus. It demonstrates God’s faithfulness to his promises and the importance of recognizing Jesus’ identity as savior and king.  Why is the story of the Magi important to Christians?  The story of the Magi is important to Christians because it reminds us of the miracle of Jesus’ birth and the role he plays in our salvation. It also encourages us to approach God with faith and to honor Jesus as king and savior.  What is the legacy of the Magi?  The Magi’s legacy is one of faithful devotion and dedication to God. Their example inspires us to seek God with perseverance, to offer our gifts and talents for his purposes, and to recognize Jesus as our king and savior.  What is the historical significance of the Magi?  The Magi’s historical significance lies in their role as witnesses to Jesus’ birth and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. Their visit to Jesus helped to establish his identity as king and savior, and their gifts served as a symbolic tribute to his greatness.  What misconceptions do people have about the Magi?  One common misconception about the Magi is that they were kings. Another is that they arrived at the stable on the night of Jesus’ birth. Additionally, the Magi are often portrayed as being present at the crucifixion, although there is no biblical basis for this.  What can we learn from the Magi’s gifts?  The Magi’s gifts teach us that offering our resources and talents to God is a way of honoring him and recognizing his sovereignty over our lives. They also remind us that Jesus is the king, priest, and savior who came to save us from sin and death.  How can we apply the lessons of the Magi to our lives?  We can apply the lessons of the Magi to our lives by seeking God with faith and perseverance, offering our gifts and talents for his purposes, and recognizing Jesus as our king and savior. We can also be inspired by the Magi’s example of devotion and dedication to God.  What is the spiritual significance of the Magi?

"religious miracle","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T09:00:50","Another prophetic sermon by the great elder of the Pskov Caves Monastery, Archimandrite John (Krestiankin)  “>Archimandrite John (Krestiankin).  My friends, the day is nearing when the joyful greeting, “Christ is Risen!” with which we meet each other will yield its place to our everyday greeting. And only once a week will the Church services and calendar remind all the living of the Resurrection of Christ, of the meaning and aim of life, of the resurrection of the soul in God. For six weeks after Pascha the Sunday Gospel offered to our attention and contemplation the profound and edifying stories of the different souls’ steps onto the path of salvation.  My Lord and my God! called out the holy apostle Thomas, teaching us to seek our salvation only in the Savior, and also teaching us the sense of our own destruction, from which He Who Saves extricates us (Jn. 20:28). The The Bravery and Courage of the Myrrhbearing WomenTheir great zeal, sacred reverence, and courage of soul passed over all the Jews’ obstacles, and all the guards at the Tomb did not shake their resolve. But one thought, but one desire led their minds and hearts— to serve the funeral of their dear Savior with fullness of faith and with reverence.  “>Holy Myrrhbearing Women gave no sleep to their eyes nor slumber to their eyelids, serving their beloved Savior to the day they found Him Resurrected. And they, like Thomas, confessed their love for Christ and His salvation—not with their tongues but with their hearts.  Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee, said the Lord to the paralytic, and so He tells us of the terrible, destructive work of sin on the soul and body (Jn. 5:14). Sin—darkness and the shadow of death—separates us from the Source of Life, from God. And only God’s mercy, which awaits our repentance and conversion, endures us and helps us turn away from death to life.  The Savior’s conversation with the Samaritan Woman teaches us to go from external attention to God’s word, to inner effort, to standing up for the truth.  And so, this Sunday, called the Sunday of the Blind Man  “>Sunday of the Blind Man, is the last Sunday before the leave-taking of Holy Pascha.  At first glance it is an at once simple and miraculous event—the granting of sight to one who was born blind; the granting of sight to a man who had never seen a ray of sunlight, never seen the beauty of God’s world. In our understanding, he was an unfortunate man, and a hopeless sufferer.  But judging from what was written in the Gospel about this man upon whom a divine miracle was wrought, he was strong and a courageous; he bore his handicap and woe without murmuring, for the Savior Himself testifies that his blindness was not the consequence of sin: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:—and then the remarkable words—but that the works of God should be made manifest in him (Jn. 9:3).  And the power of God in simple actions, not portentous of any miracle, works a miracle. Where God so wills, the order of nature is overthrown.  Jesus Christ did what not one man born of earth could do—a man blind from birth received his sight, eyes locked up from birth were opened. But not only bodily healing happened for this sufferer—his eyes saw, and his spiritual vision immediately saw in Jesus Christ the Son of God.  News of what happened flew around the city in the blinking of an eye, unsettling minds.  Who is this Man Who has done something unheard of before? And the people were divided. For some, who saw the Healer as a Man of God—because a sinner cannot do anything like it, for “God heareth not sinners”, spiritual sight had come; and having been freed of spiritual blindness, they heard God’s call.  But others, who did not wish to see the miracle, saw in the Lord no more than a violator of the Sabbath. Hypocritical and ostentatious piety and pride rose up against what was obvious, and those who could see went blind; spiritual blindness distorted the world for them, and made it impossible to see the light of truth.  The main calamity of our times is in just this—people’s extraordinary spiritual blindness.  The sin of pride and self-satisfaction, the sin of cunning unbelief rose up against simplicity of faith, which clearly sees the truth. The Pharisees cast out the man who had received his sight. Book learning casts out true faith. And the Lord pronounces the words: For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind (Jn. 9:39). Since that time, God’s judgment has been wrought continually—also in our days, and over us.  Sometimes our sight is opened spiritually; but how often do we who are blinded by sin lose the ray of light—the light of Christ—and wander through life in darkness while considering ourselves able to see.  The main calamity of our times is in just this—people’s extraordinary spiritual blindness. Spiritual wisdom, which can clearly see the light of truth, is now becoming extremely rare. Fleshly reason, mired in the things of this life, loving only what is earthly, always leads to opposition against divine teaching and revelation.  Fleshly reason, mired in the things of this life, loving only what is earthly, always leads to opposition against divine teaching and revelation  In order to acquire spiritual wisdom, we need first of all obedience to the mind of Universal Orthodox Church. St. Ephraim the Syrian says, “Do not cease to test Divine Scripture on yourself, do not cease to ask your Mother, the Church.” The light of Christ’s teaching, the light of His love, enlightens every person in world. And love is that test according to which we are proved—whether we are blind or seeing, sick or healthy.  Let us recall the Savior’s words: If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth (Jn. 9:41).  Sin gives birth to spiritual blindness, and spiritual blindness roots a person in sin. And the human heart becomes hardened and coarse. The ears hear, and the eyes see, but neither of them understand. And the sin of hardness of heart and stubborn opposition to the truth make a person a participant in the barren works of darkness. The voice of the heart fades out, and the cold, calculating, proud mind tramples upon Christian love. And finally man then goes blind. And God steps away.  Thus is God’s judgment wrought upon the stubborn “smarty”. God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, even unto this day (Rom. 11:8).  And so now, as always, today’s Gospel places us before the question: Who then are we? Are we healthy, or sick? Seeing, or blind? Are we in God, or has the spirit of the world led us away from Him to a land afar off?  Our dedication to Christ and His commandments is being tested throughout all the days of our lives—during days of outward prosperity, but more often during days of persecution and trials. We need to know the saving alphabet by heart, so that we could give an account to ourselves and others, and when necessary, give an answer—with conviction in the truth and unashamed.  The holy Orthodox Church is the pillar and foundation of truth! Nowadays specific forces are trying to shake this foundation, seeing in it the final barrier to their destructive plans. They are invading it, defaming its hierarchy, introducing the spirit of mistrust, conflict, and division. What militant theomachy was unable to do in its time is now being done by those who call themselves the guardians of faith and the canons.  Let’s look attentively at what Christ commanded us and to what these new zealots are calling us.  They are calling us to schism against unity in Christ. And in the places sanctified by the profuse, suffering blood of the Orthodox for the faith, they are raising new thrones, like for example the autocephalous Ukrainian church, or schismatic groups in Suzdal.1 The heresy of the Bogorodichny Center2 also proclaim their right to own the truth.  But is Christ divided (1 Cor. 1:13)? Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment (1 Cor. 1:10).  Where is that all-forgiving, compassionate love to which followers of Christ are called? Where is the spirit of the early Church, when the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul (Acts 4:32)? Where is the spirit of Christ, calling to us from the most onerous cross of suffering to forgive not only those who have gone astray, but even our enemies?  Here is the test: Are we of Christ, are we true Christians, or have worldly powers seized us—the power of revenge, and the power of struggle without God.  In 1920, when the blood of the martyrs was pouring out and the Russian Church was ascending wearing its crown of thorns to Golgotha, its meek and faithful Patriarch, His Holiness Tikhon, called the children of the Church who were still alive to not be angry, not to despair, but to carry their cross without fear, and to arm themselves against their persecutors with love and repentance.  And the one who we now have no doubt is standing before the throne of God, says, “Let this holy guilelessness of the Church, these calls for patient bearing of antichristian enmity and anger seem like weakness … We beg you all not to depart from this only saving disposition of a Christian—do not step off the path of the cross sent down to us by God.” “It is the difficult but high task of the Christian to preserve in himself the great happiness of guilelessness and love.”  And another word from the holy Patriarch in those days when everything living was being destroyed: “It is no great achievement to die these days. Now it is harder to learn how to live.” The Russian people and the Russian Orthodox Church are learning. They are learning to this day, sacrificing very much in order to preserve what is most important—the Church, without which we cannot live.  Hundreds of martyrs have shone forth in the Church. And each one separately, offering themselves as bloody—or what is even more difficult, bloodless moral sacrifices—were all united in an indivisible spirit, faith, and love, following the desires and intentions of the Lord: that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us… (Jn. 17:21). This is Christ’s prayer for all of those who are faithful to Him.  And so, seventy years later our Holy Orthodox Church must take upon itself a new kind of martyrdom.  We must all remember, my friends, to suggest the teaching of the holy fathers to those who are wavering. “We can have everything outside the Church—except for salvation. Outside the Church we can have the clerical rank, sacraments, and alleluia. We can have Liturgy, the Gospel, faith, preaching in the name of the Triune God—but salvation can only be found in the Orthodox Church.”  And let the words from the church ambo not sound out to us in vain: Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them (Rom. 16:17). God is the Judge of all who purposely or through ignorance have stepped upon the warpath against God.  We need to live and pray so that our struggle for Christ’s sake in these deceitful times be handed down as an inheritance and edification to the coming generations as the best testament and blessing. Only upon this rock—healing evil with good—is founded the invincible grandeur of our Holy Orthodox Church on the Russian lands.  This was the inheritance left to us by His Holiness, the Patriarch and Martyr Tikhon. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another (Jn. 13:35). This is the most important thing, which we must preserve under all circumstances. This is the measure of our spiritual vision.  This, my dear ones, is what I wanted to say to you today. Pain of heart speaks today through my lips. I have lived a long time, I have seen the history of the Church, I’ve seen what they are judging it for today with my own eyes.3 I saw and knew its hierarchs, I grew up at their feet. And I can’t forget the foundations that they placed in us, and how they themselves lived.  But God’s judgment is walking the earth. Man’s judgment is one thing, but God’s is another. May God grant that we not turn out to be spiritually blind and not depart from the truth in Christ. May we view the events in Church life, events in the life of our country in both the present times and the not-so-distant past with spiritual vision. And then we will see the many examples of how human calculations crumbled, how powerless before God’s Providence many years of wisdom, experience, scholarliness, and even spirituality perceived in a human way, were. Yes, in the present evil times, having swept aside all that is purely human, very much is being shaken to its foundations. Worldly wisdom is cracking apart, and it is becoming clear that God’s Judgment is coming; the human is being rejected and the divine is being given. And our faith and task are now one thing: to unfailingly abide on the path of Divine Providence, to give ourselves over to it undivided and without a second thought. “Even so, come Lord Jesus (Rev. 22:20), come through the grace of Thy Holy Spirit, so that in our weakness and through it Thy judgments may come to pass.” Amen.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGFyYWRpc2UubmcvdG9kYXlzLWdvc3BlbC1wbGFjZXMtdXMtYmVmb3JlLXRoZS1xdWVzdGlvbi13aG8tdGhlbi1hcmUtd2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Every day new revelations continue to play after the wake of Shakahola massacre.  Every day is full of regrets for Evarline Okello who lives in a shack in the sprawling slums of Kibera, Nairobi. In an interview with BBC, the mother of four disclosed that her woes may have started way back, but they were compounded by her quest to better her life.  This comes when Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has reaffirmed that the government will not spare anyone found guilty of manipulating Kenyans with religion in the crackdown to weed out rogue preachers.  People were left shocked after Kenyan police found dozens of bodies in the eastern part of the country. Soon after this, Paul Mackenzie was arrested as he allegedly asked people to starve themselves so they could meet Jesus. He reportedly converted people to his beliefs and engaged them in fasting.  According to Evarline, she was struggling to feed her children when she heard that a pastor would pray for her to receive financial breakthrough.But there was a catch; Evarline had to part with KSh 15,000 in what was referred to as a ""seed offering.""  The bodies of the people were found during an investigation into a Christian cult that made its followers believe that they would go to heaven if they starved themselves to death.  She discloses that whoever informed her about the clergyman waxed lyrical about how powerful he is, and that she would repay the money in days.Given that there was hope for better things ahead, she borrowed the money from a friend who took a loan on her behalf.  The massacre has rekindled the debate over the regulation of religious worship in Kenya, a predominantly Christian country with 4,000 ""churches,"" according to official figures.  It dawned on her that she had been conned when there was no positive financial change in her life, and things even got worse.The loan her friend took on her behalf has since ballooned out of control due to unpaid interest and currently stands at KSh 38,000.  Many pastors preach the so-called prosperity gospel, urging members to donate heavily to church coffers in order to improve their own financial fortunes.Others operate with much darker consequences.  ""I have no idea how I'll pay the money back and my friend stopped talking to me. Things have become so difficult I have lost all hope,"" she lamented.  The government is working closely with security agencies and relevant authorities to inquire into the deaths as well as allegations of torture and inhumane treatment of followers of controversial self-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie and his Good News International Church based in Kilifi County.

"religious miracle","2023-04-02","Not Discerned","{""Bethany"", ""UnitedStates"", ""female""}","2023-05-22T06:49:21","What is the Significance of Bethany in the Bible?  Bethany, a small village located on the southeastern slope of the Mount of Olives, is a significant place in the Bible. This village is situated approximately two miles from Jerusalem and is mentioned several times in the Bible. The name “Bethany” means “house of dates” or “house of misery.” It is unclear how this name came to be associated with the village, but scholars believe it might have been due to the presence of palm trees and their fruit in the area.  What is the History of Bethany?  Bethany has a rich history that dates back to biblical times. According to the Bible, Bethany was the home of Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. The Gospel of Mark describes Bethany as the place where Jesus visited Simon the Leper. It is also the place where Jesus entered Jerusalem triumphantly riding on a donkey, an event celebrated as Palm Sunday. Bethany was also the place where Jesus spent his last night before the crucifixion.  During the first century, Bethany was a small village with a few dozen residents. It was a farming community, and its primary crop was olives. The village was subject to many sieges during the Roman period, and it was destroyed several times. In 634 CE, the Arab-Muslim conquerors invaded the village and founded the first mosque on the Mount of Olives. Bethany’s history during the medieval period is unclear, but it is believed to have remained a small village.  What are the Biblical Significances of Bethany?  Bethany appears several times in the Bible, and each time, it has a unique significance. Here are some of the biblical significances of Bethany:  – Home of Lazarus: According to the Gospel of John, Bethany was the home of Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. The Bible mentions that Jesus loved Lazarus and his two sisters, Martha and Mary. Jesus often visited them in their home, and the Gospel of John describes the scene where Jesus wept at Lazarus’ tomb.  – Place of Miracles: Bethany was the site of several miracles performed by Jesus. It was the village where Jesus healed the blind man Bartimaeus, as described in the Gospel of Mark. It was also the place where Jesus healed a woman suffering from an issue of blood in the Gospel of Mark.  – Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem: Bethany was the place from where Jesus entered Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey, an event celebrated as Palm Sunday. This event is described in all four Gospels and marks the beginning of Holy Week.  – Last Supper: According to the Gospel of Mark, Bethany was the place where Jesus spent his last night before the crucifixion. He and his disciples stayed in the home of Simon the Leper, who was possibly one of the disciples.  What is the Importance of Bethany Today?  Today, Bethany is a Palestinian village located in the West Bank. It has a population of approximately 3,500 people, many of whom are Christian. The village is home to several churches and religious sites, including the Church of St. Lazarus, which is built over the traditional tomb of Lazarus.  Bethany has become a popular destination for pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. Many tourists visit the village to see the sites associated with Jesus, such as the tomb of Lazarus and the house of Martha and Mary. The village is also a vital archaeological site, and many excavations have been conducted there over the years.  What are the Key Sites in Bethany?  Bethany is home to several significant religious sites, including:  – Tomb of Lazarus: This is a cave located at the southeastern side of the village and is believed to be the burial place of Lazarus. The tomb is mentioned in the Bible, and it has been venerated by Christians for centuries.  – Church of St. Lazarus: This church is built over the traditional tomb of Lazarus and is the largest church in the village. It was built in the 5th century CE and has undergone several renovations since then.  – House of Martha and Mary: The house is located near the Church of St. Lazarus and is believed to be the home of Martha and Mary, the sisters of Lazarus. The house is now a chapel, and visitors can see the room where Jesus is said to have dined with the sisters.  – Russian Orthodox Church: This is a large church located near the Church of St. Lazarus. It was built in the early 20th century and is one of the most significant religious sites in Bethany.  What are the Challenges Faced by Bethany Today?  Bethany faces several challenges today, primarily due to its location in the West Bank. The village is located in Area C, which is under Israeli control. This means that the residents of the village face restrictions on their daily lives, including movement, building, and access to water and other resources.  The village is also at risk of land confiscation and settlement expansion, which would further destabilize the community. The Israeli government has been building settlements in the West Bank for decades, despite international condemnation and calls to stop.  What is the Importance of Bethany for Christians?  Bethany is an essential place for Christians, as it is the site of several significant events in the life of Jesus. It is where Lazarus was raised from the dead, where Jesus spent his last night before the crucifixion, and where he entered Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey.  For Christians, Bethany is a reminder of Jesus’ humanity and his love for his followers. It is also a place of hope, as Lazarus’ resurrection demonstrates the power of God to bring life from death.  What is the Historical Importance of Bethany?  Bethany has a rich history that dates back to biblical times. As mentioned earlier, it was a farming community that primarily grew olives. It was subject to many sieges during the Roman period, and it was destroyed several times.  The village was also significant during the Arab-Muslim conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century CE. The conquerors built the first mosque on the Mount of Olives, which is still in use today.  What are the Challenges Faced by Religious Sites in Bethany?  Religious sites in Bethany, like many other places in the Holy Land, face several challenges. The primary challenge is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which has led to restrictions on movement and access to religious sites.  Another challenge is the conflict between different Christian denominations over the ownership and control of religious sites. This has led to disputes and tensions, which have occasionally erupted into violence.  How Important is Bethany in Christianity?  Bethany is crucial to Christianity, as it is the site of several significant events in the life of Jesus. The village is mentioned in the Gospels and is the place where Lazarus was raised from the dead, where Jesus spent his last night before the crucifixion, and where he entered Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey.  Bethany is also a reminder of Jesus’ humanity and his love for his followers. Its significance lies not only in its historical importance but also in its religious and spiritual significance to millions of Christians worldwide.  What is the Future of Bethany?  The future of Bethany is uncertain, primarily due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. The village and its religious sites are at risk of land confiscation and settlement expansion, which would further destabilize the community.  Despite these challenges, the residents of Bethany are determined to preserve their village and its history. They are working to promote tourism and support local businesses, which will enable them to maintain their way of life and their religious sites.  What Can We Learn from Bethany?  Bethany can teach us several lessons about faith, hope, and perseverance. The story of Lazarus’ resurrection reminds us of the power of God to bring life from death. Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey reminds us of the importance of humility and compassion. And his last night in Bethany reminds us of the importance of community and family.  Bethany also reminds us of the importance of preserving our history and cultural heritage. Despite facing numerous challenges, the residents of Bethany are committed to maintaining their village and its religious sites, ensuring that their history and traditions are preserved for future generations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2J0aW1lcy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtc2lnbmlmaWNhbmNlLW9mLWJldGhhbnktaW4tdGhlLWJpYmxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2018-10-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T23:58:29","Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement  By Gomi Senadhira  This month the highly controversial Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), which was signed in January 2018 and enforced in May 2018, completes five years in operation. Given the high level of concern among domestic stakeholders regarding the agreement. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed an independent committee of experts, in August 2018, to study the agreement and the committee handed over its report to the President in December 2018. The committee had identified a number of pitfalls in the agreement and President Maithripala Sirisena had directed that the agreement be amended as per the recommendations of the expert group. In May 2021, it was revealed that the National Negotiation Committee had reviewed the SLSFTA and identified 18 amendments to be made to the agreement. Hence, as the SLSFTA marks five years of implementation, it is appropriate for relevant government agencies to provide an overview of the significant trade and economic effects of the FTA during the period, and any efforts undertaken by the government to revise the articles in the agreement which are unfavourable to Sri Lanka. This is particularly important in trade policy because Sri Lanka is currently engaged in FTA negotiations with a number of other countries, including China, India, and Thailand. A careful analysis of the SLSFTA, at this stage, would help to avoid repeating similar mistakes in these negotiations as well. Furthermore, the way our trade negotiators and “experts” reacted to some of these public concerns on the agreement also reveals the limits of their expertise on trade agreements and negotiations, and their understanding of the commitments they had extended to Singapore! Some of their comments are so absurd that it appears that they do not even comprehend the very basics of trade negotiations!  One of the most controversial issues in the SLSFTA was the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka to open up import and process waste/garbage from Singapore. I was the first to raise this issue in August 2018 (SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China, etc. shut their doors, The Island 18th August 2018). Last year, in a study undertaken by Anushka Wijesinha, who was an advisor to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, and Janaka Wijayasiri state, “At times, the concern morphed into undue fears and propelled misleading views and myths…Another concern that arose quite surprisingly was that the SLFTA – and the tariff liberalisation offered – would permit harmful products such as garbage, clinical waste, nuclear waste, chemical waste etc. to be imported to Sri Lanka. The argument by those individuals and groups that raised this issue was that since waste products are included in the TLP, such items can be dumped into the country under the agreement… To be clear, the reduction or elimination of tariffs does not grant automatic entry of a product into a country – all applicable domestic regulations and mechanisms would still apply, including any applicable import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals. The SLSFTA does not take away Sri Lanka’s rights under International Environmental Protection Treaties to which Sri Lanka is a signatory and therefore, relevant environmental laws and regulations would apply to such imported products with no exception for those imports from Singapore under the SLSFTA.” (Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA Four Years On: Policy Context, Key Issues, and Future Prospects – August 2022)  When I exposed the commitments undertaken in the agreement to allow waste, particularly plastic waste, imports from Singapore it was not done based simply on tariff liberalisation. It was done after analysing the global trade of plastic waste, the challenges Singapore was facing in exporting plastic waste, Sri Lanka’s import of plastic waste, and Sri Lanka’s commitments in the agreement under the TLP, rules of origin, and services.  The Global situation  The developed countries lawfully or unlawfully export garbage as “recyclable waste” overseas for recycling. That is because recycling is a labour-intensive and dirty industry. For example, a PET bottle would have to be washed, its cap, and the label taken off before it can be recycled. So, it is a labour- intensive process. Very often large quantities of toxic or hazardous wastes also are mixed with “clean” waste. Then it also becomes a hazardous industry. During the cleaning process toxic waste is released into local environs and workers get exposed to them. So, developed countries prefer to do this “recycling” in developing countries. To do their dirty work these global garbage traders particularly target developing countries with corrupt officials and shady businessmen where import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals can be bent and corrupt officials would facilitate the clearing of even toxic garbage containers without any examination. In these countries, the bulk of the imported garbage ends up in the local garbage dumps.  China was the world’s largest importer of garbage and imported almost 60% of the world’s plastic waste. However, there was a growing public outcry, over many years, against the import of “foreign garbage.” in general and import of plastic waste in particular. This intensified after the release of the documentary film “Plastic China” in 2016 depicting the lives of two families who make their living recycling plastic waste imported from developed countries. In 2017 China decided to ban imports of 24 types of rubbish and notified the WTO accordingly. “We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials. This seriously polluted China’s environment. To protect China’s environmental interests and people’s health, we urgently adjust the imported solid wastes list, and forbid the import of solid wastes that are highly polluted. Protection of human health or safety; Protection of animal or plant life or health; Protection of the environment,” stated China’s WTO notification.  Normally, in international trade when the import of a product is banned in one country, it will be redirected to other countries. After the Chinese ban. Increased volumes of plastic waste started to move into other traditional importers of waste for reprocessing (Thailand, Vietnam, and other countries in the region) and these countries too started to restrict the imports of waste products. So, where will the world’s waste exports end up, if not in China or South East Asia? By late 2016, the Chinese plastic waste processing industry was looking for places in South Asia and Africa to relocate this billion-dollar industry.  Situation in Singapore  Singapore is one of the world’s largest, per capita, plastic waste generators. From 2012 to 2017 the total volume of plastic waste generated in Singapore averaged around 800 thousand tons per year. In 2013 Singapore exported over 90,000 tons of plastic waste. Out of it over 57,000 Tons went to China. After China’s ban on the import of plastic waste, Singapore’s exports fell to around 30, 000 tons by 2021. In Singapore, plastic waste is either exported or incinerated. Ash from incineration is shipped to a man-made island and that landfill is also fast filling up. Furthermore, the incineration of plastic waste even under controlled conditions leads to environmental degradation. Singapore is very keen on maintaining its air quality and incineration is not a preferred option. But recycling in Singapore is expensive. So, recycling companies in Singapore used to undertake that in Malaysia, China, or other countries in the region. After the Chinese ban exports to China have stopped totally and other importers also were contemplating import restrictions. Hence, it was no secret, when the SLSFTA was negotiated Singapore was exploring new overseas locations to establish recycling operations, or dumping grounds. In 2021 Singapore generated 982 thousand tons of plastic waste and only around six percent of the plastic waste generated was recycled. (See Table I)  The situation in Sri Lanka  When the SLSFTA was under negotiation Sri Lanka had already commenced importing plastic waste. The surge in imports between 2013 and 2017 shown in the Table II, clearly indicated the presence of a small but growing plastic waste “recycling” industry in Sri Lanka. My comments in 2018 was partly based on this analysis. (See Table II)  Though trade flows indicated a possible presence of global waste “recycling” mafia in Sri Lanka, I didn’t know, at that stage, garbage “recycling” or “resource recovery industries” had already commenced thriving operations within the BOI, under the Commercial Hub Regulation Act.  That was revealed only after the media exposure in 2019, of a huge waste dump inside the BOI. At that time, a representative from the “resource recovery industry” operated in the Katunayake FTZ, brazenly claimed at a press conference that this was the world’s “fastest-growing and most admired industry”. However, the investigation revealed that this clandestine waste dump inside the BOI contained toxic waste. Then came the discovery of over 200 stinking garbage containers in the Colombo port! Again, with toxic waste! These were discovered only because dirty fluids started to ooze out these smelly containers. It was reported that the environmental and customs officials even refused to open these containers as it was unsafe to do so. It was also reported that the garbage consignments moved from the port to the BOI were not physically checked by the Customs and other regulatory agencies, and these agencies did not conduct any entry processing or check on documents, due to BOI regulations! Though the Finance Minister promised the Parliament, in July 2019, that he would conduct a comprehensive investigation into the matter and would take legal action against the culprits nothing much had happened even after four years. It is also noteworthy that these garbage containers were discovered only after the collapse of Meethotamulla Garbage Dump in 2017. If Meethotamulla had not imploded, at least some of the waste may have ended up there.  Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA  The SLSFTA was negotiated at a time when the global crisis in the garbage trade was at its peak. So, how did Sri Lankan negotiators react to the crisis? Did they see it as a threat or an opportunity? Trade negotiators are expected to analyse trade statistics before making any commitment on any tariff line. Didn’t they know that Sri Lanka was already importing plastic waste? The representatives from the BOI were involved in the negotiations. Didn’t they know Sri Lanka had established these “resource recovery industries” within the BOI? How Singaporean negotiators approached this issue. Did they request any commitments from Sri Lanka in the area of import and processing of waste? Did we provide these commitments without any requests? And finally, didn’t they even know that Sri Lanka made these commitments?  When I warned that plastic and asbestos waste will be imported for processing and recycling, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade responded by stating “… in order for products manufactured in Singapore using non-originating raw materials (imported raw materials) to become eligible for Customs duty concessions under SLSFTA, origin criteria listed below should be complied with: I. Sufficient working or processing + comply with value addition of 35% of FOB or II. Sufficient working or processing + comply with CTH (change of tariff no at 4- digit level between the finished product and imported inputs) or… Sufficient working or processing + comply with Product Specific Rules”),” (“Garbage in, Garbage out’- Malik’s response,” The Island, October 9, 2018).  Unfortunately, our trade negotiators and advisers are not even aware that under the SLSFTA Rules of Origin, waste and scrap for recycling qualify as wholly obtained products, like plants … grown and harvested, or live animals born, raised and slaughtered in Singapore. The relevant sections are Article 4 k, l, and m, which state” … (k) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials; (l) wastes and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there; (m) waste and scrap derived from used goods collected in the exporting Party, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials.“ Under these sub- articles plastic waste, asbestos waste and similar products, can be imported for the recovery of raw materials by the “resource recovery industry” which had a highly lucrative operation in the BOI zones when the agreement was signed.  The agreement clearly categorises waste collected in Singapore as a wholly obtained product under Article 4, the Ministry of DS& IT claimed waste cannot be imported under Article 5. Didn’t our International Trade Ministry and other trade “experts” understand waste collected in Singapore is covered under Article 4 and hence the limitations in Article 5 do not apply? Or was it a deliberate attempt to hoodwink the public?  Then there are a few specific rules of origin that would facilitate the dumping of dangerous products in Sri Lanka. For example, crocidolite asbestos (HS 6812) also known as blue asbestos, is considered the most hazardous type of asbestos. Sri Lanka prohibited the use of crocidolite asbestos in 1987. Singapore banned the use of all types of Asbestos in 1989. However, a significant amount of the material remains in the buildings and elsewhere in Singapore and there are strict laws governing the demolishing and removal of these materials. Shockingly this item is not only included in Sri Lanka’s TLP but our negotiators have spent time and money on formulating very simple specific rules of origin to facilitate its imports. If a product containing Crocidolite, simply changes its tariff subheading then it qualifies as a product of Singaporean origin.  Then in the Services Chapter Sri Lanka has undertaken a specific commitment on Waste Disposal Services which is reproduced below (see Table 3):  The CPC 9402 refers to “refuse collection and disposal services’ and it includes collection services of garbage, trash, rubbish and waste, whether from households or from industrial and commercial establishments, transport services and disposal services by incineration or by other means. The use of “**” against the CPC code indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code. Sri Lanka’s commitment clearly limits its scope to waste collected from industrial establishments not run by the Government, but no other areas are excluded.  Under these commitments, services can be provided through four modes of supply. For “Waste Disposal Services” Sri Lanka has opened up only two modes of supply, namely, Mode 2) Consumption abroad and Mode 3) Commercial presence. The term “None” under this commitment means that the country is committing itself to provide full liberalization without any limitations on market access or national treatment for the service sector and modes of supply for which commitments are written.  By opening up Mode 2 without any restrictions, Sri Lanka permits the other party to the agreement to process its solid waste in Sri Lanka. If the intention of Sri Lankan negotiators, as the government claims, was to limit this to waste collected in Sri Lanka, then mode 2 should have been left unbound. By opening up of Mode 3 Sri Lanka has allowed Singaporean Waste Disposal Services to establish a subsidiary in Sri Lanka, subject to regulations of the Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka. Therefore, under this commitment waste can be imported from Singapore not only to recover raw materials but also to dispose of.  Before the SLSFTA entered into force in May 2018, if a Singaporean, Chinese or any other national wanted to recycle imported waste in Sri Lanka, it was possible to do so under BOI regulations. After May 2018, any Singaporean company can establish refuse disposal services in Sri Lanka, under the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka in the services chapter of the SLSFTA, to recycle and/or process waste!  After I raised this issue it was widely discussed. I believe the Presidential Commission also recommended that the articles which permit waste import and recycling should be amended. My article “SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China etc. shut their doors,” published in the Island in 2018, was tabled in the parliament by Shehan Semasinghe. Later, in April 2022, he became the Minister of Trade and since September 2022 he is the Minister of State for Finance. In spite of all that the government had not taken any action to protect Sri Lanka from becoming a garbage dump for developed countries other than calling my claim, “… a despicable attempt … to deceive the public” and in turn releasing few press releases with incorrect information to mislead the public. Even when the government imposed a ban on imports of hundreds of products, waste items like plastic waste were not included in that list and every year Sri Lanka continues to import thousands of tons of plastic waste!  In 2019, the Philippines, in a major diplomatic row with Canada, reshipped 2,400 tonnes of Canadian toxic waste which was imported labelled as plastic waste for recycling. Other countries in the region also had taken similar action. But we in Sri Lanka are not like that. Last year alone Sri Lanka imported over 6000 tons of plastic waste! Most of it came from China, a country that banned the import of plastic waste to protect environmental interests and people’s health and safety.

"religious miracle","2018-10-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T23:58:29","Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement  By Gomi Senadhira  This month the highly controversial Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), which was signed in January 2018 and enforced in May 2018, completes five years in operation. Given the high level of concern among domestic stakeholders regarding the agreement. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed an independent committee of experts, in August 2018, to study the agreement and the committee handed over its report to the President in December 2018. The committee had identified a number of pitfalls in the agreement and President Maithripala Sirisena had directed that the agreement be amended as per the recommendations of the expert group. In May 2021, it was revealed that the National Negotiation Committee had reviewed the SLSFTA and identified 18 amendments to be made to the agreement. Hence, as the SLSFTA marks five years of implementation, it is appropriate for relevant government agencies to provide an overview of the significant trade and economic effects of the FTA during the period, and any efforts undertaken by the government to revise the articles in the agreement which are unfavourable to Sri Lanka. This is particularly important in trade policy because Sri Lanka is currently engaged in FTA negotiations with a number of other countries, including China, India, and Thailand. A careful analysis of the SLSFTA, at this stage, would help to avoid repeating similar mistakes in these negotiations as well. Furthermore, the way our trade negotiators and “experts” reacted to some of these public concerns on the agreement also reveals the limits of their expertise on trade agreements and negotiations, and their understanding of the commitments they had extended to Singapore! Some of their comments are so absurd that it appears that they do not even comprehend the very basics of trade negotiations!  One of the most controversial issues in the SLSFTA was the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka to open up import and process waste/garbage from Singapore. I was the first to raise this issue in August 2018 (SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China, etc. shut their doors, The Island 18th August 2018). Last year, in a study undertaken by Anushka Wijesinha, who was an advisor to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, and Janaka Wijayasiri state, “At times, the concern morphed into undue fears and propelled misleading views and myths…Another concern that arose quite surprisingly was that the SLFTA – and the tariff liberalisation offered – would permit harmful products such as garbage, clinical waste, nuclear waste, chemical waste etc. to be imported to Sri Lanka. The argument by those individuals and groups that raised this issue was that since waste products are included in the TLP, such items can be dumped into the country under the agreement… To be clear, the reduction or elimination of tariffs does not grant automatic entry of a product into a country – all applicable domestic regulations and mechanisms would still apply, including any applicable import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals. The SLSFTA does not take away Sri Lanka’s rights under International Environmental Protection Treaties to which Sri Lanka is a signatory and therefore, relevant environmental laws and regulations would apply to such imported products with no exception for those imports from Singapore under the SLSFTA.” (Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA Four Years On: Policy Context, Key Issues, and Future Prospects – August 2022)  When I exposed the commitments undertaken in the agreement to allow waste, particularly plastic waste, imports from Singapore it was not done based simply on tariff liberalisation. It was done after analysing the global trade of plastic waste, the challenges Singapore was facing in exporting plastic waste, Sri Lanka’s import of plastic waste, and Sri Lanka’s commitments in the agreement under the TLP, rules of origin, and services.  The Global situation  The developed countries lawfully or unlawfully export garbage as “recyclable waste” overseas for recycling. That is because recycling is a labour-intensive and dirty industry. For example, a PET bottle would have to be washed, its cap, and the label taken off before it can be recycled. So, it is a labour- intensive process. Very often large quantities of toxic or hazardous wastes also are mixed with “clean” waste. Then it also becomes a hazardous industry. During the cleaning process toxic waste is released into local environs and workers get exposed to them. So, developed countries prefer to do this “recycling” in developing countries. To do their dirty work these global garbage traders particularly target developing countries with corrupt officials and shady businessmen where import licensing requirements, standards, and other regulatory approvals can be bent and corrupt officials would facilitate the clearing of even toxic garbage containers without any examination. In these countries, the bulk of the imported garbage ends up in the local garbage dumps.  China was the world’s largest importer of garbage and imported almost 60% of the world’s plastic waste. However, there was a growing public outcry, over many years, against the import of “foreign garbage.” in general and import of plastic waste in particular. This intensified after the release of the documentary film “Plastic China” in 2016 depicting the lives of two families who make their living recycling plastic waste imported from developed countries. In 2017 China decided to ban imports of 24 types of rubbish and notified the WTO accordingly. “We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials. This seriously polluted China’s environment. To protect China’s environmental interests and people’s health, we urgently adjust the imported solid wastes list, and forbid the import of solid wastes that are highly polluted. Protection of human health or safety; Protection of animal or plant life or health; Protection of the environment,” stated China’s WTO notification.  Normally, in international trade when the import of a product is banned in one country, it will be redirected to other countries. After the Chinese ban. Increased volumes of plastic waste started to move into other traditional importers of waste for reprocessing (Thailand, Vietnam, and other countries in the region) and these countries too started to restrict the imports of waste products. So, where will the world’s waste exports end up, if not in China or South East Asia? By late 2016, the Chinese plastic waste processing industry was looking for places in South Asia and Africa to relocate this billion-dollar industry.  Situation in Singapore  Singapore is one of the world’s largest, per capita, plastic waste generators. From 2012 to 2017 the total volume of plastic waste generated in Singapore averaged around 800 thousand tons per year. In 2013 Singapore exported over 90,000 tons of plastic waste. Out of it over 57,000 Tons went to China. After China’s ban on the import of plastic waste, Singapore’s exports fell to around 30, 000 tons by 2021. In Singapore, plastic waste is either exported or incinerated. Ash from incineration is shipped to a man-made island and that landfill is also fast filling up. Furthermore, the incineration of plastic waste even under controlled conditions leads to environmental degradation. Singapore is very keen on maintaining its air quality and incineration is not a preferred option. But recycling in Singapore is expensive. So, recycling companies in Singapore used to undertake that in Malaysia, China, or other countries in the region. After the Chinese ban exports to China have stopped totally and other importers also were contemplating import restrictions. Hence, it was no secret, when the SLSFTA was negotiated Singapore was exploring new overseas locations to establish recycling operations, or dumping grounds. In 2021 Singapore generated 982 thousand tons of plastic waste and only around six percent of the plastic waste generated was recycled. (See Table I)  The situation in Sri Lanka  When the SLSFTA was under negotiation Sri Lanka had already commenced importing plastic waste. The surge in imports between 2013 and 2017 shown in the Table II, clearly indicated the presence of a small but growing plastic waste “recycling” industry in Sri Lanka. My comments in 2018 was partly based on this analysis. (See Table II)  Though trade flows indicated a possible presence of global waste “recycling” mafia in Sri Lanka, I didn’t know, at that stage, garbage “recycling” or “resource recovery industries” had already commenced thriving operations within the BOI, under the Commercial Hub Regulation Act.  That was revealed only after the media exposure in 2019, of a huge waste dump inside the BOI. At that time, a representative from the “resource recovery industry” operated in the Katunayake FTZ, brazenly claimed at a press conference that this was the world’s “fastest-growing and most admired industry”. However, the investigation revealed that this clandestine waste dump inside the BOI contained toxic waste. Then came the discovery of over 200 stinking garbage containers in the Colombo port! Again, with toxic waste! These were discovered only because dirty fluids started to ooze out these smelly containers. It was reported that the environmental and customs officials even refused to open these containers as it was unsafe to do so. It was also reported that the garbage consignments moved from the port to the BOI were not physically checked by the Customs and other regulatory agencies, and these agencies did not conduct any entry processing or check on documents, due to BOI regulations! Though the Finance Minister promised the Parliament, in July 2019, that he would conduct a comprehensive investigation into the matter and would take legal action against the culprits nothing much had happened even after four years. It is also noteworthy that these garbage containers were discovered only after the collapse of Meethotamulla Garbage Dump in 2017. If Meethotamulla had not imploded, at least some of the waste may have ended up there.  Sri Lanka – Singapore FTA  The SLSFTA was negotiated at a time when the global crisis in the garbage trade was at its peak. So, how did Sri Lankan negotiators react to the crisis? Did they see it as a threat or an opportunity? Trade negotiators are expected to analyse trade statistics before making any commitment on any tariff line. Didn’t they know that Sri Lanka was already importing plastic waste? The representatives from the BOI were involved in the negotiations. Didn’t they know Sri Lanka had established these “resource recovery industries” within the BOI? How Singaporean negotiators approached this issue. Did they request any commitments from Sri Lanka in the area of import and processing of waste? Did we provide these commitments without any requests? And finally, didn’t they even know that Sri Lanka made these commitments?  When I warned that plastic and asbestos waste will be imported for processing and recycling, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade responded by stating “… in order for products manufactured in Singapore using non-originating raw materials (imported raw materials) to become eligible for Customs duty concessions under SLSFTA, origin criteria listed below should be complied with: I. Sufficient working or processing + comply with value addition of 35% of FOB or II. Sufficient working or processing + comply with CTH (change of tariff no at 4- digit level between the finished product and imported inputs) or… Sufficient working or processing + comply with Product Specific Rules”),” (“Garbage in, Garbage out’- Malik’s response,” The Island, October 9, 2018).  Unfortunately, our trade negotiators and advisers are not even aware that under the SLSFTA Rules of Origin, waste and scrap for recycling qualify as wholly obtained products, like plants … grown and harvested, or live animals born, raised and slaughtered in Singapore. The relevant sections are Article 4 k, l, and m, which state” … (k) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials; (l) wastes and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there; (m) waste and scrap derived from used goods collected in the exporting Party, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials.“ Under these sub- articles plastic waste, asbestos waste and similar products, can be imported for the recovery of raw materials by the “resource recovery industry” which had a highly lucrative operation in the BOI zones when the agreement was signed.  The agreement clearly categorises waste collected in Singapore as a wholly obtained product under Article 4, the Ministry of DS& IT claimed waste cannot be imported under Article 5. Didn’t our International Trade Ministry and other trade “experts” understand waste collected in Singapore is covered under Article 4 and hence the limitations in Article 5 do not apply? Or was it a deliberate attempt to hoodwink the public?  Then there are a few specific rules of origin that would facilitate the dumping of dangerous products in Sri Lanka. For example, crocidolite asbestos (HS 6812) also known as blue asbestos, is considered the most hazardous type of asbestos. Sri Lanka prohibited the use of crocidolite asbestos in 1987. Singapore banned the use of all types of Asbestos in 1989. However, a significant amount of the material remains in the buildings and elsewhere in Singapore and there are strict laws governing the demolishing and removal of these materials. Shockingly this item is not only included in Sri Lanka’s TLP but our negotiators have spent time and money on formulating very simple specific rules of origin to facilitate its imports. If a product containing Crocidolite, simply changes its tariff subheading then it qualifies as a product of Singaporean origin.  Then in the Services Chapter Sri Lanka has undertaken a specific commitment on Waste Disposal Services which is reproduced below (see Table 3):  The CPC 9402 refers to “refuse collection and disposal services’ and it includes collection services of garbage, trash, rubbish and waste, whether from households or from industrial and commercial establishments, transport services and disposal services by incineration or by other means. The use of “**” against the CPC code indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code. Sri Lanka’s commitment clearly limits its scope to waste collected from industrial establishments not run by the Government, but no other areas are excluded.  Under these commitments, services can be provided through four modes of supply. For “Waste Disposal Services” Sri Lanka has opened up only two modes of supply, namely, Mode 2) Consumption abroad and Mode 3) Commercial presence. The term “None” under this commitment means that the country is committing itself to provide full liberalization without any limitations on market access or national treatment for the service sector and modes of supply for which commitments are written.  By opening up Mode 2 without any restrictions, Sri Lanka permits the other party to the agreement to process its solid waste in Sri Lanka. If the intention of Sri Lankan negotiators, as the government claims, was to limit this to waste collected in Sri Lanka, then mode 2 should have been left unbound. By opening up of Mode 3 Sri Lanka has allowed Singaporean Waste Disposal Services to establish a subsidiary in Sri Lanka, subject to regulations of the Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka. Therefore, under this commitment waste can be imported from Singapore not only to recover raw materials but also to dispose of.  Before the SLSFTA entered into force in May 2018, if a Singaporean, Chinese or any other national wanted to recycle imported waste in Sri Lanka, it was possible to do so under BOI regulations. After May 2018, any Singaporean company can establish refuse disposal services in Sri Lanka, under the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka in the services chapter of the SLSFTA, to recycle and/or process waste!  After I raised this issue it was widely discussed. I believe the Presidential Commission also recommended that the articles which permit waste import and recycling should be amended. My article “SL chosen as garbage dump by Singapore after China etc. shut their doors,” published in the Island in 2018, was tabled in the parliament by Shehan Semasinghe. Later, in April 2022, he became the Minister of Trade and since September 2022 he is the Minister of State for Finance. In spite of all that the government had not taken any action to protect Sri Lanka from becoming a garbage dump for developed countries other than calling my claim, “… a despicable attempt … to deceive the public” and in turn releasing few press releases with incorrect information to mislead the public. Even when the government imposed a ban on imports of hundreds of products, waste items like plastic waste were not included in that list and every year Sri Lanka continues to import thousands of tons of plastic waste!  In 2019, the Philippines, in a major diplomatic row with Canada, reshipped 2,400 tonnes of Canadian toxic waste which was imported labelled as plastic waste for recycling. Other countries in the region also had taken similar action. But we in Sri Lanka are not like that. Last year alone Sri Lanka imported over 6000 tons of plastic waste! Most of it came from China, a country that banned the import of plastic waste to protect environmental interests and people’s health and safety.

"religious miracle","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T05:00:00","Presidential transition periods are times of excitement, hope, apprehension, speculation, and drama. It is associated with chaos, complexity, and coordination challenges. The incumbent president is not only saddled with the task of leading the country but also must start winding down its activities and prepare to hand over the presidency to the new president and his team. The incumbent almost becomes a lame duck as all the political activities shift to the president-elect. The president and his team start to feel the fleeting nature of power and quickly start losing the friends of the president’s seat to the new man and his people in the block.  The pilgrimage to the incumbent president gradually winds down, and the expedition to the president-elect goes into the ascendency. These political intrigues and melodramas culminate in the final ritual of power handover – the presidential inauguration ceremony on the 29th of May of the year of the transition of power. In Nigeria, from 1999 till date, we have had six such presidential transition ceremonies but three transitions from one president to another – Obasanjo to Yar’Adua/ Jonathan, Jonathan to Buhari and now Buhari to Tinubu.  There are predominantly two shades of presidential transition: one is a transition from a president from one party to a president under another party; the other is the transition from a president to another under the same party. We have experienced both in our nascent democracy, which can be taken as an indicator of growth and the deepening of our democracy. Each transition poses challenges and brings about different apprehensions, claims and counterclaims. However, the current presidential transition is of the former shade and, therefore, must be assumed to be more accessible – President Buhari of the APC will hand over to President-elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC.  This is the easiest part of this presidential transition steep in controversy and has split public opinion into multiple dichotomies. The dominant categorisations of these dichotomous strands are binary – some calling for the presidential transition to be postponed for different conjectural reasons , and others insisting it must hold, based on orthodoxy and the provisions of our constitution. They are all entitled to their opinion but the law of the land must prevail.  Advertisement  Beyond these apparent differences, most Nigerians are interested in this presidential transition. Some Nigerians see this transition as a symbol of hope for a better future – an audacious hope in the Tinubu team to solve most of Nigeria’s problems and put the country in the direction of growth and prosperity. Others, although cautious , want to see a new government with a change of direction. Still, others are merely pessimistic and predict doom and gloom for the country. The reality is that only the future will tell what the Tinubu/Shettima presidency will mean for Nigeria, and no level of optimism or pessimism will change that. The beauty of democracy is that these differences in opinion and expectations are allowed and even encouraged. Democracy is at its best when and where there are conflicting and opposing ideas and interests in the open market of ideas.  I must admit that the actual presidential inauguration ceremony is just symbolic. The elections confer power, and the swearing in and handing over are mere rituals steeped in symbolism that entrenches our collective psyche that power has changed hands and new kids are in the block. It is only human and traditional that we have transition ceremonies, and that’s the way we make sense of the civil handover of power in a democracy. To illustrate the power associated with this symbolism, in 2009 ,President Barrack Obama retook his oath of office a day after his swearing-in because he missed one word during the swearing-in ceremony. On the 29th of May 2023, Nigerians will witness the swearing-in of a new president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces to the delight of most Nigerians amidst fanfare and jubilations.  However, most Nigerians will be enthralled less by the rituals and ceremonies and would rather focus more on the overarching challenges Nigeria is facing at the fore of their minds and wonder how the new administration will be deliberate and intentional in tackling these problems. Our nation has a humongous debt crisis, rapacious poverty, omnipresent insecurity, deepening divisiveness, nauseating nepotism, ballooning inflation, and unsettling unemployment, amongst other not-too-good indicators of falling standard of living.  Advertisement  Beyond the symbolisms and rituals, this transition offers renewed hope, new opportunities and a new sense of optimism, no matter your political view or leaning. It is another fresh start to redefining our problems and developing bespoke solutions. There are five significant ways this transition matters to Nigerians.  First, it is natural to expect a new lease of life with a new administration. Nigerians expect the new administration to hit the ground running from day one and issue policy directives that will give renewed hope to people overwhelmed by suffering. Humans, by nature, desire change, especially in a democracy. The need for change for the better has become existential for most people. If Nigeria continues in its current stunted growth trajectory, the outcome will be unimaginable. Admitted in the past eight years ,we made some progress in infrastructure and a few other areas. Overall, in a democracy , leaders are merchants of hope. But hope not backed by positive actions is merely wishful thinking. Our problems are numerous; the new administration needs the “magic wand” to wave and make them all go away. However, we only hope that this administration will lay the foundation for a better future – a future where slowly but surely, we as a people have developed the capacity and resources to improve our lives and live up to the true meaning of our creed “unity, peace and progress”.  Second, Nigerians want to hear and see what the new administration will do with fuel subsidy, taxation , our debt profile, electricity tariff, foreign exchange regime, national census, and youth unemployment. The outgoing administration has shied away from dealing with these sensitive issues in a timely and responsive manner , but the people expect this administration to deal with these issues head-on. One might argue that these are elite concerns but whatever option the new administration chooses has domestic social, economic, and political implications. This is even more crucial because we fought the last presidential election on these issues. The Nigerian electorate is savvy and much more enlightened than in the past. They demand answers and solutions. The young people are getting more politically active – some even militant about it – and are demanding change for their future. These facts are on the front burner of this administration’s agenda.  Third, Nigerians desire to see how the administration will tackle insecurity from day one. The people expect the new administration to show dexterity and innovativeness in managing insecurity, which has become our albatross. Insecurity is destroying our society, and we will not achieve meaningful progress in the face of insecurity. It is crippling and forcing us to change our way of life. The worst problem with insecurity is psychological. There is a pervading, insidious and heightened emotional sensitivity that insecurity has put in Nigerians that influences all our decisions – from the minute to the major. There is a lingering fear among Nigerians living in Nigeria that evaporates when you step out of our shores. This sensitivity is made worse by the ever presence of paraphernalia of insecurity – police, private security, paramilitary and military presences everywhere, convoys of cars blowing sirens with heavily armed men protecting our elites, stories of kidnappings, killings, and robberies everywhere, and ever-present rumours and memes about insecurity. As the new government works to tackle the real insecurity issues, it must work to tackle the psychology of insecurity that has shaped our collective consciousness.  Advertisement  Fourth, Nigerians want to see specific steps the new administration will take to unite the country, acknowledging that the administration is coming to power not with an overwhelming national mandate (36% of voters and not 51%). Nigeria has never been this divided and factionalised along different lines. There is no denying that the last presidential elections were fought on ethnoreligious lines, and they touched on our highly contentious ethnic and religious fault lines. This new administration must take steps to heal the country and intentionally solidify our unity and diversity. Even in dealing with the contentious issue of the challenge of its legitimacy in court by opposition parties, the new government must put the nation first and above other political considerations , no matter the supposed temporary advantage that it may bring.  Fifth, simply put, is the issue of bread and butter. There is hunger and poverty in the land. The elite who will make up the core of government must remember that. They must feel the pulse of the nation. People are suffering, and many are desperate. Nigerians have never seen this level of hunger and poverty before. We must do something about this and very quickly!  There is no gainsaying the complexities and complicated options before this new administration. The problems are numerous, the people are pessimistic or mostly ambivalent, and the resources are scarce. Given our economic circumstances, solutions to many issues take time to fathom. Some pundits predict that the new administration may not be radically different from the old one, given that they are from the same party and share a similar ideology. The presidential election court cases are ongoing, and some Nigerians are expecting miracles – and you do not blame them. It is in this milieu that the presidential transition is happening. This is one transition happening in a most challenging period in the life of Nigeria.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhYmxlLm5nL3doeS10aGlzLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC10cmFuc2l0aW9uLW1hdHRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This year is no exception – but while there are several exciting titles announced for 2023’s cinematic lineup (like the Anne Hathaway-starring lesbian thriller “Eileen” and Dan Levy’s directorial film debut “Good Grief”), many of their release dates are slated for later in the year or still to be determined.  That doesn’t mean there aren’t a few good options for queer movie buffs looking for some “spring fresh” cinema, and the Blade has compiled a few suggestions.  MOVIES  The First Fallen (Digital/DVD, available now)  A Brazilian release from 2021 making its debut on US screens, this 1983-set historical drama from writer/director Rodrigo de Oliveira follows a group of small-town LGBTQ men and women as they face the first wave of the AIDS epidemic. We haven’t seen it ourselves yet, but it comes with a five-star Rotten Tomatoes rating and the subject matter strikes a deep communal chord. Johnny Massaro, Renata Carvalho, and Victor Camilio lead the cast.  Lonesome (Digital/DVD, available now)  Another import making its way to U.S. screens, this Australian Outback-meets-big-city romance from director Craig Boreham explores “sexuality, loneliness and isolation in a world that has never been more connected” through the story of a country boy (Josh Lavery) who, fleeing from small-town scandal, arrives in Sydney and meets a city lad (Daniel Gabery) with secrets and struggles of his own. In their new acquaintance, the two young men “find something they have been missing, but neither of them knows quite how to negotiate it.” We don’t want to spoil anything, but since this festival-circuit favorite was praised by reviewers for its masterful use of erotic storytelling, it’s safe to assume they figure it out.  Scream VI (In theaters March 10)  The rebooted horror franchise – originally created by queer screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who in an interview around 2021’s “Scream V” said the movies were “coded in gay survival” – picks up where it left off, as the four survivors the latest Ghostface killings leave Woodsboro behind to start a fresh chapter. Melissa Barrera, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Jenna Ortega, Hayden Panettiere, and Courteney Cox return to their roles, joined by Jack Champion, Henry Czerny, Liana Liberato, Dermot Mulroney, Devyn Nekoda, Tony Revolori, Josh Segarra, and Samara Weaving.  Another chapter in the ‘Scream’ saga is coming this spring. (Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures)  The Tutor (In theaters, March 24)  Recently out “Stranger Things” star Noah Schnapp hits the big screen in this eerie thriller from writer Ryan King and director Jordan Ross, in which an in-demand tutor (Garrett Hedlund) accepts a lucrative offer to take on the son of a wealthy elite family (Schnapp) as his pupil and finds himself becoming the object of an unsettling obsession – a situation that quickly escalates toward the sinister as his creepy new student threatens to tear apart the life he is building with his newly pregnant wife (Victoria Justice) before it even begins. Ekaterina Baker, Jonny Weston, Michael Aaron Milligan, Exie Booker, and Ashritha Kancharla also star.  Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (In theaters March 31)  Yes, the venerable RPG (that’s “role-playing game,” for the uninitiated) played on the tabletops of countless Gen X nerds is coming to the screen once again, this time as a big-budget sword-and-sorcery adventure starring Chris Pine, “Bridgerton” hunk Regé-Jean Page, bi “Fast & Furious” star Michelle Rodriguez, queer actor Justice Smith, and Hugh Grant. Planned as the ambitious launch point for a “multi-pronged” franchise that includes a graphic novel tie-in, an upcoming television spin-off, and a slate of future installments across these and other forms of media, it’s an eagerly awaited roll of the 12-sided dice in an unpredictable market already saturated with tent-pole style entertainment options. After years in development and multiple COVID-related delays, moviegoers – doubtless including millions of queer fantasy fans – will finally get to decide whether or not it was worth the gamble.  Renfield (In theaters April 14)  The renaissance of Nicolas Cage continues with another franchise-ish new action-fantasy, this one more in the in the horror vein – a vein injected with a healthy dose of humor by director Chris McKay (“The Lego Movie”) and screenwriter Ryan Ridley. Nicholas Hoult (“A Single Man,” “The Great”) stars as the title character, the long-suffering lackey of Count Dracula (Cage, in a role it was inevitable he would eventually play), who discovers an unexpected new outlook on life when he falls in love with a traffic cop (Awkwafina) in modern-day New Orleans. Ben Schwartz and Adrian Martinez round out the cast of what looks to be a highly entertaining tall-tale blend of gothic vampire camp and quirky comedic reinvention. As for the LGBTQ connection, well, “Dracula” author Bram Stoker was reputedly queer, and that’s a good enough excuse to give this promising romp a chance.  Little Richard: I Am Everything (In theaters and VOD April 21)  A must-see for fans of both documentaries and classic rock ’n roll, not to mention anyone interested in the story of a unique individual charting his own course of self-expression in a world that wasn’t ready for what he wanted to be, this richly illuminated film profile from director Lisa Cortés was the opening night documentary selection at this year’s Sundance Festival. Framed as a story of “the Black queer origins of rock ’n roll,” it aims to dismantle “the whitewashed canon of American pop music” by positioning its titular subject – whose “real” name was Richard Penniman – as an innovator who forever shaped the genre with his irresistibly flamboyant style and persona. Offering a wealth of archive and performance footage alongside interviews with family, musicians, and cutting-edge Black and queer scholars, the film brings us into an icon’s complicated inner world, “unspooling” his life story with a comprehensive sense of scope and a keen eye for important detail.  Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret (In theaters April 28)  Fifty-three years after its publication, Judy Blume’s iconic piece of YA fiction comes to the screen for the first time in this adaptation from writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig starring Rachel McAdams and featuring Abby Ryder Fortson as the title character – a sixth-grader who moves to a New Jersey suburb from New York City with her mixed-faith parents (one Christian, one Jewish), prompting her to go on a coming-of-age quest for her religious identity. A touchstone for generations of young readers, the original novel has been a perennial source of controversy – not only does it depict a child allowed the freedom to choose their own religious beliefs, it contains frank discussions of “taboo” issues relatable to young teen girls, like menstruation, bras, and boys. Naturally, that means it has been included, along with other classic titles from among Blume’s work, on countless lists of “banned books” across the five decades since it first saw print. That is more than enough reason to go out and support this female-led screen adaptation with your box office dollars, as far as we’re concerned.  TELEVISION  When it comes to the small screen, spring 2023 brings not as many new shows of queer interest as it does the return of queer favorites we’re already hooked on, like the second seasons of both Showtime’s grim-but-gripping girl scout survival series Yellowjackets (March 24) and HBO’s sweet-and-gentle Somebody Somewhere (April 23). As with the movies, there are numerous upcoming titles that pique our interest, but many of them have yet to announce a premiere date. We’ll include the most enticing of those in our list of new TV series below, so you’ll know to watch for them, but keep in mind some or all of them may not come until later in the year.  Daisy Jones & the Six (Prime Video, now streaming)  Prime Video just dropped is this 10-episode limited series adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel about the rise and fall of a fictional rock group in the Los Angeles music scene of the 1970s, which frames its profile of the Fleetwood Mac-inspired titular band in a pseudo-documentary style and tracks the reasons behind their break-up at the height of their worldwide fame. Offering an attractive cast led by Riley Keogh, Sam Clafln, Camila Morrone, Suki Waterhouse, Will Harrison, Josh Whitehouse, and Timothy Olyphant, and an iconic period setting and subject matter guaranteed to inspire some fabulous costumes, if nothing else, this one has sufficient queer appeal to make our list.  Swarm (Prime Video, March 17)  Speaking of fictional re-imaginings of real-life music icons, multi-hyphenate “Atlanta” creator Donald Glover and playwright/screenwriter Janine Nabers offer up this darkly satirical horror series about fan obsession, centered on a young woman named Dre (Dominique Fishback) who goes to deadly extremes in her “stan-dom” of a certain pop star. No, the star in question isn’t Beyoncé, but her fanbase calls itself “the Swarm,” so you can draw your own conclusions from that. It’s a provocative premise that’s bound to ruffle some feathers, but that’s precisely what gives co-creator Glover his well-deserved reputation for delivering edgy, genre-defying content. All we can say is that if it’s half as unnervingly delightful as the first two seasons of “Atlanta,” we’re on board. Chloe Bailey, Damson Idris, Rickey Thompson, Paris Jackson, Rory Culkin, Kiersey Clemons, and Byron Bowers also star.  Marriage of Inconvenience (Dekkoo, April 6)  Subscribers to gay male-targeted streaming service Dekkoo can look forward to a romantic comedy described as “a 21st century gay version of ‘The Odd Couple’” centered on two mismatched strangers who enter a witness protection program and must pretend to be happily married to each other to keep their identities hidden from the people who want them dead. Series writer/creator Jason T. Gaffney stars as a messy, street-smart dropout with anger issues opposite David Allen Singletary as an even-tempered English professor conditioned to living an orderly, carefully structured life. They have nothing in common and they can’t stand each other, but at least they’re both gay – which, as we all know, is still no guarantee they’ll be able to find common ground. With a clearly campy premise like this, it should still be fun to watch them try.  Dead Ringers (Prime Video, April 21)  Rachel Weisz does double duty in this reimagined expansion of director David Cronenberg’s classic 1988 thriller about identical twin gynecologists who dupe unsuspecting patients into participating in their perverse sexual fantasies. The twist? While Cronenberg’s film featured a pair of male siblings, this one flips the gender of its creepy twins – and in so doing, opens up a whole plethora of queer possibilities to be explored. As anyone familiar with the original already knows, it’s a story full of twisted psychology and grotesque body horror, not for the faint of heart. We can’t wait.  Love & Death (HBO Max, April 27)  Queer fan favorite Elizabeth Olsen (“WandaVision”) stars in this true crime miniseries about real-life “good Christian” Texas housewife Candy Montgomery, who claimed self-defense at her murder trial after taking an axe to the wife of a man with whom she was having an extramarital affair. The lurid story has already been told (in last year’s “Candy,” with Jessica Biel as Montgomery), but with writer/producer David E. Kelley – whose back catalogue includes a host of successful shows from “Doogie Howser, MD” to “Big Little Lies” – behind it, we can be sure that this version will have a unique quality of its own. Jesse Plemons (“Breaking Bad,” “The Power of the Dog”) co-stars as the other half of Candy’s illicit and ill-fated romance, with Lily Rabe as his unfortunate wife; Parick Fugit, Elizabeth Marvel, Tom Pelphrey, Krysten Ritter, and Beth Broderick also star. In this case, perhaps, the queer appeal comes from the irony of watching supposed “good Christian” types engage in the kind of depraved and detrimental behavior they regularly condemn everyone else for – and that’s good enough for us.  As for the shows with launch dates still TBD, the standouts include:  The Idol (HBO) – a buzzy series starring Lily-Rose Depp as an aspiring pop star and Abel “the Weeknd” Tesfaye as the self-help guru with whom she becomes involved. Supporting players include Dan Levy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Hank Azaria, and musicians Troye Sivan and Moses Sumney.  Ripley (Showtime) – a limited series adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s classic 1955 novel “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” with out Irish actor Andrew Scott as its charming-but-sociopathic anti-hero; likely to bring the original story’s gay subtext to the screen much more directly than the 1999 film adaptation starring Matt Damon, it also stars Johnny Flynn and Dakota Fanning.  Fellow Travelers (Showtime) – Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey star in this adaptation of Thomas Mallon’s book about two men who begin a volatile clandestine romance while working for the government during the 1950s McCarthy era. Allison Williams also stars.  Glamorous (Netflix) – Created by Jordon Nardino (“Star Trek: Discovery”) and Damon Wayans Jr., this Brooklyn-set drama centers on a gender-non-conforming youth (Miss Benny) who falls under the wing of a high-fashion makeup mogul (Kim Cattrall), and features guest stars like Matt Rogers, Joel Kim Booster, and Monét X Change. Sounds fabulous.

"religious miracle","2023-02-02","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T16:04:00","Winter’s longest month is almost over  Winter’s longest month now has only three days remaining. The month will soon be history followed by February, the shortest month of the year. Even though February is short it can be our snowiest month and perhaps our coldest month. As January comes down to its final days, the hyacinths, jonquils, and daffodils are preparing to produce spring flowers. Wild onions are showing up on the lawn and American violets now have heart-shaped leaves on them. Spring is over the horizon and 52 days away. There is still a batch of cold weather to deal with before and after spring arrives.  Groundhog day less than week away  The day is also known as candlemas in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Dutch have a custom of burning a candle all night as a signal that spring will be welcome. Spring is really the subject of Groundhog Day. If he sees his shadow that day we have six more weeks of winter. If he does not see his shadow, we still have six more weeks of winter. The groundhog is not much of a weather guru!  Getting rid of the creepy chickweed Grinch  The Grinch is green and ugly, and so is the chickweed that thrives during the winter months. It is green and ugly, but it is also easy to get rid of because it has shallow roots and practically grows only an inch or two beneath the soil. It is easy to pull up and throw out of the garden. Remove this pesky weed from the garden or rose bushes before it gets a head start. It is the easiest of weeds to get rid of.  We have gained a half hour of daylight  As the sunsets the wind-down of January, we will have gained a half hour of daylight since Dec. 21. It paves the way for a minute more of daylight each evening when the sunsets. We can continue to enjoy this increase every day until summer arrives and spring is a little more than 50 days away.  Preparing for the mowing season  The garden centers, hardwares, Home Depots, Walmart, Lowe’s Home Improvement and Ace Hardware already have lawn equipment displayed. If you need a new mower, now is the time to shop around for one and compare values. These shops have plenty of mowers waiting for you and you can choose the one that meets your needs. Check your sleeping mower during the last days of January. If your mower needs a tune-up, or some repair, now is the time to get your mower serviced. Most small engine repair shops are not as busy at this time of year. They will pick up your mower, service it, and return it to you for only a small fee. While it is being serviced, let them sharpen or replace the blade and check the battery and belts and get the mower ready for another season of dependable operation.  Making a butterscotch raw apple cake  Apples make great desserts in winter. This is a recipe that combines the caramel flavor of butterscotch with the tartness of raw apples and blended with chopped pecans for a wonderful winter treat. For this recipe, you will need one cup Crisco vegetable oil, two large eggs, two cups sugar, two and a half cups plain flour, three cups (seven or eight McIntosh or any tart apples), two three ounce boxes of Jello instant pudding, butterscotch flavor, one teaspoon pie spices, one teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon salt, one cup chopped pecans and one tablespoon vanilla flavoring. In a large bowl, add Crisco oil, eggs and sugar. In another bowl, mix plain flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and apple pie spices. Add to the sugar-oil mixture, and then add the chopped pecans. Peel the apples, cut into half inch cubes and run through the blender in “grate” mode and mix in a tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the apples to the mixture and the vanilla flavoring. Mix all the ingredients well. Spread the mixture into a 13x9x2 inch baking pan or dish sprayed with Pam baking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Cool the cake completely. Mix the Jello butterscotch instant pudding mix according to the instructions on the Jello boxes. Spread the pudding on top of the cake. This cake can be prepared a day before you want to serve it. Top with whipping cream, Dream Whip or Cool Whip if you desire.  Applying dormant oil spray to fruit trees  The fruit trees and grape vines will remain dormant for several more weeks and can still be pruned and trimmed for better production and appearance. On a calm day as January ends, spray the trees and grapevines with a coating of dormant oil spray to protect them from aphids and insects or diseases. A bottle of oil spray mixed with the proper amount of water will coat most of the trees and grapevines with a shiny coat of spray. The oil will protect the trees and vines and will help harvest to be protected from diseases and insect pests. The job needs to be done before the middle of February when buds start to form. On a calm day with no wind or rain in the forecast, the oil spray will stick to the limbs and the sun will dry it into the limbs.  A bit of February lore  We have a bit of cold weather lore to kick off the month. This lore says, “If February produces much snow, a fine summer it will bestow.” This is a positive thought to begin the shortest month of the year. Even though short, the month is capable of dumping quit a few inches of snow. Even though summer is quit a few months away, its always a good thought on these days before February begins.  Seventeen more days to shop for your Valentine  It is getting closer to the season of hearts, flowers, candy and love. The stores and shops are bursting with plenty of hearts, flowers and Valentine gifts. On the last cold days of January, you can warm your heart by searching for and shopping for Valentine gifts for friends, sweethearts, husbands, wives, children and grand-children. No matter whether you purchase gifts , candy, perfume, gift certificates or cards, always include a small box of candy to enclose with the card or certificate, wrap with Valentine wrapping and place a bow on the box. This will make the gift extra special and a more expressive way to show love.  Getting rid of sticks, stones and litter  The lawn of mid-winter is bare, brown and at this time while it is still dormant, it is an opportune time to check for objects such as sticks, stones, obstacles and litter. These objects could get tangled in your mower blade later in the season. While the lawn is in the dormant stage, hidden objects can be discovered and retrieved and placed in the trash bin before they cause problems when you start the mowing season.  Strike is the best variety of green bean  When it comes to selecting the very best variety of green bean, Strike wins over all the rest of the green beans including the great favorite Top Crop. Strike is a great producer and totally string-less. They produce an abundance of quality beans all summer. They are long and pencil shaped and deliver clusters of beans when continually harvested. They will produce a harvest over several weeks instead of at one time. One of their attributes is that they grow upright and are easier to harvest. They can also be sown in late June to provide a second harvest. They are one of the best green beans for canning or freezing because of their uniform size and shape as well as their attractive color.  Keeping road salt rinsed from vehicles  Road salt in the winter really helps the highways to melt snow and ice but is not to good on your vehicle. After each snow or ice event, connect up the hose on a day when temperatures rise above freezing and rinse off all the salt. Also spray under the bottom of the vehicle to rinse off salt. Use a few paper towels and some glass cleaner to clean your vehicles wiper blades and windshield to clean away slush and salt.  Avoiding ice melt and salt on driveway  Using salt and ice melt on driveways can damage the grass on the lawn because the salts will run off with the water onto the lawn when it flows off the driveway. Use the snow shovel to remove the snow from the driveway. Grass has enough problems with the chemicals in many lawn fertilizers and so called turf builders.  Disconnect hoses  If you use hoses to wash cars, fill birdbaths, or water perennials, always remember to disconnect the hoses and cover the faucets with the covers to prevent plumbing from freezing. Roll up the hoses and store them to keep water in them from freezing.  Hoe hoe hoedown  “Learning fast.” Officer: “Ma’am, I stopped you because you were going 80 mph.” Young lady: “Wow, that’s very neat! I just learned to drive yesterday!”  “Bad ride.” Fran: “I’ve got the worst kind of car trouble anyone could possibly have.” Jan: “What kind of trouble are you having?” Fran: “The motor wont start, and the payments won’t stop!”  The cardinal could be national Valentine bird  We can already see a natural Valentine on the front lawn on a mid-January morning when the colorful cardinals visit the feeders and birdbath. Frosty crystals with the winter sun shining on them and maybe a dusting of snow enhances the color of the cardinals. They are colorful in all four seasons but the white background of frost and snow creates a natural Valentine’s card. The cardinal could be the official bird for Saint Valentines Day.  Getting ready for a season of white stuff  Will we get much snow as we move on into the New Year? We are certainly hoping for a few hefty snowfalls and we know most children are also. Now is the time to get down to the serious expectation of some snow, sleet, ice and freezing rain and a wintry mix during January and February. Get the snow shovel out of storage or purchase one now because the best time to purchase them is when no snow is on the ground. Buy a new ice scraper or two and several cans of de-icer spray. Keep several flashlights handy in case the power goes off. Keep a few easy to prepare meals on hand and some sandwich ingredients and snacks for kids on snow days.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10YWlyeW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvMTE5OTg1L2FncmljdWx0dXJhbC1zb2NpZXR5LWhlbHBlZC1zcHVyLWdyb3d0aC1wcm9zcGVyaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1956-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Naples"", ""Campania"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-21T08:07:38","“Not only our actions, but also our inactions, become our destiny.” ~ Heinrich Zimmer (The King and the Corpse)  This week marked the 14th anniversary of the ending of the long Eelam War.  This week also saw the re-emergence of BBS head-honcho Galgoda-Atte Gnanasara to save the nation from that enterprising entrepreneur-of-cloth, Pastor Jerome Fernando. Much verbal thundering was heard warning of a new religious war.  Later in the week, a bunch of Sinhala-Buddhist extremists crashed into a ceremony at the Borella Cemetery held in the memory of all the war-dead. They condemned the event as a commemoration of the Tigers, probably on the grounds that those Tamils who died in the war (especially in the Rajapaksas’ Humanitarian Operation with zero-civilian casualties) were Tigers, right down to babies and toddlers.  The week ended with another group of lay-and-monk warriors gathering by the Buddha statue outside the Fort Railway Station, pledging to protect rata, jathiya, and agama.  Fortunately, ordinary Lankans, immersed in the real struggle for economic survival, ignored these theatrics, turning what could have been explosions into damp squibs.  The ending of the long Eelam War brought neither peace nor prosperity even for the triumphant Sinhalese. The much awaited peace dividend was swallowed by a defence establishment that continued expanding. The Rajapaksas treated the entire Tamil population of the North and parts of the East like enemy aliens, locking up every man, woman, and child in open air prison camps called Welfare Villages (Indian and international pressure eventually compelled them to abandon this policy of mass incarceration). When the cry of the Undead Tiger failed to impress the South, the regime sought other enemies, flirting with ‘alien Christians’ before settling on ‘Encroaching Muslims’. The harvest of that toxic seeding was reaped in April 2019, three weeks short of the 10th anniversary of Eelam War’s ending.  The war was unnecessary, preventable. Every step towards it was motivated not by national necessity or even popular demand. The motive force was the hellish union between political opportunism and religio-racial extremism. As the events of the last week indicate, that union is far from dead and its current partners are waiting impatiently to return to political mainstream. Unchastened by our blood-soaked history, they want to repeat it.  Until 1955-56, Lankan politics was cleavaged by class. That classic divide left little electoral space for SWRD Bandaranaike’s ambitions. His newly formed SLFP had challenged the UNP and lost in 1952. In the 1953 Hartal that shook the nation and forced a government to flee, he was an onlooker. The left had a real chance to form a government at the next election, especially if its fractured components could bring themselves to work together. Had Lanka taken that path, there would have been no Sinhala Only, no Sri riots of 1958, no Black July, and no 25-year war.  SWRD Bandaranaike was clever enough to know that in a political battlefield divided along class lines he couldn’t prevail and unscrupulous enough to adopt the noxious race+religion=nation equation as his signature policy. He accepted the Buddhist Commission report in toto. Monks formed Eksath Bhikshu Peramuna and engaged in house-to-house campaigning to ensure his victory.  Our tragedy is littered with paths not taken. The Buddha Jayanthi of 1956 could have been celebrated by focusing on what the Buddha taught, and by commencing a process of spiritual renaissance. Instead, under the guise of restoring Buddhism to its pre-colonial glory, Tripitaka was abandoned for Mahawamsa and the core Buddhist values of compassion, non-violence, and moderation replaced with hate, violence, and extremism.  The Buddhist Commission Report’s title was The Betrayal of Buddhism. The real betrayal had come from within, the work of monks and kings. A universalist teaching had been ghettoised into the exclusive preserve of a single race. A teaching that explicitly rejected caste has been distorted by embedding caste discrimination into its very heart. The Buddhist Commission report could have chartered a course to return debased Lankan Buddhism into what the Buddha taught by ridding it of the twin perversions of race and caste. Instead it ignored the division of a single monkhood into caste-based nikayas (a distortion created by a Kandyan king) and focused on entrenching the racial ghettoisation of Buddhism.  1956 might have become a year of true nation-building. Buddhism, cleansed of distortions, could have become a binding agent for a nascent Lankan nation. Instead, an unholy alliance of monks and politicians turned Buddhism into an agent of division. 67 years later, that spectre continues to haunt us.  Fiction and Unfiction  In January this year, an outcry was heard about a fake Temple of the Tooth being built in Pothuhera in Kurunegala by a man who called himself a Bodhisatva (a future Buddha – a tad like Prophet Jerome). People were donating money and jewellery to fund this edifice, the media claimed. Donations were pouring in from here and abroad. The prelates of Malwatte and Asgiriya together with the Diyawadana Nilame of the Temple of the Tooth wrote to the president seeking political intervention against this fakery. (Incidentally, the chief prelates of other two nikayas did not sign the letter as caste bars them from playing any role in rituals surrounding the tooth relic).  The facts were telling. An enterprising individual thought to build another Temple of the Tooth. There were enough Buddhists willing to believe his claim that once the edifice was complete, the tooth relic would come to him. The entire sorry tale demonstrates how far a rational teaching which accepts the law of cause-and-effect (hethu-pala-vadaya) had degenerated into a myth-ridden superstition in which relics could perform miracles and trees grant wishes. In this version of Buddhism, men are arrested for ‘insulting the Buddha’ (or his relics) while those who claim to be his robed-disciples violate his teachings on a daily basis.  The Buddha, in his final major sermon, set out the path for the sasana’s survival and expansion (https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html). He mentioned seven conditions, seven further conditions, seven good qualities, seven factors of enlightenment, seven perceptions, and six further conditions. If monks adhere to these 41 stipulations, the sasana would flourish. He made no mention of state patronage, of his pristine teachings surviving only in an island called Lanka, of rituals or relics. His sole focus was on the conduct of the monks themselves. And in what passes for Buddhism in Sri Lanka today, almost every single one of those conditions are violated daily and in plain sight. Those violations are ignored while talking about them is being turned into a non-bailable crime.  In 2019, the writer Shakthika Sathkumara was arrested under the ICCPR and held without bail. The arrest was the outcome of a complaint made by a group of monks about a short story he wrote (Ardha – Half). The story is about life in a fictional monastery and contains a hint about the abuse of young monks by senior monks. According to a police spokesman, “A group of monks complained that the reference to homosexual activities among the clergy insulted Buddhism.”  Vinaya pitaka refers to sexual misconduct by monks and specifically lists the masturbation of one monk by another as a serious offence. The Buddha obviously understood that becoming ordained will not free a person from human desires. Only the stream-enterers would be free of such yearnings. Since there are no known stream-enterers in Sri Lanka, the kind of misconduct the Buddha made rules against is likely to be present here. The arrest of several monks for suspected child abuse (including sexual abuse) this year alone indicates that what Shakthika Sathkumara’s fiction alleges is present in real life. Unfortunately, in today’s religious universe, the crime is less offensive than talking about it.  A new trend among political monks is to refer to the saffron robe as ‘Arahat dajaya’ (the standard of enlightened monks). This new myth is a marker in the ongoing attempt to place monks above scrutiny and criticism. This is reminiscent of the kind of blind veneration and unthinking obedience rife in many parts of Catholic Europe until a few decades ago and is present in some Charismatic churches even today (in a remake of the Jonestown horror, the head of Good News International Church in Kenya persuaded his followers to die of starvation to meet Jesus fast. Many did. The pastor is alive and well and currently out on bail). Walter Benjamin in One Way Street, provides an example, something he experienced during a visit to Naples, Italy, in the 1920’s. “…a priest was drawn on a cart through the streets of Naples for indecent offenses. He was followed by a crowd hurling maledictions. At a corner a wedding procession appeared. The priest stands up and makes the sign of a blessing, and the cart’s pursuers fall onto their knees.” This is where we headed. A monk does not have to adhere to the teaching. All he has to do is to wear the robe, just as all that Neapolitan priest had to do was to make the sign of the cross.  Superstition can be dismissed as silly. But it stems from the same irrationality which accepts the perversion of a teaching based on compassion and loving kindness to all living beings into one which rewards the killing of unbelievers with heavenly bliss. It also opens the floodgates of stupidity, enabling such political machinations as the Kelani Cobra.  In the infamous Mahawamsa story which debuts the justification for a holy war there is a marker for a different path. In the story, King Dutugemunu is saddened by the human costs of his victory. “How shall there be any comfort for me….since by me was caused the slaughter of a great host numbering millions?” he laments. And the deaths he is mourning are not even of civilians in the enemy territory but of enemy combatants. The call of his conscience is closer to the Buddha’s teaching than the supposed advice given to him by monks. It would also provide a better path to a lasting peace, and a more effective counter to the triumphant return of politics of religio-racial addiction.  The Salvation Mania  In 2019, almost seven million Lankans ignored the evidence before their eyes and elected an economic ignoramus as president, believing that he could guide them to the promised land of development painlessly and fast.  Gullibility has become a national characteristic, something that unites us across racial, religious, class and other lines.  Pastor Jerome Fernando who calls himself a prophet and runs an extremely lucrative religious enterprise seems to epitome that specifically American construct: charismatic preacher who lords it over a fief and turns it into a profit-making venture. Such preachers embody in their teaching and practice the brashness of a certain strand of American capitalism and the anti-intellectual, anti-rational tendencies inherent in unadulterated Lutherism. Martin Luther rejected the concept of free will totally and advocated salvation via sola fide, faith alone. Fortunately for the world, Protestantism evolved into a more tolerant and rational faith due to active mediation by great humanists such as Philip Melanchthon. The American style charismatic preachers are outside this mainstream, advocating political and social stances that are often retrogressive. The role played by this outcrop of Protestantism in propping rightwing populist leaders from Trump to Bolsonaro is well-documented.  Pastor Jerome can perhaps be best understood by looking at the former Pitiduwe Siridamma thero who reinvented himself as Arhat Sri Samanthabadra and built another excellent religio-commercial enterprise, Umandawa. The one is as much of a follower of Christ as the other is a disciple of the Buddha. Both – and others of their ilk – work on vulnerabilities of people in uncertain times, turning fear and ignorance into lucre.  On October 3rd, 2002 a group of American Evangelical pastors wrote a letter to President George W Bush supporting a war against Saddam Hussein. The ‘Land Letter’ (named after its prime mover, Pastor Richard D Land) gave seven reasons why an invasion of Iraq would be a ‘Just War’. When Bob Woodward (of Watergate fame) asked President Bush if he consulted his (far more intelligent) father before invading Iraq, the younger Bush replied, “He is the wrong father to appeal to for advice… There is a higher father I appeal to” (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/woodward-shares-war-secrets/). The world is still living with the horrors that ‘divinely-mandated’ war, each unnecessary death a living reminder of what happens when religious irrationality bleeds into political irrationality.  Pastor Jerome cannot insult the Buddha even if he tries to. The Buddha was accused of worse and to his face, and his response was that since he refused to accept the insults, they would return to the ones making them. The danger Pastor Jerome represents is the same danger political monks and other politically active religious figures represent (including the Catholic Cardinal). Their words and deeds further exacerbate societal gullibility and social irrationality, making another 2019 and national follies of that order far more likely. But the battle that must be waged with such purveyors of blind faith and unquestioning obedience has nothing to do with law and incarceration. It is a contestation of ideas and ideals over the kind of future we want for Sri Lanka. A secular country where faith is a private matter and every citizen is free to follow a religion – or not – cannot be built on persecution and intolerance.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2xndWFyZGlhbi5vcmcvc3JpLWxhbmthLXBvbGl0aWNzLW9mLWFkZGljdGlvbi_SATtodHRwczovL3NsZ3VhcmRpYW4ub3JnL3NyaS1sYW5rYS1wb2xpdGljcy1vZi1hZGRpY3Rpb24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"religious miracle","2023-05-01","15:00:00","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-21T14:41:46","Me, I love saints.  I love the whole category of saints, holy people of their various religions. Holy people who are not quite considered gods, but who partake of something special.  Sometimes they’re martyrs for their faiths. Often they’re wonder workers, in large or small ways. They might have the marks of the divine like stigmata among Christians. They may blend into prophecy, or be charismatic teachers. A very important function of saints is as intercessors between humanity and the divine.  But, most of all saints, at least as I see it, as I find most attractive, is how saints are exemplars of the deep way.  In the West writ large, there are a ton of saints in the Roman & Orthodox calendars. Originally, in their corner of the Reformation, the Anglicans stripped their calendar down dramatically. Although they’ve been enriching it in very interesting ways over the last couple of hundred years. Mostly I like their calendar best. Although the Romans are the go to for obscure and surprising saints. Like, for instance, the Buddha.  Saints just have a way of popping up in the oddest of places.  Today, the 21st of May, marks the celebration of a prime example. One, I have to admit, I find very interesting. ‘Tis the feast of Helena of Constantinople, known in some circles as the Feast of the Holy Great Sovereigns Constantine and Helen, Equal to the Apostles.  Hard for me to imagine a blood thirsty tyrant like Helena’s son Constantine as an equal to the apostles. Although. I guess arguably as the author of what would become the normative face of Christianity, maybe. Sort of. And Helena. She’s much more attractive. He life is celebrated by the Catholic, the Orthodox and the Anglicans. Maybe some Lutherans, too.  As I noted Helena is the mother of Constantine “the Great.” We don’t want to confuse him with those lesser Constantines. Apparently the Brits like to say she was English, and want her to have been the daughter of a king. Others suggest a lower rank, including stable maid. Whatever, it doesn’t look like her life was all that easy. Until her son took over as head of the Roman Empire. Then things changed.  She was a pious person, an actual Christian, I believe. Unlike the rest of that clan who were in the tyrant business above all else. I don’t think there’s blood on her hands. Her major contribution to the church was to the religious tourist industry in Israel & Palestine. As well as giving the relic industry a much need shot in the arm. One angle on something that I think is actually much deeper. Or, co-exists with spiritual tourism. Pilgrimage. I will return to this in a moment.  Between 326 and 328 Helena traveled to the Holy Land and her tour guides at the time helped her to “discover” the sites of the nativity in Bethlehem, the ascension, Jesus’ tomb, the true cross, including several of the nails from the cross, as well as, on a side trip, the site of the burning bush.  Pretty cool. And I have no doubt she believed these were all exactly what they were presented as. So. I admit I don’t see equal to the apostles. Mother of the author of Christianity, Inc., perhaps. Patron saint for religious tourism, you bet. And, maybe a representative of something deeper. Again. Pilgrimage.  And something else. People don’t make themselves saints. Okay, some try. But, they’re at best always suspect. Saints, real saints, if you will, are woven out of many things. Some of it flesh and blood. Some of it a lived life. But other strands include human longing. And hope. And dreams. Put together by many people over time.  Miracles occur in their presence. They become icons. Saints are icons in the spiritual sense of sacred images. Whatever the great mess that came together in time and space to create them, they become windows into heaven.  And so, worthy of a pause. And a noticing. Helena. What invitation does her life bring to the spiritual pilgrim? Like, in this case, perhaps, a dive into the mysteries of pilgrimage itself.  The online version of my personal favorite dictionary for American English, Merriam-Webster gives two definitions for that word “quest.” First as “a journey made in search of something” and second, “a long and difficult effort to find or do something.” “Pilgrimage,” as it turns out, is also given two definitions. The first is “a journey to a holy place” and the second is “a journey to a special or unusual place.”  The dictionary goes on to cite the first usages for both English words in the fourteenth century. That can be a bit confusing as pilgrimage is one of the oldest of spiritual practices, and the idea of a quest is perhaps the oldest literary motif there is, songs of quest were sung around campfires, and became the subjects of the first bards in far distant antiquity. The quest is our human desire to find the treasures of our hearts. Pilgrimage is the journey of the heart. They are something critical for us, if we ever want to move from our status quo, from the comfortable shallows of our lives, and into our depths.  And, let’s be clear, like pretty much all spiritual practices, pilgrimage can be a way of avoiding the real deal, becoming tourists rather than pilgrims. There’s that famous story where a businessman, infamous for his harsh dealings with others, telling Mark Twain of his plans to take a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. “I’m going to climb Mt Sinai,” he explains. “And from the top of the mountain I’m going to read out the Ten Commandments to the world.” Twain replies, somewhat dryly, I imagine, “Or, you could stay in Boston, and try to keep them.” There is that.  I’ve known people who see their spiritual journey as a pilgrimage in a way that misses the point. The dream quest for them is a running away from the problems and difficulties of life. I suspect we need to take heed of that Buddhist text which proclaims, “how sad that people ignore the near, and search for truth afar.” Pilgrimage is not about running from, but rather running to.  Pilgrimage is a lot like that Medieval Jewish story of the man who dreams of a treasure buried by a lamppost at the edge of a bridge, who takes off on his quest, on his pilgrimage, and after much hardship finds the spot. While digging at the foot of the lamppost a policeman stops him. When the pilgrim tells his story, the policeman laughs and says he had such a dream himself, and in minute detail describes the man’s own basement. But, the policeman continues, you don’t see me chasing off after such things. Leaving the man in peace to return home and dig up the treasure.  That man had to wander in order to come home. Life’s pilgrimage is taking that walk, wandering out, and then going home. Often in order to find the true treasure we need to step out, to walk about, to experience the sacred way, in order to find our home.  It’s as natural as breathing. Who, as a child or, maybe today, hasn’t had a fantasy about embarking on an adventure and toward some wonderful object? This intuition, dream, aspiration, is about as baseline human as it gets. We all, or, just about every one of us, dreams of that better. I suggest the dream version is itself the origin of all quest. And, I think pilgrimage brings the dream of quest down to the earth. Pilgrimage is what we actually do out of that great dream.  It’s about taking that walk, long or short, home.  So. A pause is in order. A moment to notice and to reflect.  A saint shows us the way. Certainly one of the true ways…  ***  Through the eyes of religion  Through the eyes of an archeologist  And to conclude a delightful three minutes about pilgrimages. It’s supposed to be for kids. But. You know…  Icon of Helena may be purchased at the Damascene Gallery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRoZW9zLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9tb25rZXltaW5kLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1mZWFzdC1mb3ItaGVsZW5hLW1vdGhlci1vZi1jb25zdGFudGluZS1hLW1pbmQtYnViYmxlLW9uLXNhaW50cy1hbmQtcGlsZ3JpbWFnZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2017-04-01","21:00:00","{""Woodville"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T04:30:00","Transcript:  Before we start, a warning that this episode contains descriptions of suicide and violence. Please take care as you listen.  Coming up this time on “Just Say You’re Sorry”:  Chris Ax, a murder suspect, describing the Texas Rangers: [T]hey were everything to me ever since I was a kid. It wasn’t from anything I saw on TV, it was just, to me they symbolized and epitomized Texas.  Larry Driskill, describing his interactions with a defense lawyer: [I]f y’all gonna screw me, let’s just make this as easy as possible. Let’s say five years and let’s be done with this. He said they won’t do that.  Larry Driskill is sitting in his living room in Weatherford, Texas. He has just confessed to murder after spending the last two days being interrogated by Texas Ranger James Holland. But the Ranger didn’t arrest him in the interrogation room. He said Driskill could go home and tell his wife first. He made himself a drink and settled in for a conversation that’s hard to imagine: Telling a loved one, “Hey, I confessed to a murder.” But before he can really start, the deputies arrive, handcuff him and put him in the car.  Larry Driskill: There was a whole bunch of cop cars, trucks and all that [with] red lights on. And the guy that was cuffing me said, “I know you from hauling hay. Don’t think you’re going to outrun me or try to bully me or beat me up, because I’m bigger than you are.” Well, I didn’t try to fight nobody anyway. I just did what they told me to do.  Deputies drive Driskill right back to the sheriff’s office and book him into the Parker County Jail. He’s given one of those classic black-and-white striped uniforms to wear.  Larry Driskill: They put me in a cell by myself. It’s big enough to hold 20 or 30 people in there. But they put me in there by myself because of my job, because I was a licensed jailer for the state of Texas.  Because Driskill previously held a position of power over the other men in the jail, the authorities think he could be a target of violence, which means he is essentially kept in solitary confinement.  Larry Driskill: I think what might have helped me through it was being in the military. Because being a reservist, you’re on two-week duties. So you learned from your military training, and everything else too, that I can do this.  But this wasn’t a two-week Army tour. In fact, two years go by as Driskill starts talking to his lawyer, occasionally attends court, and basically waits to see if his case will go to trial. Every day is pretty much the same until Driskill starts being allowed to mix with other men in the jail.  Larry Driskill: I got where I was going out with the other guys playing handball, but it was awful, weird [to] this day.  Out on the yard, this day in April 2017, he meets a man. We aren’t going to tell you his real name as we don’t want to risk his safety. So we’ll call him John. He was arrested for stealing a lawn mower and then fleeing to Oklahoma to avoid the police.  Larry Driskill: I’m walking around, and he looks at me, and I nod my head and I talk to him for a couple minutes. And all I told him was, “I didn’t do it.”  This is Driskill’s story. But John? He claims that their conversation went very differently. He requested a meeting with the authorities.  Jail official: Let’s go right in here real quick. Your attorney, he’s in the back of the jail right now. Would you like any water or anything?  John: No.  Jail official: OK.  This is from a video I got of that meeting.  Jail official: I was told that you had some possible information on a homicide. Is that what I understand?  John: Yeah.  Jail official: OK. You say Larry Driskill, correct?  John: Yes, sir.  John wastes no time launching into the story of what happened when he talked to Larry Driskill out on the rec yard.  John: Larry has a bad habit of discussing his case. So we went to rec and we were sitting there talking and he actually told me that he did do it, and that the DA don’t have enough evidence against him to convict him.  Jail official: OK. What particulars did he tell you about his case?  John: He said [the murder] was in his truck. He did it over $20, and the reason he did it is because he thought she was robbing him.  Jail official: OK. Do you know who she is?  John: No, it was some prostitute.  Jail official: Some prostitute?  John: Yes.  This is basically the story in Driskill’s confession: sex worker tries to rob him, he fights back and kills her.  John: He told me that he strangled her to death because he thought she was gonna rob him, because he heard that her boyfriend and her had a history of robbing [men] after they were getting done doing the job.  John then offers to get more details from Driskill  John: I’m sure I can get more from him, because it wouldn’t be a problem.  But the investigator says no — that would effectively make him an agent of the state, which they’re not willing to do. John is released back to the jail and then, pretty quickly, Driskill hears about what happened.  Larry Driskill: A couple days later, they pulled me in and [showed] me what all he said and everything on the video.  Driskill denies ever confessing to John. He’s back out on the rec yard one day, and guess who he meets again.  Larry Driskill: After they showed me the video, they put him back over on our wing like a week later, and he comes out on the rec yard and was talking to me.  He said, “Mr. Driskill, I didn’t say nothing.” I said, “Stop right there.” I said, “I’ve seen the video, I’ve seen everything that you did…so leave it alone right there.” People in prison and jail don’t like snitches. I had some guys that said, “We’ll take care of him.”  Driskill told me he received a warning from the jailers: If anyone goes after John, we’ll blame you.  Larry Driskill: Snitches get stitches. You see people come out of prisons [who] got scars from here to here and that’s because they snitched.  At this point, Driskill has more than just this guy’s fate to worry about. He’s been in jail for more than two years, facing trial for a murder he still swears he didn’t commit. But if the case does go to trial, the jury will hear that he confessed to Texas Ranger James Holland and then the informant might testify too, and say that Driskill admitted guilt again in jail. How do you defend yourself when the other side says you confessed, not once, but twice?  The prosecutors also know this is the state of play, and that a first-degree murder conviction in Texas can lead to decades in prison, if not a life sentence. Driskill is in his 50s.  But instead the prosecutors offer a deal: He can take a sentence of just 15 years. He’d get out before his 70th birthday. All he has to do is plead guilty.  Larry Driskill: I didn’t really understand why all this was happening. And to this day, I still ask God every day, “Why’d you allow this? You know, I didn’t do it.”  From Somethin’ Else, The Marshall Project and Sony Music Entertainment, I’m Maurice Chammah. This is “Smoke Screen: Just Say You’re Sorry” Episode 4, “Memory, Taste and Odor.”  When I got this video of the jailhouse informant, it did throw me. Now there were two accounts of Driskill confessing to this murder. Was Holland right to use those interrogation tactics after all? It made me want to look at the bigger picture, not just of Driskill’s case, but of Holland’s track record: Was this an outlier? Or were there other people in Driskill’s situation?  I made a list of Holland’s old cases. I wrote to the people in prison. Some didn’t contest their guilt. One even praised Holland as a “perfectionist.”  As you might imagine, some did say they were innocent. But they didn’t have proof, and it quickly became clear that sussing out the truth in each case would be a major undertaking, if not impossible, which maybe I should have realized, because, well, look how much work Driskill’s case was to unpack.  All in all, I found five cases where Holland lied during the interrogation, and a similar number with “minimizing” talk of self-defense or accidents. There were a few with hypothetical how-would-you-have-done-it type language.  But one case, frankly, makes all of the rest seem pretty tame. The case of Christopher Ax.  Holland spoke to Ax on and off for weeks, and Ax was really good at describing to me what it was like to be on the other side of the Ranger’s tactics. So now we’re going to take a detour into his story, to show just how much Driskill was not alone.  Pretty soon after Driskill’s arrest, in early 2015, Holland travels north to Gainesville, Texas, a tiny town near the Oklahoma border. The sheriff’s office there has reopened the murder of a young woman named Shebaniah Dougherty. People called her by her middle name, Sarah.  In 1997, she was 20 years old, working at a video rental store. She didn’t come home after a night shift. Her body was discovered in a wooded area near an abandoned barn.  Holland studies the case file. He learns that Sarah was known as quiet and religious, not especially social. He reads about the leads they pursued back in 1997. They even hypnotized a witness back then.  There was a suspect during that original investigation, but detectives never found enough evidence to arrest him. Then he died in a car accident.  So now, 18 years later, Holland dives in. He starts looking into other people who knew Sarah, who were considered suspicious for whatever reason. He brings in the same forensic artist from the Driskill case to work with a witness and produce a sketch. They age the face in the image, just like in the Driskill case.  But — and maybe this isn’t surprising — it goes nowhere. There’s no pawn shop owner calling in to say he knows a guy.  At one point, Holland is interviewing Sarah’s sister, and she says [that] Sarah had a crush on this guy named Chris Ax. Then she says [that] Ax left town right after the murder, but now he’s back.  Holland drives over to where Ax is working.  James Holland: What do y’all do here?  Chris Ax: You know what Walmart distribution is?  James Holland: Yep.  Chris Ax: We’re kind of the same thing, only for electrical employment supplies.  James Holland: I gotcha.  Ax says he knows this is about Sarah, and he freely admits he left town in the wake of her murder, because he felt harassed as a suspect. He climbs into Holland’s vehicle.  James Holland: Hey, so tell me, I guess, what you know about Sarah.  Chris Ax: Let me think back.  Ax says, “We were friends. We knew each other’s families.” Remember, this is a small town where everyone knows everyone.  Chris Ax: Well, I knew the family for, well — my family has known that family for as long as I can remember.  James Holland: Yeah.  And not just that. They’d gone on a date once.  Chris Ax: And mom tried to set me up with Sarah one time, and we went out on a date, and it was good, but it was — there was nothing there. It was a friendship-only kind of thing.  Ax agrees to have a longer conversation at the sheriff’s office.  James Holland: You know, I look at this, as murders go, and it sounds stupid. And I know you don’t know anything about the crime scene, but, in a way, I don’t even see this as a murder. I see it more as an accident.  Ax is in his 30s, and much like Larry Driskill he’s a military veteran, now working blue-collar jobs in rural Texas. He had joined the Army as a teenager. He thought it would be a stepping stone to his real goal: to become a cop. And not just any kind of cop.  James Holland: Would you wanna be a trooper? Or you wanna be a [Texas] Ranger?  Chris Ax: Actually, I wanted to be a Ranger.  When I spoke to Ax myself, he told me that, growing up, he actually idolized the Texas Rangers.  Chris Ax: I mean they were everything to me ever since I was a kid. And it wasn’t from anything I saw on TV, it was just — to me they symbolized and epitomized Texas. And Texas was the best state. I mean, it’s the only state that could be its own country, and easily survive. And they epitomized Texas to me. They pretty much ran the show.  Ax tells Holland that in 1997, around the time of Sarah Dougherty’s disappearance, he was living with a roommate a few blocks from the video store where Sarah worked.  Because they were friends, he used to drop by while she was working.  James Holland: When did you start checking up on her at work?  Chris Ax: Maybe a month prior.  A month prior to Sarah’s disappearance.  James Holland: OK.  Chris Ax: Because I went to rent a movie from there, and I’d never been in there before, but I lived close to it, and I was like, I want a movie. So I walked in. Sure enough, she was working. After that, at least every other day, I try to stop in and say, “Hi.”  Holland says he wants to talk about the night Sarah went missing. He asks whether Ax checked on her that night. It was a Friday in March.  Ax told me he was never really sure that he saw her on the exact night she disappeared. But he tells Holland that he did drive by and saw the store was closed, which was unusual.  Holland asks Ax to rewind and go through his day leading up to that moment in detail.  Chris Ax: I started the day the way I always start my day. I wake up, I get dressed and I get in the car, and go get a Dr Pepper.  James Holland: OK.  Chris Ax: That’s been the same since I had a car.  Holland pushes him for more details beyond this daily run to get Dr Pepper. But Ax can’t remember much. Again, this was 18 years ago.  Out of nowhere, Holland drops one of his bombs. He reveals to Ax that he went and spoke to his roommate, the one he was living with around the time of the murder.  This is true. And apparently the roommate’s story is that Ax did go and get a movie from the store and had pizza the night Sarah disappeared.  James Holland: He says that you left the house at 9 o'clock, that you went up there, got movie and pizza and that you were back at, you know, like 10:30 or 11:00.  Ax denies getting a movie and isn’t sure if he had pizza. But there really was a pizza box found in Sarah’s car after her death. So Holland doesn’t let it go.  James Holland: But we know that she ordered pizza earlier that night.  Chris Ax: She did?  James Holland: Yeah. Domino’s.  Chris Ax: Um.  James Holland: And we know how much of the pizza was eaten…with someone else. And then she was saving the rest of it.  Chris Ax: I don't eat Domino’s. If I'd have gotten pizza, it would’ve been from Pizza Hut.  I’m not sure about you, but I don’t find this whole ‘I prefer Pizza Hut to Domino’s’ defense especially compelling.  Chris Ax: I know I’ve had pizza with her, but I don’t believe it was that day. And I think it only happened once, and it was just a fluke accident where I happened to get pizza and saw her working.  Holland asks whether Sarah had ever been to his house.  Chris Ax: No, not to my knowledge. If she had, I wasn’t there.  James Holland: Alright. You keep saying things that are indicative of deception. You’re killing me. You keep…  Chris Ax: Such as?  James Holland: “To the best of my knowledge…” “As far as I can remember...”  Chris Ax: It’s a military thing. When we can’t remember something, we always say, “To the best of my knowledge…” and, “To the best of my knowledge, no, I never saw her that night,” as in, “I don’t remember seeing her at all.”  You can hear how Holland is beginning to sound exasperated with Ax. Just like he was with Larry Driskill.  James Holland: I’ll be straight up with you. You’re either a great suspect or you’re the best witness in the world. It’s one of those two things.  Holland then goes to one of his favorite places: the land of hypotheticals. Remember how he asked Driskill, “How would you have committed murder?” Now he spins out a hypothetical narrative for Ax, drawing on the fact that he went on one date with Sarah, and she had a crush on him. What if it went further?  James Holland: I could see a scenario where you hook up and start going to first base, right? And everything’s going good. And all the signs are there and it’s two thumbs up. And all of a sudden, you know, kind of the psychotic-dad-religious-thing flips in, and this girl just freaks out and goes nuts.  Chris Ax: Well, considering the most I’ve ever done is maybe give her a light kiss — and when I say light, I mean, not even as in, “I like you as a girlfriend.”... No offense, to me that scenario’s completely crazy. Now, could it have happened with somebody else? Yeah, maybe, but not with me.  Holland says he believes him. But he needs to clear him. He says he wants Ax to help him find the real killer.  James Holland: Did you kill her?  Chris Ax: No.  James Holland: I believe you, alright, let me just say that. But I need to clear you, alright, which probably would be good. Would you agree? ... You didn’t kill anyone, right?  Chris Ax: No.  James Holland: OK. So that would feel good … but the second point of this would be: How good would it make you feel to get the son of the bitch who did it?  Chris Ax: Define how good would it make me feel to get him?  James Holland: I’m going to get him, but [you] leading me to the holy grail and giving me the information that I need to get there…  Chris Ax: …that would be good.  And that’s where they leave off.  James Holland: I want to prove definitively that you didn’t do this, right?  Chris Ax: Whatever I can do to help.  To recap this first interview: Holland has left Ax room to believe he’s not really a suspect. But he’s also started to mount the pressure through little revelations. He’s used the tactic known as “minimization,” pushing Ax towards a story where the victim’s death wasn’t really his fault. And there’s the whole hypothetical if-you-did-it line of questions.  The parallels with Larry Driskill are plain to see. But where Driskill had just one night before it all got really serious, Ax goes back to his daily life. But he stays in contact with Holland over the next five weeks.  Chris Ax: Then the texts came in, and the calls were coming in, and he was hounding me day and night while I was at work, when I was off work.  In the beginning, I wanted to help and I was gonna do everything I could to help.  Ax says he even went to Holland’s own office, in a different town, on three separate occasions for interviews.  Chris Ax: And then every time I went to his office, he would always accuse me of doing it.  Maurice: What would he say?  Chris Ax: “I know you killed her.” I mean, straight out, “Just tell me. Confess. It’ll make you feel better.” I said, “I’m not gonna confess to something I didn’t do.”  And he would call me while I was at work and I would say, “I am at work. I cannot talk to you right now.” [He’d say,] “Well, you need to quit your job. I’m more important right now.” His exact words.  Maurice: The way you say it almost makes him sound, out of context, like an abusive partner or something.  Chris Ax: Thank you for being the one to say that, because that is something I have never said, but it is 100% accurate.  Holland also starts to lie, telling Ax his DNA was found on the victim’s socks and shoes. Then, later on, he gaslights Ax, telling him, “I never said that.”  In a way, Holland is playing good cop and bad cop. He’s demanding and intense, but also chummy and persuasive, because eventually Ax says he does remember eating pizza with Sarah, the victim, at the movie store, then going to his house to hang out. He still can’t say, after 18 years, whether this happened on the day she disappeared. But over the course of the conversations, that distinction evaporates.  Holland asks him to take a polygraph. Ax is talking to a lawyer, on the side, who says, “Don’t do it.” But he does anyway. This takes place in late May of 2015, more than a month after Ax first met Holland.  After the polygraph, Ax is told that he has failed.  Chris Ax: I still don’t believe I failed that son of a bitch. If I did, it had to have been for a medical fucking reason.  This recording you’re hearing takes place around 9 p.m. Then there are five hours of intense back and forth: questions, speculation, frustration on both sides.  Finally, Ax relents, and tells Holland that it’s possible he accidentally choked Sarah, but Ax later follows up by saying that may just be the “vivid imagination of a tired mind.” It’s past 2 a.m. at this point.  He also says, “If I am responsible for her death…I’ll never forgive myself.”  This all turns out to be enough to justify an arrest warrant.  A few days later, Ax is at work.  Chris Ax: I went inside. I didn’t even get a chance to get a drink out of my drink. And I had armed men, probably 40 of ‘em. It felt like 40, it could have been 10, walking into that room, grabbing me, slamming me into the counter, saying, “You’re under arrest for the murder of Sarah.”  After Chris Ax is arrested, he stays up pretty much all night with James Holland. The recording of their exchange, which I got from the Cooke County District Attorney’s office, is more than eight hours long. The parallels with Larry Driskill are fascinating. But so is Holland’s perseverance. Ax really puts up a fight.  James Holland: James Holland with the Texas Rangers, June 4th, 2015. Time is 4:24 p.m. Interviewing Christopher Andrew Ax.  Even though Ax failed the polygraph and has been arrested, he’s still maintaining that he doesn’t remember any of this. He doesn’t remember killing Sarah.  James Holland: I don’t want to put someone in prison for the rest of their life. I don’t want someone to look at the death penalty when I know that this is self-defense.  Before Holland had said, “Maybe it was an accident.” Now he tries a theory of self-defense. It’s about an hour into the interview and Ax already sounds pretty hopeless.  Chris Ax: No matter how you splice it, no matter how you want to make it look good, the bottom line is my record that I have worked my entire life to keep clean is fucked.  And then we get another Holland classic you may recall this one from the last episode: the Grand Canyon.  James Holland: I told you before the other day, you're kind of like on the edge of the Grand Canyon, right? And you jump off, but you have to understand that once you jump, you jump, OK? You’ve jumped, OK?  Chris Ax: I didn’t jump, I got pushed.  Despite Holland’s best efforts, Ax just isn’t remembering. And then Ax does something shocking, at least to me. He suggests they visit the place where Sarah’s body was found.  Chris Ax: I need to see where it happened because one of two things is going to happen: Either I’m gonna firmly tell you I didn’t fucking do it when we get there, because there’s places I’ve been, and places that I haven’t been since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Or I’m gonna remember more.  James Holland: OK. Well, let’s go.  Chris Ax: I mean, fucking handcuffs.  I have to say: I’ve never heard of a detective taking a suspect to a crime scene before a confession. Talk about the risk of contaminating memories.  They drive over. It’s the middle of the night as they trek through the woods. They reach the abandoned barn. Ax says the walls look familiar.  A story emerges, very slowly, bit by bit, sort of a co-production of Holland’s and Ax’s late-night brains. Please skip ahead around a minute if you don’t want to hear talk of suicide.  In this story, Sarah made a sexual advance towards Ax. He rejected her. And then — and it’s a huge leap — she hanged herself. Ax tells Holland that he has this hazy memory of discovering her and of cutting the rope.  Chris Ax: I know somehow suicide came up, and I remembered sitting, just sitting on the step inside the building. And again, I was so freaking tired and I said, “I don't know why, but I could see somebody just swinging right there, like they had hung themselves.” And I think it was the fact that I was so exhausted. I was thinking back to the military.  When I met Ax, he told me that, during his time in the military, he was traumatized by a similar incident. One of his friends, a fellow soldier, did hang himself, and Ax discovered the aftermath.  Chris Ax: Yeah, him hanging himself — that did a number. I think it did a number on all of us, though.  Ax told me he wondered if the police interrogation revived this stress, contributing to the blur between memory and invention. Larry Driskill actually said something similar about his own trauma from an incident in the military.  Some psychologists have told me that past trauma might raise the risk of a false confession. Most of what we know comes from stories of kids and women who experienced domestic violence. But it doesn’t feel random that both Ax and Driskill had these traumatic episodes in the military before they confessed to Holland.  Ax and Holland return to the sheriff's office and over an hour goes by with them exploring the possibility of Sarah taking her own life.  And things become even weirder. They order pizza.  James Holland: Honestly, I was thinking about Domino’s pizza because I’m hungry. Maybe since you ate Domino’s pizza that night, that will help you.  Chris Ax: Huh? The one thing I do remember…  James Holland: Memory and taste and odor. Man, I’m telling you.  He’s saying, “Let’s eat the same kind of pizza as you did the night of your friend’s death. Maybe that will jog your memory.” In the Driskill case, he had asked a witness to concentrate on the five senses in his memories, hoping to unlock something new. That’s not really controversial: It’s part of a technique called the “cognitive interview,” the same one that Holland used on Michael Harden in Episode 2.  And it makes some sense: Who doesn’t have memories awakened by smells and tastes? But I’ve never heard of a detective actually using the physical item to revive the sensory experience, literally.  Eventually the pizza arrives.  James Holland: Yeah. You know? Yeah. I thought Domino’s had that 10-minute deal.  Unknown voice: Yeah, 30 minutes or it’s free.  James Holland: Oh, man, thank you. Do you want some?  Unknown voice: We got a second.  James Holland: Oh, you probably got pizza, didn’t you? Lucky Ax is in here, rolling over.  So now Holland tells Ax to focus on the flavor of the pizza. We’re nearly five hours into the interrogation at this point. It’s late into the night.  Chris Ax: One, I’m trying to remember. Two, I’m glad you like this pizza.  James Holland: It’s helping you though.  Chris Ax: No, that’s nasty.  James Holland: I’m here for you. I’m here for you.  Chris Ax: It’s nasty.  James Holland: I’m [inaudible] stuff right now, man.  Chris Ax: They didn’t cut it like this back then though.  James Holland: I’m [inaudible] stuff right now. I’m helping you to remember. Face that crust. Smell it.  About an hour later they start discussing a green rope found in Sarah’s car. That’s when Ax responds in a way he can’t control. He throws up. The next few things we cover are hard to listen to, but I think it’s important in order to understand the state that Chris Ax is in when he starts to cooperate.  James Holland: Dude, you all right?  Chris Ax: Not 100%, no.  James Holland: You want some water? I know that throw-up doesn’t taste good in the mouth.  I can think of other examples where someone who committed murder has a similar bodily response to being confronted about it. So I can see how this would really make Holland think Ax is guilty. When I interviewed Ax, he told me he had just been sick. But he also recalls feeling really hopeless.  Ax is so hopeless that now he sounds suicidal. He asks Holland to shoot him.  Chris Ax: All kidding aside, I really do wish you would just fucking shoot me. I’m not even bullshitting when I say that.  James Holland: Not gonna do it, man.  Chris Ax: I wish you would.  James Holland: Not that person.  Chris Ax: Well, I’m not the kind of person that kills somebody, but I’m in jail for it.  Maurice: At a certain point you'’e so resigned that you ask him to shoot you or you just say like, “This would be easier if you just shoot me now.”  Chris Ax: Yeah. Right.  Maurice: Do you remember that?  Chris Ax: Oh yeah, I remember that. I wanted it done. I wanted to be away from him, and I thought that was probably the only way I was getting rid of him.  Maurice: I see.  Chris Ax: I mean, to be completely honest.  It’s in this really vulnerable state, late into the night, when Ax starts to accept Holland’s scenarios. Holland starts to revise the story about Sarah Daugherty hanging herself. Instead, he says, “Well, maybe the rope was around her neck because you put it there. Maybe she attacked you, and you defended yourself.”  James Holland: But, I mean, if she comes at you with that thing and starts trying to wrap around your neck, and you push it off and it ends up around her, you know?  Chris Ax: Yeah. I would’ve pushed her hard at that point. It would've been…  James Holland: Yeah.  Chris Ax: … fight or flight and get the fuck off.  James Holland: Well, I mean, is this the ultimate self defense where she’s trying to kill you?  Chris Ax: I hate saying it, but it wouldn’t surprise me.  Holland asks for a more specific memory.  James Holland: Do you remember that rope coming up underneath you?  Chris Ax: Remember? No, but it’s…  James Holland: Can you feel it?  Chris Ax: Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense?  James Holland: Yeah.  Chris Ax: But the thing is, everything happened so fucking fast. Everything I did would've been pure reaction.  James Holland: Mm-hmm.  Chris Ax: I mean, pure reaction and the sole intent would’ve been getting her the fuck off.  James Holland: Mm-hmm.  Chris Ax: Not killing her, not ending her life, not hurting her, just getting her off.  This is the end of an eight-hour interview. Ax is clearly broken.  Chris Ax: I knew there was a point when no matter what I did, he wasn’t going away.  So Ax remains in jail. There are moments where, just like Driskill, he wonders: Did I really kill someone and not remember it? What does that say about me?  But at other moments, Ax gets his bearings and thinks: No, I am innocent. I didn’t kill anyone. This Texas Ranger just manipulated me into admitting things that are not true.  At this point Ax is in the same situation as Larry Driskill: Do I plead out and minimize my losses with a lighter prison sentence? Or do I fight this out in a trial? Ax has been charged with capital murder, meaning he could face the death penalty, or at the very least spend the rest of his life in prison. And to win, he’s somehow got to convince the jury that he didn’t do it, even though he confessed.  But there is a difference: In Driskill’s case, evidence from the crime scene is either not tested for DNA or the samples are too poor to provide usable results. We’ll get into that in the next episode. In Ax’s case, there are still DNA results pending.  Chris Ax spends more than three years in jail, waiting for his case to be investigated further and a trial date to be set. He doesn’t plead guilty. He plans to fight to the end. He has to wait as prosecutors and defense lawyers are making plans to duke it out in court. Finally, the trial is set for the fall of 2018.  But then the DNA test comes back.  It shows that the DNA on Sarah’s clothes matches the original suspect in the case, who had died in a car accident. Not Chris Ax.  This is a bombshell: Ax learns that this test was so damaging to the prosecution’s case that they are dropping the capital murder charge. He’s a free man. The DA puts out a press release. It says, “We cannot blindly seek convictions or close our eyes to evidence that points in a different direction than we are heading.”  To this day, the prosecutors in his case maintain the DNA test doesn’t ultimately prove Ax’s innocence. There was room for error. It’s just that they couldn’t justify continuing to pursue the case against him.  Ax, of course, continues to maintain his innocence and it’s true there’s no meaningful evidence against him except for his late-night confession to Holland.  But that’s not the end of his story. He told me that many people in his town are still convinced he’s guilty and got away with it. This makes it hard to get a job, to land an apartment, to meet people, to date.  When we spoke, at his mother’s house, he repeatedly mentioned the fact that several of his relatives died while he was in jail thinking he was a murderer.  And he has some really choice words for James Holland. He says Holland lied on the witness stand during a court hearing, saying he didn’t know Ax had a lawyer. We don’t have the records to prove or disprove that.  Chris Ax: He was a moron. I’m dead serious when I say that. It takes a certain kind of stupid to focus on just one person instead of looking at facts, and that’s all he was doing.  Maurice: I see.  Chris Ax: And I’m sorry, I’m not gonna pull punches when it comes to this guy. I refuse. How he became a Texas Ranger is beyond me, because that just shows me the bar, [the] level has been dropped so low for him to have gotten that far.  Larry Driskill never says things like that. Ax is angry. And at one point that anger was pointed, it felt like, towards me. After I first interviewed Ax, I wrote about his case and what Holland did.  Afterwards I went back and asked him, “Can I bring a microphone to your house and do an interview for this podcast?” Initially he refused. He said that in my article I made Holland sound too good. He said he felt betrayed.  Which is a matter of opinion. I don’t know if I could ever satisfy him on that front.  But more importantly, he said my article hadn’t really done anything for him. He’d thought maybe a lawyer would see it and help him sue Holland, but that never happened. It was sort of like: You got your story, but I’m still here, my life is still hard. He said he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk again.  In a way, it was sort of a relief. I came away from both the Larry Driskill and the Chris Ax interviews feeling conflicted about asking these guys to revisit moments of trauma in such depth.  When Ax got angry with me, it was like, “Finally!” This is sort of what I’ve been waiting for, someone to call me out for picking at their psychological wounds.  Ax saw himself as a victim,reasonably enough. He hadn’t been assaulted, and he hadn’t lost a loved one to murder. But he’d been traumatized. The things I’d felt approaching the family of Bobbie Sue Hill, the victim in Driskill’s case, returned. Was I just using him for a good story? And what did I owe him in exchange? I don’t have answers to those questions. I’m still wrestling with them.  So now, back to Driskill, who as of 2017 is still in jail. No DNA is coming back to free him. That jailhouse informant has made the prosecution’s case against him even stronger. What Driskill does have is a lawyer. He’s an old, seasoned defender named Jack Strickland.  Maurice: [A]nd what was your first interaction, first conversations with — what was it — Jack Strickland?  Larry Driskill: Mm-hmm.  Maurice: At the beginning, what played out?  Larry Driskill: Oh, Lord. He said, “I'm your court-appointed attorney,” and he said something like, “You didn’t do this,” and whatever. I only seen him two or three times in six months.  To recap Driskill’s situation: He has a choice to make. He can plead guilty. That would get him a limited prison term. Or he could go to trial. If he wins, he’s free, it’s all over. But if he loses, he gets a really severe sentence, maybe life in prison.  And Driskill starts to feel like his lawyer is pushing him to take the deal — to forego a trial and just take prison time.  Larry Driskill: He was pushing us into it.  For a defense lawyer, not going to trial is easier. And the prosecutors know that. That’s why they make it worthwhile to take the deal, offering a lighter sentence than they would demand in a trial. More than 90% of felony convictions across the U.S. end up with one of these deals.  At the same time, Driskill’s lawyer Jack Strickland does put up a fight.  In June 2017, Driskill is taken from the jail to a courtroom for a pre-trial hearing. It’s a chance for both sides to clash over what evidence will be allowed into the actual trial. I have the transcript.  Strickland, the defender, says [that] the whole interrogation that led to Driskill’s confession is full of stuff that violated his constitutional rights; [that] the confession should be thrown out.  In order to resolve this, the judge invites up to the witness stand, you guessed it: Texas Ranger James Holland.  Strickland questions him about the fact that there are some big gaps in the recordings. It’s hard to know what would be in those gaps, given how intense the recorded parts are. But it’s possible Holland did something like flat-out refuse to get Driskill a lawyer, and that casts a questionable light on the whole thing.  Holland says the various recording devices malfunctioned. He denies ever refusing Driskill a lawyer, and says technically Driskill didn’t really ask for one. In the recording, remember Driskill just kept asking whether he should call a lawyer. It wasn’t clear-cut.  Larry Driskill: Do I need to call an attorney or what?  After Holland leaves the stand, Strickland says to the judge and the prosecution: Look, sure Driskill didn’t ask for a lawyer directly. But look at the full circumstances. Driskill thought at first he was just a witness to the crime, and Holland told him if he implicated himself — you know, dug into his memory and said, “Yeah, I was there” — it would help him. Strickland says Holland’s approach “prevented” Driskill from “knowing his true status” as a suspect. So no, he didn’t ask for a lawyer, but he didn’t know he needed to because Holland lied to him.  The prosecutor responds [that] lying is legal, which is true. And he says Holland never shouted at Driskill, never berated him. He was calm and professional the whole time. He played by the rules.  The hearing ends. The judge now gets to decide. Afterwards, Driskill considers the deal that’s on the table.  Larry Driskill: When [my lawyer] first told me what they were offering, [that] they came up with 15 years. I said, “No, if y’all gonna screw me, let’s just make this as easy as possible. Let’s say five years and let's be done with this.” [My lawyer] said they won’t do that.  Maurice: Who said that?  Larry Driskill: Jack Strickland.  Larry Driskill: I said, OK, “Let’s say 10 years. If y’all gonna screw me, let’s make this as easy as possible.”  I need to be clear here. What Driskill was being offered wasn’t a deal to plead guilty. It was actually what they call a no-contest plea.  Larry Driskill: Well, he said that some counties won’t allow a ‘no contest.’ Some counties will say, “You either have to say guilty or not guilty.” He said, “But Parker County will let you say ‘no contest.’”  A plea of “no contest” is unusual. It’s basically a strange middle ground where the defendant says, “I’m not guilty, but I acknowledge the prosecution has a strong enough case against me that I’ll accept a deal.” And the prosecution says, “Fine, maintain your innocence, but take the prison sentence.”  So Driskill has this meeting with his lawyer and his family members.  Larry Driskill: Jack Strickland was in the front corner. My wife was sitting down, my mom was behind my wife, and my stepdad was next to her behind the attorney. And he said, “This is the best thing to do, because if [you don’t take this deal], they’re gonna go for a life sentence. And you have to pull a minimum of 30 years in prison.”  Feeling out of options, Driskill takes the deal of no contest. Fifteen years in prison.  Strickland’s perspective on all this is quite different. We spoke for an hour over the phone. He’s adamant that he did as well as he could’ve done for Driskill under the circumstances. Fifteen years for first-degree murder is pretty light by Texas standards. And Strickland argues that if they had gone to trial then Driskill — with all his uncertainty and his inconsistent memories — would not have gone over well with a jury. For what it’s worth, I get it. Driskill does come across as unsure. He’s bad at describing his memories. On the other hand: Who among us is that good at sounding certain about events ten years in the past?  Overall, considering the challenges he faced, Strickland says, this plea deal of “no contest” was a great outcome. In fact, he called it a “near miracle.”  But it doesn’t feel that way to Driskill  Larry Driskill: I trusted the legal system. And I won’t ever do that again.  Because the two sides have struck a deal, there is no trial. There’s just another court hearing to put it on the record. Bobbie Sue Hill’s family is in the courtroom, watching, and they’re given the opportunity to make a statement. Her oldest daughter says, “My mom’s short life enriched the lives of so many people. She’ll be loved and missed forever.”  Driskill goes from the county jail to the Texas prison system. Eventually he’s transferred to a facility in a small, remote town, Woodville, Texas, hundreds of miles from his wife and his mom. He and his wife start heading to divorce, but his mom Lynda is driving hundreds of miles regularly to go see him.  Larry Driskill: We had a guy come in [who] started the veterans’ program there.  The prison has a program for military veterans. And it’s during one of their meetings that somebody suggests Driskill write a letter about his case and send it to The Innocence Project of Texas.  Larry Driskill: Then all of a sudden, next thing you know, I get a phone call about a visit. I didn’t have one lawyer show up. I had four lawyers show up.  It’s actually two lawyers and two of their students. During their first meeting Mike Ware says to Driskill...  Mike Ware: “One more question I got to ask you,” I said. “What’s that?” he said. “You more worried about the money or your name being cleared?” “All I want right now is my name cleared. Everything else will come to fruition. I just want my name cleared.”  And that’s what Driskill is going to try to do. Clear his name.  Next time on “Just Say You're Sorry.”  Jillian Lauren, a journalist who met James Holland: I was sort of starry-eyed for the American hero, the cowboy, and also, here’s my white knight, right?  We follow James Holland to Hollywood for the case that would make him famous.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hcnNoYWxscHJvamVjdC5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9kbmEtcmVzdWx0cy1kaXNydXB0LXRleGFzLXJhbmdlci1qYW1lcy1ob2xsYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1996-01-01","18:00:00","{""Tucson"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T08:38:34","Her iconic moment from the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta has been forever preserved in Olympics lore.  Then a tiny teenager — 4-foot-8 and just 80 pounds — Strug was part of the Team USA women’s gymnastics squad known as the “Magnificent Seven.”  When the competition began, she didn’t command the top of the marque like some of her teammates — especially Dominique Dawes, Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu — and she didn’t have the rise-to-the moment reputation that some of the others already had.  But that all changed as the competition came down to the final events.  The American women never had won an Olympic All-Around gold medal — that almost always belonged to the Soviets and post-breakup Russian teams and once, in recent times, to the Romanians — but in Atlanta, Team USA had a slim lead until things began to crumble late.  Moceanu uncharacteristically fell twice on the vault.  And on the first of her two vaults, Strug severely injured her left ankle when she landed awkwardly on her dismount and tumbled backwards onto her rear end. Although two ligaments were torn, she tried to mask the pain. But you saw the shock, the panic momentarily flicker across her face and cause her to curl her lip.  I covered those Olympics and I remember the scene. The Georgia Dome crowd of 32,000 gasped. In the stands, her parents covered their eyes.  Suddenly there was real concern that the Russians would take back the lead and claim gold again.  Strug’s final vault — if she somehow managed to hobble out there — would be Team USA’s last chance to seal the victory.  In the interval, she asked the team’s fabled, but controversial coach, Bela Karolyi: “Do we need this?”  As was recounted later, he said: “Kerri, we need you to go one more time. We need one more time for gold.  “You can do it!...You better do it!”  With that, the 18-year-old Strug shed the ice bag, walked gingerly to the top of the 75-foot runway and, with a look of determination, came barreling toward the vaulting apparatus. She launched herself high into the air and perfectly landed the Yurchenko with a 1 ½ twist.  She held her pose for a second, then balanced on her right leg as she lifted her left foot — the way a flamingo might when standing in shallow water — and hopped in a circle with her arms raised in triumph. Eventually, she melted to the mat in tears.  At that moment she chiseled her likeness onto the Rushmore of Sports Resolve: joining the likes of Willis Reed limping out the dressing room to lead the New York Knick to victory in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals; Kirk Gibson, coming out of the Dodgers’ dugout on two bad legs to hit a pinch hit, walk-off home run to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series; and 44-year-old Archie Moore being knocked down and almost out four times — three in the first round — to come back and KO Yvon Durelle in their 1958 light heavyweight title fight in Montreal.  Strug’s 9.712 score assured the Americans of gold.  When it came time for the medal ceremony, Karolyi scooped her up in his arms — her left ankle and foot already were heavily bandaged — and carried her out to join her teammates as the crowd chanted “Kerri!...Kerri!”  Credit: AJC file photo Credit: AJC file photo  In the days and weeks and now decades that have that followed, the little girl with the overwhelming grit has been embraced by everyone.  After the Atlanta Games, she visited the White House, made the cover of Sports Illustrated and was on the front of the Wheaties box. She was the grand marshal of the Fiesta Bowl parade; the star of an ESPN ad campaign and appeared on numerous TV shows, everything from Saturday Night Live and 90210 to Hollywood Squares and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  She had a voice cameo on King of the Hill and has been referenced in shows like Bojack Horseman, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Community, Roseanne, Murphy Brown and Saved by the Bell.  Eventually, she’d be enshrined in the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame; would write two books — “Landing on My Feet: A Diary of Dreams” and “Heart of Gold” — and not long ago, Olivia Wilde announced she was directing a biopic of Strug’s life.  But one of the most important things she got after sticking that landing in Atlanta was a firm reality check back home from her parents: Dr. Burt Strug and Melanie Barron Strug.  “I’ll be honest, right after the Olympics, maybe I wasn’t real pleased with them,” she said with a laugh as she spoke by phone from her Tucson, Arizona, home earlier this week.  “All of my teammates were going fulltime on a 65-city tour and I assumed I was going, too. But my parents were like ‘Whoa!”  “They said ‘We love you and we’re so proud of you, but you already took a year off from college. You will start school in the fall.’  “I was like, ‘This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! Why are you doing this?’  “But they had certain expectations of me and my siblings. Sure, they wanted me to embrace all the opportunities that came, but they also knew they had to lead me in the right direction. They could see the larger picture.  “They said, ‘There’s going to be another Olympics in four years and a new star.’ They got me back on track and guided me through a tough transition.”  She went to UCLA and got her masters at Stanford.  She married Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Fischer in 2010 and today the couple lives in Tucson — five doors from her parents — and have two children, Alayna and 11-year-old Tyler.  For the past 18 years she’s worked with the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.  She’ll talk about some of this — and the role her Jewish faith plays as a wife, a mother and a champion of the kids in need — when she gives the keynote address at the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton’s Presidents Dinner today at 6 p.m. at the Boonshoft Center for Jewish Culture and Education.  Gold-medal goal  Strug admits she sacrificed a lot — she moved away from home at age 13 to train in Houston with Karolyi and his wife Marta, then other coaches in Oklahoma and Colorado Springs before returning to Houston — all because she was focused on one goal:  Winning Olympic gold.  She had been at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona — at 14, she was the youngest American athlete there — but she ended up sidelined on the bronze medal team.  So when it came down to that final vault in Atlanta, she felt she had a lot to prove:  “I just couldn’t walk away. If I hadn’t gone for that last vault, it always would have haunted me. It’s fortunate I came through at that moment. I’m very proud that I was able to accomplish such a big thing at such a young age.  “Clearly, it’s one of the highlights of my life, some people said it would be the pinnacle, but in truth, this July it will be 27 years since that happened. Life keeps moving on and you have different chapters and you take experiences from each.”  And that gave her a unique perspective three years ago when some people held her up as the praise-worthy flip side to Simone Biles dropping out of the competition early at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics because of immense stress.  The decision drew the wrath of social media trolls and some sports media types, as well.  Strug tweeted out her love and support for Biles and reiterated that when we spoke:  “Everybody was comparing the two of us, but they were totally different circumstances. Hers was a mental thing, not physical, and they’re not the same.  “We need to look at each individual and respect their decision. No one knows what another person is experiencing.  “Simone is a phenomenal athlete, an incredible gymnast. I supported whatever she decided. She knew better than anyone what was right for her. She had nothing to prove. Me, I had everything to prove. I was the last competitor. We were going for gold.  “And back then it was a totally different era.”  Credit: MARLENE KARAS Credit: MARLENE KARAS  Several gymnasts who endured the hardships of Karolyi’s training over the years have since criticized him and his wife for conditioning athletes like Strug to push through pain and not challenge their authority.  Just as she’s glad she attempted that last vault, the 45-year-old Strug also is happy she listened to her parents’ directive about going to college right after the Games.  “In college, like many young people do, I realized the world was a much larger place than I knew,” she said. “For so long I only had focused on me and my one goal. I realized I wanted to focus on others and should look for a way to contribute.”  That’s not saying college came easy.  “I’d be lying if I didn’t say I went through a lot,” she said. “A lot of athletes are so Type A, but really lead a sheltered life. You have these larger goals you’re used to pursuing, but you don’t know about finding everyday success.  “You don’t want to be ‘normal.’ You’re used to standing out. So I had to ask myself: ‘How am I going to be self-fulfilled? How am I going to get self-satisfaction?’  “Statistically, I know a much larger percentage of people graduate from college than win an Olympic gold medal, but for me, getting a college degree was a really big deal. I’d always been training and didn’t have the academic background many of my peers had. I hadn’t taken all those AP classes.  “But I realized I could take the lessons I learned in athletics and implement them into my academics. I worked really hard and went to class and read all the material.”  After college she taught second graders at Matsumoto Elementary School in San Jose, Calif., then realized the classroom maybe wasn’t her best fit.  She moved to Washington, D.C. in 2003 and after a couple of early positions — one with the White House, one with the Treasury Department — she found her niche with in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. She audits programs that receive federal funding and she’s taken a special interest in various groups in need, including tribal youth and girls in the juvenile justice system.  Family life  Strug and her husband are involved in their children’s pursuits, whether it’s providing transportation or cheering them from the stands.  Tyler is on a travel hockey team and plays tennis and soccer. Alayna is part of a travelling dance team.  The children went to a Jewish preschool at a conservative temple, but they now attend public school.  Although she said she’s not overly religious, Strug said “I’m very proud being Jewish.” She said they celebrate the High Holy Days and are “culturally Jewish.”  She said she teaches her children the tenets of her religion and how they can guide them in their everyday lives: “Things like having integrity. Having perseverance. Being a leader. Seeing light in the dark. All those core values that you learn through Judaism.”  Last Sunday was Mother’s Day and she said the kids tried to make her feel special.  “They were so cute,” she laughed. “They still like me!  “Tyler made some nice cards and got me flowers and Alayna is very creative and she designed a whole coupon book I can use throughout the year. She must have gotten a coupon template off the internet and then colored it in. Each one had a request I can hand her for different things.”  Like what?  “Well, I have it right here, let me tell you,” she said, her tone filling with delight:  “There’s giving me hugs and kisses. Going on walks, which I like to do with them. Making me breakfast in bed. And making me scones. She and her daddy make some really yummy strawberry scones.”  So much for the people who told her after the ‘96 Olympics that “nothing will ever top this…This will be the pinnacle of your life”.  Like her book said: She landed on her feet.  Hugs and kisses…walks…yummy scones.  That sounds golden, too.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRheXRvbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2FyY2hkZWFjb24tdGhlLW1hZ25pZmljZW50LWxpZmUtb2Yta2Vycmktc3RydWcvS1ZRUEVQUTJXWkJTNVBUWDZPQ0lMN1lDWU0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T20:40:21","A retired civil servant from one of Turkey’s most repressed social groups has defied doubters by pushing veteran President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into a historic election runoff.  Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu may need to perform another minor miracle if he is to convert his May 14 performance into an outright victory next Sunday.  It is a mark of how far Kılıçdaroğlu, whom few outside Turkey have heard of, has come that his first-round result came off looking like a disappointment.  Erdoğan picked up 49.5 percent of the ballot, thus falling short of a first-round victory for the first time in 20 years of dominant rule.  Kılıçdaroğlu won more votes than any of Erdoğan’s past rivals finishing with 44.9 percent of votes cast.  But pre-election polls had shown the secular opposition leader within a whisker of breaking the 50-percent threshold needed for outright victory.  “Don’t despair,” the 74-year-old told his despondent supporters as the outcome became apparent. “We will stand up and take this election together.”  The May 28 runoff will present Kılıçdaroğlu with a chance to reverse a dire electoral record that has seen him lose his 2009 bid to become mayor of Istanbul and then half a dozen national votes to Erdoğan and his Islamic-rooted party.  Study of contrasts  The usually soft-spoken Kılıçdaroğlu is a study of contrasts to the brash and bombastic Erdoğan — a populist whose gift for campaigning has helped him become Turkey’s longest-serving leader.  Kılıçdaroğlu’s silver mane and square glasses give him a professorial air that betrays his background as an accountant who worked his way up to head Turkey’s social security agency.  The first stage of the campaign saw him ignore Erdoğan’s personal barbs and instead stress the hardships all Turks have suffered over years of political and economic turmoil.  One of his main pledges is to hand over to parliament many of the powers Erdoğan has amassed in the last decade of his rule.  The ambitious goal touches on the fear that Erdoğan instilled across swathes of Turkey’s society during purges he unleashed after surviving a failed 2016 coup.  It may also never happen. Erdoğan’s allies retain a parliamentary majority that can block any attempts to dilute presidential powers.  Kitchen chats  Other elements of his appeal look more enduring.  Kılıçdaroğlu’s support has been helped in no small part by a cost-of-living crisis that analysts — and plenty of Turkish voters — pin on Erdoğan’s unorthodox economic beliefs.  But it is backed up by a viral social media campaign that bypasses the state’s stranglehold on television by speaking to voters in snappy clips recorded from his retro-tiled kitchen.  One of the most famous saw Kılıçdaroğlu break taboos by talking about being Alevi.  The group has been targeted by decades of violent repressions because it follows a more spiritual Islamic tradition that separates it from both Sunni and Shiite Muslims.  Erdoğan once accused Alevis of inventing a “new religion.”  “God gave me my life,” Kılıçdaroğlu said in the video. “I am not sinful.”  The late-night post racked up nearly 50 million views on Twitter by the following morning.  Nationalist turn  But Kılıçdaroğlu also has a steelier side that evokes the nationalism of Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk — the first and most important leader of Kılıçdaroğlu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP).  Kılıçdaroğlu has doubled down on his vow to send nearly four million Syrians who fled civil war back to their homeland.  “As soon as I come to power, I will send all the refugees home,” he said in his first post-election address.  The promise represents his most concerted attempt yet to win over right-wing voters who propelled Erdoğan to win the first round vote.  Kılıçdaroğlu argues that the refugee issue is not one of “race” but of “resources” during Turkey’s economic troubles.  He tries to soften the message by recalling his own humble upbringing in the Kurdish Alevi province of Tunceli.  He once invited reporters to his pitch-black apartment to discuss his decision to stop paying his electricity bills.  It was a campaign-savvy statement of solidarity with Turkey’s inflation-hit voters that tried to bridge political divides.  “This is my struggle to claim your rights,” he said next to an old-fashioned lantern casting a glow across his desk.  © Agence France-Presse","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEva2lsaWNkYXJvZ2x1LWJvb2tpc2gtcmV0aXJlZS10YWtlcy1vbi1lcmRvZ2FuL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cmtpc2htaW51dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEva2lsaWNkYXJvZ2x1LWJvb2tpc2gtcmV0aXJlZS10YWtlcy1vbi1lcmRvZ2FuLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1923-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Asamankese"", ""Eastern"", ""Ghana""}","2023-05-21T15:33:16","Feel the Physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the form of a “pillar of fire” at Asamankese in 1923, the great gathering on 20th May, 2023 and why you should visit Asamankese this year!    Be a Pilgrim!    Focus on your life, see God and your community differently, and so much more. From ancient times till now, people of diverse faith continuously desire to maintain spiritual and intimate relationship with the Supreme God-YHWH. One of the ways by which people forge, maintain and renew this spiritual connection is through pilgrimages. A pilgrimage is a trip made to a holy place for religious reasons. A Christian pilgrimage is a journey to a significant place with the intention of encountering God in Christ.    To embark on a pilgrimage is not merely to visit a place to admire nature’s beauty, art or history. To make time for a pilgrimage experience really means to step out of yourself in order to have a concrete encounter with God in places where He has visited and revealed himself, where His grace and mercy have shone with particular splendour, bringing a transformational experience and bearing fruits of conversion and holiness among those who believe. Christians go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to other places associated with the Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit, His death and resurrection. Pilgrims go to many other places where God visited in both solemn and dramatic ways to establish His name and covenant with mankind.    In the Bible, Jesus Christ and His parents went on a pilgrimage every year when he was a boy. (Luke 2:41-42.). There was a man called Elkanah who lived in Ramah, but went on an annual pilgrimage to Shiloh to offer sacrifices to the Lord with his two wives; Peninnah and Hannah. It was at this place that “pilgrim Hannah” (1 Samuel 1:9-28) made a vow and covenanted with God for a child, and she got more than she asked for. She had five (5) more children apart from Samuel. Great testimonies born by pilgrims in the past and present times, is an assurance of your own testimony this year as you choose to become a pilgrim at Asamankese.    There You Shall Go …    God is a Spirit and is not limited by time, space and matter, He is omnipresent. (Psalm 139:7-12, Jeremiah 23:24) The prefix omni- originates in Latin and means “all”. So, to say that God is omnipresent is to say that God is present everywhere at all times with no exceptions. There is no place you can be that God is not present. The attribute of God as omnipresent means he is both transcendent and immanent. He lives in time and beyond time and occupies every atom in nature.    God is omnipresent but humans are not, as humans, we are bound by time, space and matter. Thus, though God is everywhere humans cannot easily locate His presence unless He reveals Himself to us. “Those who seek Him find Him” (Matt. 7:7). God chooses to show His presence to mankind in diverse ways. He may reveal Himself in one form or another at different situations. God in Christ chose to step into time at a place in order to mingle with mankind. We as a people encounter the Presence of God at a place, where He chooses to establish His name in time. “But you shall seek the place where the LORD your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go”. (Deuteronomy 12:5). For instance, God asked Moses to come up to Him at the Mt. Sinai where Moses had an encounter with the LORD. (Ex. 24:1-18). Certainly, there are place(s) that we go because the name of God is honoured in those places and His presence is evident in these places in concrete ways through the signs and wonders He performs. It is good to be in the company of other saints in a gathering at one place in time to encounter God’s presence and power together, in these meetings we all practically become a living tabernacle of our God-Father, Son and Holy Spirit. There are many places and spaces around the world where God at a particular point in time chooses to make His light shine and loves to spark a transformational relationship with mankind. We speak of a particular place in the then Gold Coast now Ghana known as Asamankese where God chose to show Himself in a spectacular manner as we will soon discuss in this paper.    God Chose Ghana (Gold Coast) And Asamankese    Hundred years ago, there was a dramatic experience at Asamankese similar to the Pentecost experience which the apostles of Jesus encountered at Jerusalem. God poured out His Holy Spirit and manifested physically in the form of a “pillar of fire” on top of the church building where a group of people had gathered to pray during a revival programme. In his book titled “Pentecostalism: The Eddies of Ghanaian Christianity;(pg100), Emmanuel K. Larbi noted that, more people were added to Peter Anim’s group after the incident which happened on 20th May 1923.Their faith was sharpened and many miracles took place in those days. The church is the Christ Apostolic Church International, and as the founder, Apostle Peter Kwaku Manasseh Anim was the leader of the prayer group since its inception in 1917. God chose Asamankese to demonstrate His great power and grace for a reason, and you are part of that reason as a Ghanaian and an African. On 20th May 2023, there will be a great gathering at Asamankese to launch the 100th year celebration of this great visitation and awakening.    A little background information may help to appreciate this great day very well. As mentioned, a Biblical example of this experience is what happened in Jerusalem in 33 AD, when the promise of God was fulfilled, the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles as tongues of fire as recorded in the book of Acts 2:1-3. This great visitation also occurred in the United States of America at a place called, Azuza. The Azusa Street Revival beginning in the spring of 1906, largely spawned the worldwide Pentecostal movement. It was led by William J. Seymour, an African-American preacher in Los Angeles, California. The revival began on April 9, 1906, and continued until roughly 1915.  Three places among others that this great awakening of mankind by the visitation of the Almighty God has happened in the history of the world include; Jerusalem in 33AD, California in 1906 and Asamankese in 1923. In Africa it’s happened only in Ghana. There is God and He can be trusted to faithfully engage mankind by stepping into time in whatever form and place He chooses.    The Asamankese Experience: The Seal of Ghanaian Pentecostalism    The Asamankese experience is simply the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in all forms upon those who believed which culminated in the physical manifestation of fire from heaven at Asamankese on May 20th,1923. The Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all believers. (Ephesians 4:30) God’s approval and empowerment are demonstrated by the presence and anointing of the Holy Spirit, the apostles waited for the Spirit as a seal and an approval to begin their ministry. Without the Holy Spirit, God is not present, His presence and power is carried and released by His Spirit.    God’s promise in Joel (Joel 2:28-29) was fulfilled in Jerusalem, in Azuza, also in Asamankese and continues to be fulfilled in us as a sign of God’s approval, the seal of the Holy spirit like flames of fire. The “Trinity” of Ghanaian Pentecostal churches -The Christ Apostolic Church International (CAC), The Church of Pentecost (COP) and the Apostolic church-Ghana which have formed the bedrock out of which other charismatic churches in Ghana have emerged, all begun from the “Asamankese Experience”; an initiative of God through his servant Apostle Peter Newman Anim. From small beginnings bewildered with great weaknesses of diseases, poverty etc., men and women of a small prayer group led by Peter Anim to the great visitation of the Almighty God with fire from heaven to assuage vulnerabilities into power and dominion with God’s total salvation for both soul and body. Professor Asamoah-Gyadu had this to say in his book titled African Charismatics: Current Developments Within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana: Western Mission-Related Pentecostal Denominations, (pg. 23)-The Church of Pentecost (COP) is one out of three ‘Apostolic’ churches (talking about CAC, COP and APOSTOLIC CURCH-GHANA) to emerge from the initiative of Apostle Peter N. Anim (1890–1984) and his subsequent collaboration with the British Apostolic missionaries James and Sophia McKeown.    Asamankese is a place where God chose to reveal His grace to Ghanaians and Africa like never before. No fairy tales and no drama, God being God by concretely and vividly revealing Himself to mankind to shut the voice of unbelief, skepticism and Satan. God has chosen to place His name there, and we must go there at least once in a life time to worship. All believers in Ghana and Africa should not take this for granted. God chose an indigenous Ghanaian man, an African to light the flames of Christian spirituality in Ghana, Africa and other parts of the world, especially with the advent of the British Apostolic missionaries James and Sophia McKeown to the Gold coast in 1937. God has visited us and left us with trails to follow so we could find Him in all the events that unfolded and that which continues to unfold in the life of the people who have believed and the churches connected to this great awakening and revival; The Christ Apostolic Church International, the church of Pentecost, the Apostolic church Ghana and all the charismatic churches that have sprung out of these Pentecostal churches. God is still working and writing His-Story. A simple pilgrimage to Asamankese will earn you a spot in this God story. Tap into the revival and rally behind the fire to experience this great grace for the next level.    The Same God, Different Cultures and A Distinct People    God responds to us with His love and grace (Roman 5:8), He descends into our cultures to solve our common and particular problems when we call, thus he comes to us just as we are, wherever we are and however he chooses to come. God does not come based on another man’s standard, problem or prescription. God has shown His unconditional love to many people of different cultures and nations. Pentecostal stirrings across the world follow the same pattern, from Jerusalem to Azuza to Asamankese and to many other places without having to think that one is the export or spillover of the other. In Ghana, the Pentecostal move that was sealed on May 20th ,1923 by the physical manifestation of the fire of the Holy Spirit at Asamankese is without the direct influence of any foreign mission. God used the local men and women to start a global revival and ministry.    Taking the intercultural perspective of viewing Pentecostal history as advocated by Walter J. Hollenweger and sanctioned by Asamoah-Gyadu, “the intercultural view of Pentecostal history rejects conventional interpretations that consider what happened in the course of Western Christendom as universally normative for Christian history”. God’s work in any part of the world is not the duplicate of another. God’s work and revival in any culture or nation carries in itself a distinct purpose that is fit to bring the kind of salvation the people have been crying for. Interculturality values diversity. Asamoah-Gyadu agrees that “An intercultural theology, therefore, aims at a ‘body of Christ’ in which individual organs remain committed to their function whilst contributing to the whole without any assuming a sense of superiority over the others”. The great awakening and revival that took place at Asamankese that culminated in the physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit as a pillar of fire had not been because of what happened in Jerusalem or Azuza, we should simply understand that God chose to reveal himself at Asamankese to accomplish his own purpose in the lives of his people. What happened at Asamankese is God’s direct visitation to mankind without the interference or help of any western group. This is authentic. It is the responsibility of the current generation to keep the fire burning always. The fire is our heritage, it must be kept generation after generation, not for only Pentecostals but for everyone who believes. Ghana, Africa and the rest of the world is forever blessed in Asamankese, halleluiah!!! As we celebrate the 100 years of this great awakening and blessing, be a blessing by visiting Asamankese this year.    “Before” And “After” The Physical Manifestation of The Holy Spirit as A “Pillar of Fire” At Asamankese.  The apex of the Pentecostal movement in Ghana without doubt is the “Pentecost Phenomenon” which happened on 20th May 1923. Even though Anim’s prayer group had received testimonies of healing and many other miracles, God’s visitation in this dramatic way of fire falling from heaven and ‘standing’ on top of the church building cannot be compared to any testimony. It’s a sign of God’s eternal approval, true revival and awakening in Ghana and Africa.    According to Asamoah-Gyadu, in his book titled “African Charismatics: Current Developments within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana, Studies of Religion in Africa, Volume: 27”, in 1917 Apostle Anim started a local prayer group at Asamankese in the Eastern Region of Ghana, triggering off a ‘revivalist type campaign’ throughout that region. Anim lost his wife in 1920 and in 1921 Anim was healed of his chronic stomach and guinea worm disease through prayer without the use of any medicine and prophylactic substances. This personal testimony formed part of Anim’s theology. It was quite evident that Anim and his group were bent on experiencing the power of God and thus worked very hard in that direction. According to E.K. Larbi, in 1922, October 15th, a revival service was held in the house of Elder Kwabena Asare and several converts were won. Professor Larbi continues to say that “the healing and evangelistic activities of Anim attracted the then traditional chief of Asamankese, Nana Kwaku Amoah. In consequence, he offered them a parcel of land upon which they constructed their first church building”.    From 1917 to 1923 when the first church building was built, Apostle Anim had gone through a lot of phases with his prayer group including finally leaving the Presbyterian church and moving from Boso to Asamankese. It was on top of this first church building that the fire fell from heaven on 20th May, 1923. Before the fire came in 1923, fasting, prayer, evangelism, healing and many struggles characterized Anim’s group, including changing the names of the prayer group and affiliations. see Anim, Peter Newman - Dictionary of African Christian Biography (dacb.org)  E.K. Larbi accounts in his book titled “Pentecostalism: The eddies of Ghanian Christianity, (pg. 100)” that; “Another event which seemed to have increased the faith of Anim and also added more people to the group took place in May 1923 during a revival meeting. After the closing of service, it was reported that several Christians and non-Christians saw what was believed to be the Glory of God in the form of a pillar of fire on top of the church building”.    After the ‘fire’ came, they were endued with power. Great faith means greater works. Anim’s group continued growing and expanding beyond the borders of Asamankese and the Eastern region. Even at this point Anim begun to seek and contend for a deeper faith and greater spiritual power. He fed on the Apostolic faith teachings and even more on the Holy Spirit. In 1928, Anim faced serious opposition at the hands of pagan and religious persecutors but this did not impair the progress of his movement.    In 1932 a major event happened that changed the landscape of Christianity in Ghana, a member of Anim’s movement called Stephen Owiredu experienced the phenomenon of Spirit baptism. Owiredu went into the bush at Brekumanso to pray for one of his twin babies who was also left to die. It was during this intense prayer encounter that he experienced what Pentecostals call the baptism of the Holy Spirit; Glossolalic phenomenon (speaking in tongues), the place which Prophet Stephen Owiredu went to pray is now a huge prayer camp built by the Christ Apostolic Church International (C.A.C INT.) called KWAO YEBOAH. The spot where he prayed is still preserved, and his twin daughter Maame Ataa is still alive. Most of the history of the Asamankese Experience has been preserved and passed on by her through oral means.    After most of the dramatic spiritual experiences of this great awakening had happened without the influence of any foreign missionary, and after the foundation has been laid for the Ghanaian classical Pentecostal move, God then opened the doorway for the great Pentecostal move to spread in Ghana and to other parts of the world in later years by way of bringing foreign missionaries to work with Apostle Anim. From 1932 to 1937, God opened up international affiliations to Apostle Anim as he got in touch with his contemporaries in Nigeria and also in UK. From Asamankese he connected with the Nigerians and later through the Nigerians connected with the Apostolic missionaries in the UK. The first missionary to visit Asamankese from the UK Apostolic church was Pastor George Perfect in 1935. Pastor George Perfect spent two weeks in Asamankese. It was this visit from Pastor George Perfect that made Anim’s movement affiliate with the UK Apostolic church. By the time Pastor George Perfect was leaving Asamankese, he made such a great impression on the group with the spiritual gifts he possessed. Because of this great impression he had on the group, Apostle Anim and his group became affiliated with the Apostolic church, Bradford in 1935, and adopted the name. In October 1936, Pastor Vivian Wellings, Missionary secretary of the Apostolic Church visited Asamankese from Britain. It was during the departure of Pastor Wellings that he promised to recommend the Anim’s group (which had then adopted the name -Apostolic church) to the authorities in Bradford, with the view of sending a missionary who would stay and help the Lord’s work in Ghana at Asamankese.    The Coming of Apostle James McKeown    The coming of Apostle James McKeown was heralded by the coming of Pastor Perfect and Pastor Wellings in 1935 and 1936 respectively, through the recommendation they made to the authorities of the UK Apostolic church, because at that time, what Apostle Anim started in 1917 as a prayer group at Asamankese had evolved to become the “Apostolic church” ( Unity Prayer Group/ Faith Tabernacle Church—— 1917–1926, First Century Gospel Church—- 1926-1929, Apostolic Faith —— 1930, The Apostolic Church—-1935, The Christ Apostolic Church —-1939, Christ Apostolic Church of Ghana——- 1960, The Christ Apostolic Church International ——1994.) which was affiliated to the UK Apostolic church. What we should note here is that the group had gone through phases of changing affiliations, and certainly the UK Apostolic affiliation could not be the last until God had finished the work He intended to do with His church.  When Apostle James McKeown came to Ghana as a missionary to the Gold Coast in 1937, the ‘Pentecost phenomenon’ (Physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit as a ‘pillar fire’ on top of the church building) had already occurred at Asamankese, so he saw evidence of Pentecost in Ghana. It may not be an error to think that he called his church; The ‘church of Pentecost’ because of the evidence of Pentecost experience he saw in Ghana at Asamankese. According to Professor Emmanuel K. Larbi in his book “Pentecostalism: The Eddies of Ghanaian Christianity, pg.108)”; “Apostle Anim ended its affiliation with the Apostolic church UK in June 1939”, two years after they sent a missionary to Ghana.    A Pilgrimage to Asamankese-Why You Need to Go and Places to See    Asamankese is a town in southern Ghana, and it is the capital of West Akim Municipal District, in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Asamankese has a settlement population of approximately 39,435 people. Asamankese is on the main highway to Kumasi and Accra in the interior. It is in this place that God chose to reveal Himself which has resulted in bringing great salvation to the people of then Gold Coast and Ghana in recent times. It is a place God has chosen to put His name for the people who believe. This is a Holy Place where God’s name is honoured and you can go and fellowship there too. Out of this place three of the most vibrant and respected Pentecostal churches in Ghana have emerged. The fire is literally still burning on that hill…every spiritual eye can behold its spot and glory. Go, see it and set yourself aflame for God in this End Time Revival. Rally behind the fire that set off the great move of the Ghanaian Pentecostalism. God’s story is still being written, His great salvation is still in progress, it’s our time in this generation to write our own story too. Asamankese is a good place to stop by especially this year as we celebrate the 100 years of Pentecost in Ghana; A physical manifestation of God’s fire at Asamankese.    A pilgrimage to Asamankese will take you to the Holy Ghost temple, a 100 years old church building that the Holy Ghost fire ‘stood’ upon. The last time I was there, the Prophets who took us round the place testified that after 100 years, that building still remains very strong and not much has been changed in the building.    You may also visit the power house, the building that served as the mission house for both Apostle Anim and Apostle McKeown. Many people have testified how going inside the building and praying to God saw their requests being granted of jobs, healing, the opportunity to travel, business contracts and, many more. Sometimes just by touching the building according to their faith resulted in healings. At Kwao Yeboah prayer camp, you will meet the only surviving daughter of Prophet Stephen Owiredu. Maame Ataa is the twin who died and came back to life when her father, Prophet Stephen Owiredu vowed to take his own life if his daughter also died. Such a blessed heritage in the Lord. Her life is full of God’s grace, brethren you need to encounter this woman of God.    At Kwao Yeboah there is a spot where Prophet Stephen Owiredu received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the first man in Ghana to speak in tongues. There is so much power and God’s presence in this place. Kindly visit Asamankese this year to see Kwao Yeboah prayer camp, your life shall not be the same.    The Beauty of a Pilgrimage    There are a lot of powerful reasons to go on a pilgrimage. But what happens when you return home? How will you be changed? In other words, what are the benefits a person derives from going on a pilgrimage?  Among many others, here are a few benefits you may gain from a pilgrimage at Asamankese…    1. You shall see God and Scripture Differently    It’s impossible to see the town where God revealed himself and touched people for over 100 years, and remain the same. Every place reveals something different. When you walk into the church building, you’ll come to know better the God who is within you, who speaks to you as you pray, walk in the same places that Apostle Anim, Apostle McKeown, Prophet Owiredu and others walked, and reflect. These experiences will sear themselves on your mind, heart, and spirit, and will be with you as you go through this pilgrimage of life.    2. You shall Return with Renewed Focus    Travelers have long known first-hand the ability of places far away to take you out of your everyday life and return home with a new perspective. The beauty of travel is to explore the world and whilst you are in a new location, distance from what is familiar often reveals new light on your life. Pilgrimages are not just about enjoying the treasures of nature; it adds another layer to the travel — a spiritual focus. Pilgrimage provides the setting, experiences, and insights so that real spiritual change is possible. Last year when we came back from our pilgrimage to Asamankese, a sister in the church testified of the great spiritual awakening in her life. She has not remained the same. This could be your story and even more. Many pilgrims come back reporting a call to start something new, repair a broken relationship, invest more in their spiritual life, and so many other things. What will a pilgrimage do for you this year?    3. You’ll Never be the Same    Everyone’s pilgrimage experience is very different. The truth is that, in ways big or small, you’ll remember the experience for the rest of your life. For some, they weren’t sure about such a spiritual journey in the first place, but it opened their eyes to the benefits of going on a pilgrimage. For others, they were searching for a deeper spiritual experience and the pilgrimage was, in fact, that catalyst. But wherever you fall on the spectrum, we promise you, you’ll be different when you step off the bus back home. Have you thought of entering the bedroom of Apostle Anim and Apostle McKeown? to sit in the same hall they sat? walk the same pathways they walked? A miracle is waiting for you this year at Asamankese.    4.Discover the places God has revealed himself in a unique way.    Perhaps the most immediate reason to go on a pilgrimage is to experience firsthand the literal places that God has impacted in time and space. You have heard the stories, Go and see the place…    5. Seek transformation in your faith.    The journey of faith is filled with ups and downs, seasons of high spiritual energy, and periods where it seems like nothing is happening. No matter the of your faith journey, a pilgrimage to Asamankese is an opportunity to experience transformation. A pilgrimage might open up new questions, inspire a new way of thinking, or cause some serious soul searching, but whatever happens, you won’t remain the same. Take a leap of faith and visit Asamankese this year!    The Impact of The Asamankese Experience on Christianity Today.    Pentecostalism at the moment represents the most cogent, powerful and visible evidence of religious renewal and influence in Ghana. In his book, “African Charismatics: Current Developments within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana, Studies of Religion in Africa, Volume: 27, pg.14”, Asamoah-Gyadu noted, “even the new lease of life being experienced by some of the older churches in Ghana is explicable in terms of their, albeit recent, tolerant and open attitude towards Pentecostal phenomena and renewal movements in their midst.” The emergence of Pentecostal churches in Ghana has without doubt changed the religious landscape in the country. The expedient use of media and technology in its evangelistic, missionary activities and church services has given them great public space.    The Asamankese Experience brought a new hope, a belief that a true and realistic experience with the Holy Spirit is possible even as Africans if we search in truth with all our hearts. Today believers have this assurance that if God did it at Asamankese in times past, then he can as well do it in our time. The Asamankese Experience unveiled a new style of worship that continues to influence Christianity today. Christian liturgies that followed a strict set of rules was revived to allow a personal and distinct experience with the Holy Spirit. It is important to note that most indigenous Christian songs that are common in Ghana today which have helped shaped the faith of many in Ghana and beyond have come through Pentecostals. These songs have found their way even into the mission churches during times of praises and adoration. Pentecostals have been able to penetrate the religion of indigenous people and their culture because Pentecostalism shares the basic African ontology of good and bad spirits, and embraces supernatural beings i.e., God, Jesus, demons, that can have a direct influence in the world. In this way Pentecostalism becomes a lot more meaningful and powerful to Africans than earlier forms of Christianity. And in this spiritual power, we find an astonishing ability to bring about change and transformation – often in the direction of what we usually call ‘development’. A lot more people (souls) have been won and many churches have been planted in Ghana and other parts of the world.    The Holy Spirit outpouring in 1932 which ushered in the Glossolalic phenomenon (tongue speaking) by an indigenous person among the Pentecostals during the Asamankese Experience continues to shape the prayer life of believers today. Many young believers do desire to speak in tongues. Selfless giving of members for building Gods kingdom as a demonstration of our devotion and sacrifice to God was dominant in the days of the Asamankese Experience, most members, chiefs and philanthropist gave to support the work of God. Today many believers are motivated to give in support of kingdom work looking at the great example of the Anim’s group.    The Impact of the Asamankese Experience is readily seen in the operations of the various Pentecostal and charismatic churches that sprung out of the Asamankese Experience. The C.A.C. INT., The C.O.P. and the APOSTOLIC CHURCH-GHANA continue to greatly influence Christianity in Ghana and beyond the borders of Ghana. The 2021 population and housing census in Ghana revealed that Pentecostal/Charismatic Christians were the largest religious group in Ghana, reaching a share of 31.6 percent. This translated into over 9.7 million of the country's population, an increase compared to the 2010 census year.      Shadrack Kwabena Yeboah, MDiv.  The writer is the Head Pastor, C.A.C.INT.

Read the article for further information and follow us around for all the insights.  Who Is Pastor Jerome Fernando?  It’s the wrong time, Mr Pastor. The world is agog with the excruciating and shocking story a few days ago from Kenya. There, in the far east vast massacres were unearthed from the village of Shakahola where the “faithful” have been mercilessly under the grip of a taxi driver-turned-evangelist who has persuaded incredulous persons to come and join his religious cult, starve to death and see Jesus! It is beyond normal human understanding as to why thousands were hallucinated o join him. Burials, in the manner of scratches on the red earth, are being daily uncovered of these foolish innocents who lent their ears to the Pastor.  The pastor’s recent allegedly derogatory comments regarding several religions have been widely condemned, with some even calling for his arrest. Registration is not mandatory and the church has not broken the law by not registering “Miracle Dome” with his ministry, noted the minister. The issue, however, has prompted the Buddhasasana Ministry to take action. There are places of worship from all religions in the country that are not registered, Mr. Wickramanayaka said. The minister is now preparing to submit a Cabinet paper proposing to make it a legal requirement for all religious centers and places of religious worship to register with the authorities. He claimed the move is aimed at protecting the adherents of the religions, clergy, and the centers and places of worship.  The radical truth about faith being a way of knowledge or truth is that it is just the opposite. Faith represents an abandonment of the human need for truth-finding. The normal process of investigation for the truth of any proposition is to test it with material evidence. A hypothesis is set up and we look around for clues that can substantiate that. If we have no clues or possess insufficient ones, we abandon that hypothesis or amend it or totally abandon it – depending on the circumstances. Even if clues be available, we only tentatively accept theories and that only on condition we keep our minds open to change our theory in the event of subsequent findings of new evidence.  Sources said the pastor was also flying to Malaysia from Singapore. Photographs uploaded to Instagram on Friday evening showed the pastor leading a prayer meeting in Malaysia. Though an announcement posted on Wednesday, on his social media pages urged followers to await a “special broadcast” from pastor Fernando, no such broadcast was made. The PKB News attempted to contact Pastor Fernando’s Glorious Church for comment. The operator who answered the call at the church’s “Faithline” said details will be passed to the pastor’s office and if it cared to respond, it will get back to us. However, no response had been received at the time this edition went to press.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vcGtibmV3cy5pbi9wYXN0b3ItamVyb21lLWZlcm5hbmRvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Paul"", ""UnitedStates"", ""male""}","2023-05-21T11:48:21","There are sacred symbols such as the candles, relics and holy water used in the Catholic church. Do you know the meaning? Msgr. John Wynand Katende explains them.  Someone, out there, asked me about the mind of the Church concerning a rosary bearing the image of Pope Francis. My immediate response was the apparent invitation to pray for the pope, since he was still alive and not yet a saint.  Catholics devoutly pray using rosary beads, make pilgrimages to shrines, wear scapulars and medals, prayers in honor of the saints, take holy water, receive blessed ashes, candles, or palms, and so on.  Many of these practices are classified under devotions. The Church acknowledges that whereas people’s souls have many needs in common, each particular soul or class of souls has its own special needs.  The Church, however, judges devotions less strictly from doctrinal matters. She permits many practices that are the outcome of a simple faith and affection and are of real use to large numbers of her members.  But, the moment, they involve or imply a false conception of the teachings of religion, she bans them.  We are not bound to practice all the devotions which the Church declares holy and harmless; but we are bound to restrain our criticism in the spirit of respect for our fellow Christians; and we are also called on to conform to certain general usages under pain of becoming disagreeable in our religious community.  Catholics have, thus, the widest freedom, far more than is to be found in any of the sects.  This discussion also provides a good occasion to talk about sacraments, sacramentals and relics. The Church defines sacraments as efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us.  The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They are seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the sick, Ordination and Matrimony (Catechism).  The Church knows that we experience all of reality through our bodies, and there’s a natural, healthy tendency to want to fill that reality with meaning and beauty.  These are sacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacraments, called sacramentals. They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them people are disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various occasions in life are rendered holy (Catechism– 1667).  The crucifx, holy water, candles, etc, are examples of sacramentals.  Oftentimes, God works miracles through sacramentals. One of the most remarkable effects of sacramentals is the virtue to drive away evil spirits whose mysterious and menacing operations affect sometimes the physical activity of man.  To combat this occult power, the Church has recourse to exorcism and sacramentals. Another effect is the delivery of the soul from sin and the penalties thereof.  God blesses people to bless others and objects. Blessings are “sacramentals” because they prepare us to receive the grace of the sacraments and help us to grow to be more like Christ. Because of their special role, parents can bless their children.  Blessed objects must always be treated with reverence and respect and never as a charm or object of superstition. Placing blessed objects (sacramentals) into the walls or foundations of buildings for the protection against evil is a common practice among Catholics.  Catholic tradition encourages the wearing of blessed objects, to adorn our living rooms, to build beautiful churches as sacred spaces worthy of the celebration of the Mass.  However, there’s always the temptation to turn a sacramental into a superstition. Persons may sin in using them in a way or for a purpose prohibited by the Church; also by believing that their use will save us in spite of our sinful lives.  Sacramentals can aid us only through the blessing the Church gives them and through the good dispositions they excite in us.  Relics  Catholics also use relics. A relic is an object or a personal item of religious significance, carefully preserved with an air of veneration as a tangible memorial. God can perform miracles with relics. In 2 Kings 13:20-21, God revived a dead man through the bones of Prophet Elisha.  Jesus healed a woman who touched His cloth (Luke 8:43-45). In Acts 10: 11-12, God did miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.  St. Jerome declares, “We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the creator, but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore Him whose martyrs they are.”  Reflections  Acts 1:12-14  12 After Jesus had been taken up to heaven the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, within a sabbath day’s journey.  13 When they entered the city they went to the upper room where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.  14 All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers  1 Peter 4:13-16  13 Beloved: If you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.  14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory, and power of God, and that which is his Spirit, rests upon you.  15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men’s things.  16 But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.  Gospel – John 17:1-11A  1 Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come, glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.  2 just as you gave him authority over all people, so that your son may give eternal life to all you gave him.  3 Now this is eternal life: That they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.  4 I glorified you on earth by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do.  5 And now glorify you me, O Father, with yourself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with you.  6 “I revealed your name to those whom you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.  7 Now they have known, that all things which you have given me, are from you  8 Because the words which you gave me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.  9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom you have given me: because they are yours,  10 And all my things are yours, and yours are mine; and I am glorified in them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZWxpZ2lvbi9nb2QtcmVkZWVtcy11cy10aHJvdWdoLWV2ZXJ5LWFzcGVjdC1vZi1saWZlLTQyNDIwNTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T13:13:42","Would I have responded like that 7-year-old? The question burned in me after recently hearing of a family forced to flee their homeland upon becoming Christians. A friend of mine who often assists persecuted believers was helping the family pick up the pieces of their lives in a foreign country—all because of their faith.  After making Jesus their Lord and Savior, certain members of the family had been attacked and jailed. One day a group of men barged into the family’s home and threatened them once again if they didn’t renounce Jesus. Amid the exchange, one of the twin 7-year-old sons looked the men in the eyes and boldly declared that he was a follower of Jesus. He was kidnapped and, within days, his body was delivered to the mother—chopped into three pieces.  Such twisted evil is almost incomprehensible. But equally as staggering is the way God shows up as light in such utterly dark moments as this. When my friend met the mother and remaining twin son, they’d just been reunited with the rest of the family after weeks in hiding. The shock and pain on their faces was a look he’ll never forget. Yet somehow, despite their seemingly insurmountable grief, God’s comforting presence could still be found.  Before Jesus left this earth, He promised that “the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name … will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you” (John 14:26). Some translations of that verse use the word Counselor, while others opt for Comforter. In situations like this family’s, He is certainly all of the above. No matter how long my friend stayed to comfort those wailing parents and children, no matter what words he offered, nothing could compare to the helping, healing, comforting presence of the Holy Spirit.  I imagine many of those in the upper room on the day of Pentecost felt the same way. Acts 2:1 records that “they were all with one accord in one place,” yet given the situation, their hope was probably mixed with a sense of sorrow. Though they’d seen a risen Jesus and heard His promises of the Comforter to come, still, the man who had transformed every facet of their lives was no longer with them. They’d watched the supernatural way He left, even talked with angels who assured them Jesus would return in the same fashion (1:11)—and I’m sure they believed this. But it’s likely many of them were still recovering from the emotional roller coaster of the previous two months and thinking: I wish we could return to the good ol’ days of simply following Jesus in the countryside.  Amid their unprecedented blend of grief, joy, hope and anxiety, they needed a Comforter whose mere presence could calm their minds, hearts and souls. Isn’t it typical of God, then, that this peace and stillness came via a Holy Spirit red-carpet arrival draped in anything but serenity: the massive sound, flames of fire and seemingly drunk followers making lots of noise with their brand-new vocabularies.  What fits the description of a rock concert was instead the welcome party for the Holy Spirit’s dwelling on Earth—now taking place within believers! Indeed, there’s no greater contrast than when the Holy Spirit silences the noise of our sin-stormed souls, only to reside there.  Yet it’s because of the power of this indwelling, which we mark this month on Pentecost Sunday, that is the true miracle. Not only is it the power that can lift the faces of the family my friend met amid utter darkness and pain, it’s also the same power that gave Jesus’ grieving followers the boldness to emerge from tragedy and preach a miracle-filled gospel in the face of opposition.  That 7-year-old boy had this Holy Spirit power. I can only hope I’d do what he did if put in a similar situation. And I pray that as we celebrate Pentecost this year, we’ll be reminded of the true miracle that is the Holy Spirit’s presence in us. {eoa}  Marcus Yoars is a previous editor of Charisma magazine.

"religious miracle","2023-05-21","18:00:00","{""Lourdes"", ""MidiPyrenees"", ""France""}","2023-05-21T15:00:00","Long before humanity learned to write, stories were told about spirits and demons and things that go bump in the night. Similar stories are told today involving religious beliefs, extrasensory perception, auras, miracles, and ghosts, just to name a few.  I’m a scientist, and therefore it should surprise no one that I am skeptical of all such beliefs. In conversations with people who embrace them, I will point to inconsistencies in their ideas, or to reasons why I don’t accept their conclusions. Often these conversations will conclude with the other person saying, “Of course you don’t believe in this. You’re a scientist. You don’t know anything about this. It’s supernatural.”  What does “supernatural” mean?  With the invocation of that word — supernatural — the look on their face often says “gotcha,” conveying that they consider the conversation over and that they have carried the day. By their understanding of the word supernatural, they have elevated their position to be beyond the scrutiny of science. They wield “supernatural” as a talisman against the baleful eye of science.  However, I have never accepted that response. The scientific method is designed to help humanity understand the phenomena found in nature and the laws that govern them. Essentially, the scientific method is a way to understand everything that exists — and, if something exists, it is by definition natural.  The Earth, the sun, the sky? They exist, and science can help us understand them. Unicorns, dragons, and pixies? They don’t exist, and they are therefore outside the realm of science. Abstract things like red and love and anger? Those things do exist, and science can study them, albeit in a way that seems indirect. For example, what we call “red” is a combination of a wavelength of light, the chemistry of photosensors in the eye, and the neurology of the brain.  Similarly, if gods and souls and ESP and similar phenomena exist, they are also natural. People claim they see ghosts, which implies that ghosts can emit light. People claim that telepathy is real, which means that the phenomenon must be able to activate the same parts of the brain that allows the receiver to understand the sent message. When the Red Sea was parted in the Book of Exodus, it was said to have been achieved by a great wind. A wind implies moving air, which means a force to move it. While I am skeptical of all such things, they imply that the paranormal world and the familiar world interact. And, if that’s true, they are amenable to scientific inquiry.  There is a distinction between something being unknown to science and something that is intrinsically beyond the ability of the scientific method to investigate. Nobody should believe that science knows everything and has all the answers; after all, I am a scientist whose very job is to make scientific discoveries. Much in the way that Isaac Newton, one of the most impactful scientists of all time, was unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune and radiation and DNA, there are presumably things that exist that the best scientists today don’t know. If I’m successful (and lucky), I will discover something that fundamentally will change our understanding of the laws of nature.  But not knowing something is different from not being allowed to ask the question and properly investigate it.  Does the “supernatural” exist?  Let’s return to the definition of supernatural, which is obviously relevant to answer the question: Does the supernatural exist? One the one hand, if the word supernatural is defined as “a phenomenon that exists, but current science is not able to explain it,” then the supernatural does exist. For example, scientists have proposed an undiscovered substance called dark matter to explain the observation that galaxies spin faster than the known laws of physics allow. While scientists would call dark matter an unproven hypothesis, using this definition, we might consider it supernatural — though few people seem to use the word in this way.  On the other hand, if the definition of supernatural is “a phenomenon that exists, but science is unable to investigate it, even in principle,” then I would say that the answer is “no.” Again, if something exists, it is by definition natural — and science can try to study it. Mind you, certainly there are questions that cannot be answered using current technology. For instance, it took a century for us to develop the ability to image gravitational waves. On an even longer timescale, it took over two millennia before researchers proved atoms were real, despite being proposed in about 400 BC.  You might think that quibbling over the definition of the word supernatural is a petty point, but it really isn’t. Indeed, it goes to the very core of intellectual inquiry, to what makes science such a powerful tool. As long as gods and ghosts and ESP are intrinsically and permanently beyond the ability of science to investigate, we will never really resolve these issues. While I remain very skeptical, I am open to being proven wrong if the evidence is strong and compelling. The goal of a scientist is not to win an argument but to be right.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoaW5raW5nL2dob3N0cy1yZWFsLW5vdC1zdXBlcm5hdHVyYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2022-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T06:18:46","During the year I lived In India, I knew of many saints. Sathya Sai Baba, who had hundreds of thousands of followers, could perform miracles. In his upturned empty hand, he could materialize ashes in his palm. Anandamayi-ma, who had millions of followers, spent long hours in ecstatic states of consciousness.  Two months after I moved to Israel in 1985, a friend who was planning to compile a spiritual guide to Israel asked me to write a chapter on Israel’s female saints. I gladly agreed. But where would I find them? He smiled and replied that I was on my own to search for them. He explained that in Judaism saints [tzaddikim] are mostly hidden. According to Jewish tradition, the whole world is sustained by 36 hidden tzaddikim. Even if you meet them, you are unlikely to recognize them.  I started asking around and someone told me that Elisheva Buxbaum was in the know. I phoned her. She told me about a man named Reb Yaakov Moshe Kramer living in a ramshackle village in northcentral Israel. “He’s considered by several of Israel’s greatest rabbis to be one of the 36 hidden tzaddikim,” Elisheva disclosed to me. Then she added, “His wife Rebbetzin Chaya Sara is as great as he is.”  From Auschwitz to Northern Israel  I took a two-hour bus ride to the village, where I had arranged to spend Shabbat. My English-speaking contact there filled me in on Rebbetzin Chaya Sara’s background. She had been born to a Hasidic family in the Carpathian Mountains and taken to Auschwitz at the age of 20. There her entire family was murdered and she was experimented on by the infamous Dr. Mengele.  After the war, she made her way to Palestine and married Yaakov Moshe Kramer. They never had any children, but for some 20 years (without pay and without vacations) she took care of numerous brain-damaged children who were left on her doorstep. They lived in abject poverty, eking out a meager income by raising poultry and a few dairy cows.  On Shabbat morning, I went to the community’s bare-bones synagogue. I was the only one in the women’s gallery. Suddenly the door swung open and a stout woman wearing a quilted kerchief and two housedresses, one over the other, walked toward me, smiling broadly, her arms outstretched. She greeted me with a bear hug, like a long-lost daughter.  Then she took my prayer book from my hand. She leafed through it to find Ethics of the Fathers, aphorisms of the sages of two millennia ago. She pointed to a passage and asked me, “Have you ever seen this one?”  I looked at it and broke out into goosebumps. It addressed the foremost issue I was grappling with at that time.  Rebbetzin Kramer with the author  Then she took my prayer book again and turned a few pages. She pointed to another passage, and asked, “Have you ever read this one?” It addressed my second most pressing issue.  I stared at her in consternation. She laughed, then turned and left.  I got it that she could read minds, but what other miracles could she perform?  Her Unremitting Love  That afternoon, as arranged, I went to eat the third meal of Shabbat with her. Her husband was not in the country. When I reached their home, I was horrified. They lived in a rundown shack. The walls were bare of plaster or paint. The rough concrete floor had no flooring. The front room had a corrugated tin roof. Its only furniture was a rickety wooden table and several unmatched chairs.  Yet, in the midst of this scene, Rebbetzin Chaya Sara was smiling broadly, delighted to receive me and to share her farmer’s cheese and cucumbers with me.  That was the beginning of my 20-year search to answer the question: How could she be so constantly, radiantly happy when she had nothing ostensibly to be happy about?  And what qualified her as a saint? I knew she prayed, but I never saw her meditate or enter an ecstatic state of consciousness. She performed no glittering miracles.    Clearly, she could read minds; she read mine all the time. And in researching the biography I would write about her (Holy Woman), I discovered a case of her promising someone she would have a child after years of childlessness, and in nine months she did. And another case of her promising a man who had lost his job that he would find a better job “with double pay,” and he two days later he did find a new job, with exactly double the salary. My research also revealed many cases of her knowing what would happen at a specified time before it occurred.  However, If I had to identify one thing that qualified Rebbetzin Chaya Sara Kramer as a saint it would be this: her unremitting love for everyone. When I met her, I was a newly-religious American who had just spent 15 years living in a Hindu ashram. But from that first day, she loved me like a daughter. And she saw only the good in me. No, the greatness in me! She used to call me a tzaddeket, a righteous, saintly woman. I knew I wasn’t righteous, but her repeatedly calling me that made me aware of an inner holiness that, if she saw it, must be there.  At the memorial meal held 30 days after her death in 2005, I met for the first time several young Russian immigrant women who had also frequented Rebbetzin Chaya Sara’s home. They told me that she also called each of them a saintly woman.  She lavished honor on every guest who came to her ramshackle home. She literally ran to the door to receive every guest, including the village residents 40 years her junior whom she saw daily. Tamar Cohen, a local housewife, told me that whenever she came to their door, even to borrow a cup of sugar, Chaya Sara would announce to her husband, as if an important personage had graced their abode, “Dear Mrs. Tamar Cohen has arrived.”  Chaya Sara made no distinctions on whom she showered love and honor. Ashkenazim and Sephardim, rich and poor, religious and nonreligious, old and young, veterans and new immigrants—she showed the same solicitude to each one.

"religious miracle","1945-10-14","Not Discerned","{""WhiteSalmon"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T00:08:23","These introductions to people I have, that is, keyholing into their lives, immersing into their dreams and sharing their gifts of living, learning their avocations, and then welding connections to my own life with theirs have happened this way many times over the course of decades:  I especially got caught up in the “Autobiography Through Many Lenses” page. The very mention of Henry Miller, napalm, Mark Twain (on autobiography being the truest of all books), ancestors from Ireland, and good God Malcolm Lowry (truly one of my favorites!) was enough to make me want to pore through everything of yours I could find.”  “I found your website through something of a circuitous route. I first listened to a Courage to Resist podcast interview with Dan Shea and got interested in his story and background. A Google search took me to your interview with him for LA Progressive. From your bio, I did another search and first found some of your Dissident Voice stories and finally landed on your website, where I spent the next few hours.  [Article and photo: “Call of Duty: Resisting War in Venezuela”]  So, we’ll see if the good lord’s willin’ on this review, if I get something right, and do not immerse it all in my POV: “If the good Lord’s willing and the creek stays down I’ll be in your arms time the moon come around.” (Johnny Cash)  The linchpin for me is his refusal to go to THAT war, and some of his narrative, the memoir, deals specifically with those times. He also went from American, Western American, to Japanese. THAT war (sic): During the Vietnam War more than 170,000 men were officially recognized as conscientious objectors. Thousands of other young men resisted by burning their draft cards, serving jail sentences or leaving the country.  THAT war: United States’ military involvement in the Vietnam War began in February 1961 and lasted until May 1975. Approximately 2.7 million American men and women served in Vietnam. During the war, more than 58,000 servicemen and women lost their lives.  “I am convinced that human life is filled with many pure, happy, serene examples of insincerity, truly splendid of their kind-of people deceiving one another without (strangely enough) any wounds being inflicted, of people who seem unaware even that they are deceiving one another.”  “One cannot be pessimistic about the West. This is the native home of hope. When it fully learns that cooperation, not rugged individualism, is the quality that most characterizes and preserves it, then it will have achieved itself and outlived its origins. Then it has a chance to create a society to match its scenery.”  Family for Robert Norris is everything, and he starts spinning tales about his grandfather Frederick, born in Union County, Pennsylvania. He moved around, from Minnesota to North Dakota and then to White Salmon, WA, and that’s where Robert’s mother grew up, with the history of the Columbia River, Celilo Falls before the river was dammed up, coursing through her DNA.  Interestingly, his mother Kay talked to Norris about Kyoko Nakagawa, a Japanese-American girl who was her best friend until World War II broke out and the Nakagawa family was shipped to an internment camps.  “I thought all her family were so nice. They had a home on the river and I remember I got permission to walk down there to see if she was sick and there was nobody home. Everything was gone. I found out a long time later that she and her family had been transported to an internment camp for Japanese in Idaho. I did try very hard and seriously to track her down and finally did only to find out that she died in childbirth just after her family was released from the camp after the war. I felt very sad for a long time after that.”  “I was in high school at that time and remember well the events of that day and the days and months that followed. There were so many things I didn’t learn about until many years later. One of my very best friends in high school was Kyoko and we spent many lunch hours together gigglin’ and talkin’ about our futures. We’d usually exchange sandwiches because mine were on homemade bread and hers were on the store bread put out by Wonder Bakeries. We thought we were being so sneaky and clever to exchange our sandwiches. How young and naive we both were. I think when I was a junior in high school, I went to school one mornin’ and couldn’t find Kyoko. I didn’t know what happened to her. I was very hurt to think she left and didn’t say goodbye.  This man, Robert Norris, with his deep regard for the family, especially for his strong and adventuresome father, ended up deep in Japanese culture in the 1980s, becoming a language teacher, and then marrying a Japanese woman. He’s called Japan his home for more than 40 years.  He’s there now, in Japan, writing me emails, and his life now is slow, he says, with old age and some medical issues from the past catching up to him now.  I can hear those metal bars slamming: The date the cell doors slammed on him was in September, 1970:  I get into the patrol car. A cloud of dust rises behind the car as it lurches toward the prison. I crane my neck for a final look and see Jerry and Midge grow smaller through a brown haze until they’re tiny specks in the distance.”  “A military policeman places handcuffs around my wrist and leads me to a patrol car waiting to take me to the base prison. Jerry and Midge Kelly follow me to the patrol car.  “A bumpy, coming-of-age tale set in the logging country of the Pacific Northwest, dosed with a mother’s love, transforms an alienated young man into an expat and ultimately an emeritus professor in Japan. Robert W. Norris crafts the stages of this extraordinary journey—punctuated with a turn as a Vietnam War resister—in a narrative style that is both graceful and seamless.”  “A most impressive achievement by a highly talented writer…an emotionally powerful memoir that spans nearly a century and several continents. Riveting and rich in detail with passages that evoke Hemingway and Maugham, it draws you in and doesn’t let up. For Japanophiles, the sections on life in Osaka and Kyushu offer important lessons on cultural assimilation. You come away from this book with gratitude to the author for having written it and respect for a life well lived.”  “Robert Norris goes to military prison as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War, embraces the counterculture upon release, wanders the world in search of his identity, and eventually lands in Japan, where he finds his niche as a university professor, spends two years as the dean of students, and retires as a professor emeritus. Despite their separation by the expanse of the Pacific Ocean, Robert and Kay maintain a lifelong commitment of love, respect, and support that enriches both their lives. This story provides a heart-warming example of how far a mother and son can go in maintaining their bond against all odds. A must read for all mothers and sons, and for those who’ve wondered what the road less traveled would’ve been like had they taken that first step.”  “‘The Good Lord Willing and the Creek Don’t Rise: Pentimento Memories of Mom and Me’ traces the trials, tribulations, and unbreakable bond of two Pacific Northwest characters. Kay Schlinkman grows up on the banks of the Columbia River in the 1930s and 1940s. She overcomes a small logging town’s ostracism in the late 1950s for her divorce, excommunication by the Catholic Church for remarrying, severe criticism and rejection for defending her son’s refusal to go to war, and the burden of paying off her second husband’s gambling debts. She takes night classes to become qualified as a legal secretary in her fifties and continues to work until she’s seventy-eight.  So that brings me to the reason I’m writing to you. My life story and tribute to my mother was published in January by Tin Gate, a U.K. hybrid publisher of memoirs, travel books, and biographies. I hope I’m not being presumptuous in thinking you might be interested in looking at it with an eye toward a possible review, or perhaps passing it along to others who might be interested in whatever happened to some of us old-timers who told the military to fuck off way back when. The following summary is from the book’s back cover.  From there it was on to the video interview with David Rovics. Imagine my surprise when I heard you mention that you and your sister had inherited some land near White Salmon, Washington. I mean, my mother grew up there and graduated from Columbia High School in 1943! Small world, indeed.  My name is Robert W. Norris. I’m a Pacific Northwest native, Vietnam War conscientious objector, and longtime expat resident of Japan. I’m one of those guys who took that 1960s jingoistic catchphrase “America, love it or leave it” seriously and ended up in Japan back in 1983.  His book, the stories, the backdrops, all the encounters with his mom, before getting into the military hell we all hope those like Robert never have to get into, and those were the draft days, and, alas, he joined the US Air Force. Not going to college and living and working in Humbolt County, he was sure he’d be drafted and end up in Vietnam and dead, or dying.  The Air Force or Navy were options for he and his buddies, Troy and Shannon, sign up for the bombing brigade, the dirty Air Force. He made the Arcata all-county basketball team, but the boy Norris was depressed, disinterested.  Here, another salvo from Robert to me after I tsunamied him with emails a yard or so long.  OK, so here’s the PDF. I’m also enclosing a cover pic. I think you’ll agree my mom was pretty good-looking! Looking forward to getting a phone number (and street dress if that’s OK) so I can order an author paperback copy to send. I’m about to dig into the link on the Japanese poets writing about Fukushima.  Thanks, too, for agreeing to read the book and for the offer of doing an interview. I really appreciate it. I’ll check out Cirque’s site and see if I can come up with an idea or two to pitch to them. I’ve had a little bit of success in having excerpts put up on a couple of Boomer sites, with another excerpt (from an earlier novel) to be published around Easter in Psychedelic Press (a U.K. journal dealing in research about the history, culture, philosophy, and science of psychedelics and other drugs) and yet another in the summer peace issue of BeZine, a literary rag out of Israel focusing on peace and spirituality.  I’ll write a better letter later, but I wanted to send you the PDF first and ask for a phone number. Neither Amazon nor IngramSpark will allow me to order an author copy if I don’t have a phone number to provide the shipping company in case they need to contact the recipient of the package. Amazon allows P.O. Box numbers it seems, but IngramSpark doesn’t; they require a street address. Also, this PDF is large at 23 MB (there are about 20 pages of pictures), but most of the email addresses I’ve sent it to have handled it OK.  Thanks so much for such a quick and great reply and all the links! Wow, I now have my reading set for the next few days. I’ve already gone over a couple of the Finding Fringe stories (great stuff) and the attached interview with Emily Green. Interesting that you mentioned the documentary “Sir, No Sir.” While working on the initial draft of my book, I queried the director David Zeiger and he kindly provided a nice blurb.  Ahh, that military life, short-lived, but here, in living color from the memoir:  “Yes sir,” I bark, turning redder each time I return to him with another “left-handed stick.” Finally, it dawns on me that all the sticks are the same. A wave of shame passes through me. For the rest of the military police training, the drill instructors call me Left-Handed Stick.  For a while, however, the Air Force succeeds in brainwashing me. One image sticks in my head: a drill instructor during a training session in the use of a truncheon screaming at me in front of a gymnasium full of military police trainees. “Goddamn it, Norris! You dumb shit! You’ve got a left-handed stick! I told you to get a fucking right-handed stick. Now get your ass over to that pile and bring me a right-handed stick!”  While the majority of airmen return home on leave and report to other bases for their technical training after basic training, the others chosen to be military police (the most despicable and lowest career field in the Air Force) and I have to remain at Lackland for ten more weeks of specialized training. The hand of irony has played a cruel trick. Country bumpkin that I am, I’ve joined the Air Force thinking I’ll never have to carry a weapon, but now I’m to be trained in the art of combat and the use of deadly weapons. I know I can never kill another human being. It’s always been and still is an abstraction. Besides, I lack the courage even to use my fists to defend myself. The very thought of violence makes me sick to my stomach. I pass through the training without incident. But during those days of martial arts training; war games; kitchen labor called K.P.; stripping, cleaning, loading, firing, and handling of M-16 rifles, .38 pistols, hand grenades, bayonets, and knives; the classes on crowd dispersal, first aid, attack upon and retreat from an enemy, arrest and seizure, drugs, communism, terrorist activities, patriotism, military police history; and the propaganda the instructors use to inculcate the soldiers into submission and obedience, there grows within my heart an inchoate attitude of rebelliousness. It lies dormant, simmering below the surface, waiting silently for the right moment to emerge from its hiding.  But the Air Force Base in Yuba City is not cloistered from the world:  My order to fight in Southeast Asia comes through. I’m given thirty days leave before having to report first to a base in Texas for a month of intensive war training and later to a base in northern Thailand near the Cambodian border. This happens shortly after Nixon escalates the war into Cambodia, where B-52 bombers are now dropping tons of napalm. When I leave Beale Air Base for the start of my thirty-day leave, I know I’ll never make it to Texas.  During this time, I’m thinking about Vietnam and having a gut feeling that the war is wrong. Although we’re not allowed to take anything other than our guns and military equipment on The Good Lord Willing and the Creek Don’t Rise 116 the line, I smuggle a portable radio and earphones and listen to the lyrics of popular songs instead of just the melodies—songs by Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and all the others protesting the war. I’m also reading the underground newspapers that are finding their way on base and contain antiwar, anti-government stories about the My Lai atrocity, the shooting of Ralph Bunch at the Presidio, and the hysteria running rampant on American college campuses. All the little irritating items of military brainwashing and propaganda gradually build up inside of me. Things I’ve taken for granted before now make me bristle. There’s the time three of us guards are called before the squadron sergeant after roll call, and he reads us our rights and charges each of us with defecation on duty. “What’s defecation, Sarge?” I ask. “It’s taking a shit inside the marked line you are NOT supposed to enter, only guard, and you know that only the flight crew are allowed inside that line, and last night one of you smartasses took a FUCKING SHIT inside that line and right under the cockpit—that’s what DEFECATION means!” the sergeant screams. “You’ve got to be shittin’ me,” I say. The sergeant doesn’t think my remark is funny. There on the table as exhibit A for the prosecution is the big, black turd, hard as a rock, found the day before under the cockpit of the bomber I walked around for half my shift before changing to another place to guard. They’re actually planning to court-martial one of the three of us who was stationed on that post during the night and use the turd as evidence. It’s the final straw in realizing that military life isn’t for me. From that day on, I can’t keep my mouth shut in pointing out the inconsistencies and lies whenever I spot them. I miss haircuts and am constantly reprimanded for my shoddy appearance during inspections. I lose days off and am forced to undergo crowd control practice in case we’re called upon, like the National Guard, to break up a civilian demonstration. I know my sympathies would be with the demonstrators. I begin to think that if there really is an enemy, it’s the military. If the situation ever really comes up, I’ll cast aside my weapons and join the other side.  He gets out of spending five years total in prison, and after six months, when he’s out, his only constant was his “mom’s complete and unconditional love and support.” He of course was dazed and confused, and he ends up on this journey of kicking around, mixing with counterculture, blue collar work, slaving in mills, hitchhiking, then to New York and following a one-way flight to Luxembourg, leaving behind the country of his birth, “the country I no longer felt a part of, venturing forth with no itinerary, just the hand of fate to guide me.”  He does the hippie trail through Europe, ending up in places he only dreamed of as a baseball-playing kid in Humbolt County, California. Paris, Spain, Greece.  The journey had given me an answer to what I’d been seeking since my court martial. The single sentence [ “I don’t feel I’m mentally or physically capable of killing another human being”] I uttered in response to my order to fight in the Vietnam War had saved four and a half years of my life and instilled in me an inchoate awareness of the power of language. The experiences in Europe had now reinforced that awareness and stimulated a need to express myself. I now had a purpose. I’d try to become a writer. I’d learn the craft. Through the writing, I’d rid myself of the confusion and derangement that clung to me so tightly.  Ahh, so the communication is back and forth, between me in Oregon, with some land in White Salmon I mention — his mother’s stomping grounds and Robert’s as well, as sort of an unusual glue — and he in Japan. Another long one from me, to him, and here is his measured and kind response, and I won’t fill in all the contextual asides:  Hey Paul, Hope you’re doing OK. I’ve spent parts of the last few days going through some of the links you sent, as well as following down the rabbit holes of other links on those pages. Some fascinating stuff to read, a welcome change from the corporate drivel that comprises the majority of English reading material available in Japan. Among the things that really grabbed my attention this time were your review of the documentary “The People vs Agent Orange,” the related article “A Spray by any Other Name: Agent Orange or Clear-cut Agent?” “Wrestling the Blind, Chasing Apache Horses, and Unpacking the Vietnam War,” and your interview with David James Duncan. As you wrote in one of those articles, “I easily segue from one massive war crime after massive war crime — the American War Against Vietnam — to a small rural county in Oregon,” I too often connect what on the surface seems to be a completely unrelated thing or idea to another. As a reader, I like to read that kind of style. As a writer, I think it conveys an uninterrupted and natural flow. Maybe I just took too many hallucinogens in my youth! Anyway, here are some thoughts. You may have mentioned him only once or twice, but I constantly had Henry Miller on my mind while reading your articles. So much so that I dusted off the cover of his The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (which had been sitting untouched on my bookshelf for a good 25 years) and started reading it again with great pleasure. It’s amazing how so little has changed in the U.S. since he wrote that book back in 1940 and ’41. In the midst of ranting about how fucked up and doomed America is/was, he still, like a magician, pulls out a gem of a phrase on almost every page that makes the reader practically double over with laughter. I once worked as a cook for a restaurant owner who had lived in Big Sur in the 1950s, ran a kind of trading post, and would barter with Miller, who was always broke, and would end up giving him bags of groceries for rough draft manuscripts of whatever Miller had pounded out on his typewriter that day. This dude was Irish-American, in his 60s at the time, had a plump and red nose from too much booze, and told great tales that got better with each embellishment. I first met him when I was down to my last $20 and drinking a beer at his bar. When I told him The Colossus of Maroussi was my favorite Miller book, he hired me on the spot. I ended up working for him for about a year and a half. He taught me everything he knew about cooking, a skill that became my main source of income for the next five years as I wandered throughout much of the U.S. Next up, that documentary “The People vs Agent Orange.” To tell the truth, I hadn’t thought much about Agent Orange for years, not since the use of depleted uranium “bunker busters” in Iraq and the resulting cancers, birth defects, etc. among Iraqi children in the ensuing years. Since about 2005, however, it seems someone I knew well or from a distance has died almost every year from some Agent Orange-connected cancer. Occasionally, I’ve wondered if I’d’ve died myself by now if I’d followed my order to fight in the war. In a sense, military prison saved my life. My job had been guarding B-52 bombers and I know I would’ve been one of the airmen who had to spray the perimeters of Southeast Asian bases with that poison to keep the jungle from encroaching on and overgrowing the fence lines. I was in other parts of the States when the spraying of Oregon forests began. I was in southern Humboldt County (working for that Irish-American) in 1977-78, but the only helicopters flying above the forests then were the ones doing surveillance on the marijuana farmers. They didn’t spray anything; they merely landed on the property and sometimes busted the larger farms, that is, until the farmers starting shooting at them. The fact that much of the documentary took place so close to where I grew up intrigued me greatly. After reading your review, I had to watch it. It wasn’t easy, but I managed to get my hands on a copy. My wife and I watched it a couple of nights ago. Jesus! What a gut punch! Like so many, my wife was aware of what Agent Orange was and the horrible damage it had done (still does) in Vietnam, but she thought its use was limited to that part of the world and that time. Wrong! This is indeed an international problem, right up there with the Fukushima disaster (by the way, those poems in that book were quite powerful, too). Even though the Independent Lens program was sponsored by and shown on PBS, the only place I could find that had it available was for Amazon Prime customers. Why is it so limited in availability? Is PBS also intimidated by the corporate power wielders and so won’t distribute it widely? It should be required viewing (and actively discussed) in classrooms worldwide. I finally resorted to using a VPN and accessing a couple of pirate sites. Even among those sites, it seemed a dead end. Just as I was about to give up, however, I found one place that actually had a pretty good quality file that I was able to download. I plan to make a few DVD copies and distribute them among a couple of academics I’m still in touch with. Being retired seven years now and having not kept up any correspondence with most of my former colleagues since the pandemic started, I don’t have many contacts anymore, but still this is information that needs to have a wider audience. It was sad to learn that the French court threw out Tran To Nga’s lawsuit. You kicked off the “Wrestling the Blind” story with Robert Bly asking you when you first saw yourself as strong as or stronger than your old man. The complicated relationship I had with my dad was in my thoughts the whole time I was engaged with the story (which is a beautiful one, by the way). My dad was a World War II hero who piloted a P-38 in over 70 combat missions out of England. How he survived was a miracle. After the war, he and his brother and dad started a lumber mill and redwood logging business in Humboldt County. For the next 25 years, he was heavily involved in the American Legion (and helping to destroy almost all the old growth redwoods!). Although not political by nature, he followed his family’s guidance and always voted Republican and hung out mainly with other loggers and John Birch Society types. I had an idyllic childhood in the redwoods and spent most of my time fishing, playing baseball, and doing all the things country boys love to do. Until my parents divorce put an end to all that. The script was set. I was destined to rebel against whatever he had hoped for my life. When I became a conscientious objector (from within the military, to boot) to the Vietnam debacle, my actions, thoughts, and appearance all constituted an affront to everything he’d considered sacred in life. Of course, all this stuff takes up a good portion of the first half of my book, but that story of your trip in the desert with your dad was almost like looking into a mirror of my relationship with my dad. Particularly the parts about how you two bonded over wrestling. In my case, we bonded over basketball, or I should say he was proud of my skills (I made the all-county team my senior year) and even though we could never get on the same page about political shit, we could always communicate meaningfully about sports. Another one: by the time I hit 15, my dad didn’t know me, either. I still had a couple of years to go before my hair hit shoulder length, but some of my buddies were growing their hair out at that age and Dad’s comments were always about how they were turning into girls and sissies, the inference being he didn’t want to see me with long hair. Like you, I didn’t consider until way too many years too late that my dad’s reluctance to talk about his war experiences might’ve been his version of PTSD. And the first time I really noticed his vulnerability was on a rare trip home from Japan (escorting some Japanese students on an American homestay program). His hairline had receded greatly (he was in his 70s by then), his eyes appeared softer and kind of milky, and his handshake had become weak. You wanna hear something ironic? He died at the age of 89 on June 6th, D-Day, the one day of the year (in his 30s and 40s) when he’d actually mention casually that he’d flown with the invasion of Normandy and also a few days later with an escort squadron flying cover as Churchill crossed the English Channel. I admired the way you ended that story — “Bly was right. The moment the war lifted from my heart, I saw my old man. Just a guy waiting for daylight, waiting for fish.” Lastly, it was great to read your interview with David James Duncan. That was done quite a long time ago (2008). To me, your questions had a bit of a provocative ring to them, as if you were demanding definitive answers to complex questions about life, activism, and the future of our planet and humankind’s place on it. DJD sounded like someone on the verge of Buddha-hood (or maybe a character out of a Hermann Hesse novel), what with his calm acceptance of everything and the insanity surrounding him. The image I got reminded me of that cartoon showing a searcher of the truth struggling to scale a mountain to find the Buddha and finally at the summit sees him and gasps, “Oh Great One, please tell me, what is the answer to mankind’s struggle to find meaning in life?” The Buddha peers down at him, points a finger at the opposite direction, and replies, “My friend, you’ve climbed the wrong mountain. The Buddha you seek is over there on that other mountain.” Do I have a weird interpretation of what I see and read, or what? Anyway, here are a few DJD quotes from that interview that made me smile. “There is no reason for amazement: surely one always knew that cultures decay, and that life’s end is death.” “Mother Teresa spoke with the heart of a wild salmon when she said, ‘God doesn’t ask us to win. He only asks us to try.’ I’m in the business of trying. I leave the scorecard to the Scorekeeper.” “When small things are done with great love, it is not a flawed you or me who does them: it’s just love. I have no faith in any kind of political party, left, right, or centrist. I have boundless faith in love. The only spiritually responsible way I know to be a citizen, artist, or activist in times like ours is by doing a daily and nightly, faith-driven skein of small things, each of them done with all the love I can muster.” “I trust my hands more than my mind. My hands are enlivened by my lungs and heartbeat and by the Earth and by Spirit directly. Only indirectly are they guided by the mind. My aging hands have done so much cool stuff it staggers my mind.” “He (Cesar Chavez) didn’t demonize those who caused this suffering. His life of love and service is the opposite of a World Bank project or a papal decree or a government program. It was grass roots love. Love from the ground up, not the top down. Love with the mud of the fields all over it.” Duncan’s novel The Brothers K is one of my all-time favorites. It has many parallels with family and other people in my life, as well as my own experiences — Seventh Day Adventist parent, conscientious objection to the Vietnam War, baseball, a father who was a logger, siblings who traveled entirely different life roads, and the town of Camas (which is on the Columbia River, not that far from White Salmon, Washington, where my mother grew up), and much more. When I finish The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, that’s the next book I plan to reread. So, all in all, thank you Paul for giving me much to think about and providing a bit of literary enjoyment to balance out all the other shit that’s happening around us. If you’ve actually read this far, thanks for that, too. You take care, OK? Robert  I think Robert knows that this review of his work will not be some bullshit LA Times crap or Kirkus reviews milquetoast. The memoir is his life, his concerted effort to get from pre-birth to now, in Japan, and then finding meaning in a journey which is always galvanized by his love of and interest in his mother’s life, who was still in the USA while Robert made his way to Japan, doing part-time work as an English Teacher, and then eventually language school fulltime work, and then teaching for a college, a deanship, getting an advanced degree and becoming now retired, emeritus.  Ahh, as a battler and endless communicator and ranting fool, I hit Robert with another email, and here, again, his thoughtful response:  Hi Paul, Thanks for letting me know the book arrived in one piece, and thanks for all the recent links. My aging body and mind don’t move very quickly these days, so I’ve taken my time in checking out some of your media recommendations. At this stage of the game, I don’t want to burden myself with information overload. I’m afraid Japan’s stick-its-head-in-the-sand approach to the world has rubbed off a bit on me. 🙂 What I have read has given me a better indication of why most of my American friends, contacts, and relatives (not that many left in all three categories) seem so frustrated and filled with rage these days. Much of that, it seems to me, comes from a deep disappointment in “the system” and a feeling of having been deceived by everything they’d been inculcated into believing was sacred — American exceptionalism, the so-called American Dream, the righteousness of capitalism, the sanctity of Christianity, the worship of Ronald Reagan, John Wayne, and Babe Ruth, and on and on. Everything, in fact, that Mark Twain and Henry Miller spat on in their different times. Granted, on this side of the pond there has also been a rapid increase in violence, murders, alcoholism, suicide, and depression in the last few years, but it’s nothing to compare with the States. I still feel relatively safe whenever I leave the house. Of course, that might be different if I were living in Tokyo or Osaka, but here in Kyushu things are relatively calm. Okinawa, Taiwan, and all the potential for the start of World War III are not that far away and in the back of people’s minds, but for the most part people don’t talk about it much. It’s the ol’ “see no evil” approach (until it affects someone directly, that is). One thing that caught my attention while reading your own and other recommended stuff is the issue of “sensitivity editors/readers” and the related issue of book banning in Florida and other red states. I’d seen a little bit about this here and there over the past couple of years, but nothing in detail. Your substack article sent me on a search and I was amazed at what a big issue this is becoming. The danger here is the tendency for this kind of thing to catch fire with all sides on the political spectrum. Again, I refer to Henry Miller and his reasons for leaving the States to live abroad in the 1930s, George Carlin’s later rants on the idiocies of American culture and political thought, and Groucho Marx’s quote on group behavior: “I’d never want to be a member of a group that would have me as a member. They must be crazy.” Or something along those lines. If nothing else, that about sums up my philosophy of shying away from any religious or political affiliation. Somehow, I’ve managed to make it this far in life without relying too much on group-think or support. I plan to do my best to continue forward (limping, of course, and assisted by my trusty cane) in the same manner. Of course, I’ll always listen to and think about what others believe and rationalize about their own behavior, but I’m not going to be signing up for their activities anytime soon. You mentioned earlier that you’d like to do a Zoom chat. Sure thing. I can’t promise any usable quotes (the ol’ noodle seems to switch on and off these days at a pace I can’t control — somewhat like a pitcher who has control of his pitches one day and can’t find the strike zone the next day). Probably more than trying to share political philosophies, I think it’d be more fun to simply share stories from the different places and eras we’ve experienced and survived. I’ve got a few things to take care of over the next couple weeks (e.g., I have to try to change internet providers as my current website has no security certificate and is deemed “not secure” — not that a lot of people drop by, but the browser warning probably scares off 90 percent of those few curious visitors), but any time after that would be fine. There’s a 16- or 17-hour time difference, so we’d have to take that into consideration. Take care, Paul. Try to get some rest from time to time. We ain’t spring chickens anymore. I’m amazed at how you can keep up such a rigorous writing pace. That’s all for now.  I sent Robert a long list of open ended questions, and we’ll see how he receives them. The interesting part of the book is Robert’s second trip there heading to Iran (Turkey) and Afghanistan, and he ended up in India, too. His so-called around the world walkabout and flowing love of learning about people, keeping an open mind, asking questions, and shutting up to hear others’ biographies.  Here, a slice from Robert’s journey, when he is about to head back to the USA:  I usually visited Rolf in the evenings. We’d prepare a dinner of rice with raisins and lamb meat, then retire to the top of the bus to smoke some hashish, watch the stars, and discuss life. One night, I told him about my journey from Paris to Afghanistan and the various adventures I’d had. “So what have all these experiences taught you? You seem to me to be more of an observer of men than an active participant in their affairs,” Rolf said. “I suppose you’re right about that,” I said. “The one political stand I made landed me in jail and I’ve spent a good portion of my life since then trying to rationalize what I did. This journey I’ve taken has carried me halfway around the world in search of something I can’t put a name on. I know I don’t care much for capitalism. I have an attraction for some form of socialism, but I can’t commit myself to what I don’t understand. Idealistically, it seems the best answer to man’s inability to live together peacefully, but socialism, too, has a history of violence and upheaval. It’s all pretty hard to figure out. What do you think?” Rolf considered my question for a moment, scratched his head, then said, “Socialism, communism, Marxism, all these ‘isms’ have no soul. They’re connected only in terms of class struggle and a fight for equality in the production and consumption of material goods. In that sense, they’re not so different from capitalism. What about the spiritual struggle? Islamic Marxism? It’s a joke! It’s just another form of cultural imperialism that would force people to conform to a standardized way of thinking and behaving. “Democracy, individual freedom, human rights? Also a bunch of rubbish that can never be inflicted upon impoverished nations and peoples. What do uneducated peoples know about such things? They think only about where the next meal comes from. It doesn’t matter what form of government they live under. It seems to me, there’s only one reality and that’s mankind’s inability to organize itself. I think we have to accept man’s weaknesses, his greed, his stupidity. And love him for it all. No one can possibly know what the answers to life are until after we die. It’s like the preacher said, ‘All is vanity and a striving after wind.’ “You can’t save the world alone or through any ideology or ‘ism.’ That’s the only truth I know. Oh sure, you can chase after a spiritual path. Become a Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist if you must. But you won’t find any answers there, either. I’ve tried. The world’s religions are just a bunch of exclusivist groups, too. Stick with science, knowledge, the art of survival. Study languages, communicate, make life interesting for yourself, that’s what I try to do. Here, go on, have another hit off the pipe. Concentrate on the moment, look at the stars, appreciate what is here and now. If you’re meant to find any answers, they’ll come to you in due time.”  What prescient and profound advice for the beaten-down young man, Robert, a babe in the woods who was put through the ringer by the military and the judicial forces. I have a feeling these words from Rolf, whether they are sort of silly to me, are deeply embedded in his consciousness.  After the second trip through Europe and Asia, he ended up working in the USA, cooking, even on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. All of that in condensed form is covered in the book.  While memoir is an amazing form, not a pure autobiography, that is, more of an enlightened journey, a walkabout, a talk with the writer’s own ego and intellect and self/muse, Robert attempts to reconstruct those days, those moments, the dialogue, his thoughts, other’s thoughts. We are with him, and in many cases it feels like a journalistic recalling of events. Again, this man coveres his great grandfather, the journeys there in the Norris Family, Pennsylvannia Dutch, and into the New America, the tough life of hard work and his mother’s own emancipation from a sexist and closed world for women to venture into male territory.  This is not anti-memoir, for sure, and this search for his identity throughout his life is compelling, and this piece, this big tome is surely a Mother’s Day gift, an act of love, a tribute to his mother’s deep cut into his life. Her imprint on him and his words. This woman vaulted above the strictures of American, Lutheran, Catholic, misogyny.  Here, a quick look at anti-memoir: from Yiyun Li, author of Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life  A memoirist is always trying to connect with the reader and to make sure that the reader reads the memoir – reads the subject of the memoir, that is, the author – in the right way, on the writer’s terms. That’s what makes me hesitate to want to write a memoir or to call what I have written a memoir. I think if a writer does not set out to challenge herself in her work, her foundation is a little off. Is that what you mean when you say, ‘One cannot be an adept writer of one’s life’? Because you’d have to start by admitting that there is no such thing as a consistent and stable ‘I’? That’s a crucial point – if you write without questioning your own life, without questioning your ‘I’, the book that you write is not going to be one we can trust. But if you write while questioning yourself – constantly questioning that ‘I’ – that book will reflect many of the conflicts you experience. That makes it a very messy tale, much messier than a memoir with a neat arc. But, you see, you can’t pretend your life is a ‘neat’ story or even a ‘good’ story – life isn’t a good story. If you try to make it into one, you are simplifying too many things. (source)  You as the reader will get stepping stones, big lily pads from which to travel with Robert on his life, the ups and downs, sweeping thoughts, focused intrigue, all the trials and tribulations, and his own life in Japan, the struggle there, language and culture crashing like an earthquake basalt tipping over.  He comes to love a woman, her family, the home that is Japan, and his mother comes to Japan and becomes both enamored of and engaged in the language, learning, an open hand to understanding her own life throught the lens of where her son embarked, disembarked and then set down roots.  Robert’s stand against fighting, against killing, against using a weapon was remarkable in his time or in fact during any time in history:  When Harold Bing was in Winchester Prison, there was one wing for male criminal prisoners, one for women and two for conscientious objectors. The conditions for COs were exactly the same as those for criminal prisoners, but COs did succeed in getting prisons to offer a vegetarian diet. Vegetarianism was common among COs, as it had an obvious affinity, particularly with humanitarian pacifism. CO prisoners were allowed a very limited number of censored letters, though one of the COs interviewed by IWM said ‘filling the notepaper was quite an art’ because there was nothing to say after months or years in prison. They had no calendars, no newspapers, and few visits – those visits they did receive were through a grille. They were limited to a few books from the prison library at infrequent intervals, but after a while COs were allowed to have books sent in under the condition that they donate them to the prison library once finished with them. Later CO prisoners were impressed to find prison libraries stocked with titles by William Morris, Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other writers of the left. Here, Bing recalls the constrained and degrading conditions of prison life. (source)  It might not be difficult for Robert living in Japan, a culture before he showed up that has been militaristic to the max, imperial to the max, and now, the country is building up military once again, another flavor of the Nazism of Ukraine and UK and USA, and alas, they, Japanese, do not all agree, but it is a country that seems cemented over in terms of defying the powers that be. Robert takes a country one person at a time. Here, the nutshell of Japan’s march to war:  Japan is undergoing the most significant changes to its security strategy since the end of World War II. In late 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government approved three policy documents—the National Security Strategy (NSS), the National Defense Strategy and the Defense Buildup Program—that propose a significant expansion of Japan’s military capabilities and a major increase in military spending over five years. The documents enable important modifications of the senshu boei (exclusively defence-oriented policy) that Japan has followed since 1946, not least allowing Japan to participate far more actively in collective self-defence with the United States and to substantially increase its ability to project force beyond its borders.  And to be THAT Japan, the vassal of the West, USA, in its hate toward China, what terrible times, really, and that is a question I posed Robert, who is in his 70s, has had medical issues for years, and seems to be happy and content with not rocking boats and rattling cages. You’ll see again, people are people, wherever he ventures. That is his chi.  Without further ado, here’s the interview, in his words, unadulturated:  1. What do you miss most about your mother?  Her smile, which could light up a room, her infectious giggle, her stories, and the warmth of her hugs.  2. What do you believe have been the most transitional and emblematic changes in your character as you have become an ex-pat of Japan?  I’ve become much more accepting and patient. Too many times, especially in my early years in Japan, I would react to things people around me did or said based on my limited and direct interpretations of Japanese into English in my head. Without having the cultural advantage of knowledge of nuances in intonation, idiomatic language, sarcasm, gestures, and even levels of politeness, there were often huge differences in what was really being conveyed and what I thought was being conveyed. I committed many cultural faux-pas.  Eventually, I learned to pay attention to how native speakers interacted with one another. I tried as much as possible to copy what they said and did in certain situations. The concept of wa, or harmony, is indispensable to the functioning of Japanese society. Individualism is accepted but not necessarily encouraged. When you think about it historically, it’s easy to understand. I mean, you’ve got a country with 120 million people crammed into the space of California, and probably 70 percent of that land space is mountainous and uninhabitable. People in most cities are piled one on top of another like sardines in a can. In order to survive, they have to be able to put up with a lot. In that sense, I’m lucky that we live in a somewhat rural area with plenty of space and greenery.  When I finally got around to noticing in detail how Japanese really communicated on a daily basis in public and in private, as well as trying to accept things as they were instead of judging, I found my own life improved and I had a lot less stress, despite still not understanding 100 percent of everything that was going on.  3. What does it mean to you to be a conscientious objector?  That’s a bit of a loaded question, wouldn’t you say? If I tried to answer it with some kind of philosophical or religious tenet, I’d probably come across as a self-righteous and condescending asshole.  To me, it’s really just a matter of common sense. I’ve never felt the need to align myself with one particular group or way of thought in order to express the importance of nonviolence. I’m not against the idea of using force to protect myself or others, but just the idea of violence, whether verbal or physical, let alone killing, especially in the name of one’s government or tribe, makes me sick to my stomach.  In one form or another, I think we’re all conscientious objectors at heart. In retrospect, most people come to see wars as senseless and insane. It’s never a matter of one side being more righteous than another. Even today, we see a tendency to point fingers at perceived perpetrators of criminal acts and claim the superiority of what our government tells us is reality and truth. In the case of what’s going on in Ukraine, I think we should do what we can to provide support to those young men refusing to kill on either side, Russian or Ukrainian.  4. What key lesson in your early years, post prison, up to way before Japan, did you gain as both personal philosophy and a way to move forward with your life?  My journeys across the U.S. and Europe in 1973 and around the world in 1977 resulted in my having less fear of the unknown and more trust in total strangers. From the moment I first stuck out my thumb while hitchhiking on the highway leading out of my hometown, I had nothing but positive experiences. This newfound faith was in a sense akin to Bob Dylan’s line in that song “Like a Rolling Stone”: “When you ain’t got nothing, you got nothing to lose.” By throwing away any worry of not having to follow a plan and basically casting my fate to the wind, I opened myself up to experiences, places, and people that would ultimately lead me to a multitude of adventures, opportunities, discoveries, friendships, and an appreciation for living life in the moment.  5. What if you had not gotten called up for overseas duty but were still in the Air Force? Would you be a much different man, thinker, and person if none of that happened to you? Explain.  I’ve never been one to dwell on “what if” situations. I’ve always tried to move on and deal with the consequences, good or bad, of whatever fork in the road I’ve chosen. At any rate, I probably wouldn’t have naively entered the Air Force if there hadn’t been a war going on or an eventual draft notice coming with my name on it. I can’t imagine myself as still being in the Air Force. As I see it now, that was simply one path I traveled early on in life that led to the next path. I’ve come to accept all the paths I’ve walked as necessary and natural in the arc of my life story.  6. Truly, Japanese culture-people-history is so much different than the history of your birth country and your mom’s place of birth and death. A few contrasts you think would be worthy of prominence in this interview?  I’ve lived in Japan for so long now that I hardly ever think in terms of comparisons or differences between the countries. Besides, even if I tried to make comparisons, they would be outdated as the images I have in my brain about the States are mainly from the 1960s and 1970s. I’m stuck in a time warp. What I have noticed about Japan is no different from observations I made on my journeys through other countries in the 1970s. People everywhere go about their daily lives in much the same way. They’re concerned with putting food on the table, health, family, and all the rituals of working, celebrating, grieving, showing appreciation, getting high, entertaining, and taking care of one another. If you are open to them, they’ll open their arms to you.  7. Is there anything you like about the US foreign policy, US government? if not, why, and if so, expand.  I like that the U.S. is often way ahead of most other countries when it comes to helping out in times of a natural disaster. The main thing I don’t like is the U.S. having military bases in almost every country on the planet. I mean, come on! Think of how much good all the money wasted on military expenditures could be used for in battling poverty, disease, crime, pollution, all the things that will probably wipe us out as a species.  8. Being a young man when you grew up and came of age, well, so different than now, as an 18-year-old. Give us some insight into what you think is different now being a young man growing up compared to 1965 to 1975 in your case?  When I was an 18-year-old, we got much of our news from just three different TV news stations. My generation was probably influenced more by the music we listened to, the underground newspapers and magazines we read, and the movies we watched than anything else. I think we had time in those days to digest and discuss the issues that concerned us.  With the advent and ubiquity of today’s social media, news is aimed at and consumed by insulated tribes at a break-neck speed. Memes and 30-second Tik-Tok videos present issues that are gobbled up and replaced within minutes. It sometimes seems as if critical thinking has disappeared. Young people have to contend with too many forms of media demanding their attention 24 hours a day. No one seems to have the concentration or time necessary to read slowly and carefully and think about something that doesn’t reinforce the opinions they’ve already had formed for them.  I’d like to see someone develop an audio or video app that would read stuff like Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States and every ten pages or so take a break with a hip-hop or rap song or whatever music is popular at the moment and then summarize the contents of what was just read and ask you what you thought. That would be cool.  9. What about writing resonates with you, your spirit, your intellect that you can share with say readers who are not wired that way.  Originally, I came to writing as a means of exploring the confusion I felt about life, family, meaning, everything I didn’t understand in my youthful angst. I can’t say it led to any profound revelations, but it was cathartic. My exposure to young hippie artists, musicians, and poets during my first journey to Europe in 1973 influenced me enough to want to explore a means of expressing myself. At the time, the lives of those people seemed so fulfilling.  I think my mother’s influence played a strong role, too. As far back as I can remember, she was always playing music, writing poetry, painting scenes of nature, and expressing herself in many other ways. Her eyes always lit up when she was involved in something artistic. I guess I ended up just trying to follow her example. Writing has given me great satisfaction in life, and whenever I’m in a state of confusion, frustration, depression, or even excitement, I put pen to paper. At the end of a writing session, I always feel somewhat relieved and even interested in where some of the thoughts and descriptions came from.  Mom used to say, “Try making some lemonade out of the lemons in your life. You might find yourself feeling better.” I think the answer is as simple as that. No harm in trying, and it’s a helluva lot better than drinking yourself to death in order to forget.  10. You know where I stand politically and ethically. Japan is not my cup of tea in terms of the history of hate and mayhem with China, Korea, and in the Pacific, etc. And now, Japan is so aligned with the dirty USA, so I can’t really muster up a great theoretical love of the place. But, you do love your wife, the people who shepherded you and those you have shepherded. Riff with this.  That’s it right there. The people. Again, maybe this stems from my journeys as a young man, but I found that as long as I was open to others without any preconceived notions based on any country’s history or on the things I’d heard or read about it, people anywhere would be open to me. We should always separate the people of any country from their government’s actions or policies. We shouldn’t judge individuals without trying to communicate with them first.  I’ve shared drinks, meals, pipes of various substances, and time with people from many different countries who had reason to hate me simply because I was American and my generation or my ancestors had been responsible for the suffering of their people. Or even some of them personally. In some cases, it was the other way around.  The fact is we were able to communicate somehow without judgement. At some point, I’d learned how to be a good listener. I didn’t try to force my feelings or beliefs on them, and they didn’t try to force theirs on me. We expressed ourselves — sometimes with the help of interpreters, sometimes not — but what seemed to matter most in those moments of attempts at communication and understanding was the sincerity of the individuals involved. In my case, Japan was never an ultimate planned destination. I could’ve just as easily ended up in Greece or Spain or someplace else. As it turned out, fate intervened and I ended up here. I was lucky things turned out the way they have.  It may sound corny, but I really believe, more now than ever before, that we are all members of one family. I don’t think of myself as an American; rather, I think I’m a world citizen. If the human race can’t ever fully grasp that we’re all connected and dependent on one another, then I’m afraid we’re doomed.  Concerning that, a George Carlin quote comes to mind. In one routine about how he thought people trying to save the planet was bullshit, he said he thought that the earth didn’t give a shit about us human beings and it’d be just fine after we self destructed. He said, “The planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas.” I think he’s right. In the overall scheme of things, the existence of the human race is really inconsequential.  11. What do you want people to know about your mother — key points — from and after reading the memoir?  Her compassion and her capacity for total and unconditional love. Her courage, curiosity, tenacity, sensitivity, perseverance, insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding, and dedication to family. Her stubbornness, self-sacrifice, generosity, strength, zest for life, and the joy she gave others simply by being with them. Do you want me to continue? I can go on and on. Good Lord, how I loved that woman!  12. What gives you hope?  Children at play. Children who know they are loved. Parents in the kitchen preparing healthy meals for loved ones.  13. What presents you with the half-empty glass scenario, and if you always see it half full, then riff, discuss.  Watching corporate news programs gives me a bad case of seeing the glass as half empty. Looking at great paintings, reading great literature and poetry, listening to favorite music, hearing children laugh, eating healthy and delicious foods — these things bring back an awareness of the beauty of life and a “glass half full” viewpoint. Mom used to call herself a “cock-eyed optimist.” I think I inherited that characteristic from her.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZGlzc2lkZW50dm9pY2Uub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1raWQtaW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1oZWFkaW5nLXRvLXRoZS1icmlnL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","1966-04-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:31:30","It’s been quite the journey for psychedelics, and it’s just getting started. First, they were sacred and ceremonial plant medicines for millennia. In the 1960s era, they traversed an American culture of mind expansion, which used them as wild tools for transcending ordinary states of consciousness. Then came the backlash in the 1970s when they were outlawed by a nervous Nixon administration. Now, psychedelics are emerging from the underground as a new generation of researchers amasses evidence that mind-altering drugs offer new and effective therapies to help stem the rising tides of mental illness.  Funding for research and legalization efforts on psychedelics are ramping up across the US. In January alone, seven states introduced new psychedelic legislation that ranges from decriminalization to supervised adult use to psychiatric treatment. Abroad, Australia became the first country to legalize psilocybin — psychedelic mushrooms — and MDMA as prescribable medicines by psychiatrists. The US looks poised to follow, with the FDA potentially set to approve MDMA for therapy later this year.  These tectonic changes in drug policy are taking place against the backdrop of a US mental health crisis, one where existing treatments have fallen short: The World Health Organization’s (WHO) largest mental health report this century has termed current interventions “insufficient and inadequate.” Turning to psychoactive fungi for treatment-resistant mental illness is a sharp pivot, a sign of both the impoverishment of current approaches and the excitement around a genuinely novel remedy.  But as important as anything that can turn the tide on mental health is, the frenzy over transforming psychedelics into new treatments for illness obscures — and may even interfere with — their further potential to expand our understanding of what healthy minds could be. The deep history of psychedelics shows they have far more to offer than simply the next generation of psychiatric treatment.  Conventional psychiatry looks at mental disorders: clinically significant disturbances in areas that are important for day-to-day functioning, like emotional regulation, behavior, and thinking. But psychedelics, when used carefully, can do more than heal disturbances. The WHO’s founding constitution defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Psychedelics can help shift attention toward reconfiguring the baseline of ordinary, non-impaired experience in ways that enrich what we call “normal.”  But fully harnessing these drugs may require a very different set of research and regulatory approaches than current conventional efforts focused on turning psychedelics into the next generation of therapeutic medicines. To make the most of what psychedelics can offer to the more expansive project of human flourishing, medicalizing isn’t enough. Regulators should consider allowing access outside a doctor’s office.  “The problem with the current biomedical vision is that it’s very much based on an individualistic understanding of mental health and human flourishing,” said Claudia Schwarz-Plaschg, a social scientist and visiting scholar at the University of Edinburgh’s Usher Institute who spent three years studying attitudes toward psychedelics in the US. “Medical interventions are geared towards making the individual fit better into society through therapeutic and substance-based interventions, but other approaches are more open towards a broader vision of how mental health issues and societal structures are producing each other,” she said.  Leaving psychedelics in the hands of the biomedical industry and state-regulated facilities can undermine their potential by excluding more diverse “sets and settings” (a term describing how psychological, social, and cultural factors all profoundly shape the kinds of trips one might experience) while leaving inequalities across race, culture, and class unaddressed.  But there is little consensus among researchers and policymakers on questions of access — from who gets access to where and how — in ways that could make the most of psychedelics’ benefits while balancing the potential risks.  Given the extent of the mental health crisis, policymakers should embrace new treatments to help those who suffer from mental illness. But in that embrace, we shouldn’t lose sight of what psychedelics can offer beyond psychiatry. Used holistically, these drugs can help expand our understanding of what healthier, richer, more flourishing states of consciousness might be like. The smothered dream of those hippies and former Harvard psychology professors who called on Americans to expand their minds with psychedelics could be revived in more prudent, diverse, and informed ways — provided we don’t box them in.  Why the psychedelic renaissance is focused on mental illness  In 1943, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann first discovered the effects of LSD, which is part of the family known as “classical” psychedelics. These also include psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline (from the peyote cactus), and DMT. Classical psychedelics are non-addictive and bind to the brain’s serotonin receptors. That makes them unlike “non-classical” psychedelics such as ketamine and MDMA, which have different mechanisms of action in the brain and higher risks of side effects and abuse. (For example, in warm environments coupled with dehydration, MDMA can cause death via heatstroke, while ketamine could exacerbate existing heart conditions).  Like the psychedelic experience itself, there is no single narrative that fits the midcentury American trips that followed LSD’s introduction. It was a blooming, buzzing, revelatory confusion. LSD psychotherapy leaped into the Hollywood elite, the CIA experimented with the drug for mind control, and Jimi Hendrix front-manned a culture of Black psychedelia. But that experimentation largely came to an end in 1971 when President Richard Nixon’s Controlled Substances Act banned psychedelics (among other drugs) and stifled psychedelic research.  While the legislation forced those interested in psychedelics underground, they didn’t stay there long. By the 1990s, a mostly new generation of researchers had begun revisiting studies from the 1950s, while attitudes toward psychedelics within the FDA and DEA were softening. Regulators no longer saw them as exotic substances with unknown long-term consequences, but increasingly, just another potentially dangerous drug. By 1991, a series of legal challenges, together with the perseverance of researchers who believed psychedelics were worth studying, led to the first approval for human psychedelic research since the 1970s.  Regulatory hurdles to obtaining approval remained steep, and young scientists still risked their reputations by working with psychedelics. But a landmark paper published in the journal Psychopharmacology in 2006 on mushrooms and mystical experiences — where recipients reported mystical experiences with high personal significance that endured for months afterward — signaled the above-ground renaissance in scientific research was professionally viable, institutionally acceptable, and already underway.  This time, however, the focus was not directed toward expanding the mind, Timothy Leary-style, but alleviating mental illness. In part, this shift was a strategic response to the 1960s moral panic and 1970s legal action against psychedelics. By reintroducing psychedelics through the most accepted and controlled channels — medical research — scientists aimed to minimize the risk of another backlash.  The shift toward psychiatry was also a response to a clear need. By 2019–2020, approximately a fifth of all adults — over 50 million Americans, up from 39.8 million in 2008 — were reporting some kind of mental illness. The growing body of psychedelic research suggested significant promise in treating precisely the illnesses that were most widespread: depression, anxiety, and addiction. That list may continue to expand as research fans out into new areas, like eating disorders.  No single group of chemicals can solve the complexities of mental health, which extend beyond the individual mind to include social and political elements. But if recent research holds course, psychedelics may well provide much-needed relief while inspiring entirely new approaches to psychiatry. That’s especially vital given the lack of innovation in mental health treatments since SSRI antidepressants like Prozac were approved in the 1980s.  Still, a singular focus on making psychedelics into pharmaceutical medicines carries its own drawbacks, in part by isolating the psychoactive molecules themselves from the wider cultural practices that have traditionally been inseparable from the experience.  “Mainstream culture hears about psychedelics primarily through a medicalized or therapeutic lens,” said Ariel Clark, an Odawa Anishinaabe regulatory attorney based in California and a founding board member of the Psychedelic Bar Association. “But the use of sacred medicines in Indigenous paradigms of access really eclipse the medical use by far.”  As the Harvard theologian Rachael Peterson put it: “Important wisdom is lost when technologies of transcendence are stripped from their spiritual and religious contexts and presented as psychological treatments.” Now, a new generation of researchers is seeking to return a wider spiritual lens to targeted questions of therapy and neuroscience.  How psychedelics can enrich your mind  Until recently, there was little funding for psychedelic research on volunteers without diagnosed mental illness, what researchers sometimes call “healthy normals.” That’s why Roland Griffiths, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, recently launched the Griffiths Fund. The fund supports research and a professorship at Hopkins to study the effects of psychedelics on well-being and secular spirituality in healthy volunteers. Griffiths, whose research has been pivotal in advancing the field since his 2006 paper helped launch the psychedelic renaissance, has called this “the most consequential direction for future psychedelic research.”  The first recipient is David Yaden, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who works in the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Prior to studying psychedelics at Hopkins, Yaden’s work focused on “self-transcendent experiences,” or altered states of consciousness achieved through drugs or other means, ranging from meditation and brain stimulation to simple walks in nature. While most research on psychedelics and spirituality has treated elements like mystical experiences as secondary to therapeutic outcomes, Yaden told me he plans to “confront the issue of spirituality” head-on, rather than as a side quest.  “I think it’s essential that the study of well-being is not lost in this emphasis on therapeutics,” Yaden told me. He calls this focus on whether and how psychedelics can improve well-being (even for those who aren’t mentally ill) the “positive program” of psychedelic research.  Although the Griffiths Fund is the first effort specifically dedicated to these questions in healthy volunteers, there already exists a small foundation of academic research on the subject. Most of it can be divided into two buckets: the observable effects of psychedelics on the brain and their subjective effects on the mind. This blurry relationship between the brain and the mind is one of the many mysteries psychedelics may help clarify.  We can record objective data on how LSD changes patterns of electrical activity in the brain with neuroimaging technologies like EEG and fMRI. But to capture the feeling of the psychedelic dissolution of the boundary between yourself and the world, we can only rely indirectly on people’s recollections. Mainstream psychedelic research leans toward what you can directly measure, but Yaden told me that the subjective experiences are a necessary part of any full explanation of the lasting benefits on well-being some psychedelic users report.  In the brain, psychedelics are associated with at least three groups of observable effects. They boost neuroplasticity, which supports the rewiring of existing neurons. They promote neurogenesis, which supports the creation of new brain cells. And they increase brain “entropy,” or the diversity, randomness, and unpredictability of electrical activity across brain regions.  Neuroplasticity likely plays a key role in addressing mental illness by enhancing the brain’s ability to rewire patterns of thought. Especially when paired with psychotherapy, psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity can help reshape harmful habits — from mental patterns of self-criticism to forms of addiction — into more beneficial ones.  While anyone can benefit from a little more neuroplasticity, which tends to decline with age, increasing brain entropy offers another explanation for the spectrum of benefits beyond treating illness. In 2014, Robin Carhart-Harris, a neuroscientist who was then the head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, published a landmark work on what he called “the entropic brain.” The basic idea is that what any state of consciousness feels like — and in particular, what he calls the “richness” of its feeling — depends on the amount of entropy in the associated brain activity. Brain entropy is low in reduced states of consciousness, like when you’re under general anesthesia. During altered states, from psychedelic trips to deep meditation, entropy is higher. In ordinary waking consciousness, it rests somewhere in the middle.  Carhart-Harris argues that the brain evolved an ability to strike a useful balance of entropy levels. In particular, he believes that the collection of regions known as the default-mode network (DMN) is primarily responsible for suppressing entropy in the ordinary brain. Doing so favors forms of cognition that help us make sense of our environments in ways that are useful for survival. “Equally however,” he writes in the paper, “it could be seen as exerting a limiting or narrowing influence on consciousness.”  Psychedelics reduce activity within the DMN, loosening its hold over entropy levels. The resulting high-entropy states may not have been the most beneficial for our ancestors on the savannah. (Predators would welcome blissed-out prey, marveling at their surroundings rather than scanning for threats). But for a species where basic survival can now mostly be taken for granted, these states may have much to offer. Beyond mere vacations into “richer” states of consciousness, entropic states can cast new light on the ordinary ones we return to when a trip subsides. Sometimes it’s tough to imagine how different something that’s grown so familiar can be — like the habitual ways we experience ourselves, those close to us, and the world — until we’ve had the direct experience of it being otherwise.  But Yaden emphasized that entropy, neuroplasticity, and all the other factors that we can observe with brain-imaging technologies are only part of the story. He calls these “lower-level neurobiological processes,” and adds that higher-level ones, like the subjective content of the experiences themselves, play a key role in explaining the benefits of psychedelics.  These fall into the hazier category of effects on the mind, where scientific tools awkwardly grasp for measurements that don’t come easy. To describe these parts of a trip, you must rely on imperfect language: mystical experience, ego death or dissolution, unselfing, oceanic boundlessness. They can run the spectrum from blissful to terrifying, and the quality and intensity of these experiences shape the long-term effects.  For example, one study found that higher scores of oceanic boundlessness during a trip (a term reaching all the way back to the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, describing the sense of separation between self and world melting away, like a water droplet losing its separateness as it rejoins the ocean) were more predictive of long-term clinical benefits than basic hallucinatory effects (like seeing undulating geometric patterns). The interpretation was that when it comes to psychedelics, the ordinary and predictable relationship between dose and outcome isn’t as simple as with other drugs. Sometimes, the kind of experience someone has — and the set and setting in which that experience takes place — is more important than the dose of psychedelics they take.  While the majority of clinical psychedelic experiences are positive, this is likely because researchers have a great degree of control over risk factors. But the very measures of control that help ensure more positive experiences can also suppress the wider range of possibilities, just like the default-mode network’s regulation of entropy levels. The clinically controlled environments employed in research trials and regulated psychiatric contexts have their own set and setting that will tend to reproduce particular kinds of experiences while discouraging others. Many within the psychedelic community believe that greater freedoms in where, how, and in what company we take psychedelics are crucial for maximizing their benefits, especially in already healthy users.  States across the US are introducing varieties of psychedelic legislation that will lay the groundwork for what psychedelic access may come to look like domestically while also informing global strategies. “From a global perspective,” Schwarz-Plaschg writes in her ethnographic study, “the US can be understood as a test bed from which lessons might be drawn for how to best build a post-prohibitionist world for psychedelics.”  The debate over how to expand access to psychedelics  There’s an unavoidable tension in legislative efforts to shape this post-prohibitionist world. Supporting wider uses and benefits of psychedelics by making them easier to access means raising the risks for individuals, as well as the chances of another legal backlash. As states continue introducing new bills, there is no settled blueprint. Each approach explores different ways of balancing benefits and risks.  One approach gaining traction is the “adult-use” model pioneered in Oregon, which took effect at the start of 2023. Anyone over the age of 21 who can afford the cost (early estimates suggest as much as $1,000 per session, which would keep out all but the well-off) can sign up for a psychedelic service session. These can only take place at a service center approved by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) under the supervision of facilitators who have completed one of the training programs vetted by the Oregon Psilocybin Services division of the OHA.  Cole Burston/AFP via Getty Images  By eliminating the need for a medical diagnosis or referral, the adult-use model does expand access. But requiring the trip to occur inside a government-sanctioned room, under the supervision of a facilitator one may have very little relationship with, and without the company of others joining in the experience, can all run counter to the variety of social and nature-immersed ways Indigenous cultures have used psychedelics for generations.  Colorado recently went a step further, including a decriminalization component alongside adult-use legislation. This would allow citizens to possess, grow, and share psychedelics for personal use in whatever forms they see fit. But psychedelic researchers and practitioners disagree on permitting such unregulated access. Beyond concerns over the risks of psychedelic use in unregulated environments, there are further worries that decriminalization could undermine researchers’ ability to carry out rigorous clinical trials, or that an absence of restrictions on the quantity of psychedelics that can be grown for personal use will lead to a large black market supply for the drugs.  Beyond “where” and “how,” there is also the question of “when.” As Rick Doblin, director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit specializing in psychedelic research and education, told GQ in 2021, “medicalization precedes legalization.” But for how long?  There are two broad camps here. One (including Doblin) sees medicalization as the necessary path toward broader acceptance, arguing that mounting evidence of medical benefits will gradually turn public opinion in favor of wider access to psychedelics. The other camp sees medicalization as a sort of waiting room that will slow legalization efforts.  Clark echoed the idea that careful regulatory policy is essential, but rejected that medicalization is the best approach in the meantime. As she pointed out to me, holding psychedelics in an exclusively medicalized waiting room could worsen the existing diversity problem. “You want to talk about the history of Black people or Native people with the medical establishment?” Clark said. “Who’s driving the conversation around the medical and therapeutic being the safest and only way?”  There is also the uncomfortable matter of psychedelic capitalism. The reservation of early access to psychedelics for pharmaceutical companies, medical researchers, and opportunistic investors is transforming the psychedelic industry — including the drugs themselves — before it even reaches the public. Broadly, the concern is that capitalism’s profit motive won’t necessarily support the prudent research, rollout, and harm reduction measures that can help ensure a smooth and equitable reintroduction.  Schwarz-Plaschg said that a complementary non-biomedical focus (like decriminalization) would help maximize the benefits. “The broader the spectrum of psychedelic services and legal uses in society, the more people will be reached who can benefit in their own flourishing, and that will enable society to flourish more in the long term.”  But the sometimes strained move from biomedical to recreational legalization in cannabis suggests the need for prudence. Businesses that deal with a substance legalized by the state but still outlawed by the federal government face a variety of elevated costs (for example, they can’t deduct business expenses from their federal taxes and struggle to find willing insurers). The odds of success in the industry are stacked toward large corporate entities with money to blow. “We have to go slow to go fast,” Clark told me. “That is a huge lesson from cannabis, and with psychedelics, there’s even more reason to go slow at the beginning. It’s the foundational stages that matter the most because of these huge, important, intersectional issues.”  The current moment presents an opportunity to engage deep representation and participation from all stakeholders of psychedelic drugs and sacred plant medicines alike. Colonial tensions are baked into the psychedelic renaissance, but movements to decolonize the industry can elevate a commitment to equity while helping to expand the conversation around different models of access.  These Indigenous approaches vary by culture and place, but generally share a few themes. First, as Clark explained, psychedelics are not seen as substances you “take,” like an aspirin or an antidepressant, but as entities that you enter into relationship with. “It’s a deep and sacred relationship, grounded in veneration and relationality.” Second, many Indigenous models could not be carried out on a solo trip inside a cozy doctor’s office, isolated from larger communities of practice.  Finally, many Indigenous models do not recognize a distinction between therapeutic and spiritual. Illness and one’s existential relationship to the self and the world go hand in hand. The idea that you could extract the therapeutic mechanism from the spiritual context is seen as a peculiarly Western conceit.  Next stop on the trip  President Biden’s administration expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve MDMA and psilocybin for treating PTSD and depression, respectively, within the next year or two. This would increase pressure on the DEA to reschedule the drugs, which are currently categorized as Schedule I substances “with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” This status — widely considered out of touch with current research — restricts access to the substances, creating a major barrier to further studies and to those who could benefit from their use.  With or without rescheduling, the flurry of state bills for psychedelic access is likely to continue. One study based on cannabis legalization trends predicts that a majority of states will legalize psychedelics in the next 14 years. Whether these legal models will open up access for a wider range of potential benefits (and risks) or reinforce the conditions to explore only a narrow, more manageable band of their potential is still up for grabs.  So what could legalization efforts that extend access beyond psychiatry look like? It would require a diversity of sets and settings, not just clinical trials or government-approved cozy rooms. It requires a diversity of participants, beyond privileged subgroups who can afford access to expensive services. And it needs an equal investment in harm reduction alongside benefit maximization.  Doblin has sketched one idea: licensed legalization. Think of it like getting your driver’s license but for buying psychedelics. Once you are a certain age, you would become eligible for a supervised psychedelic experience at a licensed facility — a sort of initiation ritual where you learn the ropes. Perhaps there’s a written portion to ensure basic knowledge. Afterward, you receive a license that allows you to purchase psychedelics for use however you see fit. The license could be revoked for any number of infractions, just as we do for drunk drivers.  Advocates for this sort of regulated legalization still lack answers for how to keep purchasing costs down — one reason that some support decriminalization, where personal cultivation could afford cheaper access. The cannabis legalization experience shows how dealing in Schedule I substances entails regulatory compliances and tax burdens that drive up the price.  Costs aside, there’s still a bumpy road to licensed legalization. There is no getting around the fact that lowering barriers to access can raise the risk of harm, and safety measures in clinical settings are better developed than those for communities new to the drugs. Nor are there established business models for psychedelics that ensure benefit sharing with Indigenous communities.  Experiments are underway, though, like Journey Colab’s “Reciprocity Trust,” where they designate 10 percent of their founding equity to cycle back into Indigenous communities and other stakeholders working on equitable access. Finally, rising demand from widespread access would deepen exploitative pressures on the ecosystems where psychedelics grow. Synthetic alternatives developed in the spirit of open science could help. But whether synthetic alternatives are as effective as their naturally occurring counterparts remains under-studied.  Whatever rationale — or concern — one leans toward, a broader approach to psychedelics offers something that’s otherwise hard to come by. Disturbances in ordinary experience are easy to spot, like measuring the brain’s electrical activity. But how much richer ordinary experience itself can be is a camouflaged question that seldom arises unprovoked.  Psychedelics are one way of bringing the construction of ordinary consciousness into view, wherever one falls on a diagnostic rating scale of mental disorders. But regulatory environments and models of access are part of the wider set and setting that shapes or constrains psychedelic experiences. Hopefully, the burgeoning post-prohibition world for psychedelics won’t remain boxed in by lab coats and psychiatry alone, and we won’t deprive ourselves of the strange, fascinating, sometimes risky, and meaningful views a wider approach to psychedelics can offer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbXlkcm9sbC5jb20vdGhlcmUtYXJlLW1vcmUtYmVuZWZpdHMtdG8tcHN5Y2hlZGVsaWNzLXRoYW4tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC10cmVhdG1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The protesters are also angry over the rising cost of living and the prolonged insecurity in the east of the country, where armed militias and rebel groups have been carrying out attacks that have killed hundreds and displaced over a million.  Around a dozen protesters were detained by security forces just after the start of the demonstration, which was called for by opposition leaders.  “The procession is not allowed to come here, this is not the authorised route,” police commander Faustin Numbi said at the scene of the clashes.  Congo is due to hold a general election on Dec. 20 in which President Felix Tshisekedi is expected to seek a second term.  But political tension is on the rise in the world’s leading cobalt producer, with some opposition candidates complaining of delays and alleged irregularities in a voter registration drive that they say is being conducted to their disadvantage.  Four opposition leaders including Martin Fayulu, who came in second in the 2018 presidential election, and Moise Katumbi, a millionaire businessman and former regional governor who is expected to run in 2023, called for the protest on Saturday.  “It’s sad, you see, they are firing tear gas. Just before, it was real ammunition,” Katumbi told journalists near the protest venue in Kinshasa.  Fayulu said by telephone that his vehicle was surrounded by security forces who continued to fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators.  “The electoral register is not reliable and we’ll not compromise on this issue,” Fayulu added.

Desperation for food forces the stranded soccer team in Yellowjackets to turn to their most drastic measure yet in the penultimate episode of season 2. Titled “It Chooses,” episode eight sees the starving survivors carry out a hunt on one of their own for the first time—in what appears to be the original version of the brutal hunt shown in the opening scene of the Yellowjackets premiere.  The mood at the cabin is lower than ever in the episode—Lottie remains near death after letting Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) beat her violently, an effort to allow her to release her grief over the loss of her baby. And as the hunger sets in further, the line between reality and the supernatural has grown increasingly blurred. Several members of the group experience hallucinations—or visions, depending on how you see it—throughout the episode. By the end of the hour, they come to the collective decision to sacrifice one of their own so that the others can eat and, as a result, save Lottie.  To make the choice, they play what essentially boils down to a game of Russian roulette using a deck of cards: Whoever draws the queen of hearts will be the one to die. The unlucky loser of the game is Natalie (Sophie Thatcher), who accepts her fate at first and lets Shauna clasp Jackie’s heart necklace around her neck. But when Shauna moves to slit her throat, Natalie turns to tell her to look her in the eye when she kills her. In that moment, a distraught Travis (Kevin Alves) springs into action and tackles Shauna to the ground before screaming at Natalie to run.  Read More: TV Is Embracing Matriarchy at a Dark Moment for Feminism  A hunt ensues as Nat flees through the wilderness, hiding until Javi (Luciano Leroux) finds her and tries to lead her across the frozen lake to a secret hideout. But Javi falls through the ice—and though Natalie tries at first to save him, she’s pulled back by Misty (Samantha Hanratty), who tells her the girls will kill her if Javi lives. They watch as Javi helplessly flails in the water before he drowns—and then pull him out of the lake. “The wilderness chose,” Van (Liv Hewson) proclaims.  Sophie Thatcher as teen Natalie in Yellowjackets season 2, episode 8 Kailey Schwerman—SHOWTIME  Jonathan Lisco, the co-showrunner of Yellowjackets, tells TIME they killed off Javi—who spent much of season 2 missing and presumed dead until he miraculously reappeared—to make viewers question what is actually happening.  “When you have people believing in something that they think is supernatural or phenomenological or religious, and others who think things are just random, what better way to test each side’s hypotheses?” he says. “Is it the wilderness snatching it away from them? Or is it that Javi was trying to do something genuinely good for Natalie, who was “chosen” to be murdered and consumed, and then, in doing so, his goodness created an energetic environment in which he had to be the one to suffer and die.”  The full truth about the wilderness is unlikely to be revealed this season, with only one episode left. But it’s clear that the surviving adult Yellowjackets still think there was some sort of supernatural entity that held power over them while they were stranded, even if this belief hasn’t kept their guilt over what they did at bay. Natalie and Travis, in particular, are forever changed by Javi’s death, Lisco says.  “They both felt horribly guilty over Javi and were never really able to unpack exactly how to interact with one another. Their love affair was laden in addiction and dysfunction and was very unhealthy,” he says. “They were staying together, on and off, to, in some ways, to keep what was good about their relationship in the past alive, but also in many ways to honor Javi.”  More Must-Reads From TIME  Write to Megan McCluskey at [email protected]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbXlkcm9sbC5jb20vYnJlYWtpbmcteWVsbG93amFja2V0cy1zZWFzb24tMi1lcGlzb2RlLTgtZW5kaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The new Zelda has never sold so much and so fast. Still, it’s not Call of Duty, it doesn’t have TV series inspired by its characters, it’s not a world-famous card game like Pokémon and it’s not even as popular as Super Mario. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom only looks back on the (hefty) legacy of being the sequel to Breath of the Wild crowned 2017 game of the year. Moreover, arriving after a game considered by critics to be almost perfect is never very simple. Yet, once again Nintendo has managed to amaze us.  The Secret of the Ultrahand  Whoever writes to you took a while to understand the secret. The first five or six hours are not surprising, at least those who have spent a lot of time in the realm of Hyrule where the adventures of the characters Zelda and Link take place. It all seems a little too familiar at first. The idea of ​​the three maps on which the game extends, i.e. the intuition of also developing vertically, allowing you to explore the islands in the sky of Hyrule is a game designer’s cunning. But no big deal. The puzzles then all look a bit the same as well as the graphics which are nothing spectacular or original.  The true generators of creativity  What happened is yet another creative miracle of the great N. The secret is the Ultramano: a lucky intuition that has generated an explosion of new objects, solutions and tools within the game. It is an editor that allows you to assemble and combine objects. We are talking about a tool born in the mists of time that uses the physics of objects. Link activates his bionic limb, locates the object and with the controller can lift and rotate it in 3D space to generate new weapons or solve numerous puzzles. The success of this mechanic is demonstrated by the publication on social media of sometimes brilliant, sometimes hilarious works of wit. very often vulgar but almost always the fruit of the imagination. Not since the first Minecraft or Will Wright’s latest games has there been such a fun creative contamination.  What is happening on the web and on social media?  This possibility has literally unleashed the creativity, imagination and even a little morbidity of gamers, sometimes with amazing, complex and certainly hilarious results, which can also be admired on social networks. Guides of all kinds have flourished on specialized sites to accompany players in the adventure. The official guide to Zelda, paper book, has climbed the Amazon charts. As for social media, just use the hashtag #Zelda or #ultramano on Twitter or Instagram to come across mechanical skewers, laser rides, religious symbols and scurrilous writing.

"religious miracle","2023-01-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T23:18:30","What are some undeniable examples of divine intervention?  From a religious perspective, divine intervention is the belief that a higher power can intervene in the natural world and influence its course. While some may find the idea of divine intervention unconvincing, there are numerous examples throughout history that are hard to ignore. Here are some undeniable examples of divine intervention.  The Parting of the Red Sea  One of the most famous examples of divine intervention in the Bible is the parting of the Red Sea. This event occurred during the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, where they were pursued by Pharaoh’s army. According to the Book of Exodus, Moses lifted his staff and the Red Sea parted, allowing the Israelites to cross to safety. The Egyptian soldiers, who followed them into the sea, were drowned when the waters closed over them.  This event has been the subject of much debate and speculation. Some suggest that it was a natural phenomenon, such as the receding of the tide. However, the magnitude of this event suggests that it was likely the result of divine intervention.  11:12 AM. Watch this video Something very important WILL happen for you at  The Resurrection of Jesus Christ  The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a cornerstone of the Christian faith. According to the Gospels, Jesus was crucified and buried, but on the third day, he rose from the dead. This event has been the subject of much debate over the centuries, with some arguing that it was a hoax or a carefully staged illusion.  However, the resurrection is supported by numerous eyewitness accounts, including the appearance of Jesus to his disciples after his death. The transformation of the disciples from a group of frightened and dispirited individuals to bold and fearless advocates of the Gospel is also seen as evidence of the reality of the resurrection.  The Miracle of Fatima  The Miracle of Fatima is one of the most well-known examples of divine intervention in modern times. In 1917, three children in Portugal claimed to have received a series of visions of the Virgin Mary. On the final apparition, tens of thousands of people witnessed an event that became known as the Miracle of the Sun.  According to witnesses, the sun appeared to leave its place in the sky and dance around in the air. Many reported feeling healed of various afflictions, and the event was seen as a sign of divine intervention. While skeptics have suggested natural explanations for the Miracle of Fatima, the sheer scale of the event and the number of witnesses make it difficult to dismiss.  The Healing of Naaman  The story of the healing of Naaman is found in the Old Testament. Naaman was a military commander in Syria who suffered from leprosy. He traveled to Israel to seek a cure and was directed to the prophet Elisha. Elisha instructed him to wash seven times in the Jordan River, which he did, and he was healed.  The healing of Naaman is seen as an example of divine intervention, as it was under the guidance of Elisha, who was inspired by God. This event demonstrates the power of faith and obedience, as well as the willingness of God to show mercy and compassion.  The Conversion of Saul  The conversion of Saul, who later became known as Paul the Apostle, is a powerful example of divine intervention. Saul was a persecutor of Christians, but on the road to Damascus, he encountered a vision of Jesus Christ that changed his life forever. Paul became one of the most important figures in the early Christian church, spreading the Gospel throughout the Mediterranean world.  This event is seen as evidence of the transformative power of God’s love and grace. It also demonstrates the willingness of God to reach out to those who seem the most unlikely to respond positively to his message.  The Weeping Madonna  The Weeping Madonna is a phenomenon that has occurred in various parts of the world, where statues or images of the Virgin Mary have been reported to weep tears or blood. These events have been the subject of much debate, with skeptics suggesting that they are the result of hoaxes or natural explanations.  However, many believers see these events as evidence of divine intervention. The tears and blood are seen as a sign of Mary’s compassion and mercy, as well as a warning of impending calamities.  The Conversion of Augustine  The conversion of Augustine is another powerful example of divine intervention. Augustine was a philosopher and theologian who lived in the 4th century AD. He struggled for years with questions of faith and morality, but eventually had a transformative experience that led him to become one of the most important figures in Christian thought.  Augustine’s conversion is seen as evidence of the power of God’s grace to overcome even the most entrenched doubts and skepticism. It also demonstrates the importance of humility and openness to new experiences, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  The Manna from Heaven  The story of the manna from heaven is found in the Book of Exodus. According to the story, the Israelites, who were wandering in the desert, were sustained by a food that fell from the sky. This food, which was described as a type of bread, was seen as a divine gift that sustained them through their difficult journey.  The manna from heaven is seen as evidence of God’s providential care for his people. It is also seen as a symbol of the spiritual nourishment that comes from faith and trust in God’s love and grace.  The Conversion of Constantine  The conversion of Constantine is a significant event in the history of Christianity. Constantine was a Roman emperor who ruled in the early 4th century AD. He was initially a persecutor of Christians but had a vision before a battle that led him to convert to Christianity.  This event is seen as evidence of the power of divine intervention to change even the most hardened hearts. It also demonstrates the importance of courage and faith in the face of adversity.  The Battle of Lepanto  The Battle of Lepanto is a significant event in the history of Christianity and Islam. It occurred in 1571, when a Christian fleet defeated an Ottoman fleet in the Mediterranean. The battle was seen as a miraculous victory, and the Pope declared it a triumph of the Virgin Mary.  This event is seen as evidence of divine intervention in the course of history. It is also seen as a symbol of the power of prayer and faith to overcome seemingly unbeatable odds.  Why is divine intervention often doubted?  One reason why divine intervention is often doubted is that it can be difficult to prove. Events that are attributed to divine intervention may have natural explanations, or they may be the result of human intervention, coincidence, or chance.  Another reason why divine intervention is often doubted is a lack of evidence. While there are numerous stories and accounts of divine intervention throughout history, there is little concrete evidence to support them.  Finally, some people may doubt the existence of God or a higher power, leading them to dismiss the idea of divine intervention altogether.  Do people of all faiths believe in divine intervention?  While not all religions believe in the concept of divine intervention, many do. The belief in a higher power that can intervene in the natural world is common to many different faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism.  Even within these religions, though, there may be different interpretations of divine intervention, and not all believers may accept the idea.  Are there any scientific studies on divine intervention?  While there are no scientific studies that directly confirm or deny the existence of divine intervention, there are some studies that explore related phenomena. For example, research on prayer and meditation has shown that these practices can have positive effects on mental and physical health.  Other studies have explored the relationship between spirituality and well-being, finding that people who have a strong spiritual or religious practice tend to have better overall health and well-being.  What role does faith play in divine intervention?  Faith is an essential component of divine intervention. Believers must have faith that a higher power exists and that it can intervene in the natural world. Faith also plays a role in the outcome of events that are attributed to divine intervention.  When people pray or ask for divine intervention, their faith can influence the outcome of the event. This is because faith can change people’s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, making them more receptive to positive outcomes.  Can anyone experience divine intervention?  Yes, anyone can experience divine intervention, regardless of their religious or spiritual beliefs. However, it is important to note that divine intervention is not something that can be predicted or controlled. It is a spontaneous event that can occur at any time, and its effects may not be obvious at first.  Does divine intervention always have positive outcomes?  No, divine intervention does not always have positive outcomes. While many stories of divine intervention involve miraculous healings or incredible rescues, there are also stories of tragedy and loss. For example, the death of a loved one may be seen as an example of divine intervention, even if it is a painful and difficult experience.  What is the purpose of divine intervention?  The purpose of divine intervention is to demonstrate the power and presence of a higher power. Divine intervention is often seen as a sign of the compassion, grace, and mercy of God. It can also be used to teach important lessons, inspire faith and hope, and provide comfort in times of trouble.  Is divine intervention predictable or controllable?  No, divine intervention is not predictable or controllable. While people may pray or ask for divine intervention, it is ultimately up to the higher power to decide whether or not to intervene. The timing, manner, and outcomes of divine intervention are all unknown and unpredictable.  How can one recognize divine intervention?  Recognizing divine intervention can be difficult, as it is often mysterious and unexplainable. However, some signs of divine intervention may include unexpected outcomes, unusual or miraculous events, and a sense of peace, comfort, or direction.  It is important to keep an open mind and look for signs of divine intervention in unexpected places. It can also be helpful to pray or meditate, asking for guidance and direction.  Is there a difference between divine intervention and coincidence?  Yes, there is a difference between divine intervention and coincidence. While both may involve unexpected or unlikely outcomes, divine intervention is seen as the result of a higher power intervening in the natural world, while coincidence is a chance event that occurs without any apparent cause or purpose.  Determining whether an event is the result of divine intervention or coincidence can be difficult, but taking into account one’s spiritual beliefs and experiences can be helpful.  How can one experience divine intervention?  Experiencing divine intervention can be a powerful and life-changing event. While there is no guaranteed way to have a divine intervention happen, some suggested ways include prayer, meditation, attending religious services, reading scripture, and being open to spiritual experiences.  It is important to note that divine intervention is not something that can be forced or controlled, and individuals may have different experiences and interpretations of what constitutes a divine intervention.  What is the impact of divine intervention on people’s lives?  The impact of divine intervention on people’s lives can be profound. For some, it can be a source of comfort and healing, providing hope and direction in difficult times. For others, it may be a wake-up call or a turning point in their spiritual journey, leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their faith.  It is important to remember that the impact of divine intervention can be different for everyone, and that it is a deeply personal and spiritual experience.  Can divine intervention be a source of conflict or controversy?  Yes, divine intervention can be a source of conflict or controversy, especially when different interpretations or beliefs come into play. While some may see divine intervention as a universal and undeniable reality, others may dismiss it as superstition or wishful thinking.  Interpretations of divine intervention can also differ depending on cultural or religious traditions. For example, the miracles associated with saints in Catholicism may not be accepted in other Christian denominations.  What role does divine intervention play in healing?  Divine intervention can play a significant role in healing, especially when it is seen as a source of comfort, hope, and strength. Many people who have experienced illness or injury have turned to prayer or other religious practices as a way to cope and find meaning in their suffering.  In some cases, people have reported miraculous healings or recoveries that are attributed to divine intervention. While the medical community may have a different explanation for these events, they can still serve as a source of inspiration and comfort for people who are facing health challenges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZ2J0aW1lcy5jb20vd2hhdC1hcmUtc29tZS11bmRlbmlhYmxlLWV4YW1wbGVzLW9mLWRpdmluZS1pbnRlcnZlbnRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-04-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:22:34","Today marks the day when, six years ago, my life changed forever as I was diagnosed with blood cancer. That night I experienced the first of many sleepless, tearful nights. Or was the day that changed my life the 28 April 2017 – the day I got sick, was admitted to hospital, and remained severely unwell with pneumonia for several weeks?  Both dates are forever etched in my mind. The gap between them feels so long as I go through spring each year and relive the experience of those 22 days.  Today, as I mark this sixth anniversary, I realize that I have changed a lot over the years, despite many serious mistakes along the way. This journey has presented me with challenges I could never have imagined, forcing me to confront realities about my own health and mortality. I have grown in my character and become more resilient.  Navigating the physical and emotional tumult of chronic illness hasn’t been easy, but it’s shaped me into a person I could not have become otherwise. Each setback, every moment of despair, has been a step on the path to finding strength in vulnerability. I know that there have been times along the way when I have not been very easy to live with which has itself caused me great sorrow and deep regret.  I don’t want this article to increase anyone’s anxiety, however. My journey with blood cancer has been much more traumatic than many others will experience, especially with the chronic slow growing ones (though I do also understand some have more aggressive cancers than mine turned out to be. But as you read on remember that I am happy to be alive. Happy to have gone through treatment and to know my cancer is in remission. Happy to be about to marry. Happy to have lovely kids and other family and friends. I have been unfortunate in getting certain unusual problems that most people do not get. My intent is not to bring more anxiety to anyone. But rather to show that hope is there however our journeys turn out.  Many wirh CLL and other cheonic blood cancers will have very slow growing disease that might never need treatment. Not all are that lucky. But treatments are really good at saving our lives and pushing the cancer back into remission. It’s not the end of the world if you do need treatment and as I say despite being an outlier in terms of the effects of thst on my body I am so thankful to be alive (and bear in mind I had chemo which most people do not have to have with CLL today).  I’ve learned that optimism is not about denying reality but about acknowledging the severity of your battles whilst choosing to find light in the darkest moments. The importance of a robust support system has become abundantly clear— in the form of understanding doctors, professional counsellors, as well as compassionate family and friends. Most crucially, I’ve come to understand more deeply that caring for mental health is as crucial as looking after physical health.  I am incredibly grateful for all the support I’ve received over these years. My doctors, nurses and physios, for their medical expertise and compassion; my family and friends, for standing by me; and to, my online community, where I have forged new friendships and learnt so much. I could not have done this journey alone, even though at times it has felt very lonely. Somehow in the dark moments it can feel as though everyone has abandoned you, even when they haven’t.  Please do not make the mistake of thinking none of this is relevant for you because, so far, you may not have experienced significant suffering. I am sorry to report that suffering will come your way eventually. It comes to all of us eventually. We cannot escape this world without going through it. As Keller said  “No matter what precautions we take, no matter how well we have put together a good life, no matter how hard we have worked to be healthy, wealthy, comfortable with friends and family, and successful with our career — something will inevitably ruin it.” (Tim Keller)  So please prepare for what will one day come your way  For those of you embarking on a similar journey, know this: you are stronger than you realize. The journey may be fraught with challenges, but it will also be filled with moments of strength, courage, and resilience you never knew you possessed. My insights drawn from these six years of personal experience are a testament to the fact that, while chronic illness may change your life, it doesn’t have to define it.  Sometimes in previous years I have marked the way my life has changed by posting on the 28 April, other years I write on the 20 May.  On the 26th April this year I got engaged just a few days after catching COVID19 so I am sure you understand why I had other things on my mind! In fact, I announced my engagement on Facebook two days later, which seemed like an appropriate way to mark the anniversary of my sickness in a positive way:  “I’m excited to announce that I am engaged to Adele Robinson and we will be getting married THIS JULY! Thankful for this new phase of my life which I’m announcing exactly six years after I became unwell. Please pray for us as we plan our wedding rapidly and start our lives together.”  We will get married on 1 July so are in a bit of a whirlwind right now! You can read more about my COVID experience and the engagement here:  Every year up to 2022, the intervening period between April 28 and May 20 was a difficult, emotional period as I relieved the anguish of spring 2017 and reflected on what I have lost since.  However, last year something different happened. On the 27th Apri, I was exploring Highwoods Country Park and something about the beauty of the bluebells springing up after the cold and dark of winter spoke to me of hope. I discovered the charm of bluebells and realised that they always appear around the very same dates that I remember my sickness sucking the hope out of me. They bring a burst of colour to a dull time. Here is a picture I took that day, I think I identified with the dead, fallen tree trunk! Beauty out of ashes.  I stayed up unusually late for me that night (even going in to the 28th!) I was with a new friend and told them my story. They said that it sounded like I was no longer desolate. Hearing that led to a real shift in my attitude. I did still think about my journey during the following 22 days, but the difference was that I had genuine hope.  As I wrote last year:  “My testimony as a Christian is not that knowing Jesus has removed my fear, loneliness and despair. But rather that the hope he gives has not entirely disappeared. Even though there have been many times when I have been at my most desolate, and been tested far beyond what I could cope with so that I “despaired even of life itself“. There have been many sleepless nights where my pillows are wet with tears; but whenever my faith has felt like a smouldering candle about to go out, Jesus gently breathes on that flame to keep my hope alive . . . although things have been really tough emotionally just recently, I am also once again seeing a bit more hope than I have for a while in the middle of all the pain. On these anniversary days I have always felt completely desolate in previous years, instead today I am actually daring to hope that just maybe when I write my six year anniversary article I will be able to report that this next year I am about to enter has been better than the last five . . .” READ THE REST  I dared to believe a year ago that the following words are true:  For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” Jeremiah 29:11, NLT  Despite this verse’s promise of a hopeful future, I have found it challenging at times to truly accept this, especially in the face of a cancer diagnosis. Living with cancer is like having an ominous presence constantly trailing behind you with a gun to your head, a chilling reminder of life’s fragility. However, amidst the fear and despair, hope has been a steadfast companion, often ignited by my faith in Jesus.  Cancer is not just about the physical disease. It’s about the emotional turbulence, the constant oscillation between hope and despair. Yes, there have been moments of intense loneliness and desolation, nights drenched in tears, moments when life seemed too much to bear. Yet, whenever my faith flickered, hope, like a gentle breeze, kept the flame alive. And that verse with its promise of a brighter tomorrow was becoming precious to me a year ago.  This was despite feeling that my life was like a disaster movie or a soap opera. And despite the many times I had asked God why he seemed to have stopped answering my prayers. I was facing some major challenges in my personal life a year ago that were only indirectly related to my sickness. I was desperate for a fresh start in every area of my life. And somehow, I dared to begin to believe that maybe, just maybe, some good things might start happening for me again.  As April drew to a close last year, I was exploring the possibility of moving to Colchester. I’d had a bungalow in mind for months but had not been able to put an offer on it. It was next to Highwoods Country park and had been on the market for a long time. I had been convinced that God was keeping it for me whilst I was unable to put my old house on the market. When it finally went on the market at the end of April my house sold very quickly. However, I was shocked to hear that the bungalow was now finally under offer to someone else. I was still so sure I wanted it that I even tried to gazump them!  On 4th May 2022, I heard that the seller was not interested in letting their buyers down. I felt really fed up, and all the hope of just a few days before seemed to evaporate. I called my new friend, and they were quite worried about how flat I seemed. They insisted on coming round that evening to cook for me.  But before they got there something remarkable happened. I somehow came up with the idea of looking for a house that I could put a wet room in downstairs, as using stairs is hard and at times unsafe for me. I hadn’t considered this before for some reason. This new approach would create what I later described as a bungalow with a guest house on top.  I looked online, found a suitable house very quickly with a floor plan that looked very suitable. It was also very close to the bungalow I had been interested in and the road has its own entrance to the forest. I didn’t realise this until checking the location of the photo today, but the bluebells photo I shared earlier was taken on the forest track which leads directly to what is now my new home!  God that day begun a process of directing me into restoring my life in many different aspects. His hand has been all over directing me in many significant ways in several areas. Moments after I had put in a call to the estate agent to see the house that had caught my eye, I had a call from some Christian acquaintances who said that I was actually coming to see their house! Throughout the sale process they have been amazing and have become some of my dearest friends. I named their house “The Haven” and have already written about what it meant to me to gain a new home as a foundation for my new life:  At times this last year has been also very difficult with many challenges both in my health and in my personal life. But I do think it has been a much better year than the previous five, not least because I have spent the last nine months of it getting to know my lovely fiancée.  I have had two hospital admissions in the last year, during one of which I was told a scan revealed evidence of a small stroke (lacunar infarction). Obviously catching COVID was also initially scary, given the hugely increased risk of serious complications due to my impaired immune system. In fact I did much better than expected, thanks to medication I quickly got better which felt like a miracle.  I continue to have significant impairment to my life because of the symptoms I experience daily. These symptoms are mostly due to what is likely a complication from my poor immune system: autonomic instability, also known as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). This is a complex condition affecting the nervous system, causing a large range of troubling symptoms which stop me doing a lot of things.  Immune deficiency also adds an extra layer of complexity to life as I must weigh up the risks and benefits of every single social interaction or outing. I can’t live in a bubble as that is no life. But I also can’t afford to be careless about the risk of catching infections, especially in the winter months. It took me 18 months to get over a simple common cold once and infections have led to several hospital admissions over the years.  No doubt in the years to come my health will continue to be an issue. But as I mark the anniversary of my diagnosis this year, my heart is full of gratitude. The biggest difference is that I now look at the future with renewed confidence and hope, and thankful for the friends and family that I have around me, many of whom will be at our wedding.  But more than all that, having a hope in Jesus makes all the difference. Ultimately this world is not my home, I am just passing through and my faith in an eternity with Jesus is what keeps me going through the darkest times.  Throughout this journey, I have tried to share with you my honest reflections on how cancer has affected my relationship with God, and all aspects of my life.  I have written about topics such as suffering, hope, faith, prayer, gratitude, joy, peace, love, grace, resurrection, healing, and eternity. I have shared practical tips on how to cope with cancer emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually, especially over on bloodcanceruncensored.com.  I have drawn inspiration from the Bible, Christian books, music, podcasts, and testimonies and have found great support from various sources such as church, online groups, charities, counsellors, and doctors. Don’t try and face your own suffering journey alone.  As I move forward, I promise to keep sharing my experiences, the good and the bad, the heart-warming and the heart-breaking. I believe that our stories have power. They connect us, inspire us, and help us feel a little less alone in our struggles.  My story so far  April 28 2017  One normal day I was travelling home from my office on the underground. As I stepped off a train, my legs suddenly buckled under me and I couldn’t keep walking. I became very breathless, and my smart watch showed a fast pulse. I also felt my brain become fuzzy, like cotton wool.  I was taken to hospital via ambulance, having had a sudden onset of these symptoms and waiting on the tube platform for over an hour. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, sent home with antibiotic tablets and told to come back to A&E if I didn’t quickly feel better.  Two days later, I was lying in a hospital bed in a different hospital as an inpatient when I received a telephone call from a doctor at the first hospital who told me I almost certainly had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). I had no emotional support available to me at this time.  Unfortunately, for two weeks the local NHS haematologist wouldn’t see me, even though my other doctors were concerned my pneumonia wasn’t getting better like it should be. I had to go to a private doctor to get the diagnosis confirmed, even though by then I was attending the NHS hospital every day for IV antibiotics.  20 May 2017  I remember not so much the numb feeling I had when the consultant confirmed what others had already suspected for some weeks, but rather the sense of desperation as I spent a completely sleepless night crying completely alone downstairs in my lounge, not wanting to wake the family. It would not be the last such sleepless night of tears. That day my world came crashing to an abrupt halt. It has never fully restarted.  But I also remember the nurse who was running the helpline I rang in the middle of that night. I had not been offered the chance to speak with a blood cancer nurse for all those weeks. And in my sense of utter emotional crisis I had the cheek to ring an emergency helpline run for patients of the largest European blood cancer centre, UCLH. Even though I was not a patient there, I remember thinking “Well it doesn’t actually say it is only for their patients!”  The humanity and kindness of that nurse talked me down from the emotional precipice I was on. He seemed concerned on hearing how my infection just wasn’t going away, and surprised by the choice of relatively weak antibiotics I was still on. I was at that point visiting my local hospital daily, having been sent home from the wards even though my infection was far from cured.  Nobody there seemed to understand that I was already immune compromised and so needed stronger treatments. I explained to the nurse that I was needing a wheelchair to get around at the hospital and was barely able to walk to and from the toilet at home. He suggested I may want to try and get an urgent referral to their hospital.  Within three days I had done just that by speaking to my GP, and the same day the referral was faxed I was admitted to UCLH severely unwell and beginning to go into sepsis. They treated me with much stronger antibiotics and I gradually improved. That nurse saved my life. I am forever grateful for him, and for all the many other skilled and compassionate health care professionals I have encountered along the way. But physically I never fully recovered, and this was just the beginning of my health journey. Years later the doctors said it was at this point that my nervous system was damaged leading to autonomic instability and never again being able to stand still for more than a few seconds at a time.  READ MORE  Year One  A year into my journey with chronic illness, I publicly disclosed for the first time that I had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a slow-growing form of blood cancer.  Those initial twelve months were fraught with difficulties, not only for me but also for my family. It was a year of struggle, of grappling with my weakness, and acknowledging my human frailty. I watched every area of my life implode. Yet, it was also a time of immense gratitude. Despite the trials, I recognized that there were others facing even more challenging circumstances.  It’s a common belief among some Christians that service to God guarantees protection from all harm. My experience, however, has taught me that life doesn’t always work out that way.  I entered a phase of ‘watch and wait’ where I had to monitor my blood counts and symptoms without any active treatment. I suffered from multiple infections, hospital admissions, and operations to remove the cancer from my throat. I continued to experience severe fatigue and had to stop working.  I experienced shock, denial, and subsequent acceptance. I had to confront the reality of having a chronic illness and face the changes it would inevitably bring. I remember the emotions swirling around me, primarily fear, confusion, and anxiety, as I grappled with what lay ahead. I decided to write about and share my experiences, hoping to find solace and community in shared experiences.  Read the rest of my 1st Anniversary and coming out post :  Year Two  I found myself so distressed around the second anniversary of my sickness and diagnosis that I couldn’t even articulate my feelings in writing. That year was dominated by my chemotherapy, a journey I mostly weathered in blog silence, even spending a month in the hospital.  I started chemotherapy in October 2018 after my blood cancer cells started to double in number every three months. I had six cycles of FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) which at the time was considered a gold standard treatment for CLL. I tolerated the treatment relatively well, though did have to spend a month in hospital after the first course! I achieved a complete remission but have been warned the cancer will almost certainly come back at some point due to the aggressive markers I had. The doctors do believe they will be able to treat it successfully again, however, and many newer treatments are in the pipeline.  During this period, I began to publicly share some of my experiences and reflections. I published a long article focused on the poignant biblical verse: “Jesus wept.” Years later, I shared an edited version of my chemotherapy diary which gives all the gory details of my treatment journey  I also launched the ‘Hope in Suffering‘ blog series during this time, sharing insights I gleaned from Tim Keller’s book about walking through difficulties with God. The series integrates numerous quotations from Keller’s work and my own reflections on suffering. Dr Keller has now died from his own cancer, and the insights I have gained from him remain precious to me.  Year Three  I was pretty grim and honest about where I was at on the third anniversary:  “Blood Cancer has been like a tsunami in my life ever looking for new ways to try and kill or destroy me, my dreams, my career, my hobbies, my charity work, my writing, my ability to watch TV at one point, and yes even all my relationships if it could. I have been grumpy at times, distracted, detached from the goings on of normal life. And so I have had to learn how to manage my emotions. Which sounds so civilised but sometimes is about as easy and apparently impossible as herding cats. . . ..” READ THE REST  Year Four  On the fourth anniversary, I wrote about the profound emotions I had felt. Despite the deep gratitude I felt for being alive, a sentiment shared by many blood cancer patients, the anniversary was also steeped in sorrow.  The diagnosis of blood cancer often precipitates a grieving process. We mourn the loss of a sense of invincibility and grapple with our own mortality, inevitably asking ourselves, “How long will I live?”  Suddenly, we no longer take a long, healthy life for granted. This awareness of our mortality can be chilling and emotionally burdensome, yet it can also be challenging to share with others. Coupled with the fear of death, it can lead to a crushing sense of isolation.  I explained that I’ve had many moments where I have experienced “Elijah syndrome,” named after the biblical prophet who despaired, felt utterly alone, and wished for death (1 Kings 19). The pressure to maintain a positive demeanor, whether self-imposed or influenced by others, can often be counterproductive. I’ve realized that while we should not allow our emotions to dominate us, we also must not suppress or ignore them. See “The Tyranny of the positive“  Facing chronic illness has taught me the delicate balance between embracing despair without getting consumed by it and cherishing hope without falling into the trap of false optimism. It’s essential to recognize the difference between genuine hope and the tyranny of forced positivity, as they exist in stark contrast. Life is not about always being cheerful or bending reality to our will through faith or positive thinking. That’s not hope; that’s a distortion of reality.  I explained that throughout the journey till that year I’d yearned for normalcy: to return to work, to go for long walks in a forest, a city, or at an amusement park. It was only in that 4thyear that I came to accept the unlikelihood of returning to anything resembling “normality,”. I must clarify that many blood cancer patients are less impacted in their daily activities than I’ve been, and some can continue to work and walk throughout their cancer journeys.  However, don’t be deceived. Regardless of how well a cancer survivor may appear to you, regardless of how much they seem to have regained their “normal life”, regardless of how far they can walk or how many hours they can work, the experience leaves its indelible mark. Even amid the silver linings of the cancer journey, the battle scars run deep, altering our perception of life forever. Just as one never truly “gets over” the death of a loved one, the loss of our sense of health, wellbeing, and invincibility will not go unmourned or forgotten.  READ THE REST  Year Five  As I explained earlier in this article, that year was exceptionally challenging emotionally—a year of desolation and great loss at times. But amidst all that, I started seeing glimmers of hope once again especially at the end of the year. I began to dare to hope and to hope that the following year would be better. You can read more about that in the post I wrote a year ago:  Year Six  I am glad to be able to report that optimism was not misplaced! Year six has definitely been the best year since my diagnosis by far, as I wrote about earlier in what has become a rather long article! I am genuinely looking forward to my seventh year post diagnosis. I wonder what is in store for me this year?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdGhlb3MuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2Fkcmlhbndhcm5vY2svMjAyMy8wNS9zaXgteWVhcnMtb24tbGlmZS1hZnRlci1hLWNhbmNlci1kaWFnbm9zaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"religious miracle","2023-11-12","Not Discerned","{""Lagos"", ""Lagos"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-21T00:06:24","Sadly, several of the comments left the issue of the interview to probe or suggest motives, inferred from my response on “investment” that I am opposed to Peter Obi’s ambition and therefore committed a “crime” for which the punishment is internecine abuse and harassment even to my family. “Some people even suggest that the gunmen who went to attack a checkpoint at my hometown on Saturday12th November but were gunned down was part of the mob reaction” – Anambra state governor, Charles Soludo  It will be nice if, in view of the above, the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) will please stop these ruffians – with ‘crab mentality’ – from coming to the court lest Obidients, IPOB and sundry Unknown Gun Men turn the place to a killing field.  Peter Obi, his Obidients and their sundry associates have, since INEC declared Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu winner of the February 25, 2023 Presidential elections, shouted themselves hoarse over what they like to call a ‘stolen mandate’. Readers of this column will remember that I have long ago written on these pages that Peter Obi, the Labour party presidential candidate who would later place a distant third in the elections – behind the winner and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the PDP – had no path, whatsoever, to victory. I had equally written that there was no way he was going to secure 25 per cent of votes in more than 16 states. My third prediction, cognizant of the fact that he would, as is the practice in the Southeast, be credited with a minimum of between 85 – 99 per cent of votes there, was that it would still be of no moment in his illusory hope of winning the election because the entire voting population in the entire 5 Southeast states would, at best, equal that of one single state in the NorthWest or the Northeast where he is almost practically an unknown.  And it happened!  But give it to him – thanks to his Christian brethren and Igbo ubiquity – he ended up scoring the millions I had imagined were far beyond his ken.  But even that could only place him two million plus votes behind the winner, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  They have since made all manner of claims as to how Obi’s votes were under- reported and credited to the APC.  Read Also: JUST IN: Labour Party factions clash after tribunal proceedings  Nigerians have since asked that they place that before the tribunal, complete with a tabulation of the votes he scored in the 36 states and the FCT.  It is fascinating that one of the States where Obi claims that this happened is Lagos state. On the contrary, however, what is in the public space, sourced from the blog of somebody who is unlikely to be anti – Labour party, and which shows that Obi did not win Lagos state, is as follows:  In my article: ‘The Peter Obi Revolution That Atrophied Midway’, 26 March, 2023, I wrote: “Talking about a miracle reminds me of an interesting WhatsApp post I saw during the giddy days of a supposed Labour party victory in Lagos.  It reads as follows: “LindaIkejiblog Official INEC Result for Amuwo Odofin LGA in the Presidential election”.  Whoever shared it commented as follows:“Amuwo Odofin!!!  Please check the number of Regisrered Voters – 322,600 and the number of Accredited Voters 57, 530.  Add Obi’s 55, 547 to Tinubu’s 13, 318! Don’t even bother with the rest! We are beginning to see how Obi “won” Lagos”.  But I bothered with the rest. I did the additions of all party votes, and the following is what I got:  “Total number of registered voters – 322.600.  “Total number of accredited voters – 57,530.  Votes:  APC – 13, 318  PDP – 2, 383  LP – 55, 547  Others – 1, 161  Total votes cast – 72, 409  Reg. voters -57,530  Over voting 14879″.  What does the Election Tribunal do in cases of over voting? It automatically cancels the election.  Therefore, if you take away LP’s 55,547 votes from its overall tally in Lagos, it becomes obvious that Labour did not win in Lagos.  The Amuwo Odofin incident must have been repeated elsewhere in the state.  But how hollow Labour party really is showed up in the subsequent elections when, the youths, the bishops and the pastors, have abandoned the sinking Titanic.  In the Southeast where Obi had high 80’s & 90’s in the Presidential election, 4 out of the 5 states completely deserted him just as he woefully lost to APGA in Anambra where he was governor for 8 years.  Now we hear he is raising issues on Rivers and Imo state results.  The respondent’s lawyers should equally ask questions, not only on the entire Lagos state election, but on all Southeast states because that is an area where election officials, native to the region, were literally all held captive by the illusion of helping to produce a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction even when their politics remains completely insular.  So from where did Obi secure his much lamented mandate?  In the Christian areas where he weaponised religion, working in cahoots with the likes of Babachir Lawal, the votes he got were soon ‘eaten’ up and subsumed by the huge figures the APC recorded in the NorthWest and the North central.  The election results for Labour and APC are summarised below: LABOUR PARTY.  President- 0  Senate – 7 seats.  House of Reps -34.  Governor- 1  State Assembly seats- 38.  Grand Total labour-80.  APC  President- 1.  Senate- 62.  HOR- 177.  Governors Elect- 16.  States Assembly-534.  Grand Total APC- 790  If Labour party could secure victory in only 7 senatorial districts, out of 109, in an election that took place, same day and same time, where was Obi’s victory in the Presidential election expected to come from?  Can he put something on nothing?  Or are they so logic challenged?  It is this logical reasoning, which is not common among Obidients, that led one of them, in a WhatsApp post, to ask Peter Obi why, rather than provide figure showing how he won the election, all he put across to the election tribunal are how the President – Elect emerged candidate of APC, and why he was declared elected when he did not score 25 per cent of Abuja votes. Funny enough, not even the five who recently filed a case at an Abuja High court against the President – Elect being sworn in, for not scoring 25 per cent of Abuja votes, even though lawyers, or have lawyers representing them, knew that apart from the Abuja issue already being before the election tribunal, there is a subsisting court decision to the effect that Abuja is the equivalent of any other Nigerian state and, therefore, has no such superior status as is being arrogated to it.  So I ask Obidients: Quo vadis?  While this question goes, primarily, to Obidients, it also applies to Ndigbo in general. I am darn too small to attempt answering a question directed at such an unarguably brilliant, sagacious and enterprising Igbo race.  Let us, therefore, press into service, a very educated and patriotic Igbo gentleman to help us.  I refer here to former Enugu state governor Chimaroke Nnamani who has spared considerable time thinking through the problem with contemporary Igbo, as he attempts to offer a way out of the Igbo conundrum.  Below are some of his views in an interview captioned “Reflect On (the) Looming Reality of Tinubu’s Presidency” which I enjoin interested persons to Google.  Said the senator:“The fact that a government can be formed with virtually zero input from Igbo land saddens me. It means that the Igbo leadership has failed. The wrong people have led us; jobbers and mediocres have led us. When you get to the table, jobbers and mediocres negotiate for us because the Igbo man appears to be intimidated by intellect.  We were in total control – the army, the police, external affairs, banking industry, the economic sector; name it. Ndigbo were number one in this country, today it is arguable whether we are three or four. Remember we were in control, University of Lagos, University of Ibadan, University of Nigeria, but we lost everything. Others have done everything possible to displace Igbo intelligentsia, so that those who argue for us are not intellectually equipped. Those who have no certificate were talking for us. The Igbo first eleven never showed up in the past sixteen years in this country. It was a gradual emasculation of the Igbo man. So traders or political frauds, fronting for people outside Igbo land are those we now associate with speaking for Igbo. The mediocres had no political ideology as they move from one party to the other. Privateers, people looking for one tariff or another, one contract or another; they became the Igbo elite. False elite, planted by outsiders. Igbo man now has to seek acclamation from outside Igbo land”.  And so on and so forth.  And for the solution, he says: “We need to have Igbo citizens’ conference! Who can facilitate such a meeting? Chekwas Okorie can do it. Ogbonnaya Onu can do it. We have to enter into the sanctum of power. Whether it is UPP, PDP or PDC, we have to find a way and gradually walk ourselves back to the centre of Nigerian politics. What are the criteria for attendance?  Merit and intellectual content of a man, brain is power. You can solve problems with brain, man is not just a mass of flesh; it is intellect. We want to send our best; not the confirmed mediocres. Mediocres that pander to the whims and caprices of non-Igbo; who seek acclamation in Abuja, carrying Ghana-must-go bags there, and come back to become leaders”.  But will the Obidients who think they already have an Igbo messiah in Peter Obi listen to this voice of reason? Beyond that, what of the infernal fear of the different killing groups who predominate Igbo land and who all seem to rally round Obi in the mistaken view that he is the messiah? To say anything contrary to the dominant view in the region about the election is to earn a death sentence. So in a thousand years these people will, surely, still be chorusing ‘Tinubu must not be sworn in’.

"religious miracle","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T06:10:13","5 ( 1 )  Whenever it comes to the right kind of marriage, opinions get distributed, there never seems to be an unanimity. However, the new generation, seems to have found the perfect compromise and is now talking of love-arranged and arranged-love marriages, as a carriage to the NX!  In this article I’ve discussed the changing face of marriage in India, tracing the evolutionary phase of the present day marriage. Right back from the generation for whom there was no option other than to marry the partner chosen by their parents; it goes right up to the present enlightened generation. Learning from their parents, this generation has recognized the wisdom of allowing their parents to fix their marriages for them. Between these two was the era of rebellion, when youngsters embarked on love marriages merely to prove a point.  I’ve seen as many successful ‘arranged’ marriages as ‘love’ marriages. This is, of course, a peculiarly Indian description that amuses the rest of the world. But hang on! Umm…I see ‘arranged’ or ‘semi-arranged’, i.e., ‘love’ marriages gaining importance even in the West. Perhaps people have got to know the reality that there are no real guarantees, no safety nets either way; you can consult the most revered astrologer, talk to the family poojaree, match horoscopes for all the gunas endorsed by the shastras, but if a marriage has to collapse, it will and for a marriage driver by emotion, which we so cutely call a ‘love’ marriage either. It’s a fifty-fifty chance, whichever option one takes. One has to maintain his lifeline all by himself, like how a player has to protect his lifeline in the game of Players’ Unknown Battle Grounds(PUBG). Young people have discerned this, perhaps with all the visions and missions. A lot of kids today are entrusting this all-important decision to their folks-parents, relatives and true friends. Of course the new ‘arrangement’ is more open-ended and better structured, for the old ‘rules’, which prescribed the ghastly ‘Dekho’ session seems null and void. The social meetings orchestrated by intermediaries these days work in a more acceptable fashion.  Shobhaa De’s father recalls his first encounter with her mother with a wry smile, many score years later. He describes each stage as if it happened last week. How his eldest brother asked to see the ‘girl’ in broad daylight, and insisted on her displaying a bit of her ankles too! This was to make sure her mother was not lame, had no deformities in her lower limbs that a flowing nine-yard saree could successfully camouflage, and that she could walk unaided! The ‘broad daylight’ factor was to judge the exact shade of her complexion—naturally light-skinned or were the blemishes concealed by a concealer(a makeup product) from the on-lookers and/or caked with talcum powder!? Fortunately she was not asked to sing, dance or produce a culinary miracle to the discretion of misuse of freedom that was given to the guests!  Apart from this, their formal meeting, this uncle also surprised her mother’s family with an unscheduled visit, during which he demanded the ‘girl’ be produced in an ‘undisturbed’ or ‘as is’ condition what we call, without as much as running a comb through her hair(beware! Maybe the future bride is bald and wearing a wig!)  Once she passed his scrutiny, the talks progressed to the matching of horoscopes. Alas! The family priest declared the match entirely unsuitable, insisting there’s no hope for such an ill-starred couple. She understood he’s then ‘persuaded’ to reconfigure the astral positions with a few additional rupees thrown in for a fresh verdict. And bingo! The match was declared to be perfect after all. And so it was…not so was it!  She often asks her dad what he thinks are the basic factors that made his marriage a success. He always gives her the same reply: ‘character’ and ‘abiding love’. With these comes the rest of the attributable package. It helped, of course, that her dad flipped for her mother’s looks at first “glance”, not even sight! But what about her? Did she have a choice in the matter? He insists that she did and that nobody could have forced the spirited seventeen-year-old Shakunthala to marry a man she didn’t give a damn about!  What about fights? Differences? Tantrums? Of course their marriage had a fair share of these. But beyond occasional arguments and sulks, I don’t recall a day of sustained hostility and unpleasantness. If they’d problems, they settled them in privacy. It was, in many ways, a great marriage, full of caring, sharing and a great give and take. And above all, full of communication.  One need not chuck either communication or passion out of a modern-day arranged match. Of late while in America, she’d met several extremely bright American Desis. She confesses she was a little surprised when told that most of the young couples slaving away for their MBAs, were in fact, not the dating couples she imagined, who’d taken campus romance to the altar, but couples who had met as strangers through family intervention. In this day and age, these kids had taken the crucial seven steps round the holy fire, without so much as holding hands before the wedding night, forget about the epic Sangeet night! And here they were, some with young children, others still settling in their new lives as ‘young marrieds’, but nobody could possibly guess that they’d opted for a conventional ‘arranged’ marriage out of choice and not with any stereotypical assumptions as such. When she expressed her surprise, they drawled, ‘Aaw-no big deal…it has worked out just great!’ And so it seemed!  In Mumbai, too, more and more children of parents De knows are leaving it to mum and dad to look for the right alliance, without going on consulating it on their own. ‘My mum knows me better than I know myself’, a young man confessed, ‘I trust her judgement. My dad has seen the world, he has more experience. They know what’s good for me.’ And these are guys in these mid-thirties who’ve studied on foreign universities, dated a few girls, done the party circuit and yet, when it came to marriage, they were more than Happy to settle for a conventional, old fashioned match much like their grand parents !  It was De’s generation that perverted the system by rebelling against it that had perfectly worked well, for centuries. A lot of them paid the price for letting their impulsive hearts decide who their soulmates would be. No regrets ! Just that she fears they are blindly following the West and taking their cues from Hollywoods, just to prove to their parents how ‘liberated’ and ‘modern; they were. Their kids are smarter And more realistic, They have seen too many marriages collapse and they definitely don’t want repeat performances in their own lives, force-fed on romantic drive from countless movies, this is a generation that laughs at the old Mills & Boon version of marriage.. They ache for performance and stability. If an arranged match can provide both, they are not disinclined to considering it. Because the disinclination, previous shown, has turned hollow.  De’s own girls receive proposals from suitable boys, through well-meaning intermediaries. So far, nothing has clicked. But at least, the girls are not mocking of the matter. ( The same thing follows for the boys, who shrug ‘whatever’, which translates to ‘It’s Alright’, without disapprovingly shrugging their shoulders at least ! ( like the author’s driver does in the ‘Two gentlemen of Verona) which is perhaps why she’s not wholly caught by surprise when she heard of those desi young married in the US.  They were refreshingly candid both by the look and by words, when talking about the methodical manner in which their parents had gone about the whole thing. The girls were all literates, attractive pres who looked happy enough as they adapted to an entirely alien culture with an entirely alien partner. So be it ! A great deal of crisis resolved !  We got to know each other only after the wedding. But it has worked out, they insisted. Some had had earlier relationships but claimed that fact did not colour their decision. They had made informed choices and expressed no regrets-uncoloured, untainted decisions !  On the other hand, she had also met alarmingly young divorcees ( some with crying babies), who had lamented the day, they’d said ‘I do’ to a boy-friend of long standing. ‘We thought we knew each other so well. We were used to each other’s ways too. God knows what went wrong after we got married. It reached a point where we could not stand the sight of one another’. Can happen. Does happen. Love…passion…desire..madness…where does everything vanish ? Nobody knows crazy, lunatic matters to be commented and lamented upon.  The worst thing about a love marriage that ends up on the rocks is that parents get all huffy and judgements.’ We told you it would not work. Did you listen ? We knew he wasn’t the right person. Now look where you are!’ Parents in such a plight do have a point. But they also need to rise above their own feeling of outrage and false pride and provide much needed empathy to a child who has made a mistake and is going through the hell-like pitfalls of love.  Love marriages may be more common now than they once were in our society, but that’s only because of increased mobility and access, that has, kind of, made us forget locomotions! Dating starts among teens. Couples might see each other for close to a decade before tying the Brahma knot. But even such marriage can collapse, much to the parents’ dismay. ‘After ten long years you people still didn’t know what you were doing! Ludicrous!’  Parents must avoid this harsh judgement trap even inside the already existing pit/ditch in which their child is, and extend a helping hand to an emotionally distressed offspring dealing with a broken marriage and much else. This is the time which can only be described as wretched. De knows the feeling for, she’s gone through it herself.  Your self-worth is at its lowest and you’ve never felt as desperately lonely. You also feel the entire world is sitting in judgement over what is a personal and painful decision. Friends take sides, cast aspersions, play the blame game. As for foes-they gloat and chortle with glee, at the expense of the loss of intimacy, while trading the ugliest rumours and their auxiliary-like flop theories as to why the whole thing collapsed.  If, at such a time, even your ‘immediate next’ family turns its back on you, then why call it family in the first place; in the honour of outsiders!? All it takes is a little sensitivity, love and patience. De keeps running into single parents trying hard to cope with a failed marriage, while presenting a tough facade; running out of joyful days of life. Having been there, she can identify with the emotion. No matter what anyone says, it isn’t easy; never was…never will be…Society is not known for its mercy. When the chips are down, you’ve just one person to fall back on—yourself!  Not every love match is similarly hopeless. There are enough and more marriages based on great romance. Marriages that have survived all attempts to ruin them. Couples who’ve battled tremendous, daunting odds to be together—religious problems, caste problems, class problems too. Yet, I fear the vulgarization of the entire love-marriage phenomenon.  At least some of the blame for this has to be shared by popular Hindi cinema. Love ke liye kuch bhi karega and similar sentiments. Almost everyday, our newspapers run headlines about lovers caught in some hedious situation—elopements to the altar gone awry, acid attacks on women who’ve turned down ardent suitors; kidnappings and rapes. All this in the name of ‘love’. It’s not just an urban problem. These ridiculous manifestations of ‘love’ can be discerned in rural India too! A direct spin-off of Bollywood potboilers I’m convinced.  Marry for love by all means but be realistic simultaneously. Marrying ‘above’ or ‘beneath’ your own level is an option only the stout-hearted should take…not the faint-hearted! Even in this day and age, a large part of India is still preoccupied with caste and class. Those who attempt to cross either or both, will necessarily be up against a great deal of resistance governed by the prejudices less breakable.  To have the guts to stand up for your beliefs and marry the person you house in your mind, despite the dismay and sigh, is a challenge. If, on the other hand, you’re lucky enough to flip for someone you can happily take home to mum, go for it. There’s no better reason to give up your independence than to be with a person you love and who loves you. But love solely is no guarantee.  At the end of the day, it’s back to the C-word: Commitment. A couple in an ‘arranged’ match can fall in love later and make a success of their marriage. But someone opting for love cannot then look for the rewards of an arranged alliance.  Love is meant to overcome all odds and embrace any complication. Nothing quite as unrealistic or lofty is expected from a more conventional approach. Which is why, the next time someone rolls up flashing the right credentials and with serious intent, I shall swiftly arrange a Dekho session at Mumbai’s all-time favourite ‘Dekho’ venue—the old-fashioned ‘Sea-Lounge’ at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Imagine me as a ‘proper’ mother-in-law! You can’t? Too bad! I can!

"religious miracle","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T11:04:12","The next presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey are scheduled for May 14, 2023. The voting will take place amid a challenging socioeconomic environment, aggravated by the aftermath of February’s natural disasters. Deadlines for a number of promising projects have been pushed back, and the country has proved unprepared for the problems it is now facing. The ruling coalition’s hopes for a convincing victory often seem dubious, with the struggle for power accompanied by fierce disputes over how to resolve the current problems and proceed with political and economic development. Meanwhile, old and forgotten cards are being played along with new ones as external interference in national affairs has become more frequent. It is difficult to say unequivocally what the outcome of this complicated electoral process might be. We shall try to identify the most likely scenarios of the political dynamics as well as the outcome of the upcoming elections, which, according to many experts, promise to be the most competitive in the entire history of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) rule.  Today, power in Turkey is held by the People’s Alliance (“Cumhur İttifakı”) coalition led, in fact, by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The coalition consists of the AKP, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Great Unity Party (BBP) and the New Welfare Party (YRP). The need to form this coalition is fostered by the risks of repeating the scenario of June 2015, when, in the absence of political allies, the ruling AKP lost its majority in parliament, despite winning the elections. This led to a political crisis in the country, as no government was formed and the vote had to be repeated in November of the same year. According to the Turkish constitution, to form a government alone, a party must secure more than half of the seats in parliament, which, under current conditions, is an unattainable goal for existing political parties. Thus, in the current political configuration, supporters of the ruling party expect to form a government in alliance with other conservative forces, while supporters of other parties in the ruling coalition intend to  In addition to the People’s Alliance, at least four other political blocs will participate in the elections. The main opposition coalition force is the Nation Alliance, the so-called Table of Six, consisting of the following parties: 1) Republican People’s Party (CHP), led by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, one of the favorites in the presidential race; 2) the Party of Humanity, Innovation and Goodness (Good Party), led by Meral Akşener; 3) the Felicity Party (PS) led by Temel Karamollaoğlu; 4) the Party of Democracy and Progress (PDP) led by Ali Babacan; 5) the Future Party (PB) led by Ahmet Davutoğlu; 6) the Democratic Party (DP) led by Gültekin Uysal.  The third coalition, also comprised of six parties, is known as the Alliance of Labor and Freedom. It includes the following political forces: 1) the pro-Kurdish Democratic People’s Party (HDP); 2) the Workers’ Party of Turkey (WPT); 3) the Labor Party (EMEP); 4) the Labourist Movement Party (EHP); 5) the Social Freedom Party (TӦP); and 6) the Party of Greens and the Left Future (YSGP).  Another coalition is called the Union of Socialist Forces. This political association consists of parties ideologically similar to those in the Alliance of Labor and Freedom, although united under much more radical political views, slogans and programs. The coalition includes the following parties: 1) the Left Party (ӦDP), 2) the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP), 3) the Communist Movement of Turkey (TKH), 4) the People’s United Revolutionary Movement or HBDH and 5) the Revolutionary Socialist Workers’ Party (DSİP).  Finally, the fifth coalition that managed to nominate its own single presidential candidate (Sinan Oğan) is the Ancestral Alliance (ATA İttifakı), consisting of the Victory Party (PP), the Justice Party (JP), My Country Party (MCP) and Turkey Alliance Party.  Thus, five political coalitions have been formed several weeks prior to the elections. Yet, not all parties of the Republic followed the path of coalition engagement, though this is an exception rather than the rule. One such party is the Homeland Party established and led by Muharrem İnce, who, running for president from the PPR in 2018, won just over 30% of the vote, while his main opponent, R.T. Erdoğan, received over 52% of the vote. In other words, we can say that the practice of coalition formation keeps on taking root in the political life of Turkey, as it becomes an integral part of both the current election and the electoral process as a whole.  The Table below gives the most graphical representation of the current balance of political forces in the Turkish parliament that has 600 seats.  Table 1: Distribution of Seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey  No. Party Name Leader Chairperson Position Number of seats Relation to coalition 1 Justice and Development Party (AKP) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Naci Bostancı Right-wing populism, conservative democracy 285 People’s Alliance 2 Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Centre-left social democracy, kemalism 134 Nation Alliance 3 Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) Mithat Sancar & Pervin Buldan Pervin Buldan Left-wing, radical democratic socialism 56 Labour and Freedom Alliance 4 Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) Devlet Bahçeli Devlet Bahçeli Far-right ultranationalism, idealism 48 People’s Alliance 5 Good Party (İYİ) Meral Akşener İsmail Tatlıoğlu Centre-right Turkish nationalism 36 Nation Alliance 6 Workers’ Party of Turkey (TİP) Erkan Baş – Far-left socialism, Marxism 4 Labour and Freedom Alliance 7 Democratic Party (DP) Gültekin Uysal – Centre-right Liberal conservatism 2 Nation Alliance 8 Homeland Party (MP) Muharrem İnce – Centre-left Kemalism, patriotism 2 – 9 Great Unity Party, BBP Mustafa Destici – Far-right Turkish Islamic synthesis 1 People’s Alliance 10 Democracy and Progress Party, DPP or DEVA Ali Babacan – Centre Liberal democracy 1 Nation Alliance 11 Democratic Regions Party, DBP Saliha Aydeniz & Keskin Bayındır – Left-wing Democratic socialism 1 – 12 Felicity Party (SP) Temel Karamollaoğlu – Far-right, political Islam, Millî Görüş 1 People’s Alliance 13 Innovation Party (YP) Öztürk Yılmaz – Centre-left, civic nationalism, patriotism 1 – 14 Victory Party (ZP) Öztürk Yılmaz – Centre-left, Turkish nationalism, anti-immigration party 1 Ancestral Alliance (ATA İttifakı) 15 Independents 4 – 16 Vacant 23  We would like to call your attention to another table, which highlights the current balance of political forces in the country. Thus, Table 2 shows the results of sociological surveys recently conducted in Turkey. The first column indicates the sociological companies which conducted the polls.  Table 2. The Results of Turkish Citizenry Political Preference Surveys (Average Numbers)  Average Results of the Latest Election Polls  Justice and Development Party (AKP) — 32.8%  Republican People’s Party (CHP) — 27.6%  Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) — 10.7%  Good Party (İYİ) — 10.5%  Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) — 6.5%  Homeland Party (MP) — 2.9%  Democracy and Progress Party, DPP or DEVA — 1.6%  Future Party (PB) — 1.6%  New Welfare Party (YRP) — 1.3%  Workers’ Party of Turkey (TİP) — 1.2%  Victory Party (ZP) — 1.1%  Felicity Party (SP) — 0.9%  Thus, according to the average results of the latest polls, the ruling coalition may garner about 41% of the votes, while the opposing coalition may reach just slightly over 45%. In other words, the balance of power in parliament may change in favor of the opposition bloc.  As for the position of Recep Erdogan himself, most experts believe that the incumbent President feels more confident than the ruling bloc. This state of things became especially clear after the political parties from the main opposition alliance decided on a single candidate, namely K. Kılıçdaroğlu. But how justified is such overconfidence?  Indeed, as per the results of opinion polls conducted by pro-government companies, Mr. Erdogan can get more than 50% of the votes already in the first round. Building on this, predictions speculate that the president will likely repeat the success of 2018. However, the results of opinion polls conducted by companies closely associated with opposition forces generally show that the main candidates will still have to contend in the second round to be held on May 28. Notably, the main favorite in the presidential race is Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu.  Proceeding from the above-mentioned data, one should admit that forecasts made on the basis of sociological surveys conducted by the opposition forces look more realistic. This state of affairs makes us turn to the current realities and come up with forecasts taking into account not only the results of the opinion polls, but also the current reality and the processes taking place in modern-day Turkey.  First of all, the diverse position of the opposition parties united in the Nation Alliance is what catches the eye. To understand the actual incapacity of the Nation Alliance, it would suffice to recall a series of last year’s fruitless meetings of the opposition Six, as well as the incident with Meral Akshener, when she actually left the six-party platform for a while, having stated that the alliance “has lost the ability to express the people’s will.” Indeed, this assessment is not an overstatement as the parties in the Nation Alliance are far from developing a unified and consistent political program, the main agenda of these opposition meetings revolving around two topics—the collective opposition to Erdogan and the proposal to strengthen the parliamentary system.  In other words, the coalition’s members do not share a political platform, with each promoting their own political agendas and cherishing their own plans for distribution of powers and authorities in a possible coalition government. So far, there is no reason to expect a compromise between the leaders of the main opposition parties on these key issues, which is alarming, because it could lead to another political crisis. This is the last thing Turkish voters want. Quite indicatively, more than half of those polled expressed doubts in the ability of the main opposition bloc to solve the country’s current economic problems, according to a survey conducted by the Metropoll agency.  Let us talk about the main advantages of Erdogan in the context of the current electoral process. First of all, the incumbent president is actively pursuing the idea of establishing Turkey as a major regional hub for logistics and energy as well as an international transport artery for food freights. The almost simultaneous launch of all these transit initiatives in 2023 can provide Turkey with a brilliant prospect, resulting in a viable way of replenishing the state treasury. Mr. Erdogan is already garnering certain political dividends from the practical implementation of these large-scale regional projects, and we have to admit that their monetization will not be long in coming. The Turkish leader is aware of that, making great effort to ensure that these initiatives start working at their full capacity within the set deadlines.  Second, the commissioning of some major infrastructure facilities is anticipated this year, including those in the industrial, energy and logistics sectors. It is planned to expand some of the already existing large-scale projects in both infrastructure and high technology (civil, military and dual-use), which were launched during the AKP rule, bringing them to a new quality level.  Third, the Turkish president seriously expects his monetary policy to start bearing fruit already by the end of this year. It should be mentioned that his insistence on restraining and even lowering the key rate of the central bank does not fit into the generally accepted laws of economic theory, according to which one of the ways to tackle inflation is the central bank raising the key interest rate. In other words, the usual course of action should look as follows: the central bank raises the rate, while banks adapt their interest rates on loans and deposits to match the Central Bank’s higher rate. As a result, loans become more expensive, and deposits—more profitable. Accordingly, the funds of the population are drawn to deposits, the money supply is compressed, which ultimately leads to a slowdown in inflation.  However, according to Mr. Erdogan, inflation could be reined using the opposite method, which is the reduction of the Central Bank’s interest rate. This should increase the availability of cheap money in the country, boosting the production of domestic goods and services, which are then exported in exchange for foreign currency. Foreign currency is sold on the domestic market, strengthening the Turkish lira exchange rate and slowing the rate of inflation. The government expects that there will be a slowdown in annual inflation to some 20% by the end of 2023. Accordingly, in the medium term, the growing trade surplus should strengthen the national currency, as is forecast by the government. Today, the refinancing rate of the Central Bank in Turkey is going down in the face of severe pressure, amounting to 8.5% (last year it stood at 14%). If this approach, based mainly on promoting the exports of goods and tourism, is successful, Mr. Erdogan might rest on the laurels as the “innovator economist,” which will automatically make him the main author of the Turkish model of economic development, as he displaces Turgut Ozal from this pedestal, who was the father of the “Turkish miracle” and initiator of socioeconomic reforms in Turkey in the late 20th century.  Critics of this economic policy warn that the growth-oriented policy pursued in the run-up to the elections is unstable and could cause a systemic economic crisis. In turn, Turkish voters do not share the optimism of the authorities, albeit seeing no real alternatives from the opposition either.  Today, about 42% of respondents approve of what Erdogan does as president. It should be noted that this is not a bad indicator in the current difficult economic situation, but it may not be enough for Erdogan’s coalition to win the upcoming elections. Perhaps, that was the reason why the Turkish authorities were going to launch military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Another successful operation, which could have resulted in a crushing blow to the plans of a “Syrian Kurdistan,” could have strengthened the position of Erdogan and his party on the eve of the upcoming elections. In the meantime, the Turkish media review shows that public opinion is now least concerned about a new Syrian front. Moreover, the military operation is seen mostly in the context of a possible influx of new refugees. Under such circumstances, the normalization of relations with Syria looks like a much better prospect.  The incumbent President has been pointing to Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s weakness and even incompetence in foreign policy as well as security matters in every way possible. After Mr. Erdogan was announced the official candidate of the People’s Alliance for president, he addressed 10 questions to the leader of the CHP, which cornered him, as he was confronted with a difficult dilemma. These questions remained unanswered, which gave the Turkish president grounds for stating that the opposition acts not in the best interests of the Turkish electorate but to promote the interests of external forces.  It is obvious that Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu turned out to be “the most convenient” presidential candidate for Mr. Erdogan in comparison with other possible contenders—the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara. Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavaş were once the favorites among the opposition, garnering the support of 60.4 percent and 50.7 percent of voters, respectively. But in the words of Kılıçdaroğlu, these surveys are now “irrelevant.”  Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu has led the CHP, the oldest Republican Party of Turkey, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, for 13 years. Under his leadership, Ataturk’s party has evolved from a nationalist and Kemalist party into a more progressive and leftist force. The party leader abandoned opposition to the hijab and tried to build bridges with other political movements, including Islamists and conservative democrats. He also managed to convince Turkey’s nationalistic Good Party and the pro-Kurdish HDP to support the same candidate in the 2018 mayoral elections, when the opposition defeated the ruling AKP in Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in nearly two decades.  Kılıçdaroğlu promised to send millions of Syrian refugees back home and to restore relations with Syrian President Bashar Assad as part of his election program. The CHP leader does not approve of Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems, believing it has caused a rift with Washington. He also stated that, if elected, he would review the Central Bank’s management and stop interfering in its policies. Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s position on the Kurdish question is not so clear-cut. This may be due to the disputes between the nationalist and social-democratic wings of the AKP over this issue. In 2013, the politician condemned the peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) as part of a plot to create a Great Kurdistan, and the party consistently supported military action against the group and its Kurdish-Syrian allies until recently. By 2021, however, Kılıçdaroğlu had changed his position, stating that the former co-chairman of the HDP, Selahattin Demirtaş, was “unjustly” put behind bars. In September 2021, he declared that the HDP was a “legitimate body” and called it a viable partner to “address the Kurdish question”.  * * *  Today, none of the main contenders for presidency in Turkey has a clear advantage. The electoral process is quite tense, while the arguments of the parties are multifaceted, spilling over from foreign policy into economic and domestic policy domains and vice versa. Supporters of political parties often resort to polarizing society in an attempt to strengthen their base.  An important feature of the current election race in Turkey has been a blatant interference of the U.S. in the process. Even before his election, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “We need to make it crystal clear that we support the opposition leaders and that we have a road map. We have to speak louder about what we think. Erdogan needs to be overthrown by way of elections. He was kicked out in Istanbul, and his party was kicked out as well.” Notably, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Jeffrey Flake held meetings with all representatives of the country’s main opposition political forces. The Turkish president openly accused him of an unprofessional approach.  Amidst the growing anti-American, anti-NATO and anti-Western sentiments in Turkey, fostering cooperation with Russia looks quite advantageous practically in all areas. As for this track, all the parties (both members of the ruling alliance and members of the opposition bloc) hold on to a similar position, generally speaking. Most likely, this has to do with a clear demand existing in the Turkish society. There is an understanding that Turkey is a player that is to a certain extent dependent on Russia—particularly, in economic, trade, energy, tourism and other domains. Turkey remembers very well that the entire tourism industry of the Republic was seriously impaired with the sharp decline in tourist flows from Russia in 2015-2016, with hundreds of hotels closed and resort areas suffering huge losses. The Russian market is extremely attractive for Turkey; this explains the fact that recently, with the departure of Western brands from Russia, the Turks have been actively building up their presence in almost all sectors. The country understands that Russia’s position largely determines the level of its presence in a number of regions, including Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, the Black Sea region, etc. Russia and Turkey interact effectively within the framework of international formats to negotiate settlements in Syria, Libya, Karabakh.  Turkey is seeking to play a mediating role in the Ukrainian crisis. Ankara sees this as an opportunity to strengthen its position in the international arena. As an initiator and mediator in implementing the new regional mechanism under the auspices of the UN, aimed at addressing issues related to global food security, Turkey gets an additional opportunity to assert itself as a responsible global player. This is a completely new perspective for the country, which followed from permanent contacts with Russia. Today, Ankara has become virtually the only player in the Collective West, who is capable of maintaining a normal dialogue with both Moscow and Kiev. Turkey has not joined the anti-Russian sanctions and currently enjoys Moscow’s trust. It is making the most of this privilege in its communication with Western countries by demanding certain concessions from them. Such diplomatic maneuvers have provided Turkey with important advantages that its other potential competitors on the issue of the Ukrainian settlement do not possess. In other words, the growing engagement with Russia can guarantee the incumbent Turkish government success, both domestically and internationally. This circumstance is certainly taken into account by both the incumbent authorities and the opposition forces. Thus, cooperation with Russia promises to be an important and constant topic of discussion in the Turkish presidential election race.

"religious miracle","2023-02-02","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:08:00","Winter’s longest month is almost over  Winter’s longest month now has only three days remaining. The month will soon be history followed by February, the shortest month of the year. Even though February is short it can be our snowiest month and perhaps our coldest month. As January comes down to its final days, the hyacinths, jonquils, and daffodils are preparing to produce spring flowers. Wild onions are showing up on the lawn and American violets now have heart-shaped leaves on them. Spring is over the horizon and 52 days away. There is still a batch of cold weather to deal with before and after spring arrives.  Groundhog day less than week away  The day is also known as candlemas in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Dutch have a custom of burning a candle all night as a signal that spring will be welcome. Spring is really the subject of Groundhog Day. If he sees his shadow that day we have six more weeks of winter. If he does not see his shadow, we still have six more weeks of winter. The groundhog is not much of a weather guru!  Getting rid of the creepy chickweed Grinch  The Grinch is green and ugly, and so is the chickweed that thrives during the winter months. It is green and ugly, but it is also easy to get rid of because it has shallow roots and practically grows only an inch or two beneath the soil. It is easy to pull up and throw out of the garden. Remove this pesky weed from the garden or rose bushes before it gets a head start. It is the easiest of weeds to get rid of.  We have gained a half hour of daylight  As the sunsets the wind-down of January, we will have gained a half hour of daylight since Dec. 21. It paves the way for a minute more of daylight each evening when the sunsets. We can continue to enjoy this increase every day until summer arrives and spring is a little more than 50 days away.  Preparing for the mowing season  The garden centers, hardwares, Home Depots, Walmart, Lowe’s Home Improvement and Ace Hardware already have lawn equipment displayed. If you need a new mower, now is the time to shop around for one and compare values. These shops have plenty of mowers waiting for you and you can choose the one that meets your needs. Check your sleeping mower during the last days of January. If your mower needs a tune-up, or some repair, now is the time to get your mower serviced. Most small engine repair shops are not as busy at this time of year. They will pick up your mower, service it, and return it to you for only a small fee. While it is being serviced, let them sharpen or replace the blade and check the battery and belts and get the mower ready for another season of dependable operation.  Making a butterscotch raw apple cake  Apples make great desserts in winter. This is a recipe that combines the caramel flavor of butterscotch with the tartness of raw apples and blended with chopped pecans for a wonderful winter treat. For this recipe, you will need one cup Crisco vegetable oil, two large eggs, two cups sugar, two and a half cups plain flour, three cups (seven or eight McIntosh or any tart apples), two three ounce boxes of Jello instant pudding, butterscotch flavor, one teaspoon pie spices, one teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon salt, one cup chopped pecans and one tablespoon vanilla flavoring. In a large bowl, add Crisco oil, eggs and sugar. In another bowl, mix plain flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and apple pie spices. Add to the sugar-oil mixture, and then add the chopped pecans. Peel the apples, cut into half inch cubes and run through the blender in “grate” mode and mix in a tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the apples to the mixture and the vanilla flavoring. Mix all the ingredients well. Spread the mixture into a 13x9x2 inch baking pan or dish sprayed with Pam baking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Cool the cake completely. Mix the Jello butterscotch instant pudding mix according to the instructions on the Jello boxes. Spread the pudding on top of the cake. This cake can be prepared a day before you want to serve it. Top with whipping cream, Dream Whip or Cool Whip if you desire.  Applying dormant oil spray to fruit trees  The fruit trees and grape vines will remain dormant for several more weeks and can still be pruned and trimmed for better production and appearance. On a calm day as January ends, spray the trees and grapevines with a coating of dormant oil spray to protect them from aphids and insects or diseases. A bottle of oil spray mixed with the proper amount of water will coat most of the trees and grapevines with a shiny coat of spray. The oil will protect the trees and vines and will help harvest to be protected from diseases and insect pests. The job needs to be done before the middle of February when buds start to form. On a calm day with no wind or rain in the forecast, the oil spray will stick to the limbs and the sun will dry it into the limbs.  A bit of February lore  We have a bit of cold weather lore to kick off the month. This lore says, “If February produces much snow, a fine summer it will bestow.” This is a positive thought to begin the shortest month of the year. Even though short, the month is capable of dumping quit a few inches of snow. Even though summer is quit a few months away, its always a good thought on these days before February begins.  Seventeen more days to shop for your Valentine  It is getting closer to the season of hearts, flowers, candy and love. The stores and shops are bursting with plenty of hearts, flowers and Valentine gifts. On the last cold days of January, you can warm your heart by searching for and shopping for Valentine gifts for friends, sweethearts, husbands, wives, children and grand-children. No matter whether you purchase gifts , candy, perfume, gift certificates or cards, always include a small box of candy to enclose with the card or certificate, wrap with Valentine wrapping and place a bow on the box. This will make the gift extra special and a more expressive way to show love.  Getting rid of sticks, stones and litter  The lawn of mid-winter is bare, brown and at this time while it is still dormant, it is an opportune time to check for objects such as sticks, stones, obstacles and litter. These objects could get tangled in your mower blade later in the season. While the lawn is in the dormant stage, hidden objects can be discovered and retrieved and placed in the trash bin before they cause problems when you start the mowing season.  Strike is the best variety of green bean  When it comes to selecting the very best variety of green bean, Strike wins over all the rest of the green beans including the great favorite Top Crop. Strike is a great producer and totally string-less. They produce an abundance of quality beans all summer. They are long and pencil shaped and deliver clusters of beans when continually harvested. They will produce a harvest over several weeks instead of at one time. One of their attributes is that they grow upright and are easier to harvest. They can also be sown in late June to provide a second harvest. They are one of the best green beans for canning or freezing because of their uniform size and shape as well as their attractive color.  Keeping road salt rinsed from vehicles  Road salt in the winter really helps the highways to melt snow and ice but is not to good on your vehicle. After each snow or ice event, connect up the hose on a day when temperatures rise above freezing and rinse off all the salt. Also spray under the bottom of the vehicle to rinse off salt. Use a few paper towels and some glass cleaner to clean your vehicles wiper blades and windshield to clean away slush and salt.  Avoiding ice melt and salt on driveway  Using salt and ice melt on driveways can damage the grass on the lawn because the salts will run off with the water onto the lawn when it flows off the driveway. Use the snow shovel to remove the snow from the driveway. Grass has enough problems with the chemicals in many lawn fertilizers and so called turf builders.  Disconnect hoses  If you use hoses to wash cars, fill birdbaths, or water perennials, always remember to disconnect the hoses and cover the faucets with the covers to prevent plumbing from freezing. Roll up the hoses and store them to keep water in them from freezing.  Hoe hoe hoedown  “Learning fast.” Officer: “Ma’am, I stopped you because you were going 80 mph.” Young lady: “Wow, that’s very neat! I just learned to drive yesterday!”  “Bad ride.” Fran: “I’ve got the worst kind of car trouble anyone could possibly have.” Jan: “What kind of trouble are you having?” Fran: “The motor wont start, and the payments won’t stop!”  The cardinal could be national Valentine bird  We can already see a natural Valentine on the front lawn on a mid-January morning when the colorful cardinals visit the feeders and birdbath. Frosty crystals with the winter sun shining on them and maybe a dusting of snow enhances the color of the cardinals. They are colorful in all four seasons but the white background of frost and snow creates a natural Valentine’s card. The cardinal could be the official bird for Saint Valentines Day.  Getting ready for a season of white stuff  Will we get much snow as we move on into the New Year? We are certainly hoping for a few hefty snowfalls and we know most children are also. Now is the time to get down to the serious expectation of some snow, sleet, ice and freezing rain and a wintry mix during January and February. Get the snow shovel out of storage or purchase one now because the best time to purchase them is when no snow is on the ground. Buy a new ice scraper or two and several cans of de-icer spray. Keep several flashlights handy in case the power goes off. Keep a few easy to prepare meals on hand and some sandwich ingredients and snacks for kids on snow days.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10YWlyeW5ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb24vMTE5OTU4L2p1c3QtYW5vdGhlci1vbGQtZGlydC1yb2Fk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Getting rid of the creepy chickweed Grinch  The Grinch is green and ugly, and so is the chickweed that thrives during the winter months. It is green and ugly, but it is also easy to get rid of because it has shallow roots and practically grows only an inch or two beneath the soil. It is easy to pull up and throw out of the garden. Remove this pesky weed from the garden or rose bushes before it gets a head start. It is the easiest of weeds to get rid of.  We have gained a half hour of daylight  As the sunsets the wind-down of January, we will have gained a half hour of daylight since Dec. 21. It paves the way for a minute more of daylight each evening when the sunsets. We can continue to enjoy this increase every day until summer arrives and spring is a little more than 50 days away.  Preparing for the mowing season  The garden centers, hardwares, Home Depots, Walmart, Lowe’s Home Improvement and Ace Hardware already have lawn equipment displayed. If you need a new mower, now is the time to shop around for one and compare values. These shops have plenty of mowers waiting for you and you can choose the one that meets your needs. Check your sleeping mower during the last days of January. If your mower needs a tune-up, or some repair, now is the time to get your mower serviced. Most small engine repair shops are not as busy at this time of year. They will pick up your mower, service it, and return it to you for only a small fee. While it is being serviced, let them sharpen or replace the blade and check the battery and belts and get the mower ready for another season of dependable operation.  Making a butterscotch raw apple cake  Apples make great desserts in winter. This is a recipe that combines the caramel flavor of butterscotch with the tartness of raw apples and blended with chopped pecans for a wonderful winter treat. For this recipe, you will need one cup Crisco vegetable oil, two large eggs, two cups sugar, two and a half cups plain flour, three cups (seven or eight McIntosh or any tart apples), two three ounce boxes of Jello instant pudding, butterscotch flavor, one teaspoon pie spices, one teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon salt, one cup chopped pecans and one tablespoon vanilla flavoring. In a large bowl, add Crisco oil, eggs and sugar. In another bowl, mix plain flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and apple pie spices. Add to the sugar-oil mixture, and then add the chopped pecans. Peel the apples, cut into half inch cubes and run through the blender in “grate” mode and mix in a tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the apples to the mixture and the vanilla flavoring. Mix all the ingredients well. Spread the mixture into a 13x9x2 inch baking pan or dish sprayed with Pam baking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Cool the cake completely. Mix the Jello butterscotch instant pudding mix according to the instructions on the Jello boxes. Spread the pudding on top of the cake. This cake can be prepared a day before you want to serve it. Top with whipping cream, Dream Whip or Cool Whip if you desire.  Applying dormant oil spray to fruit trees  The fruit trees and grape vines will remain dormant for several more weeks and can still be pruned and trimmed for better production and appearance. On a calm day as January ends, spray the trees and grapevines with a coating of dormant oil spray to protect them from aphids and insects or diseases. A bottle of oil spray mixed with the proper amount of water will coat most of the trees and grapevines with a shiny coat of spray. The oil will protect the trees and vines and will help harvest to be protected from diseases and insect pests. The job needs to be done before the middle of February when buds start to form. On a calm day with no wind or rain in the forecast, the oil spray will stick to the limbs and the sun will dry it into the limbs.  A bit of February lore  We have a bit of cold weather lore to kick off the month. This lore says, “If February produces much snow, a fine summer it will bestow.” This is a positive thought to begin the shortest month of the year. Even though short, the month is capable of dumping quit a few inches of snow. Even though summer is quit a few months away, its always a good thought on these days before February begins.  Seventeen more days to shop for your Valentine  It is getting closer to the season of hearts, flowers, candy and love. The stores and shops are bursting with plenty of hearts, flowers and Valentine gifts. On the last cold days of January, you can warm your heart by searching for and shopping for Valentine gifts for friends, sweethearts, husbands, wives, children and grand-children. No matter whether you purchase gifts , candy, perfume, gift certificates or cards, always include a small box of candy to enclose with the card or certificate, wrap with Valentine wrapping and place a bow on the box. This will make the gift extra special and a more expressive way to show love.  Getting rid of sticks, stones and litter  The lawn of mid-winter is bare, brown and at this time while it is still dormant, it is an opportune time to check for objects such as sticks, stones, obstacles and litter. These objects could get tangled in your mower blade later in the season. While the lawn is in the dormant stage, hidden objects can be discovered and retrieved and placed in the trash bin before they cause problems when you start the mowing season.  Strike is the best variety of green bean  When it comes to selecting the very best variety of green bean, Strike wins over all the rest of the green beans including the great favorite Top Crop. Strike is a great producer and totally string-less. They produce an abundance of quality beans all summer. They are long and pencil shaped and deliver clusters of beans when continually harvested. They will produce a harvest over several weeks instead of at one time. One of their attributes is that they grow upright and are easier to harvest. They can also be sown in late June to provide a second harvest. They are one of the best green beans for canning or freezing because of their uniform size and shape as well as their attractive color.  Keeping road salt rinsed from vehicles  Road salt in the winter really helps the highways to melt snow and ice but is not to good on your vehicle. After each snow or ice event, connect up the hose on a day when temperatures rise above freezing and rinse off all the salt. Also spray under the bottom of the vehicle to rinse off salt. Use a few paper towels and some glass cleaner to clean your vehicles wiper blades and windshield to clean away slush and salt.  Avoiding ice melt and salt on driveway  Using salt and ice melt on driveways can damage the grass on the lawn because the salts will run off with the water onto the lawn when it flows off the driveway. Use the snow shovel to remove the snow from the driveway. Grass has enough problems with the chemicals in many lawn fertilizers and so called turf builders.  Disconnect hoses  If you use hoses to wash cars, fill birdbaths, or water perennials, always remember to disconnect the hoses and cover the faucets with the covers to prevent plumbing from freezing. Roll up the hoses and store them to keep water in them from freezing.  Hoe hoe hoedown  “Learning fast.” Officer: “Ma’am, I stopped you because you were going 80 mph.” Young lady: “Wow, that’s very neat! I just learned to drive yesterday!”  “Bad ride.” Fran: “I’ve got the worst kind of car trouble anyone could possibly have.” Jan: “What kind of trouble are you having?” Fran: “The motor wont start, and the payments won’t stop!”  The cardinal could be national Valentine bird  We can already see a natural Valentine on the front lawn on a mid-January morning when the colorful cardinals visit the feeders and birdbath. Frosty crystals with the winter sun shining on them and maybe a dusting of snow enhances the color of the cardinals. They are colorful in all four seasons but the white background of frost and snow creates a natural Valentine’s card. The cardinal could be the official bird for Saint Valentines Day.  Getting ready for a season of white stuff  Will we get much snow as we move on into the New Year? We are certainly hoping for a few hefty snowfalls and we know most children are also. Now is the time to get down to the serious expectation of some snow, sleet, ice and freezing rain and a wintry mix during January and February. Get the snow shovel out of storage or purchase one now because the best time to purchase them is when no snow is on the ground. Buy a new ice scraper or two and several cans of de-icer spray. Keep several flashlights handy in case the power goes off. Keep a few easy to prepare meals on hand and some sandwich ingredients and snacks for kids on snow days.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10YWlyeW5ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb24vMTE5OTYwL3N0cmF3YmVycnktaGFydmVzdC1pbi1mdWxsLXN3aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When mum wakes up, she gets us all up to face our responsibilities, perform our prayers, get ready for work, for school, whatever we have to do.  Chop chop, mum gets us up! The house then descends into a fury of activity and productivity. Mothers are simply awesome.  Last weekend mothers were honoured and celebrated in various outpourings of love, respect and gratitude – as mothers so absolutely deserve.  Islam teaches us to show utmost respect to our parents and be grateful towards them in order to please Allah the Almighty. As Muslims, we are obliged to take care of our parents as they did to us when we depended on them – with utmost respect, patience, kindness and affection.  Indeed, one of the Ten Commandments of the Bible, commands that mothers and fathers be honoured.  Most mothers are recognised for their unconditional love for their children, and indeed they have dedicated their lives to motherhood.  Some mothers haven’t lived up to being so virtuous for reasons they can’t even explain. I suppose they were only meant to house their offspring – which too is a vital task – and for that they must be given due respect, such as the following quote by Nayyirah Waheed depicts: “My mother was my first country; the first place I ever lived.”  Mothers come in all forms and descriptions so it’s unfair to put labels on what constitutes a “good” mother or a “bad” mother. Vocabulary.com describes a mother as this: “The woman who gave birth to you. Mothers are parents, the female equivalent of a father. Besides biological mothers, there are stepmothers and adopted mothers; they all do mothering, which means taking care of children (or, sometimes, being overprotective of children). Oddly enough, a mother is also slimy substance that forms during the fermentation of wine or cider. But in any case, mothers give and sustain life.”  I like that description, it sums up mothers beautifully.  Parents, single or together, are known by the grace of God to make miracles happen to make our children happy. My darling granddaughter, Aayah, sent me the following quote. We don’t know the source but it is a profound statement that I’m sure most of us can relate to:  “When your parents aren’t rich, but they still afford to give you a beautiful life, please appreciate their sacrifice.”  That’s the phenomenon of the love we have for our children and grandchildren. And by the grace and mercy of God, we make miracles happen for our children, be it that school trip, tuition fees, birthday present, we attempt to make it happen. And when all else fails, we have taught our children patience and understanding, that whatever it is they wanted can’t be gotten – yet.  Because of the role the mother plays it’s her duty to give wise, understanding, life skills and lessons to our children to enable them to become well-rounded adults.  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said in a Hadith “that paradise lies at the feet of the mother”.  Abu Huraira reported that a person asked Allah’s messenger, “Who among the people is most deserving of my good treatment?”  He said: “Your mother.”  He was asked this question three times and again he replied, “Your mother, again your mother, then your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order (of nearness).” Book 32, Number 6181.  This displays the importance of one’s mother.  Also, Islam considered kindness to both parents next to the worship of God. “And we have enjoined upon man (to be good) to his parents: His mother bears him in weakness upon weakness …” (Koran 31:14)  I could go on and on about mothers and parents to drive home the point that every day is mother’s day. We should shower our mothers with love, respect and prayers, giving them honour even when they have left this earthly abode. Let’s make our mothers and others who have served as mothers happy every day.  Bermuda, have a blessed and peaceful weekend with lots of happy mothering!  As salaam alaikum.  • Linda Walia Ming is a member of the Bermuda Hijab Dawah Team, a group of Muslim women who reside in Bermuda and have a goal of educating the community about the religion of Islam","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMzA1MjAvbGV0cy1tYWtlLW91ci1tb3RoZXJzLWhhcHB5LWV2ZXJ5LXNpbmdsZS1kYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Unfortunately for pastors, we have a time warp. As everybody knows, a thousand years is about one divine day on God’s calendar. If God rests for only two days, that will see us through 4000AD.  I was mindful of this anomaly towards last weekend when I stumbled into an open-air crusade in Kira Municipality’s Kyaliwajjala trading centre.  The stage was a substantial knockdown steel structure. The sound equipment drowned out all the loudspeakers small-time traders use to advertise their stuff in the general market area. The performers – pastors, singers and dancers – were numerous. The atmosphere was one of enhanced roadside entertainment.  We – the standing ‘congregation’ – looked like a gathering mainly composed of idlers and petty traders taking time off our other distractions. The organisers may have had exaggerated expectations.  Was there serious content at this so-dubbed Mega Crusade?  As usual, ‘plants’, devotees and imitators had their arms raised and swaying on command. Bystanders were watching. And whenever we were assured that our fortune would be like that of some heroic biblical figure, some devotees clapped ecstatically.  The health needs of any congregation are a serious matter. And the pastor on the stage that evening was proclaiming instant and near-instant healing for a catalogue of complex conditions: high blood pressure and heart disease, including inherited conditions, diabetes, Aids, cancer, persistent headaches, and so on; of course, in the name of Jesus. You only had to touch the area of your body that troubled you as the pastor commanded all the disorders to disappear!  We often hear that instead of their churches being named after the traditional Christian saints (who are considered stale), Pentecostal churches are given names that refer to actions, or aspirations, or attributes.  Instead of, say, St Luke Church, you will find something like The All Engulfing Holy Spirit Fire Church; or even more ridiculous mouthfuls. This, in fact, signifies a big problem.  After rejecting the sobering distance provided by a dead saint, the pastor presents a picture of high drama in his immediate time and place.  The pastor, who sometimes vainly calls himself an apostle or a prophet, sets himself at the centre of this drama as the earthly agent of divine power.  But he is 100 percent mortal. His God is resting and does not even know him.  When a narcotic drug fails to show any effect, it is tempting to take bigger doses of the drug, or to turn to a stronger narcotic. Likewise, to show his power, and the power of his God, the pastor proclaims bigger and bigger miracles, which are of course big lies that sometimes turn deadly.  The more outlandish the pastor’s claims, the more gullible and more vulnerable are those who believe him.  But lying about his special access to divine power is the source of the pastor’s livelihood. He is a freelance operator in circumstances where his supposed leaders jostle for connection to the power and money of the State instead of taking (enlightened) responsibility for their amorphous faith outfits. Selling bigger and bigger lies to believers who seem to become more idiotic will therefore increase.  That is one way a faith system begins to die.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL29wZWQvY29sdW1uaXN0cy9hbGxhbi10YWNjYS93aHktcGFzdG9ycy10ZWxsLWJpZy1saWVzLTQyNDEyODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Kandy"", ""Kandy"", ""SriLanka""}","2023-05-21T05:17:36","Photo courtesy of Twitter  “Not only our actions, but also our inactions, become our destiny.” Heinrich Zimmer (The King and the Corpse)  This week marked the 14th anniversary of the ending of the long Eelam War.  This week also saw the re-emergence of BBS head-honcho Galgoda Aththe Gnanasara to save the nation from that enterprising entrepreneur of cloth, Pastor Jerome Fernando. Much verbal thundering was heard warning of a new religious war.  Later in the week, a bunch of Sinhala-Buddhist extremists crashed into a ceremony at the Borella Cemetery held in the memory of all the war dead. They condemned the event as a commemoration of the Tigers, probably on the grounds that those Tamils who died in the war (especially in the Rajapaksas’ humanitarian operation with zero-civilian casualties) were Tigers, right down to babies and toddlers.  The week ended with another group of lay-and-monk warriors gathering by the Buddha statue outside the Fort Railway Station, pledging to protect rata, jathiya, and agama.  Fortunately ordinary Lankans, immersed in the real struggle for economic survival, ignored these theatrics, turning what could have been explosions into damp squibs.  The ending of the long Eelam War brought neither peace nor prosperity even for the triumphant Sinhalese. The much awaited peace dividend was swallowed by a defence establishment that continued expanding. The Rajapaksas treated the entire Tamil population of the North and parts of the East like enemy aliens, locking up every man, woman, and child in open air prison camps called Welfare Villages (Indian and international pressure eventually compelled them to abandon this policy of mass incarceration). When the cry of the Undead Tiger failed to impress the South, the regime sought other enemies, flirting with “alien Christians” before settling on “Encroaching Muslims”. The harvest of that toxic seeding was reaped in April 2019, three weeks short of the 10th anniversary of Eelam War’s ending.  The war was unnecessary, preventable. Every step towards it was motivated not by national necessity or even popular demand. The motive force was the hellish union between political opportunism and religio-racial extremism. As the events of the last week indicate, that union is far from dead and its current partners are waiting impatiently to return to political mainstream. Unchastened by our blood-soaked history, they want to repeat it.  Until 1955-56, Lankan politics was cleavaged by class. That classic divide left little electoral space for S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s ambitions. His newly formed SLFP had challenged the UNP and lost in 1952. In the 1953 Hartal that shook the nation and forced a government to flee, he was an onlooker. The left had a real chance to form a government at the next election, especially if its fractured components could bring themselves to work together. Had Lanka taken that path, there would have been no Sinhala Only, no Sri riots of 1958, no Black July, and no 25 year war.  S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was clever enough to know that in a political battlefield divided along class lines he couldn’t prevail and unscrupulous enough to adopt the noxious race+religion=nation equation as his signature policy. He accepted the Buddhist Commission report in toto. Monks formed Eksath Bhikshu Peramuna and engaged in house to house campaigning to ensure his victory.  Our tragedy is littered with paths not taken. The Buddha Jayanthi of 1956 could have been celebrated by focusing on what the Buddha taught and by commencing a process of spiritual renaissance. Instead, under the guise of restoring Buddhism to its pre-colonial glory, Tripitaka was abandoned for Mahawamsa and the core Buddhist values of compassion, non-violence, and moderation replaced with hate, violence and extremism.  The Buddhist Commission Report’s title was The Betrayal of Buddhism. The real betrayal had come from within, the work of monks and kings. A universalist teaching had been ghettoised into the exclusive preserve of a single race. A teaching that explicitly rejected caste has been distorted by embedding caste discrimination into its very heart. The Buddhist Commission report could have chartered a course to return debased Lankan Buddhism into what the Buddha taught by ridding it of the twin perversions of race and caste. Instead it ignored the division of a single monkhood into caste-based nikayas (a distortion created by a Kandyan king) and focused on entrenching the racial ghettoisation of Buddhism.  1956 might have become a year of true nation building. Buddhism, cleansed of distortions, could have become a binding agent for a nascent Lankan nation. Instead, an unholy alliance of monks and politicians turned Buddhism into an agent of division. Sixty seven years later, that spectre continues to haunt us.  Fiction and Unfiction  In January this year, an outcry was heard about a fake Temple of the Tooth being built in Pothuhera in Kurunegala by a man who called himself a Bodhisatva (a future Buddha – a tad like Prophet Jerome). People were donating money and jewellery to fund this edifice, the media claimed. Donations were pouring in from here and abroad. The prelates of Malwatte and Asgiriya together with the Diyawadana Nilame of the Temple of the Tooth wrote to the president seeking political intervention against this fakery. (Incidentally, the chief prelates of other two nikayas did not sign the letter as caste bars them from playing any role in rituals surrounding the tooth relic).  The facts were telling. An enterprising individual thought to build another Temple of the Tooth. There were enough Buddhists willing to believe his claim that once the edifice was complete, the tooth relic would come to him. The entire sorry tale demonstrates how far a rational teaching which accepts the law of cause and effect had degenerated into a myth-ridden superstition in which relics could perform miracles and trees grant wishes. In this version of Buddhism, men are arrested for “insulting the Buddha” (or his relics) while those who claim to be his robed disciples violate his teachings on a daily basis.  The Buddha, in his final major sermon, set out the path for the sasana’s survival and expansion. He mentioned seven conditions, seven further conditions, seven good qualities, seven factors of enlightenment, seven perceptions and six further conditions. If monks adhere to these 41 stipulations, the sasana would flourish. He made no mention of state patronage, of his pristine teachings surviving only in an island called Lanka, of rituals or relics. His sole focus was on the conduct of the monks themselves. And in what passes for Buddhism in Sri Lanka today, almost every single one of those conditions are violated daily and in plain sight. Those violations are ignored while talking about them is being turned into a non-bailable crime.  In 2019, the writer Shakthika Sathkumara was arrested under the ICCPR and held without bail. The arrest was the outcome of a complaint made by a group of monks about a short story he wrote (Half). The story is about life in a fictional monastery and contains a hint about the abuse of young monks by senior monks. According to a police spokesman, “A group of monks complained that the reference to homosexual activities among the clergy insulted Buddhism.”  Vinaya pitaka refers to sexual misconduct by monks and specifically lists the masturbation of one monk by another as a serious offence. The Buddha obviously understood that becoming ordained will not free a person from human desires. Only the stream enterers would be free of such yearnings. Since there are no known stream enterers in Sri Lanka, the kind of misconduct the Buddha made rules against is likely to be present here. The arrest of several monks for suspected child abuse (including sexual abuse) this year alone indicates that what Shakthika Sathkumara’s fiction alleges is present in real life. Unfortunately, in today’s religious universe, the crime is less offensive than talking about it.  A new trend among political monks is to refer to the saffron robe as “Arahat dajaya” (the standard of enlightened monks). This new myth is a marker in the ongoing attempt to place monks above scrutiny and criticism. This is reminiscent of the kind of blind veneration and unthinking obedience rife in many parts of Catholic Europe until a few decades ago and is present in some Charismatic churches even today (in a remake of the Jonestown horror, the head of Good News International Church in Kenya persuaded his followers to die of starvation to meet Jesus fast. Many did. The pastor is alive and well and currently out on bail). Walter Benjamin in One Way Street, provides an example, something he experienced during a visit to Naples, Italy, in the 1920’s. “…a priest was drawn on a cart through the streets of Naples for indecent offenses. He was followed by a crowd hurling maledictions. At a corner a wedding procession appeared. The priest stands up and makes the sign of a blessing, and the cart’s pursuers fall onto their knees.” This is where we headed. A monk does not have to adhere to the teaching. All he has to do is to wear the robe, just as all that Neapolitan priest had to do was to make the sign of the cross.  Superstition can be dismissed as silly. But it stems from the same irrationality which accepts the perversion of a teaching based on compassion and loving kindness to all living beings into one which rewards the killing of unbelievers with heavenly bliss. It also opens the floodgates of stupidity, enabling such political machinations as the Kelani Cobra.  In the infamous Mahawamsa story which debuts the justification for a holy war there is a marker for a different path. In the story, King Dutugemunu is saddened by the human costs of his victory. “How shall there be any comfort for me….since by me was caused the slaughter of a great host numbering millions?” he laments. And the deaths he is mourning are not even of civilians in the enemy territory but of enemy combatants. The call of his conscience is closer to the Buddha’s teaching than the supposed advice given to him by monks. It would also provide a better path to a lasting peace, and a more effective counter to the triumphant return of politics of religio-racial addiction.  The Salvation Mania  In 2019, almost seven million Lankans ignored the evidence before their eyes and elected an economic ignoramus as president, believing that he could guide them to the promised land of development painlessly and fast.  Gullibility has become a national characteristic, something that unites us across racial, religious, class and other lines.  Pastor Jerome Fernando who calls himself a prophet and runs an extremely lucrative religious enterprise seems to epitome that specifically American construct: charismatic preacher who lords it over a fief and turns it into a profit making venture. Such preachers embody in their teaching and practice the brashness of a certain strand of American capitalism and the anti-intellectual, anti-rational tendencies inherent in unadulterated Lutherism. Martin Luther rejected the concept of free will totally and advocated salvation via sola fide, faith alone. Fortunately for the world, Protestantism evolved into a more tolerant and rational faith due to active mediation by great humanists such as Philip Melanchthon. The American style charismatic preachers are outside this mainstream, advocating political and social stances that are often retrogressive. The role played by this outcrop of Protestantism in propping rightwing populist leaders from Trump to Bolsonaro is well-documented.  Pastor Jerome can perhaps be best understood by looking at the former Pitiduwe Siridamma Thero who reinvented himself as Arhat Sri Samanthabadra and built another excellent religio-commercial enterprise, Umandawa. The one is as much of a follower of Christ as the other is a disciple of the Buddha. Both, and others of their ilk, work on vulnerabilities of people in uncertain times, turning fear and ignorance into lucre.  On October 3, 2002 a group of American Evangelical pastors wrote a letter to President George W. Bush supporting a war against Saddam Hussein. The Land Letter (named after its prime mover, Pastor Richard D. Land) gave seven reasons why an invasion of Iraq would be a “Just War”. When Bob Woodward (of Watergate fame) asked President Bush if he consulted his (far more intelligent) father before invading Iraq, the younger Bush replied, “He is the wrong father to appeal to for advice…There is a higher father I appeal to.” The world is still living with the horrors that “divinely-mandated” war, each unnecessary death a living reminder of what happens when religious irrationality bleeds into political irrationality.  Pastor Jerome cannot insult the Buddha even if he tries to. The Buddha was accused of worse and to his face,and his response was that since he refused to accept the insults, they would return to the ones making them. The danger Pastor Jerome represents is the same danger political monks and other politically active religious figures represent (including the Catholic Cardinal). Their words and deeds further exacerbate societal gullibility and social irrationality, making another 2019 and national follies of that order far more likely. But the battle that must be waged with such purveyors of blind faith and unquestioning obedience has nothing to do with law and incarceration. It is a contestation of ideas and ideals over the kind of future we want for Sri Lanka. A secular country where faith is a private matter and every citizen is free to follow a religion – or not – cannot be built on persecution and intolerance.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ3JvdW5kdmlld3Mub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvcG9saXRpY3Mtb2YtYWRkaWN0aW9uL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vZ3JvdW5kdmlld3Mub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvcG9saXRpY3Mtb2YtYWRkaWN0aW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Be A Pilgrim!  Focus on your life, see God and your community differently, and so much more. From ancient times till now, people of diverse faith continuously desire to maintain spiritual and intimate relationship with the Supreme God-YHWH. One of the ways by which people forge, maintain and renew this spiritual connection is through pilgrimages. A pilgrimage is a trip made to a holy place for religious reasons. A Christian pilgrimage is a journey to a significant place with the intention of encountering God in Christ.  To embark on a pilgrimage is not merely to visit a place to admire nature’s beauty, art or history. To make time for a pilgrimage experience really means to step out of yourself in order to have a concrete encounter with God in places where He has visited and revealed himself, where His grace and mercy have shone with particular splendour, bringing a transformational experience and bearing fruits of conversion and holiness among those who believe. Christians go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to other places associated with the Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit, His death and resurrection. Pilgrims go to many other places where God visited in both solemn and dramatic ways to establish His name and covenant with mankind.  In the Bible, Jesus Christ and His parents went on a pilgrimage every year when he was a boy. (Luke 2:41-42.). There was a man called Elkanah who lived in Ramah, but went on an annual pilgrimage to Shiloh to offer sacrifices to the Lord with his two wives; Peninnah and Hannah. It was at this place that “pilgrim Hannah” (1 Samuel 1:9-28) made a vow and covenanted with God for a child, and she got more than she asked for. She had five (5) more children apart from Samuel. Great testimonies born by pilgrims in the past and present times, is an assurance of your own testimony this year as you choose to become a pilgrim at Asamankese.  There You Shall Go …  God is a Spirit and is not limited by time, space and matter, He is omnipresent. (Psalm 139:7-12, Jeremiah 23:24) The prefix omni- originates in Latin and means “all”. So, to say that God is omnipresent is to say that God is present everywhere at all times with no exceptions. There is no place you can be that God is not present. The attribute of God as omnipresent means he is both transcendent and immanent. He lives in time and beyond time and occupies every atom in nature.  God is omnipresent but humans are not, as humans, we are bound by time, space and matter. Thus, though God is everywhere humans cannot easily locate His presence unless He reveals Himself to us. “Those who seek Him find Him” (Matt. 7:7). God chooses to show His presence to mankind in diverse ways. He may reveal Himself in one form or another at different situations. God in Christ chose to step into time at a place in order to mingle with mankind. We as a people encounter the Presence of God at a place, where He chooses to establish His name in time. “But you shall seek the place where the LORD your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go”. (Deuteronomy 12:5). For instance, God asked Moses to come up to Him at the Mt. Sinai where Moses had an encounter with the LORD. (Ex. 24:1-18). Certainly, there are place(s) that we go because the name of God is honoured in those places and His presence is evident in these places in concrete ways through the signs and wonders He performs. It is good to be in the company of other saints in a gathering at one place in time to encounter God’s presence and power together, in these meetings we all practically become a living tabernacle of our God-Father, Son and Holy Spirit. There are many places and spaces around the world where God at a particular point in time chooses to make His light shine and loves to spark a transformational relationship with mankind. We speak of a particular place in the then Gold Coast now Ghana known as Asamankese where God chose to show Himself in a spectacular manner as we will soon discuss in this paper.  God Chose Ghana (Gold Coast) And Asamankese  Hundred years ago, there was a dramatic experience at Asamankese similar to the Pentecost experience which the apostles of Jesus encountered at Jerusalem. God poured out His Holy Spirit and manifested physically in the form of a “pillar of fire” on top of the church building where a group of people had gathered to pray during a revival programme. In his book titled “Pentecostalism: The Eddies of Ghanaian Christianity;(pg100), Emmanuel K. Larbi noted that, more people were added to Peter Anim’s group after the incident which happened on 20th May 1923.Their faith was sharpened and many miracles took place in those days. The church is the Christ Apostolic Church International, and as the founder, Apostle Peter Kwaku Manasseh Anim was the leader of the prayer group since its inception in 1917. God chose Asamankese to demonstrate His great power and grace for a reason, and you are part of that reason as a Ghanaian and an African. On 20th May 2023, there will be a great gathering at Asamankese to launch the 100th year celebration of this great visitation and awakening.  A little background information may help to appreciate this great day very well. As mentioned, a Biblical example of this experience is what happened in Jerusalem in 33 AD, when the promise of God was fulfilled, the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles as tongues of fire as recorded in the book of Acts 2:1-3. This great visitation also occurred in the United States of America at a place called, Azuza. The Azusa Street Revival beginning in the spring of 1906, largely spawned the worldwide Pentecostal movement. It was led by William J. Seymour, an African-American preacher in Los Angeles, California. The revival began on April 9, 1906, and continued until roughly 1915.  Three places among others that this great awakening of mankind by the visitation of the Almighty God has happened in the history of the world include; Jerusalem in 33AD, California in 1906 and Asamankese in 1923. In Africa it’s happened only in Ghana. There is God and He can be trusted to faithfully engage mankind by stepping into time in whatever form and place He chooses.  The Asamankese Experience: The Seal of Ghanaian Pentecostalism  The Asamankese experience is simply the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in all forms upon those who believed which culminated in the physical manifestation of fire from heaven at Asamankese on May 20th,1923. The Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all believers. (Ephesians 4:30) God’s approval and empowerment are demonstrated by the presence and anointing of the Holy Spirit, the apostles waited for the Spirit as a seal and an approval to begin their ministry. Without the Holy Spirit, God is not present, His presence and power is carried and released by His Spirit. God’s promise in Joel (Joel 2:28-29) was fulfilled in Jerusalem, in Azuza, also in Asamankese and continues to be fulfilled in us as a sign of God’s approval, the seal of the Holy spirit like flames of fire. The “Trinity” of Ghanaian Pentecostal churches -The Christ Apostolic Church International (CAC), The Church of Pentecost (COP) and the Apostolic church-Ghana which have formed the bedrock out of which other charismatic churches in Ghana have emerged, all begun from the “Asamankese Experience”; an initiative of God through his servant Apostle Peter Newman Anim. From small beginnings bewildered with great weaknesses of diseases, poverty etc., men and women of a small prayer group led by Peter Anim to the great visitation of the Almighty God with fire from heaven to assuage vulnerabilities into power and dominion with God’s total salvation for both soul and body. Professor Asamoah-Gyadu had this to say in his book titled African Charismatics: Current Developments Within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana: Western Mission-Related Pentecostal Denominations, (pg. 23)-The Church of Pentecost (COP) is one out of three ‘Apostolic’ churches (talking about CAC, COP and APOSTOLIC CURCH-GHANA) to emerge from the initiative of Apostle Peter N. Anim (1890–1984) and his subsequent collaboration with the British Apostolic missionaries James and Sophia McKeown.  Asamankese is a place where God chose to reveal His grace to Ghanaians and Africa like never before. No fairy tales and no drama, God being God by concretely and vividly revealing Himself to mankind to shut the voice of unbelief, skepticism and Satan. God has chosen to place His name there, and we must go there at least once in a life time to worship. All believers in Ghana and Africa should not take this for granted. God chose an indigenous Ghanaian man, an African to light the flames of Christian spirituality in Ghana, Africa and other parts of the world, especially with the advent of the British Apostolic missionaries James and Sophia McKeown to the Gold coast in 1937. God has visited us and left us with trails to follow so we could find Him in all the events that unfolded and that which continues to unfold in the life of the people who have believed and the churches connected to this great awakening and revival; The Christ Apostolic Church International, the church of Pentecost, the Apostolic church Ghana and all the charismatic churches that have sprung out of these Pentecostal churches. God is still working and writing His-Story. A simple pilgrimage to Asamankese will earn you a spot in this God story. Tap into the revival and rally behind the fire to experience this great grace for the next level.  The Same God, Different Cultures and A Distinct People  God responds to us with His love and grace (Roman 5:8), He descends into our cultures to solve our common and particular problems when we call, thus he comes to us just as we are, wherever we are and however he chooses to come. God does not come based on another man’s standard, problem or prescription. God has shown His unconditional love to many people of different cultures and nations. Pentecostal stirrings across the world follow the same pattern, from Jerusalem to Azuza to Asamankese and to many other places without having to think that one is the export or spillover of the other. In Ghana, the Pentecostal move that was sealed on May 20th ,1923 by the physical manifestation of the fire of the Holy Spirit at Asamankese is without the direct influence of any foreign mission. God used the local men and women to start a global revival and ministry.  Taking the intercultural perspective of viewing Pentecostal history as advocated by Walter J. Hollenweger and sanctioned by Asamoah-Gyadu, “the intercultural view of Pentecostal history rejects conventional interpretations that consider what happened in the course of Western Christendom as universally normative for Christian history”. God’s work in any part of the world is not the duplicate of another. God’s work and revival in any culture or nation carries in itself a distinct purpose that is fit to bring the kind of salvation the people have been crying for. Interculturality values diversity. Asamoah-Gyadu agrees that “An intercultural theology, therefore, aims at a ‘body of Christ’ in which individual organs remain committed to their function whilst contributing to the whole without any assuming a sense of superiority over the others”. The great awakening and revival that took place at Asamankese that culminated in the physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit as a pillar of fire had not been because of what happened in Jerusalem or Azuza, we should simply understand that God chose to reveal himself at Asamankese to accomplish his own purpose in the lives of his people. What happened at Asamankese is God’s direct visitation to mankind without the interference or help of any western group. This is authentic. It is the responsibility of the current generation to keep the fire burning always. The fire is our heritage, it must be kept generation after generation, not for only Pentecostals but for everyone who believes. Ghana, Africa and the rest of the world is forever blessed in Asamankese, halleluiah!!! As we celebrate the 100 years of this great awakening and blessing, be a blessing by visiting Asamankese this year.  “Before” And “After” The Physical Manifestation of The Holy Spirit as A “Pillar of Fire” At Asamankese.  The apex of the Pentecostal movement in Ghana without doubt is the “Pentecost Phenomenon” which happened on 20th May 1923. Even though Anim’s prayer group had received testimonies of healing and many other miracles, God’s visitation in this dramatic way of fire falling from heaven and ‘standing’ on top of the church building cannot be compared to any testimony. It’s a sign of God’s eternal approval, true revival and awakening in Ghana and Africa. According to Asamoah-Gyadu, in his book titled “ African Charismatics: Current Developments within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana, Studies of Religion in Africa, Volume: 27”, in 1917 Apostle Anim started a local prayer group at Asamankese in the Eastern Region of Ghana, triggering off a ‘revivalist type campaign’ throughout that region. Anim lost his wife in 1920 and in 1921 Anim was healed of his chronic stomach and guinea worm disease through prayer without the use of any medicine and prophylactic substances. This personal testimony formed part of Anim’s theology. It was quite evident that Anim and his group were bent on experiencing the power of God and thus worked very hard in that direction. According to E.K. Larbi, in 1922, October 15th, a revival service was held in the house of Elder Kwabena Asare and several converts were won. Professor Larbi continues to say that “the healing and evangelistic activities of Anim attracted the then traditional chief of Asamankese, Nana Kwaku Amoah. In consequence, he offered them a parcel of land upon which they constructed their first church building”.  From 1917 to 1923 when the first church building was built, Apostle Anim had gone through a lot of phases with his prayer group including finally leaving the Presbyterian church and moving from Boso to Asamankese. It was on top of this first church building that the fire fell from heaven on 20th May, 1923. Before the fire came in 1923, fasting, prayer, evangelism, healing and many struggles characterized Anim’s group, including changing the names of the prayer group and affiliations. see Anim, Peter Newman - Dictionary of African Christian Biography (dacb.org)  E.K. Larbi accounts in his book titled “Pentecostalism: The eddies of Ghanian Christianity, (pg. 100)” that; “Another event which seemed to have increased the faith of Anim and also added more people to the group took place in May 1923 during a revival meeting. After the closing of service, it was reported that several Christians and non-Christians saw what was believed to be the Glory of God in the form of a pillar of fire on top of the church building”.  After the ‘fire’ came, they were endued with power. Great faith means greater works. Anim’s group continued growing and expanding beyond the borders of Asamankese and the Eastern region. Even at this point Anim begun to seek and contend for a deeper faith and greater spiritual power. He fed on the Apostolic faith teachings and even more on the Holy Spirit. In 1928, Anim faced serious opposition at the hands of pagan and religious persecutors but this did not impair the progress of his movement.  In 1932 a major event happened that changed the landscape of Christianity in Ghana, a member of Anim’s movement called Stephen Owiredu experienced the phenomenon of Spirit baptism. Owiredu went into the bush at Brekumanso to pray for one of his twin babies who was also left to die. It was during this intense prayer encounter that he experienced what Pentecostals call the baptism of the Holy Spirit; Glossolalic phenomenon (speaking in tongues), the place which Prophet Stephen Owiredu went to pray is now a huge prayer camp built by the Christ Apostolic Church International (C.A.C INT.) called KWAO YEBOAH. The spot where he prayed is still preserved, and his twin daughter Maame Ataa is still alive. Most of the history of the Asamankese Experience has been preserved and passed on by her through oral means.  After most of the dramatic spiritual experiences of this great awakening had happened without the influence of any foreign missionary, and after the foundation has been laid for the Ghanaian classical Pentecostal move, God then opened the doorway for the great Pentecostal move to spread in Ghana and to other parts of the world in later years by way of bringing foreign missionaries to work with Apostle Anim. From 1932 to 1937, God opened up international affiliations to Apostle Anim as he got in touch with his contemporaries in Nigeria and also in UK. From Asamankese he connected with the Nigerians and later through the Nigerians connected with the Apostolic missionaries in the UK. The first missionary to visit Asamankese from the UK Apostolic church was Pastor George Perfect in 1935. Pastor George Perfect spent two weeks in Asamankese. It was this visit from Pastor George Perfect that made Anim’s movement affiliate with the UK Apostolic church. By the time Pastor George Perfect was leaving Asamankese, he made such a great impression on the group with the spiritual gifts he possessed. Because of this great impression he had on the group, Apostle Anim and his group became affiliated with the Apostolic church, Bradford in 1935, and adopted the name. In October 1936, Pastor Vivian Wellings, Missionary secretary of the Apostolic Church visited Asamankese from Britain. It was during the departure of Pastor Wellings that he promised to recommend the Anim’s group (which had then adopted the name -Apostolic church) to the authorities in Bradford, with the view of sending a missionary who would stay and help the Lord’s work in Ghana at Asamankese.  The Coming of Apostle James McKeown  The coming of Apostle James McKeown was heralded by the coming of Pastor Perfect and Pastor Wellings in 1935 and 1936 respectively, through the recommendation they made to the authorities of the UK Apostolic church, because at that time, what Apostle Anim started in 1917 as a prayer group at Asamankese had evolved to become the “Apostolic church” ( Unity Prayer Group/ Faith Tabernacle Church—— 1917–1926, First Century Gospel Church—- 1926-1929, Apostolic Faith —— 1930, The Apostolic Church—-1935, The Christ Apostolic Church —-1939, Christ Apostolic Church of Ghana——- 1960, The Christ Apostolic Church International ——1994.) which was affiliated to the UK Apostolic church. What we should note here is that the group had gone through phases of changing affiliations, and certainly the UK Apostolic affiliation could not be the last until God had finished the work He intended to do with His church.  When Apostle James McKeown came to Ghana as a missionary to the Gold Coast in 1937, the ‘Pentecost phenomenon’ (Physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit as a ‘pillar fire’ on top of the church building) had already occurred at Asamankese, so he saw evidence of Pentecost in Ghana. It may not be an error to think that he called his church; The ‘church of Pentecost’ because of the evidence of Pentecost experience he saw in Ghana at Asamankese. According to Professor Emmanuel K. Larbi in his book “Pentecostalism: The Eddies of Ghanaian Christianity, pg.108)”; “Apostle Anim ended its affiliation with the Apostolic church UK in June 1939”, two years after they sent a missionary to Ghana.  A Pilgrimage to Asamankese-Why You Need to Go and Places to See  Asamankese is a town in southern Ghana, and it is the capital of West Akim Municipal District, in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Asamankese has a settlement population of approximately 39,435 people. Asamankese is on the main highway to Kumasi and Accra in the interior. It is in this place that God chose to reveal Himself which has resulted in bringing great salvation to the people of then Gold Coast and Ghana in recent times. It is a place God has chosen to put His name for the people who believe. This is a Holy Place where God’s name is honoured and you can go and fellowship there too. Out of this place three of the most vibrant and respected Pentecostal churches in Ghana have emerged. The fire is literally still burning on that hill…every spiritual eye can behold its spot and glory. Go, see it and set yourself aflame for God in this End Time Revival. Rally behind the fire that set off the great move of the Ghanaian Pentecostalism. God’s story is still being written, His great salvation is still in progress, it’s our time in this generation to write our own story too. Asamankese is a good place to stop by especially this year as we celebrate the 100 years of Pentecost in Ghana; A physical manifestation of God’s fire at Asamankese.  A pilgrimage to Asamankese will take you to the Holy Ghost temple, a 100 years old church building that the Holy Ghost fire ‘stood’ upon. The last time I was there, the Prophets who took us round the place testified that after 100 years, that building still remains very strong and not much has been changed in the building.  You may also visit the power house, the building that served as the mission house for both Apostle Anim and Apostle McKeown. Many people have testified how going inside the building and praying to God saw their requests being granted of jobs, healing, the opportunity to travel, business contracts and, many more. Sometimes just by touching the building according to their faith resulted in healings. At Kwao Yeboah prayer camp, you will meet the only surviving daughter of Prophet Stephen Owiredu. Maame Ataa is the twin who died and came back to life when her father, Prophet Stephen Owiredu vowed to take his own life if his daughter also died. Such a blessed heritage in the Lord. Her life is full of God’s grace, brethren you need to encounter this woman of God.  At Kwao Yeboah there is a spot where Prophet Stephen Owiredu received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the first man in Ghana to speak in tongues. There is so much power and God’s presence in this place. Kindly visit Asamankese this year to see Kwao Yeboah prayer camp, your life shall not be the same.  The Beauty of a Pilgrimage  There are a lot of powerful reasons to go on a pilgrimage. But what happens when you return home? How will you be changed? In other words, what are the benefits a person derives from going on a pilgrimage?  Among many others, here are a few benefits you may gain from a pilgrimage at Asamankese…  1. You shall see God and Scripture Differently  It’s impossible to see the town where God revealed himself and touched people for over 100 years, and remain the same. Every place reveals something different. When you walk into the church building, you’ll come to know better the God who is within you, who speaks to you as you pray, walk in the same places that Apostle Anim, Apostle McKeown, Prophet Owiredu and others walked, and reflect. These experiences will sear themselves on your mind, heart, and spirit, and will be with you as you go through this pilgrimage of life.  2. You shall Return with Renewed Focus  Travelers have long known first-hand the ability of places far away to take you out of your everyday life and return home with a new perspective. The beauty of travel is to explore the world and whilst you are in a new location, distance from what is familiar often reveals new light on your life. Pilgrimages are not just about enjoying the treasures of nature; it adds another layer to the travel — a spiritual focus. Pilgrimage provides the setting, experiences, and insights so that real spiritual change is possible. Last year when we came back from our pilgrimage to Asamankese, a sister in the church testified of the great spiritual awakening in her life. She has not remained the same. This could be your story and even more. Many pilgrims come back reporting a call to start something new, repair a broken relationship, invest more in their spiritual life, and so many other things. What will a pilgrimage do for you this year?  3. You’ll Never be the Same  Everyone’s pilgrimage experience is very different. The truth is that, in ways big or small, you’ll remember the experience for the rest of your life. For some, they weren’t sure about such a spiritual journey in the first place, but it opened their eyes to the benefits of going on a pilgrimage. For others, they were searching for a deeper spiritual experience and the pilgrimage was, in fact, that catalyst. But wherever you fall on the spectrum, we promise you, you’ll be different when you step off the bus back home. Have you thought of entering the bedroom of Apostle Anim and Apostle McKeown? to sit in the same hall they sat? walk the same pathways they walked? A miracle is waiting for you this year at Asamankese.  4.Discover the places God has revealed himself in a unique way.  Perhaps the most immediate reason to go on a pilgrimage is to experience firsthand the literal places that God has impacted in time and space. You have heard the stories, Go and see the place…  5. Seek transformation in your faith.  The journey of faith is filled with ups and downs, seasons of high spiritual energy, and periods where it seems like nothing is happening. No matter the of your faith journey, a pilgrimage to Asamankese is an opportunity to experience transformation. A pilgrimage might open up new questions, inspire a new way of thinking, or cause some serious soul searching, but whatever happens, you won’t remain the same. Take a leap of faith and visit Asamankese this year!  The Impact of The Asamankese Experience on Christianity Today.  Pentecostalism at the moment represents the most cogent, powerful and visible evidence of religious renewal and influence in Ghana. In his book, “African Charismatics: Current Developments within Independent Indigenous Pentecostalism in Ghana, Studies of Religion in Africa, Volume: 27, pg.14”, Asamoah-Gyadu noted, “even the new lease of life being experienced by some of the older churches in Ghana is explicable in terms of their, albeit recent, tolerant and open attitude towards Pentecostal phenomena and renewal movements in their midst.” The emergence of Pentecostal churches in Ghana has without doubt changed the religious landscape in the country. The expedient use of media and technology in its evangelistic, missionary activities and church services has given them great public space.  The Asamankese Experience brought a new hope, a belief that a true and realistic experience with the Holy Spirit is possible even as Africans if we search in truth with all our hearts. Today believers have this assurance that if God did it at Asamankese in times past, then he can as well do it in our time. The Asamankese Experience unveiled a new style of worship that continues to influence Christianity today. Christian liturgies that followed a strict set of rules was revived to allow a personal and distinct experience with the Holy Spirit. It is important to note that most indigenous Christian songs that are common in Ghana today which have helped shaped the faith of many in Ghana and beyond have come through Pentecostals. These songs have found their way even into the mission churches during times of praises and adoration. Pentecostals have been able to penetrate the religion of indigenous people and their culture because Pentecostalism shares the basic African ontology of good and bad spirits, and embraces supernatural beings i.e., God, Jesus, demons, that can have a direct influence in the world. In this way Pentecostalism becomes a lot more meaningful and powerful to Africans than earlier forms of Christianity. And in this spiritual power, we find an astonishing ability to bring about change and transformation – often in the direction of what we usually call ‘development’. A lot more people (souls) have been won and many churches have been planted in Ghana and other parts of the world.  The Holy Spirit outpouring in 1932 which ushered in the Glossolalic phenomenon (tongue speaking) by an indigenous person among the Pentecostals during the Asamankese Experience continues to shape the prayer life of believers today. Many young believers do desire to speak in tongues. Selfless giving of members for building Gods kingdom as a demonstration of our devotion and sacrifice to God was dominant in the days of the Asamankese Experience, most members, chiefs and philanthropist gave to support the work of God. Today many believers are motivated to give in support of kingdom work looking at the great example of the Anim’s group.  The Impact of the Asamankese Experience is readily seen in the operations of the various Pentecostal and charismatic churches that sprung out of the Asamankese Experience. The C.A.C. INT., The C.O.P. and the APOSTOLIC CHURCH-GHANA continue to greatly influence Christianity in Ghana and beyond the borders of Ghana. The 2021 population and housing census in Ghana revealed that Pentecostal/Charismatic Christians were the largest religious group in Ghana, reaching a share of 31.6 percent. This translated into over 9.7 million of the country's population, an increase compared to the 2010 census year.  Shadrack Kwabena Yeboah, MDiv.

Okafor, leader of the Liberation and Miracle Ministry arrived in the country Thursday, with businessman and Zanu PF central Committee member, Mike Chimombe rolling out the red carpet.  He is attending a three day conference that kicked off Friday in Harare.  Upon arrival at Robert Mugabe International airport, the controversial cleric was draped in President Emmerson Mnangagwa's traditional scarf by Chimombe.  Okafor who is not new to scandals and controversies finally landed in the country after being denied entry by President Robert Mugabe's government in 2015.  The Nigerian miffed the Mugabe regime after a prophecy predicting the near death of the then longtime Zimbabwean leader.  The General as Okafor is affectionately known, is famed for his ""miracles"" on the pulpit which have on numerous occasions come under scrutiny.  In 2020 Okafor was accused of paying a woman to ""fake"" a miracle, an allegation he dismissed.  A grouping of indigenous business people which is fronted by Chimombe is spearheading the cleric's visit.  Independent Norton legislator Temba Mliswa, recently expressed concern in parliament over the visit of clerics of Okafor's ilk in Zimbabwe.  ""My question is to the Leader of Government business pertaining to false prophets that come to this country after they have done a research in terms of prophecy. They go and talk to families to make you believe that what they are saying is true. They take money from our people yet things are so difficult, in particular the one called Prophet Chris Okafor from Nigeria who has been banned in South Africa and Namibia but he is coming to Zimbabwe.""

Indeed, everybody dies but he then died in 2019. You can see that he has an agenda. What policy has Government got to vet these people before they come to this country because they also come for our money? Do we not have enough prophets in this country? We have Prophet Magaya, Prophet Makandiwa, churches and so forth. Are we short of faith as a nation to want to import faith into this country? Are we not a God-fearing country? Why are we allowing prophets to come to this country and milk money from our people?  ""I would like the Minister to speak on Prophet Chris Okafor from Nigeria who is coming. He was banned from South Africa and it will be worth investigating him before he comes. There is need for there to be a panel of men of God who are able to vet these people because it is not good for the country for us to have these false prophets who come and perform prophecy which they would have done research before they come here.

"religious miracle","2006-10-04","Not Discerned","{""Warrnambool"", ""Victoria"", ""Australia""}","2023-05-20T15:00:00","The spark of life that gave Warwick Thornton what is now “The New Boy” took 18 years to flicker, and then fully glow. The Australian filmmaker looked to his own childhood, raised by monks, to find the spiritual fairy tale that now manifests via the film’s eponymous Aboriginal child in a sweeping and poetic portrait of stifled faith and the threat of monopoly on religion.  Thornton’s cinema is one of enormous, orchestral music and vast landscapes that envelop and invite us in, even if you feel like you don’t know where you’re going or shouldn’t be allowed to look around. It’s the kind of culturally specific filmmaking that somehow immediately gains universality in that ambition to connect, to understand the empathy and sensitivity to listen in to these conflicts and this bright spark of a boy who speaks to struggles of faith however you were raised.  He is simply known as the New Boy, a nameless Aboriginal boy (a breakout turn from Aswan Reid, almost completely silent but beguiling) welcomed in by Sister Eileen (Cate Blanchett) at her fiercely protective remote monastery. It’s 1940s Australia in the middle of World War II, and the New Boy is captured by a horseback police patrol and dumped with Sister Eileen. But she does and will care for him — her faith is religious but also transcendent when it comes to her small group of boys. She works with the Church, but ultimately for those she cares for.  That includes two Aboriginal staff, George (Wayne Blair) and Sister Mum (prolific Australian TV actress and emotive standout Deborah Mailman) who, with Sister Eileen, nurture the next generation while reconciling multiple schools of thought in the name of survival. But Thornton often lenses the film with great beauty (acting as DoP as well as writer and director, alongside Jules Wurm as camera operator), as much in wide-open vistas of the wild bush in the wind as the fragility of a fly landing on Sister Eileen’s eyelid as she awakens from a nap. The world is harsh, challenging, but there is poetry in the hope that things can still grow and become beautiful.  It doesn’t hurt to have Nick Cave and Warren Ellis on scoring duties, arguably the best possible pairing to work with this out-of-reality remote way of living, engaging with the natural world, its parched fields and beating sun, while still injecting immense life and humanity — and so, hope — into everything that breathes. And that goes for a lot more things than you’d initially expect.  Everything changes for the New Boy — and for Sister Eileen — when a life-size carving of Christ on the cross arrives. Everybody knows what it means, but the New Boy doesn’t. He sees things the others don’t, and Reid’s angelic innocence is hypnotic to follow. He eventually manages two words after spending some time feeling his way through these things everybody seems to believe in: “Slut” and “Amen.” But the words don’t matter — his spark does. Thornton injects a childlike sense of wonder with literal glimmers of light, magic realism making its way into this stark, severe environment. Because when you’re a kid, out in a bold new world, it’s all you have.  The New Boy sees things in Christ that only he can. There’s movement — in his chest, his sighing eyebrows, in droplets of blood making a splash on the floor that nobody else can feel. It’s like nothing Sister Eileen has ever experienced, which pushes Blanchett’s own performance to extremes that the likes of Lydia Tár would shudder at. There’s deep emotion and vulnerability in Blanchett’s work, with its performance counteracting the New Boy’s calm and comfortable otherness with an almost overbearing dedication to care.  What Thornton is striving toward, an embrace of generosity, of humanity being able to change what faith and religion even mean, is often moving. But in ways that many cynics of the world we live in have long lost — that spark only touches those still letting it in. Reid plays the New Boy’s difference, almost beyond human, with surprising subtlety and restraint for such a raw performer (which is essential to capture that primal sense of survival at all costs). There’s conflict in everything, in the clashing of worlds and the fight for a world that makes sense to believe in, yet miraculous poetry and optimism somehow, too.  But then whatever seems like it’s taking us down a path shifts — and the spark is out. And even then, all is not lost (how could it ever be, with “Sing Sing Sing” by Benny Goodman just entering the show). The New Boy may have entered the community somewhat, changed paths just a little, but Sister Eileen’s community is entirely different than what it once was. Christianity must make room for Aboriginal spirituality, and all other schools of thought in the world we live in, full of new boys. That Thornton has found a language to tell this loud, and find magic in it, could be a tiny miracle in itself.  Grade: B+  “The New Boy” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vY3JpdGljaXNtL21vdmllcy90aGUtbmV3LWJveS1yZXZpZXctd2Fyd2ljay10aG9ybnRvbi1jYXRlLWJsYW5jaGV0dC0xMjM0ODY1Njg5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-18","14:00:00","{""Eldoret"", ""RiftValley"", ""Kenya""}","2023-05-20T21:03:39","Recently, I watched on TV a group of Christian evangelicals, Pentecostals and 'Charismatics' fielding a press conference castigating the appointment of a commission of inquiry and a task force to probe rogue preachers. They were hysterical and illogical in a manner that confirmed the necessity of pruning wayward religious groups.  What immediately struck me was that these Christian jihadists don’t want to understand there’s a big difference between a church, a sect and a cult. There are about 40,000 registered ‘churches’ in Kenya — a frighteningly large number which even much bigger countries don’t have.  A majority of Kenyans who describe themselves as Christian subscribe to five or six mainline denominations. The minority is crowded into numerous sects whose doctrines are shifty. Then in the mix are the cults: dark, sinister and sometimes criminal. These are one-man shows whose theological grounding is a blur.  To argue that in this morass official regulation must have no role is to make a proposition that is outlandish. Let’s be clear on one thing. Paul Mackenzie is not a flash in the pan. There are others like him in Kenya’s untidy religious terrain. Like Osama bin Laden, who took cover under Islam, hiding behind Christianity is a favourite tactic of many psychopaths.  Granted, not all of these oddballs believe in driving their brainwashed followers into committing mass suicide, and killing them when they refuse. Many will come posing quite innocuously. Yet you'll sense something is terribly wrong with them when they suddenly start styling themselves as Prophets or reincarnations of Jesus Christ, or even God himself. Their hypnotised followers believe them instantly.  In dealing with these deviants, the constitutionally mandated freedom to worship should not be treated as open-ended. We have certain misfits who use the name of God, but there's nothing holy about them. The authorities must not feel inhibited in cracking down hard.  Tighten the registration rules for religious groups. Make them stringent. Don’t fall to the demand for self-regulation. With these extreme outfits, that will never work. Let’s strengthen the office of the Registrar of Societies to regulate denominations and weed out the rogue ones. Insist that each preacher has proper training in theology. Deregister the fraudsters who peddle bogus miracles and those who preach the fake “prosperity gospel”.  I can’t leave out the political connection. Politicians have contributed immensely to the glorification of preachers who are well-known scoundrels. They lavish them with money and cars. In return, they get their support and that of their followers in their election campaigns. We have seen the pulpit being misused brazenly by politicians as the clergy clap approvingly.  Prayer meetings  Indeed the frequent “prayer meetings” where politicians and clergymen mingle have become indistinguishable from political rallies. This political nexus is not just unpleasant but dangerous. It feeds a narrative that unless one is “born again” he can't make a good leader. Yet as we see every day, morality and ethics know no religious persuasion.  I recognise the politicians who are sincere persons of faith, but they certainly are out of order when they seek to conflate the Church with those cultic monsters posing as Christians.  Cults revolve around a charismatic leader (usually self-appointed) who exercises excessive control over members, requiring unwavering devotion to a set of practices that are unorthodox or twisted.  Many sociologists note that these cult leaders exercise some toxic form of mind control on their followers, which leads them to behave abnormally. New religions are sometimes described as cults until they gain mainstream status. Many are generally benign, unlike the dangerous ones which cause havoc in society.  Eliud Wekesa, popularly known as 'Yesu wa Tongaren’, comes across as a fairly harmless mystic. I was not surprised when after he was arrested a court released him for lack of evidence. He had been accused of “endangering public safety” by giving himself the name Jesus. However, it was going to be tricky convicting him on that. What exactly is the crime in calling yourself Jesus? He is just a confused charlatan.  Kenya doesn't have a specific law on blasphemy. But there's an archaic offence in our Penal Code against ""insulting religion"" or something like that. However, unless they pin something more tangible on him like, say, stopping his followers from going to hospital when they fall sick, or prohibiting their children from attending school, calling himself Jesus or Buddha or Prophet Muhammad is just bizarre hot air on his part. I doubt it’s a crime.  From the same Bungoma County where 'Yesu wa Tongaren' hails from, there was another cultist who called himself 'Jehovah' Wanyonyi. When he died, wags commented that he had gone to heaven ""to be with himself"".  Well, well, well. I don't know if 'Yesu wa Tongaren' considers himself as 'Jehovah' Wanyonyi's heavenly son. When Good Friday approached, some fellows looking for some fun announced they would go for him and crucify him. They reasoned that if he was the real Jesus, he would resurrect anyway. The poor guy went into hiding.    * * * * * * *  I must commend the government for acting resolutely after details of the Kemsa scam and the contaminated sugar scandal emerged. The government acted swiftly in firing or suspending those who acted with laxity in allowing those scams to happen. Corruption must be fought relentlessly without pause.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9ibG9ncy1vcGluaW9uL29waW5pb24vZW1wb3dlci10aGUtcmVnaXN0cmFyLW9mLXNvY2lldGllcy10by13ZWVkLW91dC1yZWxpZ2lvdXMtY3VsdGlzdHMtLTQyNDE3NDbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-04-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T03:03:00","Typically, the media response to Operation Shield and Arrow was to blame Israel as the aggressor for the massive terrorist rocket attacks on the Jewish state last week. Once again, prominent global media outlets whitewashed Islamic Jihad’s extremism while creating an appalling moral equivalence with the IDF’s defensive actions.  With this past week’s Nakba Day receiving more favorable coverage this year than ever before, Israel finds itself playing defense against a growing chorus of media critics. In order to go on the offensive in the battle over Israel’s narrative, my organization, Israel365, will be leading an influential delegation of Israeli leaders to the National Religious Broadcasters Conference (NRB) in Orlando, Florida, this May 22-25.  For decades, NRB has been the hub for thousands of Conservative and Christian media leaders to gather together for high-level meetings and networking. This year, NRB has partnered with Israel365 to celebrate Israel’s 75th anniversary and together we have planned a number of important events for the faith community’s leading communicators.  Defending democracy against radicalism  Media personalities Dennis Prager, Eric Metaxes and Erick Stakelback will be speaking about why America and Israel must unite to defend democracy and fight against radicalism at our “Night to Celebrate Israel.” Religious leaders Rabbi Doron Perez of World Mizrachi, Pastor Tommy Waller of HaYovel and Samuel Rodriguez of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference will speak about Jews and Christians, changing the world together.  Israel365 News and The Jerusalem Post will be conducting interviews from the exhibition hall for two days. Israeli companies such as MyHeritage and Holy Gems, along with organizations such as Shiloh Israel Children’s Fund, Israel Defense and Security Forum and Yad L’Olim will have representatives in Orlando to meet with their Christian customers and donors.  Rabbi Tuly Weisz, editor of ‘The Israel Bible’ (credit: Courtesy)  A new documentary, Confront Radicals: What America Can Learn from Israel based on the book of the same name by David Rubin, will debut in front of distributors and broadcast partners in its worldwide premiere. Additionally, the Guardian of Israel Award will be presented to Sheriff Michael Chitwood for his role in combating antisemitism in Florida.  “Both Israel and the Jewish people are near and dear to the hearts of Evangelicals, and we are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate the miracle of Israel with our Israeli brothers and sisters at this special event this year,” said Troy Miller, president and CEO of NRB. “In partnering with Israel365, we have one clear message: we want Christians and Jews to do life together. We are eager to create a space where leaders from both faiths can spark relationships, do business and ministry together, and be an active part of each other’s lives. This is the vision God gives us through His word, and we want to be a part of that promise.”  Despite the increase in antisemitism and the decline in traditional backing for Israel, faith-based support for Israel has remained rock solid, thanks largely to the role of religious media. Christian networks including CBN, TBN, and Daystar all have television bureaus in Jerusalem keeping their massive audiences informed and engaged. By placing Israel at the forefront, the NRB, whose member organizations reach tens of millions of homes all over the world, contributes directly to stronger political backing for an increasingly marginalized State of Israel.  Christian support for Israel  The religious community’s positive news coverage about Israel has led to practical support in various arenas. Thanks to increased media visibility, philanthropic backing from Christian donors has increased significantly in recent years, as has the number of incoming Christian tourists. After centuries of hostility, we are thankfully in a new era of Jewish-Christian relations, and after seventy-five years of statehood, we are poised to embark upon a future of faith-based support for Israel that has massive potential.  The founding of the state in 1948 has led to new and significant religious trends. Secular Israelis have become less hostile towards religion than in previous decades while soaring birthrates in the religious community have caused a demographic shift resulting in a much more traditional Jewish State.  Around the world, Christians have rejected Replacement Theology and antisemitism in large numbers and have become Israel’s greatest supporters. These developments have created a historically unprecedented opportunity to nurture meaningful and healthy relationships between Christians and Jews.  Out of all the anniversary milestones, Jewish and Christian leaders celebrating Israel’s 75th anniversary together at the largest faith-based media gathering is a hopeful sign for all those who care about Israel. By uniting together, we can rewrite the narrative and change the way people around the world view Israel and the Jewish people.

"religious miracle","2023-04-30","Not Discerned","{""Colombo"", ""Colombo"", ""SriLanka""}","2023-05-21T00:42:11","No miracles but manacles await Pastor Jerome’s promised coming View(s):  Buddhist sensitivities were outraged this week after Jerome Fernando, the self-proclaimed prophet, made an unwarranted attack on the Buddha, casting him in inferior light to Jesus, and claiming the Buddha, born 500 years before Christ, was searching for Jesus’ light.  In a controversial video released on April 30 on his YouTube channel, he has not spared the other three main religions either. Islam, Hinduism and even his ancestral faith, Catholicism, get their equal share of public denigration.  The video, which went viral this week, shows the hot gospeller striding, like a cock on the walk, to and fro on a carpeted floor, dressed in branded clothing, sorrowing for Buddhists who have never heard of the Buddha’s love. He weeps for the Muslims who have never known love as a name for Allah among 99 other names. He pities the Hindus for their ignorance in worshipping animals as their Gods because they do not know, animals are sacred only because they are creations of his Almighty God. As for the Catholics, he says, they can get no hope from the Pope.  His congregation may have never heard of The Compassionate Buddha’s supreme love and kindness not only to humans but to all beings; or, having never known of the All Merciful and All Compassionate Allah, never could know that His 47th name al-Wadud meant ‘The Most Loving One’ or that the Hindus held Brahama – the Ultimate Reality – as their own Creator in the Hindu Triumvirate over 3000 years ago; or that the Pope had never been held out as a beacon of hope but only as infallible Servant of the Servants of God.  Jerome’s sweeping denunciation of other’s faiths in their religions’ founders and the trivialization of their age old beliefs, had the frenzied gallery of devotees rising to their feet, cheering, clapping, waiving hands in the air in ecstatic delight to hear they were the blessed children of a superior God, the most supreme, whose Prophet was Jerome.  If God had made man in His image, seems Jerome was striving to make God in his own.  The man who claims that God speaks to him in the night and uses him as His megaphone to convey His messages to Jerome’s flock of sheep, declared, ‘you may pray to St. Peter to help you. But St. Peter comes to me in the night and tells me to help you, for he is in heaven and I am the one on earth’.  At best, it was a cheap way to score brownie points by putting down another’s god and elevating his, boasting, ‘my god is greater than your god,’ in the puerile manner schoolboys brag, ‘my dad is bigger than your dad.’ Nothing more than a dash of evangelical hyperbole, pastors have in their repertoire and commonly use to fleetingly drive the captive audience to new egoistical heights.  He would have certainly assured the poor lost sheep that had strayed in from more ascetic flocks, they had strayed at last – Hallelujah – to an oasis where the grass grew greenest. Lost in rhapsodic joy, they, perhaps, forgot that to subject God to a shallow superiority contest is to traduce the eternal in profanity’s dust.  At worst, was it a calculated move to inflame bigotry’s simmering fires? Was his unwarranted attack on other religions as being barren of love, his callous disregard to the tender feelings of those embracing other faiths, his rough shod ride, trampling upon their religious petals without remorse, nay, with unbounded glee, and claiming sole monopolistic rights over God’s ‘apage’ – the Greek word for a love divine that transcends all other loves – part of a carefully choreographed plot to rake the coals of religion and provoke a backlash for vile political ends?  Or was the plan designed to enhance his mundane status from a mere evangelizing pastor, preaching his brand of the gospels to a local elitist cult, to that of a persecuted prophet, hounded by a Lankan religious mob, for spreading the Good Word, even as Jesus was by the Romans for preaching his message of love?  No doubt, western bleeding hearts would embrace him to their bosom and fill the till of his Glorious Church to launch an international crusade to stop the Sinhalese inquisition to deny a prophet his right to preach. Was it a cheap attempt to take the self-bestowed ‘prophet’ title to the next level, a rash bid to up the ante and risk losing even liberty and reputation, to gain the glory of a tyrannised prophet willing to be martyred for a holy cause?  Whatever the reason for his derogatory slurs on all the four main religions in the island, it could have swiftly led – in a nation, dangerously taut with racial and religious tension – to another damning round of communal violence. For that reason alone, it must be condemned.  Already on the fringes, the first stirrings of bigotry’s beast are being sounded to amass at battle stations.  Fortunately, the President took no chances. He pre-empted the chauvinistic call by swiftly ordering the police to investigate Jerome’s inflammatory comments. Furthermore, an intensive probe was ordered into his speeches and organisation. The President took the wind out of warped patriotism’s sails by declaring that he would not allow any individual to destabilize the country and said anyone instigating religious disharmony should be probed and stern action should be taken.  Pastor Jerome is, of course, no stranger to controversy. His close association with his mentor, the prophet of all prophets, the controversial Uebert Angel had raised many eyebrows, even among his adulating cult. On March 19 this year, he had begun his razzmatazz evangelical event at his ‘Miracle Dome’ speaking of angels.  It is a night to remember, for Jerome is about to manifest another miracle beneath his aptly named Miracle Dome. He says, ‘Joy is a tangible thing. It’s real. It’s a commodity of God. It’s a heavenly reality. It’s part of the real estate of Heaven. Listen to the words that are coming out of Prophet’s mouth. Joy is the oxygen of angels. Angels invade environments of joy.’  Lo and behold, no sooner he says those words, who enters? Well, speak of the angel. None but the angel himself, manifested in the flesh. The angel comes not direct from Heaven but all the way from Zimbabwe. As he strides into the Miracle Dome with a host of cherubs following him, Pastor Jerome falls prostrate. A reverent hush falls. And we are reminded of the words in Corinthians: ‘And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God.’  Jerome remains prostrate until the invading angel takes his seat. Then he rises, walks up to the seated angel and goes down on all fours in unabashed worship. Receiving the angel’s grace, he rises and says: ‘What was I just talking about? I said in a joyful environment, angels will come. I just said it and you see. My Father did tell me one day. “One day we will come without telling you’’. He said it to me. I said, Oh! Okay. I’ll wait for that day. But did I know it was today?’.  Glory to God. Jerome had shown his first miracle for the day. Then he begins to eulogize this dark angel who has miraculously materialised at his Miracle Dome in Ja-Ela and explains why this angel means so much to him.  He says of his angel, Uebert Angel: ‘I introduce to you my father, the master of prophecy – the Godfather of the prophetic movement – the ambassador of ambassadors – the diplomat of diplomats – hey, the one and only measure, there’s no two – the prophet to all prophets – a teacher to all teachers – angels learn from this angel – Angel, my one and only spiritual father’.  What wayward angels may have learnt from this ‘Teacher of all Teachers’, Uebert Angel, was revealed by Al Jazeera 4 days later.  The man whom the self- styled Prophet Jerome idolises and unabashedly worships as his one and only spiritual father, reveres as Prophet to all Prophets, holds as Teacher to all Teachers, and venerates as the Godfather of the Prophetic Movement was exposed by the international news channel as Godfather of a Zimbabwean gold smuggling and money laundering mafia.  In an undercover operation Al Jazeera’s investigative journalists secretly filmed Zimbabwe born British national Uebert Angel Mudzanire offering to use his diplomatic status as Zimbabwe’s Ambassador-at-Large to launder 1.2 billion dollars for the reporters who were posing as Chinese nationals.  Angel and his business partner Rikki Doolan also claimed that their laundering operations had the approval of Zimbabwean President Mnangagwa, who had made him ambassador and presidential envoy in March 2021.  He told reporters he would be able to carry large volumes of dirty cash into the country using his diplomatic status. Central to Angel’s gold-for-dirty money operations is Henrietta Rushwaya, the Zimbabwean President‘s niece. She told Angel and the reporters on a phone call that smuggling 100kg of gold each week would be no problem.  Following the revelations, published on March 23th by Al Jazeera, President Mnangagwa stripped Uebert Angel of his diplomatic status on March 30.  But there were more skeletons to come out from the Angel’s closet that had been rattling even earlier.  Born in Zimbabwe on September 6, 1975, he moved to England and set up his Spirit Embassy in 2007. He later rebranded it as the Good News Church. Later he was accused of fraud and racketeering by a former member of his Manchester church.  A proponent of a ‘prosperity’ gospel, he has faced criticism for peddling a pseudo-theological belief that the reward of financial and material gain is the divine will of God for all pious Christians. In a video released two months ago, Jerome praises Angel’s power to conjure miracle money.  He says, ‘My Father went to Nigeria’. Jerome shows a video of Uebert Angel proclaiming to his Nigerian audience, ‘If I be a Prophet of God, let miracle money appear now. It is happening.’ Jerome then cuts in to say, ‘the money began to appear in people’s handbags, wallets, multiply in their very hands.’ The video then shows Angel screaming with evangelistic fervour, ‘This raw money just appeared into the hands of this man. He has got four million naira in his bank account.’  Jerome was thoroughly impressed with his mentor’s feat. He says, ‘Ever since my Father came back, he was attacked by other apostles who asked “where is this in the Bible?”. They were attacking a man with 3 financial degrees who was a multi-millionaire. You know what this is called in the Bible? This is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, speaking against what God had just done’.  Though it left Jerome convinced, there was more to Angel’s miracles than met the eye. In January 2015, a Zimbabwean judge issued an arrest warrant after he failed to appear in court to answer fraud charges relating to a $300,000 Bentley. The warrant later cancelled in February 2016 when court was informed, the accuser had settled the matter out of court.  He has also been accused of sexual misconduct.  In one of several documented cases of sexual misconduct, Angel was accused of asking a female congregant to send him nude pictures of herself on Twitter and WhatsApp. The digital communication records were authenticated by Twitter for IP addresses.  He has faced other allegations of infidelity and has been unrepentant when confronted with evidence of his wrongdoing. ‘You see moral failure is not a crime’, he says.  But gold smuggling and money laundering are penal crimes. And moral transgressions. The fallout that fell from Al Jazeera’s shocking revelations enveloped Ja-Ela’s Miracle Dome in grime. And not all the waters in the nearby lagoon will wash one speck of it.  Only 4 days before the exposure, Miracle Dome’s Prophet Jerome had embraced the gold smuggling and money laundering racketeer, Uebert Angel, as his one and only spiritual father in front of his rapturous followers. Was this the fount, was this the source, the Pierian Spring from whence he drew his spiritual inspiration to deliver gratuitous lectures to ‘infidel’ Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Catholics to renounce their ancestral faiths and gain new birth on his glorious path to find Heaven’s riches on earth?  A mentor’s sins visit the protégé. And this prophet of prophets’ prophet, having cockily sown the wind, must now reap the whirlwind.  He had strode into every temple, mosque, kovil and church and shattered the idols enshrined in people’s hearts. He had remorselessly taken liberties with the nation’s religious tolerance and risked outstepping the ambit of its patience.  The police announced, on Thursday, Jerome Fernando will be arrestedw upon arrival at the BIA. Jerome has tweeted, he will be returning to Lanka on Sunday but is reported to have cancelled his scheduled Sunday sermon.  For those who have lost their moral compass and aimlessly drift to any port in storm, it‘s best to scour the original texts to regain their moral bearings. Helpful will be the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus says: ‘No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and money.’  And where Jesus warns: ‘Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.’  Share This Post FacebookTwitterEmail × Send Email to Friend            Send Please enter valid email WhatsappDeliciousDiggGoogleStumbleuponRedditTechnoratiYahooBloggerMyspaceRSS","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheXRpbWVzLmxrLzIzMDUyMS9jb2x1bW5zL3BvbGljZS1hd2FpdC10aGUtcHJvbWlzZWQtY29taW5nLW9mLXBhc3Rvci1qZXJvbWUtYXQtYWlycG9ydC10b2RheS01MjA1MzUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"religious miracle","2023-05-21","10:00:00","{""Katunayaka"", ""Gampaha"", ""SriLanka""}","2023-05-21T00:42:11","Pastor Jerome under the radar, CID to probe the big bucks behind his church View(s):  By Sandun Jayawardana and Damith Wickramasekara  A wide-ranging criminal investigation into Pastor Jerome Fernando, now at the centre of a controversy, will look into his finances and how vast sums of money came to maintain his massive church complex in Katunayake, which authorities confirm is unregistered.  Pastor Fernando, a self-styled “prophet,” describes himself on his website as the senior overseer of the Glorious Church in Colombo, which is part of the Glorious Global Church. The Glorious Church’s main complex in Katunayake, known as the “Miracle Dome” however, is not registered with the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs as a place of worship, subject Minister Vidura Wickramanayaka told the Sunday Times. “We have forwarded the details we have on the matter to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to take action within the legal framework,” Minister Wickramanayaka said.  Registration is not mandatory and the church has not broken the law by not registering “Miracle Dome” with his ministry, noted the minister. The issue however, has prompted the Buddhasasana Ministry to take action. There are places of worship from all religions in the country that are not registered, Mr Wickramanayaka said. The minister is now preparing to submit a Cabinet paper proposing to make it a legal requirement for all religious centres and places of religious worship to register with the authorities. He claimed the move is aimed at protecting the adherents of the religions, clergy and the centres and places of worship.  The pastor’s recent allegedly derogatory comments regarding several religions have been widely condemned, with some even calling for his arrest. “No one is allowed to defame a religion or religious leader in public like that,” Minister Wickramanayaka said.  The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had received five complaints against the pastor as of Friday (19). They relate to his alleged derogatory comments on Lord Buddha, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. Based on the complaints, detectives are also investigating him over alleged money laundering activities, a senior CID officer disclosed.  While the CID obtained an overseas travel ban on pastor Fernando from the Colombo Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday (16), he had already left the country by then. Taking to his official Instagram page, he told his followers that he was presently travelling on “pre-scheduled official matters pertaining to the ministry” and will be back in Sri Lanka today (21). He invited them to be present at the vast “Miracle Dome” complex of his church in Katunayake at 10 a.m. that day for “Mega Church Day.”  Sources said the pastor was also flying to Malaysia from Singapore. Photographs uploaded to Instagram on Friday evening showed the pastor leading a prayer meeting in Malaysia.  Though an announcement posted on Wednesday (17) on his social media pages urged followers to await a “special broadcast” from pastor Fernando, no such broadcast was made.  On Friday, messages were sent out to the pastor’s followers informing them that Sunday’s Service scheduled to be held at the “Miracle Dome” has been cancelled. Church attendees have been told to celebrate the Sunday Service at their respective branches today.  The CID has the power to arrest the pastor on arrival under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on charges of creating religious and communal disharmony, the CID source said. The department will also be looking into other crimes he is accused of in the complaints, notably money laundering and whether there are others in Sri Lanka who might be linked to such activities.  Pastor Fernando’s website claims that he graduated in theological studies at the Asian Access School of Theology, which is affiliated with the Gordon Cornwell University of Theology, USA. He is also listed as the Chancellor of Osborne University of Theology, UK, appointed by his “Spiritual Father,” Zimbabwean “prophet” Uebert Angel.  In March this year, “prophet” Angel was exposed by Qatar based television channel Al Jazeera’s Investigation Unit (I-Unit) telling undercover reporters that he could use his status as a diplomat to launder millions of dollars through a gold smuggling racket.  Angel, who had been appointed ambassador-at-large and a presidential envoy by Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, told undercover reporters, posing as Asian criminals, that he could carry large amounts of “dirty money” into the country using his high diplomatic status. The money would then be exchanged for Zimbabwe’s gold, which the recipients could in turn sell for legitimate money, thus turning their cash clean. Angel has since denied the allegations, with his office issuing a lengthy statement insisting that Al Jazeera’s recorded episode with fake investors was a “well-crafted” ploy to trap the ambassador and tarnish his image.  Angel was in Sri Lanka less than a week before the Al Jazeera story broke. Video posted on Pastor Fernando’s YouTube channel shows him apparently showing up unannounced at the Katunayake “Miracle Dome” on March 19 while pastor Fernando is preaching.  The “Miracle Dome” complex has attracted much scrutiny in the wake of the controversy over questions regarding how it came to be built, as well as who and how it was funded. Construction of the complex began around 2015 and it was officially opened in May last year. The complex is described as a 5000-seat “House of God.”  Given that there are regulations surrounding the building of a place of religious worship, Rev.Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando of the Catholic Church questioned how pastor Fernando had been allowed to build such a vast complex. “We can’t build a church just like that. There are regulations we must follow. Did he get the proper approvals to build this complex?” he queried. The senior Catholic priest also expressed surprise that authorities had not taken action to investigate the pastor earlier given his close association to Uebert Angel.  Approval to build “Miracle Dome” was not given by elected members of the Katunayake-Seeduwa Urban Council, claimed former Council Chairman Chamith Nishantha Fernando. “Construction began at a time the local authorities had been dissolved. You will recall that local authorities were run by the secretaries from 2015 to 2018, just as they are now. We had no part in approving it and I believe it was council officials who gave the go ahead for the construction, though I cannot definitely say which officials were responsible,” said the chairman. He said as far as he is aware, approval had been sought to build a “convention centre” at the site and there had been no mention that it would serve as a place of religious worship.  Urban Development Authority (UDA) Director General Prasad Ranaweera said he is unaware whether proper approval had been obtained from his authority to construct the “Miracle Dome” complex. “We have not been made aware of this issue until now but it is certainly something we will have to look into,” he told the Sunday Times.  Meanwhile, a fundamental rights petition was filed in the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday (18) by several petitioners requesting the SC to order the IGP to arrest pastor Jerome Fernando for allegedly making remarks that are insulting to Buddhism and other religions.  The seven petitioners include Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera and Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera. The petition has cited 16 respondents, including the IGP, the Director of the CID, the Minister of Public Security and the Attorney General.  The petitioners note that alleged derogatory comments made by pastor Fernando regarding several religions including Lord Buddha and Buddhism have circulated widely on social media. They claim that the comments are an obstacle to religious harmony and a serious threat to religious and communal co-existence. The petitioners have urged the SC to order the IGP and other officials to conduct an investigation into the pastor under the ICCPR Act.  The Sunday Times attempted to contact pastor Fernando’s Glorious Church for comment. The operator who answered the call at the church’s “Faithline” said details will be passed to the pastor’s office and if it cared to respond, it will get back to us. However, no response had been received at the time this edition went to press.

"miracle","2023-03-07","Not Discerned","{""SpringHope"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:03:00","A family is suing a small town in Nash County over a 30-mile police pursuit that left an innocent wife and mother with “catastrophic” injuries.  Police said the chase started on Nash Street in Spring Hope on March 7, 2021 after Terry Harris sped away from an officer who was trying to stop him for speeding. Harris was traveling 57 MPH in a 35 MPH zone.  The pursuit, which reached speeds of 120 MPH, ended at the intersection of Poole and Smithfield roads in Knightdale when Harris ran a red light and crashed into Carolyn Bonner’s car.  Bonner spent 88 days in the hospital after suffering a traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.  Two years later, Bonner is still not talking, walking or responding.  “It just breaks my heart,” said Al Bonner. “When I saw that situation, I had no strength. It’s from that point to now that we have been living off the grace and love of God.”  Carolyn and Al Bonner have been married for 31 years. Before the crash, he said his wife was working full-time, volunteering and caring for her elderly mother. Ever since the crash, Mr. Bonner has been caring for his wife with around-the-clock help from home health nurses.  “She was extremely, extremely active so this is a complete 180,” said Mr. Bonner. “I know she’s looking out the window and hoping and thinking her life is totally different than what it was.”  On March 7 — the two-year anniversary of the crash — Bonner filed a lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court against Officer Lashawn Lucas, the Spring Hope Police Department and the Town of Spring Hope. The lawsuit claims Officer Lucas and his supervisors were negligent in continuing the high-speed chase.  The lawsuit alleges, “Officer Lucas breached his duty of care…by initiating and continuing a lengthy, high-speed chase because of a routine speeding offense [and] by failing to stop the chase when it became readily apparent that the chase was likely to endanger the lives and safety of innocent civilians.”  Andrew DeIonno, Spring Hope town manager, said in an email “the town doesn’t comment on pending litigation.”  “Officer Lucas has never had a disciplinary action since his employment as a police officer,” said DeIonno.  In a court filing, the town’s lawyer denied claims of negligence and argued the town was not responsible for damages under governmental immunity which protects police departments in many situations from liability if something happens in the course of carrying out the duties of a job.  Philip Miller, an attorney representing the Bonner family, said his lawsuit is challenging governmental immunity.  “We fully appreciate the difficulty of the legal challenges we face,” Miller said. “The governmental immunity defense is a huge hurdle. However, we also firmly believe that this police chase that ended with Carolyn Bonner suffering catastrophic and life changing injuries should never have happened in the first place.”  Mr. Bonner hopes the lawsuit will prevent similar chases in the future.  “Major decisions have consequences and we are living with those consequences,” Mr. Bonner said. “What we would hope for is a major reduction of not having to go through what we have to go through.”  Despite his wife’s poor prognosis, Mr. Bonner said he is hoping for a miracle that her condition will improve over time.  “She always used to say — her statement when she saw other people in tough situations — that God is a restorer. So, we say that back to her.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2h1c2JhbmQtc3Vpbmctc3ByaW5nLWhvcGUtcGQtb3Zlci1jaGFzZS1jcmFzaC10aGF0LWNyaXRpY2FsbHktaW5qdXJlZC13aWZlLW9mLTMxLXllYXJzLzIwODcwMjQ5L9IBImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL2FtcC8yMDg3MDI0OS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

OPA-LOCKA, Fla. – Lorenzo Shine is known in the streets of northern Miami-Dade County as “Du Du” or “Blaze” and over the years his reputation in Opa-locka also earned him the street moniker “Shine Murda,” records show.  At 30 years old, detectives in Opa-locka have already come to know Shine as a gang member who has wasted years of his life in Florida jails and prisons, records show. Under the threat of spending many more behind bars, he was at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on Saturday held without bond.  It took detectives from the Miami Gardens, Opa-locka, and Hollywood police departments to put him there, records show. He was facing seven charges: Prosecutors filed a new case on Thursday with two charges after a Miami-Gardens police arrest and a new case on Friday with five charges for an Opa-locka shooting.  Shine’s Florida Department of Corrections file had a promise: Had he stayed out of trouble, his probation would have ended in 2027. But detectives reported he returned to Opa-locka — where for decades gang feuds have erupted into fusillades of bullets time and time again.  Before Shine was even born, Opa-locka’s Wall gang was already fighting turf wars. He was 5 when the feds arrested a man known as the “Mayor of Opa-locka” because he was the city’s main heroin and cocaine supplier.  Shine was a teen when the feds caught 33 alleged members of the Young and Holsey gangs. He was 18 when Miami-Dade police officers arrested him for burglary, and grand theft of a vehicle, records show.  Even some of the city of employees got caught up in crime. Shine was 19 when the feds accused a police captain of being a Back Blues gang member, and the feds would later find public corruption ran deep there.  Just before his 21st birthday, Shine was arrested again for armed burglary and robbery, and before his conviction, he got arrested for another armed burglary and a probation violation, records show. He remained in a Florida prison until June 16, 2018, but it didn’t take long for him to make headlines when he was involved in a drive-by shooting that changed the lives of two football players.  Shine confessed to his involvement in the Opa-locka drive-by shooting that injured Florida International University’s Mershawn Miller, an offensive guard, and Anthony Jones, a running back, records show. Both athletes survived and the NFL went on to refer to the case as the “Miami Miracle.”  Shine went back to prison in 2019 until corrections freed him last year, and a probation violation turned him into a fugitive, records show. The 6-foot, 2-inch tall convicted felon was injured when an argument escalated into a shootout that police say put others’ lives at risk, records show.  A confidential informant and surveillance videos at the crime scene and at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood helped detectives to identify Shine as a suspect, records show. Police officers arrested him on Tuesday and he was facing charges of third-degree grand theft and resisting arrest for the Miami-Gardens case, records show.  For the Opa-locka shooting, police officers rearrested Shine on Wednesday at TGK and he was facing two counts of attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, using a firearm while committing a felony, possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, and discharging a firearm in public.  Shine’s arraignment hearing is set at 9:30 a.m., on June 7, before Miami-Dade Circuit Juge Zachary James, who is presiding over both of the pending cases.

Schwarzbek had been serving as acting principal since February.  The special meeting took place at the unusual time of 2:30 p.m. on Friday, May 19, and brought more attendees than could fit in the room – including many teachers and school staff members present to support Schwarzbek’s appointment.  Not everyone was in favor of the hiring committee’s desired candidate. Some parents came to raise concerns about how ELHS administration has operated since Schwarzbek arrived in January of 2020 and shared negative experiences they say they have had with her.  Staff support was clear  One overwhelming feature of the meeting was the resounding support from school staff for Schwarzbek.  Social Studies Teacher Mark Pontoni said when the East Lansing Education Association (the teachers’ union) surveyed its members, more than 80 percent expressed “strong support” or “very strong support” for Schwarzbek.  Teachers showed up in force to support Schwarzbek at the meeting. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  “Getting 80 percent of any group to agree on anything these days in this country probably qualifies as a legit miracle,” Pontoni said.  Computer Science and Engineering Teacher Kevin Mayes, who was on the hiring committee, said that Schwarzbek was by far the best candidate. He also praised the turnaround the district experienced under Schwarzbek’s leadership. Earlier in the year, ELHS was seeing extraordinary levels of violence and endured a scandal when, according to Superintendent Dori Leyko, it was discovered former principal Shannon Mayfield had presented fraudulent evidence of a degree.  “This marking period was easily one the best that I’ve had as an educator and I’m starting to get a long career,” Mayes said. “In the middle of the year ,when this building was on fire, I was going ‘Man, I love East Lansing and these kids, but is this what I want to be doing?’”  “[Schwarzbek] did an amazing job,” he continued.  Ashley Schwarzbek leading students on Senior Day, the same day she was named principal of East Lansing High School. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  Several other teachers spoke up to praise Schwarzbek’s leadership through a myriad of challenges during her stint with the district.  “Our teachers are ready to break,” Social Studies Teacher Ross Gorman said. “We’ve been through a pandemic…. We’ve been through a gun inside, we’ve been through a gun outside, we’ve had a questionable principal to say the least and Ashley was the one there that kept us showing up, that kept us doing what we needed to be doing.”  Ultimately, the Board of Education voted unanimously to approve Schwarzbek, largely due to the outpouring of support displayed by staff.  “I never worked for a principal that this room would have filled up for,” Trustee Amanda Cormier said.  Parents raised concerns about bias, disciplinary measures  The approval shared by school staff members was not felt by some parents in attendance. Parents spoke out about negative experiences they had with Schwarzbek and concerns about approaches administration has taken to discipline in recent years.  Speaking on behalf of the East Lansing Parent Advocacy Team (ELPAT), Shari Brooks requested that the offer to Schwarzbek be rescinded and the job be reposted.  Shari Brooks speaking to the Board of Education on May 19, 2023. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  “Through community conversations, parental engagement and student feedback, we learned that behaviors, specifically those of Ashley Schwarzbek…were condescending, demeaning, inequitable, lacked integrity, unhelpful and unnecessarily harsh,” Brooks said.  Brooks and other speakers opposed “exclusionary discipline” measures employed by the school like suspension and moving students to Graduation Alliance, an online program. Brooks said these measures are disproportionately applied to students of color.  “The academic gap is widening amongst students identifying as BIPOC versus those identifying as white,” Brooks said.  Another parent who said they are a member of ELPAT said if Schwarzbek is to lead the school, they’d like to see growth from her in nonviolent communication and work around implicit biases and trauma.  ELHS staff and school board see conversation as opportunity to grow  Despite differing views and, at times, harsh words there was clear respect between ELPAT and the teachers and Board members that supported Schwarzbek’s promotion.  Interim Associate Principal Jeff Lampi at the board meeting on May 19, 2023. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  “I believe we need voices in our community and groups like ELPAT,” said Interim Associate Principal Jeffrey Lampi during a speech in support of Schwazbek receiving the job. “The quote is ‘Iron sharpens iron.’”  Brandy Branson, a parent who spoke against Schwarzbek’s appointment, took time to thank Lampi for helping her child when she returned to make additional comments. She and Gorman also exchanged a handshake after his comments in support of Schwarzbek.  Former ELHS Principal Andrew Wells, who spent 34 years working in the district, urged stakeholders to communicate respectfully and pointed out Schwarzbek has never been a sole decision maker that created the issues that exist. He also highlighted the fact that Schwarzbek was tasked with tackling unprecedented challenges.  Former ELHS Principal Andy Wells at the board meeting on May 19, 2023. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  “Quite frankly, this pandemic put us in a very interesting situation,” Wells said. “We had students come back to the school house who were still stuck in seventh grade. They were out for two years.”  Wells said he and Schwarzbek did not always agree on things, but they were able to work together well.  ELHS Associate Principal Quiana Davis said the issues surrounding diversity raised by parents are real. As a Black administrator serving on a staff that is disproportionately white compared to the student body, Davis sees many of the challenges students of color face.  “Anyone who feels like they are opposed or marginalized tends to gravitate towards my office and that’s heavy,” she said.  Davis said she feels she can push back against positions Schwarzbek takes and that she listens to differing views. Those are a couple of the reasons she feels Schwarzbek is capable of leading the district to make needed improvements.  Board Treasurer Kath Edsall (left) and Board Vice President Elizabeth Lyons at the May 19, 2023, meeting. (Julie Seraphinoff for ELi)  Board Treasurer Kath Edsall said the meeting was positive in her eyes because of the conversation that took place. She said the issues parents raised are very real but they cannot all be attributed to Schwarzbek.  “We have families whose children were suspended, expelled, sent to Graduation Alliance as if they are not our kids,” Edsall said. “We have staff who feel the status quo of suspension [or] expulsion is the best solution to students who don’t respond to their traditional way of doing things. In the middle is a principal who is being blamed for more than she could have possibly done or being given credit for more than she could have possibly done.”  Multiple board members said that comments from parents will be used during Monday’s board meeting, when goals for the district will be set.

These things happen,"" the homeowner told ABC13 as he stood outside of the now-uninhabitable home where he's lived for 30 years.  Clear Lake-area home catches fire after speeding driver crashes into it, police say  HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- A driver lost control and crashed into a home in the Clear Lake area overnight, sparking a fire, according to police.  The homeowner was just feet away from the point of impact. His home is now uninhabitable.  The crash happened around 12:15 a.m. Friday at a home on Kelbrook Drive near Manorhill Drive, in a neighborhood near Highway 3 and El Camino Boulevard.  When Houston fire officials arrived at the home, they found a sedan crashed head-first into the front of the home. Flames were coming out of the roof, but firefighters were able to extinguish them quickly.  ""When the car hit the structure, it caught fire,"" George Nicasio with HFD said. ""We got the fire under control pretty quickly. We had some structural stability on alpha, which prevented it a little bit, but the guys did a great job.""  Video from a neighbor shows the moment the car came crashing into the home.  In the midst of everything that happened, Scott Sandler still managed to smile when he spoke to ABC13. There's a big hole in the house he's lived in for 30 years, but he said he knows things could have been worse.  ""If it weren't for that outer wall, things could have been more severe for me, but the outer wall slowed up a lot of the momentum,"" Sandler said.  The driver was treated at the scene for minor injuries. No one inside the house was hurt, HFD said.  Investigators are looking into whether or not alcohol played a factor. The driver was reportedly speeding before he lost control for unknown reasons and crashed into the house.  Neighbors described the moment of impact.  ""I heard some bumping and crashing, and then I heard the big crash of the car going into the home. It really scared me. I was worried someone got hurt,"" Judy Verdusco said. ""I grabbed my husband and said, 'Hey, let's get outside. I think there's a bad accident. We need to go help.'""  Sandler said he grabbed his three dogs and got out of the house as fast as he could. He's diabetic, so eventually crews had to go back and retrieve his medicine and wallet. He thinks his electronics and pretty much everything else is unsalvageable.  As he works with insurance, finds a hotel, and works on next steps, he's taking things in stride.  ""Little bit numb, honestly, because of how much that is gone. Mostly, property interior, so, not angry. What's there to be angry about? These things happen,"" Sandler said.  A firefighter had to go to the hospital with a minor injury to his hand, officials said.  Given the damage, it's a miracle no one else was seriously hurt.

"miracle","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Edwardsville"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:09:20","EDWARDSVILLE — Multiple zoning issues, including zoning requests, changes in zoning regulations regarding wind and solar farms, and the demolition of an unsafe house were among items approved by the Madison County Board at Wednesday’s meeting.  The board approved text amendments, or changes to the zoning code, regarding solar and wind-powered zoning requests. While there is little application for wind-powered zoning, there is again an increasing number of requests for solar farms, including two approved that night.  Text amendments are done periodically to make sure zoning regulations are current. These changes were required because of changes in state law and there is a time limit on making those changes.  The Building and Zoning Department is also looking at other text amendments to be considered at a later date.  Also approved were eight zoning requests. In addition to two regarding solar farms, the other big issue was allowing chickens in residential areas.  Two requests were approved, although a requested variance to allow 10 chickens instead of the normal five was voted down.  There was some discussion on the issue, in part because as more people are requesting special use permits to keep chickens, many are requesting variances for more than five allowed under current zoning regulations.  Board members said one reason was the baby chicks are often sold in pairs or multiples of two.  Also approved was a resolution allowing the demolition of property at 2245 Miracle Ave., Granite City.  In other business, the board approved paying $108,165 for roof repairs for one of the Highway Department buildings. The contract is with Lakeside Roofing, and most of the cost is being reimbursed through insurance.  The board also approved spending $206,000 for a building addition to Special Service Area 1. The work will be done by R.W. Boeker Inc. of Hamel.  The board also approved $350,000 for preliminary engineering services to replace the Pilla Bridge, which carries Old Carpenter Road over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Hamel Township. Oates Associates of Collinsville will perform the work.  An agreement to pay $150,000 for preliminary engineering services to replace the deck of the Alhambra-Livingston Bridge over Silver Creek in Alhambra Township was also approved.

Laura Kelly and her husband Cheyne's lives were 'turned upside down' when they received the news their then-16-month-old son Noah has pineoblastima stage 4 brain cancer.  The pair knew something was wrong but said doctors put Noah's strange symptoms down to a virus and issues with his eye muscles before an MRI eventually uncovered a tumour in his brain 'the size of a small mandarin'.  Noah, now 19 months, is Laura and Cheyne's 'miracle' baby after they struggled through four years of fertility issues and two miscarriages.  'It was such a miracle for us to bring Noah earthside after a difficult fertility journey,' the Sydney mum said.  Parents of Noah Kelly (pictured) has spoken out urging mums and dads to 'trust their gut' after a change in their son's eye movement turned out to be a symptoms of a rare brain tumour  Laura Kelly (right) and her husband Cheyne's (left) lives were 'turned upside down' when they received the news Noah has pineoblastima stage 4 brain cancer at 16 months old  'There are so many beautiful children that are riddled with this devastating disease, but when it is your own, it really hits home and your whole world comes crashing down.'  In February, they noticed Noah's right eye was turning inwards. He then started having difficulty walking and became more irritable.  They quickly arranged an appointment with an ophthalmologist before Noah became sick at daycare with a fever and lethargy.  'We planned to travel to the Emergency Department at Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick around 8am the next morning to find out what was going on,' Laura said.  'In the middle of the night, Noah threw up and we found him shaking with a fever, so we drove over to ED at 3am.'  The doctor assigned to Noah said his fever was due to a virus but didn't see any need to look into the issue with his right eye.  'They concluded his cross-eye was due to an issue with his eye muscles and suggested it could be resolved using either glasses or eye patches,' Laura said.  Noah has had five surgeries in just over two months and has started chemotherapy to treat the tumour in his brain which is the size of 'a small mandarin'  What is Pineoblastoma? Pineoblastoma is a type of cancerous (malignant) tumour that grows in a part of the brain known as the pineal gland. It occurs mainly in children. Symptoms of Pineoblastoma include a buildup of fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus), headaches, nausea, and difficulty with eye movement. The cause of Pineoblastoma is unknown, but specific inherited genetic variants in two genes, RB1 and DICER1 can increase the risk for a Pineoblastoma. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. In addition, a biopsy is often done to examine a small piece of tumour tissue under the microscope.

However, the consultation with the eye specialist raised alarms when they said there wasn't any issues with Noah's eye muscles, but that the optic nerve was swollen.  'This is a much serious matter, so we immediately proceeded back to ED and get put on the waiting list for an MRI,' Laura said.  The MRI found a large mass on Noah's brain and doctors ordered emergency surgery the next day to perform a biopsy and relieve the pressure impacting his eye.  'It was devastating news to receive, and nothing any parent wants to hear about their baby,' Laura said.  'There was a 10 day waiting period between the biopsy being performed and confirming the results. The hardest part was the waiting.'  The results confirmed any parent's worst nightmare - Noah had a stage four Pineoblastoma, a rare and fast-growing type of brain cancer.  The little boy has undergone more than five brain surgeries in just over two months since the news of his cancer.  One of the operations was an emergency procedure he had to have just days after starting chemotherapy which will make his recovery more challenging.

'Having your whole life instantly turn upside down is a tough one but you need to quickly adapt,' Laura said.  'Simple things, like spending time together as a family and celebrating special milestones have been impacted as it is difficult to plan when Noah will be well enough to experience activities together.'  The parents are also struggling to deal with the rising cost of living and interest rate rises on top of Noah's medical bills.  'Work has been supportive, but once your leave has run out, the loss of income you are facing becomes apparent for such a long journey ahead,' Laura said.  'One parent's income and career are put on hold to change to a full-time carer role. The other parent is torn between being away from Noah versus finding time for work, which also ends in a reduced wage.'  Laura and Cheyne spend every moment they can by Noah's side and say it is an 'easy decision' to forgo both salaries during times when he is well enough to leave hospital.

'His vision now appears to be back to normal and he was close to regaining his crawling strength and attempted a few unassisted steps after being mostly bedridden for the last two months.'  However Laura and Cheyne are feeling the pinch and relying on support from family and friends, two of whom have created a GoFundMe page to raise some much-needed money for the family.  'The community around you is important in tough times like these. Most people feel helpless in what they can do but we are very grateful of all our family and friends who have reached out and given support,' Laura said.  'Whether that be cooking meals for us or sitting with Noah while he sleeps so we can grab a coffee and get some fresh air. The kindness of strangers and small business owners has blown us away.'  One of the most valuable lessons Laura has learned through Noah's illness is that parents should always trust their gut and instinct when it comes to their child's health.  'As parents you know your child the best. If you feel something isn't right, continue to advocate for them,' she said.  'There have been a few times we've been turned away by medical staff and then something serious happens that may have been prevented.'","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL3JlYWwtbGlmZS9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMDcxNDI3L011bS1iYWJ5LXJhcmUtYnJhaW4tY2FuY2VyLWlzc3Vlcy13YXJuaW5nLXBhcmVudHMtZGlzbWlzc2VkLWRvY3RvcnMuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL3JlYWwtbGlmZS9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMDcxNDI3L2FtcC9NdW0tYmFieS1yYXJlLWJyYWluLWNhbmNlci1pc3N1ZXMtd2FybmluZy1wYXJlbnRzLWRpc21pc3NlZC1kb2N0b3JzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Most recently, he started signing athletes to Name, Image and Likeness deals to spread his HOLO message — Hope and Love. His first signing was Montana State quarterback Tommy Mellott, who started a mental health awareness campaign with HOLO.  “What I really want to do is bring in people who a lot of people look up to,” Swensson said. “Every kid looks up to Tommy all across the state, whether you're a Bobcat fan, a Griz fan, everyone looks up to him. He's a role model for absolutely everybody.”  But Swensson took a different approach with his next signing, 8-year old Troy Ross.  ""So I actually came across Troy at a school assembly that I was doing in Great Falls,” Swensson said. ""And that's kind of where I heard about Troy and about his story. And that really stuck with me.""  In 2017, Troy was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder at 3 years old and nearly lost his life. Five years later he is in remission but he and his family remain strong advocates for helping others, organizing an annual #TroyStrong blood drive throughout the state that has potentially saved thousands of lives.  “Having to go through something like he did with autoimmune disease at that young age and I knew what he was doing with the blood drives, and I guess I wanted to help with that,” Swensson said. “And that's kind of our mission is to help make an impact.”  Troy and Luc met the night before one of Luc’s Imagine, Believe, Achieve assemblies at Riverview elementary. They hit if off quickly.  “We kind of talked about what Troy had gone through some of the darkest times in his life, some of the most amazing opportunity his and truly what a miracle took place with him,” said Troy’s dad Wes Ross. “Luc and his father (Thor) reached out to me the morning of the assembly and said they'd like to sign Troy to the HOLO brand. And I was blown away that they would like to do that.”  Swensson and HOLO are offering a branded #TroyStrong merchandise line with all proceeds going towards the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Seattle Children’s Hospital.  “Every piece of clothing that is sold, all the proceeds would go straight to Troy and give him the ability to give back to the places that saved his life,” Swensson said. ""I don't want to take anything from that, so I won't get anything from my shirts. Everything is going to go straight to him, for him to give back to those places and do his own blood drives.”  It’s a mission the Ross family can get behind.  “If it helps people remember to donate blood or leave this world a better place, we’re all for it,” Wes said. “We’ll see what happens in the future, but for the last five years that’s just been who Troy is.""

"miracle","2019-03-14","09:00:00","{""Strawberry"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T03:00:00","PHOENIX — More than 10 years after his hand began involuntarily and rhythmically shaking, a 78-year-old Phoenix man has been relieved of his symptoms thanks to a new, non-invasive treatment offered at Barrow Neurological Institute.  “Patients are amazed at the results. Many are in tears with how immediate and impressive the effect is,” Dr. Francisco Ponce said.  Jim Kurtz, an Arizona State University alumnus who worked many years as a sales manager for a company headquartered in Phoenix, said he first recognized the tremor at a business meeting.  “I remember it so vividly. I had poured a cup of coffee, and when I went to lift it, my left hand started to shake so much that I completely emptied the cup,” Kurtz said.  Over time, Kurtz’ tremor grew worse and medication only reduced some of the shaking. He lost the ability to type on a keyboard and write with his left hand.  He was diagnosed with essential tremor, the most common movement disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 10 million people. It is a neurological condition not related to Parkinson’s disease that causes involuntary and rhythmic shaking.  While it’s generally viewed as a non-threatening disease, the impacts of ET on everyday life can be disabling, impairing patients’ ability to eat, drink, shave and write, as well as perform hobbies, housework, and workplace tasks.  “One day, I just decided to try calling Barrow because I knew of their great reputation,” says Kurtz.  After evaluation by movement disorder neurologist Dr. Justine Chan at Barrow’s Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center in 2020, Kurtz learned he might be a candidate for deep brain stimulation (DBS), another innovative treatment used for various neurological conditions such as essential tremor and Parkinson’s.  “DBS seemed too scary for me and my wife, Diane, at the time,” Kurtz recalls. “I know it works wonders and can be a miracle for some patients, but it just wasn’t something I was ready for.”  So, Kurtz lived with the tremor until recently. He read an article about a new technique using ultrasound technology and was immediately intrigued. It turned out Barrow had started offering the procedure and Kurtz was a candidate.  “When I met with Dr. Ponce, everything he said made sense,” says Kurtz. “The procedure is irreversible, and that was a little scary, so I went home and did a lot of research. I told Diane I needed to do this and that was that. I had a lot of faith in Barrow and Dr. Ponce.”  Kurtz underwent the groundbreaking procedure in March. Requiring an incredible amount of precision, the procedure can take three to four hours. Patients lie in an MRI tube which guides where Dr. Ponce directs each set of ultrasound beams. Doctors use a spiral test before, during and after the procedure to illustrate effectiveness.  “When we were only about three quarters of the way through, I could write with my left hand again. The tremor was almost gone,” he said. “By the end, my tremor was completely gone. I hadn’t been able to clearly follow a spiral with a pen like that in more than 10 years!”  Kurtz, who now resides in Strawberry, Ariz., says he missed the small things that really were big moments in his life, like carrying a hot cup of coffee in each hand to meet his wife of 23 years for their daily coffee date.  “Every morning since we both retired, we sit together and read the news while drinking coffee. For the first time in almost a dozen years, I can carry two cups at once. I don’t have to make two trips, or send her to get her own cup,” Kurtz adds.  Focused ultrasound was first approved by the FDA to treat essential tremor in 2016, the noninvasive, therapeutic technology was not approved by Medicare in all U.S. states until July 2020. Dr. Ponce, a world leader in DBS surgeries, performed Arizona’s first procedure for a patient with essential tremor at Barrow in Oct. 2022.  Follow @KTAR923  We want to hear from you.

The baby girl was found in good condition in a wooded area in Forsyth County on the night of June 6, authorities said. A local family told ABC News' Good Morning America at the time they had heard crying and called 911 after finding the newborn in a plastic bag.  The baby, temporarily named India, was likely born within hours of being found, authorities said. Her umbilical cord was still attached.  The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office released remarkable body camera footage of first responders recovering the baby from the scene in the weeks following the discovery as they attempted to identify her.  The Forsyth County Major Crimes Unit has been ""tirelessly working"" on the ""Baby India"" case ever since, and on Thursday morning, deputies made an arrest, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office said in a press release.  The sheriff's office will be holding a press conference on Friday at 2 p.m. ET to discuss the case. Members of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the FBI will also be in attendance.  People were ""waiting in line"" to adopt India following her miraculous recovery, Tom Rawlings, then-director of Georgia's Division of Family and Children Service, told Good Morning America at the time.  ""In child protective services we deal with a lot of tragedy, of course, but it's great to have a miracle,"" Rawlings said of baby India's survival. ""And this truly is a miracle.""  Rawlings was not able to disclose too much about where the baby was due to confidentiality reasons.  The first deputy to the scene recounted finding the baby in an interview with Good Morning America.  ""I wanted to give her comfort,"" Forsyth Sheriff's Deputy Terry Roper said in the weeks after the discovery. ""A little bit later I realized it was the first time she had felt love, and I felt honored to be able to give her that.""  Two sisters heard India's cries and went to investigate with their parents, after initially thinking it might have been a cat.  ""It sounded like a baby, but you never would think that it's a baby,"" Kayla Ragatz told Good Morning America at the time.  When they found the baby in the plastic bag, her sister, Kyler Ragatz, said she ""started bawling"" due to the emotional discovery.  ""I was angry, scared, sad,"" she added.

"miracle","2018-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Tuscaloosa"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T09:22:56","The world premiere opera ""Naaman"" took a year to compose, though its gestation began almost four decades ago.  First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa commissioned the chancel opera from composer K. Lee Scott, who sang in the church's choir in the 1970s, while he was still a student. Scott earned two degrees in choral music from Frederick Prentice at the University of Alabama, studying composition under Paul Hedwall.  More:Tuscaloosa native Katy Sullivan earns historic Tony nomination for ""Cost of Living"" role  ""Back in the early '80s, the economy was not doing very well, and I thought, well if I don't go ahead and establish a career as a composer, it's gonna be hard to do,"" said Scott, who's also conducting the 3 p.m. Sunday production of ""Naaman.""  Though he has worked adjunct faculty jobs at UA, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Samford University and Birmingham-Southern College, and part-time as a church musician, Scott has worked as a full-time composer, writing church anthems and other works on commission.  His hymn tunes can be found in more than 20 hymnals over four continents, with 300 published compositions including anthems, works for solo voice, organ, brass, and orchestra, and major works such as ""Requiem,"" ""Band of Angels,"" commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Birmingham church bombing, and ""The Suffering Servant,"" based on Isaiah 53.  ""Naaman"" is based in part on an opera Scott co-wrote almost 40 years ago, originally written on an old Underwood typewriter, built around the conversion story from II Kings, chapters five and six, in which an Aram general travels to Israel to be cured of leprosy, and in the journey, becomes a follower of the Jewish god.  ""Naaman"" is being performed in honor of Ed White, director of opera at UA from 1975-2001. White, who died in 2020, with his wife Karen was also active in choral music at First Presbyterian.  The Ed and Karen White Endowment helped pay for the work, which includes not only the yearlong composition, but Gary R. Smoke's engraving — music notation at high quality for mechanical reproduction — which runs to just short of 1,000 pages, plus the orchestral musicians, costumes, props, makeup and other technical requirements.  Former students of White's, many of whom have gone on to professional music careers, are performing all the roles, save Bonnie Blackwell, a current UA study who's singing the part of an adviser, and working as understudy.  Hope Koehler sings the pivotal role of Miriam, a servant to Naaman who points the general toward Israel. Dewin Tibbs performs Naaman, and Jennifer Bryant Pederson plays Sardia, Naaman's wife. Doff Procter, director of the Alabama Choir School, serves as narrator.  Dee Hamner will be Jehoram, the king of Israel in Samaria. With Blackwell, Leslie Sheppard and Chip White will be servants and advisors. David O'Steen will be Elisha, the prophet; Walter Jones will play Gehazi, Elisha's servant; Danny Potts will be messenger to Jehoram; Everett McCorvey will play Naaman's servant; and Melanie Claypool Jonas and Ellen Woodward Potts are solo soprano and solo mezzo-soprano, respectively.  Knowing those voices, but keeping in mind ""Naaman"" might have a life beyond this weekend, Scott wrote challenging though not impossible parts.  ""f you can come up with a story that has six or seven principles and then a few other smaller roles, you can involve the choir,"" Scott said. ""So hopefully this can be done, not only by colleges, Christian or secular, but by churches.""  Opera's roots can be traced to the church, from liturgical dramas to mystery ― or miracle ― plays. Gian Carlo Menotti's ""Amahl and the Night Visitors,"" about three kings visiting the Christ child, is the most famous of contemporary chancel operas, and ""Naaman"" shares some of that terrain, both thematically, with a miracle healing, and melodically.  ""Certainly, there's a (Menotti) influence in my tonal language in this one. It's modern, but not too modern. Tonally, the thing that the singers are finding out that I'm relatively conservative harmonically,"" Scott said, ""but rhythmically, it's very challenging. ""  Naaman drew Scott for a number of reasons. First, it's fresh material.  ""They don't need another arrangement of 'Amazing Grace,' "" Scott said.  Second, the heroic figure, though a powerful man, listens to servants. Naaman offers the prophet Elisha gold and silver supplied by his king ― an amount roughly $250,000 today ― but Elisha sends a message telling Naaman to bathe in the river Jordan seven times.  "" 'Well, I thought surely he would come out waving his hand over me, and I'd be healed.' So (Naaman) goes off in a rage,"" Scott said, "" and it's his servants who go up to him and say, 'Father, if he had told you some great thing to do, would not you have done it? How much more that you would wash and be cleansed?' ""  Scott finds it telling the servants care enough to break through to him, indicating his worth.  ""It really is a story of his conversion, because he becomes a believer in Jehovah and in the Jewish God then,"" Scott said. ""And so as one writer said, it's one of the most complete conversion stories in all of scripture. He's humbled.""  It's also a timeless, modern tale, he added, of a man who had everything, yet in danger of losing it all. Seeking desperate measures, he finds deeper meaning.  The world premiere of ""Naaman"" will be performed at 3 p.m. Sunday in the First Presbyterian Church, 900 Greensboro Ave. in downtown Tuscaloosa. Admission is free.

"miracle","2023-07-01","07:15:00","{""Tuscumbia"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T18:27:00","This next act is called the Vanishing Dogs.  A “rebellious” Fido who freed his friends and tore apart an animal shelter lobby found a forever home less than 24 hours after the debacle.  Titan, a 4-year-old husky, was caught on CCTV footage causing $2,000 worth of damage to the Colbert County Animal Shelter in Tuscumbia, Alabama.  But shelter director Charles Speegle was none the wiser as the pooch partied on after closing. It wasn’t until he came to work Tuesday morning, when he saw Titan peeking through the windows at the front desk, that he realized something was amiss.  “I got there about 7:15 a.m. I went to unlock the door and he was sitting in front of the door in the lobby looking at me,” Speegle, from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, told Kennedy News.  The 46-year-old couldn’t figure out how the escape artist pulled off the impressive feat — the doors, he said, aren’t “easy” to open, and the lobby door opens with a lever.  Titan, hailed as a Houdini dog, left staff members baffled at how he escaped and destroyed the shelter’s lobby. Kennedy News & Media  “How did this guy do all that?” Speegle asked himself.  Then, he spotted the carnage.  “I thought, ‘Oh gosh,'” Speegle continued. “He’d destroyed my lobby. The blinds were ripped down, he’d destroyed the computer, paperwork, files, the whole interior was shredded.”  CCTV footage showed the pup parading on the front desk, knocking the desktop computer to the floor. Titan, who had just arrived before closing the night prior, also unleashed his two pals.  CCTV footage shows the clever canine knocking the expensive desktop to the ground, damaging it. Kennedy News & Media  The escape artist also freed two of his pals who threw a “party” in the back room. Kennedy News & Media  While dogs can “sometimes” sneak out of their crates, the clever canines “never” open the lobby door — until Titan.  “He’d let two of his buddies out, too, and they threw a party in the back as well, but it wasn’t as bad back there,” Speegle said. “I don’t know how he did it.”  Funny enough, Speegle admitted the alarm company had phoned him Monday evening claiming movement was spotted at the shelter. Even with a visit from law enforcement, officers claimed to not see anything suspicious.  When Speegle arrived the next morning, he spotted Titan peering through the front windows amid the wreckage. Kennedy News & Media  Supplies were damaged and shredded and the shelter’s desktop computer was a goner. Kennedy News & Media  “They called again because it was going off again and I said, ‘It’s probably a mouse,’ so I went to bed and little did I know that they were throwing a party,” he said.  While clean-up required five staff members and a fund-raiser to replace the damaged equipment, their liberated antics caught the attention of husky-lovers when the footage was posted online.  On GoFundMe, generous donations total more than $3,000 — $1,000 more than their goal.  It took five staffers to clean up the mess. Kennedy News & Media  Huskies, Speegle said, are “hard to contain.” Kennedy News & Media  “I imagine the reason the owner surrendered him is because he’s kind of rebellious and rambunctious,” Speegle said. “Huskies are very clever and hard to contain.”  Rather than deter potential families for troublesome Titan, it garnered some laughs and an onslaught of adoption requests. The Houdini hound went home the day after his rager was discovered, with a family who already owned an identical husky.  “We would have had to barricade him in that night if he wasn’t adopted,” Speegle quipped.  On Wednesday, Titan was adopted by a family who already has a near-identical husky. Kennedy News & Media  When Speegle arrived to work on Wednesday morning, he was met with Titan’s aftermath. Kennedy News & Media  But just days after his miracle adoption, during his first trip to the vet, he was diagnosed with heartworm.  Christopher Davis, Titan’s new owner, said he “instantly fell in love with the doggy in the window,” according to the “Titan the Destroyer” GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his treatment.  “Who would think such a cute and fluffy little animal could cause so much havoc/chaos,” Davis wrote on the fund-raising page, saying he wanted to give Titan “a great new lease on life.”  After Titan was adopted by his family this week, he was diagnosed with heartworm. Kennedy News & Media  Pleading for generous donations, kind words or just some good vibes, Davis said he hopes the heartworms haven’t inflicted too much damage on the poor pup.  While Titan allegedly “can’t read” the donors’ well wishes — a fact his human is “not sure” about, given the daring dog’s demonstrated intelligence — Davis promised to “give him good scratches and butt rubs in exchange.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L2hvdWRpbmktZG9nLWFkb3B0ZWQtYWZ0ZXItdHJhc2hpbmctc2hlbHRlci1mcmVlaW5nLXBhbHMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvaG91ZGluaS1kb2ctYWRvcHRlZC1hZnRlci10cmFzaGluZy1zaGVsdGVyLWZyZWVpbmctcGFscy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

What can God do in your life with one Bible verse a day? Subscribe to Aleteia's new service and bring Scripture into your morning. Click to bring God's word to your inbox: One verse a day  The Catholic Church has a long process in place that examines the life of an individual to determine if they lived a life of extraordinary virtue that should be lifted up for all to imitate.  One of first major steps along that path is called the beatification ceremony.  The word itself stems from the Latin word beatus, meaning “blessed” and facere, “to make.” To beatify is simply the act of declaring an individual “blessed.”  In order to be beatified (the last step before being canonized), an individual needs to have one miracle attributed to their intercession.  Typically throughout the beatification process, the local bishop will promote an individual’s cause among the faithful and encourage them to pray through that person’s intercession.  One of the most common type of miracles is the sudden healing of someone. According to author Michael O’Neill, “For the cure to be considered miraculous, the disease must be serious and impossible (or at least very difficult) to cure by human means and not be in a stage at which it is liable to disappear shortly by itself. No medical treatment must have been given, or it must be certain that the treatment given has no reference to the cure. The healing must be spontaneous, complete and permanent.”  It can take many years before a miracle is verified by the Vatican, as there are hundreds of cases being submitted every year. Not all of them are miracles and so the Vatican has to weed them out, determining which ones are authentic and which ones are not.  Furthermore, when an individual is beatified, this typically authorizes the local diocese(s) to celebrate their life and they are included on a few liturgical calendars.  Only when an individual is canonized are they approved for widespread veneration.  The beatification ceremony is not meant to be a reward for certain men or women after their death, but a public confirmation of their saintly life and union with God.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYWxldGVpYS5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8xOS93aGF0LWRvZXMtYmVhdGlmaWNhdGlvbi1tZWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA... Read more                May 20 - Kyle Tucker recorded a pair of run-scoring extra-base hits while Brandon Bielak sidestepped early trouble en route to a career-best strikeout total as the Houston Astros topped the visiting Oakland Athletics 5-1 on Friday in the opener of a three-game series.  Tucker finished 2-for-3 with a walk, a double and a home run. His RBI double in the fourth inning came two batters after Yordan Alvarez opened that frame with a 417-foot double that caromed off the center-field wall. Tucker snapped a 1-all tie with his two-bagger and extended the lead to 4-1 when he golfed his seventh homer into the right-field seats in the sixth, plating Jose Abreu.  That Houston, which extended its winning streak to five games, proved able to secure a 1-0 lead when Abreu scored on a throwing error by Athletics shortstop Aledmys Diaz in the second inning was a minor miracle. Bielak (1-1) loaded the bases with one out in the top of the first by allowing softly hit singles to Esteury Ruiz and Ryan Noda before issuing a walk to Shea Langeliers.  Bielak recovered with strikeouts of J.J. Bleday and Ramon Laureano, a preview of how vital the strikeout would become over his five-inning stint. Langeliers pulled the Athletics even with his two-out RBI double in the third, scoring Ruiz, but Bielak closed that frame by fanning Bleday. Bielak then struck out two batters apiece in the fourth and fifth innings, completing his outing with nine strikeouts against three walks. He allowed one run on five hits and tossed 88 pitches.  Athletics left-hander Ken Waldichuk (1-3) retired the Astros in order in the first and fifth innings and induced a key double play to stifle Houston after Jake Meyers and Martin Maldonado reached in succession to open the third. But Tucker victimized Waldichuk in two critical spots, and Waldichuk departed with a left lower body injury while facing Jeremy Pena in the sixth.  Alvarez and Meyers also recorded two-hit games for Houston. Astros second baseman Jose Altuve made his season debut and finished 0-for-4 with a walk.

"miracle","1998-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Walkerton"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:11:17","The raw milk movement may be on the rise again. Devotees tout it as an unprocessed miracle food to help with ailments or promote overall wellness. In fact, few foods have been as highly celebrated for their benefits as raw milk. Yet the claims made by advocates of unpasteurized milk aren’t backed up by evidence. Rather than strengthen immune systems, help with asthma and allergies or circumvent lactose intolerance, consuming raw milk can cause severe foodborne illness — which can lead to paralysis or even death.  What Is Raw Milk?  The typical cow’s milk you find in the grocery store is pasteurized. This means that it’s heated to a high enough temperature for a long enough period to kill off unwanted microorganisms. This process removes any harmful bacteria that would ordinarily be in cow’s milk. Milk that is not pasteurized is known as raw milk, because it has not undergone this sterilization process.  Is Raw Milk Safe?  Raw milk may contain harmful bacteria that can cause severe and enduring medical conditions, some which can result in death. States that allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption have higher incidences of related foodborne disease outbreaks than those that do not allow the sale of raw milk.  What Is in Raw Milk?  Raw milk can harbor harmful bacteria such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria. During the pasteurization process these bacteria are typically killed by heating the milk.  What Are the Risks Associated With Drinking Raw Milk?  Drinking raw milk can lead to a plethora of different health conditions, ranging from run-of-the-mill food poisoning to fatal diseases. Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own nerves, and can cause paralysis. Another severe condition that can result from consuming certain bacteria harbored in raw milk is hemolytic uremic syndrome. This syndrome may result in kidney failure, stroke or even death.  Who Is at Greatest Risk of Getting Sick From Drinking Raw Milk?  Though foodborne illnesses such as those contracted by drinking raw milk can impact anybody, there are some groups of people who should be especially cautious. Consumers with compromised immune systems, anyone older than 65 and children younger than five years old should be especially wary.  How Does Milk Get Contaminated?  There are many ways that milk can become contaminated with harmful bacteria. Milk can come into contact with animal feces, or with microorganisms on a cow’s skin. The environment that dairy cows are raised in is usually teeming with bacteria, including those passed on from other animals such as rats and insects. The cow that produced the milk could easily have had mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland that often involves infection. The bacteria could even come from workers through contaminated clothing or unclean hands. With so many ways for milk to become contaminated with harmful bacteria, consuming raw milk that has not been pasteurized places consumers at an unnecessary risk of developing disease.  Raw Milk Versus Whole Milk  Raw milk is unpasteurized, contains about 4.4 grams of fat in every 100 grams of milk, and comes straight from the cow. Whole milk contains about 3.5 grams of fat per 100 grams of milk, and is heated to kill any foodborne illness-causing bacteria.  Is Raw Milk Illegal?  Raw milk is illegal in several states, including Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Tennessee and North Carolina. Some states allow the sale of raw milk only on farms. Texas, Oregon and New York all fall into this category. South Carolina, California and Nevada allow the sale of raw milk in certain stores. In addition to being governed by individual states, raw milk is illegal to sell across state lines, per the federal government. This means that dairies located in states where raw milk is illegal are unable to transport it to states where it is legal to sell raw milk.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has conducted research into how often diseases result from the consumption of raw milk. They found that in places where raw milk is legal, the incidence of foodborne illnesses linked to raw milk consumption is 3.2 times higher than in areas where it is illegal. In places where raw milk is sold in stores, the incidence of related foodborne illness outbreaks is 3.6 times higher than in areas where raw milk can only be sold on farms.  Why Is Raw Milk Illegal?  Raw milk is illegal in many places due to the numerous health risks associated with drinking it. On top of common foodborne illnesses such as salmonella that can be contracted from consuming raw milk, other bacteria within the drink can lead to severe and lasting consequences, and can potentially even be fatal.  Why Do People Drink Raw Milk?  Interest in raw milk has been increasing as people look to move away from processed foods. Those who do drink it often say that the taste is better than pasteurized milk. In response to the trend, the CDC has warned the public about the dangers associated with the consumption of raw milk.  Does Pasteurized Milk Have Fewer Nutrients?  There is a fairly common misconception that raw milk has more nutrients than pasteurized milk. This is false — the pasteurization process does not significantly impact the nutritional content of milk.  Does Pasteurizing Milk Destroy Proteins?  Those who choose to consume raw milk may claim that pasteurizing the milk destroys proteins. Though the form of proteins within milk may be impacted by pasteurization, the nutritional content and digestibility of the proteins are not.  Does Pasteurizing Milk Reduce Fatty Acids?  While pasteurizing milk does not reduce the amount of fatty acids present in milk, a process called ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treatment can.  Does Raw Milk Contain More Antimicrobials?  Drinkers of raw milk often believe that the milk contains good bacteria that will help build up their immune systems and make them more resistant to developing diseases. Yet raw milk is more likely to cause disease than prevent it. What is present in raw milk are bacteria with genes for antimicrobial resistance, some of which may be capable of transferring their resistance to other bacteria, including pathogens living in the human gut. This finding is especially concerning, given the severity of antimicrobial resistance and its considerable threat to public health.  Is Raw Milk Better for People With Lactose Intolerance?  Some advocates of raw milk make the claim that unpasteurized milk is better for those with lactose intolerance. This is simply untrue, however, as both pasteurized and raw milk contain lactose, and raw milk does not contain special bacteria that produce the lactase necessary to prevent an intolerance reaction.  Does Raw Milk Protect Against Allergies and Asthma?  Some argue that children growing up on farms consuming raw milk may have fewer allergies and less asthma than kids who drink pasteurized milk. Yet any association is likely due to their growing up in a less-polluted environment, and is not solely attributable to the type of milk consumed.  What Is the Truth About Raw Milk?  It’s important to be wary of misinformation concerning raw milk. Advocates tend to make far-reaching claims, often based on cherry-picked data. Raw milk is not a miracle food and does not bring the many benefits often ascribed to it. The reality is that raw milk places drinkers at an increased risk of developing a wide array of foodborne illnesses. Below are some truths about raw milk, according to the FDA.  Pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk.  Raw milk causes a greater rate of foodborne outbreaks than pasteurized milk.  Raw milk does not contain natural antimicrobial components that make milk safe.  Raw milk does not contain nisin for pathogen inhibition.  Raw milk does not cure lactose intolerance.  Raw milk does not cure or treat asthma and allergies.  Raw milk is not an immune system-building food, and is particularly unsafe for children.  Raw milk is not more effective in preventing osteoporosis than pasteurized milk.  Raw milk is not nutritionally superior to pasteurized milk.  There are no additional proteases and lipases in raw milk that facilitate milk digestion.  There are no beneficial bacteria in raw milk for gastrointestinal health.  There are no immunoglobulins in raw milk that enhance the human immune system.  What You Can Do  Raw milk is not a miracle food. In fact, it’s dangerous enough that it is illegal in several states, and cannot be sold across state lines. The consequences of consuming unpasteurized milk can be severe, especially for young children, the elderly and those with already-compromised immune systems.  If you’re looking for a raw and healthy alternative milk, consider making your own nut or oat milk at home. Doing so provides a delicious and much safer beverage, while also ensuring that you know exactly what’s going into your body.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vc2VudGllbnRtZWRpYS5vcmcvcmF3LW1pbGsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If anything, the decrease in divisional games only has intensified the showdowns they do have, with this series dripping in drama.  A quick recap: There were allegations of Aaron Judge cheating and a subsequent scrutiny on his eyeballs; actual rule-breaking by Domingo German and his sticky right hand; petty complaints about where base coaches were standing, which led to Blue Jays manager John Schneider yelling, “Shut up, fat boy,” at Yankees assistant hitting coach Brad Wilkerson; a 10th-inning walkoff; and Judge leaning into the villain role with four home runs and a new celebration in which he covered his eyes with his hand.  Aaron Judge was in the thick of the action in Toronto with four home runs in four games and one controversy over the direction of his gaze. Getty Images  Did we miss anything?  “I think this division in general, it kind of feels like the old-school — when I played, when Boonie [Aaron Boone] played — rivalries,” said Wilkerson, who played in the majors from 2001-2008, with his final season coming in Toronto. “There’s a lot of good teams. [The Blue Jays] have a great team over there. We got to focus on what we have to do in our dugout with our guys because there’s a lot of great teams. We can’t let outside noise distract us.”  The Yankees have largely stuck to that mantra this week, despite things hitting the fan around them.  “It’s just the AL East — it’s a different animal,” said Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who turned in a strong game Tuesday night (2-for-3 with a double, home run, walk and three runs scored) that got buried in the midst of all the other chaos.  Tensions between the Yankees and Blue Jays picked up last year after Alek Manoah hit Aaron Judge with a pitch (and Gerrit Cole took exception). Robert Sabo for the NY Post  But while the Yankees have had a long history of feuding with the Red Sox and a more recent one with the Rays and their “whole damn stable of pitchers that throw 98 miles per hour,” their rivalry with the Blue Jays has been building over the last few years.  There was Luis Severino and Alek Manoah chirping at each other last April, and then by August, it was Manoah hitting Judge with a fastball, Gerrit Cole taking a few steps out of the dugout to yell at Manoah, and Manoah saying postgame, “If Gerrit wants to do something, he can walk past the Audi sign next time.” The tensions were even fueled over the offseason, when Manoah called Cole the “worst cheater in baseball history” and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. vowed he would “never sign with the Yankees — not even dead.”  The first series between the teams this season, at Yankee Stadium in April, was relatively quiet besides a Yankees walkoff. But the rematch this week north of the border has quickly made up for that with no lack of chippiness.  “Hey, it’s competition,” Wilkerson said. “Competition is good. I think the fans love it. Obviously you don’t want to go across certain lines with it, hopefully. But it is fun. It’s fun to play in a great division, and our schedule’s been unbelievable so far. We’ve really responded.”  Yankees assistant hitting coach Brad Wilkerson described what is “fun” about the rivalry games between the Yankees and Blue Jays. YES  A quality rivalry typically takes two good teams, and with the Blue Jays re-entering the thick of the division race over the past few seasons, the stage has been set for fireworks.  “Whenever there’s two good teams that are familiar with one another, yeah, it can get a little competitive and heated at times,” Schneider said. “You probably do or say some things that you wouldn’t say if it wasn’t the heat of the moment. You could say that about basically any team in our division right now, if you look up and down. When you have high-level athletes that are very competitive and coaches that are very competitive, you kind of see what you’re seeing a little bit.”  Want to catch a game?

If there are any engineers out there who can develop a tool to instantly identify a substance and measure exact levels of said substance on a hand, Major League Baseball should be willing to pay you whatever it takes.  German’s ejection Tuesday and subsequent 10-game suspension for a failed sticky-stuff inspection brought to light once again how subjective those checks can be.  MLB has left it up to the umpires to inspect hands, gloves, hats, belts and everything else. With 70-plus active umpires in the game, it’s impossible to have an objective standard for how sticky is too sticky.  Umpires eject Domingo German over what they considered excessive stickiness on his pitching hand. YES  Phil Cuzzi had been responsible for all three sticky-stuff ejections — Max Scherzer in April and Hector Santiago and Caleb Smith in 2021 — before Tuesday, when James Hoye’s crew decided German’s right hand was “the worst hand we’ve ever felt during a game.”  German insisted it was only rosin (from the bag on the back of the mound) and sweat. Hoye asserted it was “definitely not rosin.”  If German is telling the truth, it raises the question of how a pitcher should know how much rosin is too much.  “The reality is we should all have a very good idea of what the line is,” Boone said. “Apparently Domingo crossed it.”  And yet…  “Look, there’s a dicey [component to it] because they always compare hands,” Boone said. “Of course there’s not going to be anything on the other hand. There’s not going to be any tack. So I don’t know what the line is. [Hoye] just said it was too sticky.”  Long-lost brothers in arms  Gerrit Cole and Bills quarterback Matt Barkley met for the first time this week at Rogers Centre despite being born on the same day in the same town and playing at rival high schools and colleges. USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con; Getty Images  On Monday afternoon at Rogers Centre, before the Yankees-Blue Jays circus kicked into gear, Bills quarterbacks Josh Allen, Matt Barkley and Kyle Allen took batting practice.  They put on a show with some impressive home runs, which a handful of Yankees came out to the dugout to watch.  Afterwards, Cole found Barkley behind home plate and shared an embrace.  The two men have walked eerily similar yet divergent paths to pro sports: Both Cole and Barkley were born in Newport Beach, Calif., on Sept. 8, 1990.  Cole went to Orange Lutheran High School, and Barkley went to its rival, Mater Dei, in Orange County.  Then Cole played baseball at UCLA and Barkley played football at its rival, USC.  The crazy part? Cole and Barkley had never met before Monday.  Down on the farm  Yankees pitching prospect Will Warren strikes out Clint Frazier during his Triple-A debut. Twitter/Scranton Wilkes-Barre Railriders  On Wednesday, Will Warren was promoted from Double-A Somerset to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, putting one of the organization’s top pitching prospects one step closer to helping the Yankees.  The 23-year-old right-hander had posted a 2.45 ERA with 39 strikeouts in 29 ⅓ innings to start the season. The eighth-round pick in 2021 out of Southeastern Louisiana University left a strong impression on the organization last season, which was his first in pro ball.  The fast-rising Warren is not yet on the Yankees’ 40-man roster, but he likely will be before long, giving the Yankees some much-needed starting depth at the upper levels of the minors.  In his Triple-A debut Thursday night, Warren got the win, allowing two runs (on solo home runs) in six innings while striking out four and walking none.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3lhbmtlZXMtYmx1ZS1qYXlzLXJpdmFscnktZmlyZXdvcmtzLWhhdmUtb2xkLXNjaG9vbC1mZWVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2001-07-24","Not Discerned","{""Gulfport"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:59:57","He was predicted to 'be a vegetable' and '85 percent mentally retarded' at birth  Derick Hall wasn't supposed to make it to the NFL... but through resilience, tenacity and grit, he's made it somehow - an incredible accomplishment considering that the linebacker was only given a one percent chance to live at birth.  Hall, 22, was drafted as a second round pick (37th overall) by the Seattle Seahawks after impressing at Auburn, where he was named first-team All-SEC in 2022. The six-foot-three, 256-pounds trailblazer registered 6.5 sacks and 60 total tackle during the final season of his college career.  But none of that would've occurred without his mother believing that her son would turn out to be a fighter. Hall was born 23 weeks premature in Gulfport, Mississippi, in 2001 and was dead at birth - without a heartbeat before being resuscitated.  Weighing just two pounds and one ounce at birth, with brain bleeding, the NFL player spent a week on life support. Believing that he would likely be in a permanent vegetative state, doctors advised Stacey Gooden-Crandle, Hall's mother, to allow life support to be discontinued, but she refused.  'The doctors wanted me to just let nature take its course,' Gooden-Crandle once told AuburnUndocver. 'We decided we wanted to fight for him.'  Derick Hall's rise to the NFL is a 'one-in-a-million' story full of resilience, tenacity and grit  The Seahawks linebacker was born 23 weeks prematurely and dead (without a heartbeat)  Struggling to survive, doctors advised against Hall's mother to keep her son on life support  'We just trusted God wholeheartedly, and look what we've got now,' said Hall's mother, Stacey  'They said he'd never be able to walk or be able to talk,' she added. 'They said he'd just be a vegetable. He'd be 85 percent mentally retarded. He wouldn't have any quality of life. They said ''we shouldn't try to save this baby.'''  Hall was finally able to go home with his family five months after being taken care of at a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) while hooked on a ventilator. But, his mother didn't necessarily know if that was the end of her newborn son's health troubles.  'A young woman being told all this, I was scared,' Gooden-Crandle recalled. 'I didn't know if I could financially support this kid.  'I didn't know if I was prepared for the things I was being told. We just trusted God wholeheartedly, and look what we've got now.'  In his early years, Hall would be frequently hospitalized and suffered from asthma. He began playing flag football when he was four, but knew he'd be limited both in games and at practice due to being at a health disadvantage, though that gave him a sense of resilience and grit that's helped him reach the summit of American Football.  'The earliest thing I remember is being 4 or 5 years old and having an asthma attack,' Hall told AuburnUndercover. 'I was in the hospital for three weeks. Going through all that at a young age, going through breathing machines and treatments and stuff like that, getting through all of that every year at a young age really put me in position to learn how to fight, compete and face adversity.'  Hall began playing flag football when he was four but was limited at games and in practice  At Auburn, Hall was named second-team All-SEC in 2021 and first-team All-SEC in 2022  In full disbelief, Hall had his head in his hands when he learned that he was drafted by Seattle  Hall was a standout athlete at football, basketball and track at Gulfport High School. He was among the most highly rated football prospects in Mississippi in 2018 and even had Division I offers to play college basketball, despite often requiring inhalers as a teen.  Hall's lungs are still not as highly functioning as they normally would be at his age, though that never stopped him from pursuing his passion.  'It was definitely hard,' he recalled. 'Watching everybody run when I was over there coughing up a lung, it was pretty hard.'  'I have the lungs of a 13- or 14-year-old child,' Hall added. 'Trying to overcome those obstacles through hard work and dedication and commitment started at a young age up until now. That's what propelled me to where I am today.'  Hall doesn't use an inhaler much these days. He only occasionally needed a breather during his four years at Auburn, where he developed an interest for civil engineering.  The linebacker could've plied his trade at Mississippi State or Ole Miss but cited his relationship with Tigers assistant coach Rodney Garner as the main reason for his commitment.  'I would never have imagined God would have such a great future for him, especially athletically. He was always smart, a straight-A student. It's so amazing. He was always a hard worker. I knew he had determination and grit,' said Gooden-Crandle. 'He had a goal, and with God's help he got there.'  Seattle's newest defensive player holds a close bond with his mother, who he calls his 'queen'  As a freshman and sophomore at Auburn, Hall recorded a total of 34 tackles and 3.5 sacks. He became a starter as junior, where he registered 52 total tackles and nine sacks, earning himself a second-team All-SEC nomination in 2021 before becoming a member of the conference's first-team honors a year later.  The newest addition to the Seahawks defense said he's grateful for his mother and step-father, Cedric Crandle, and all of the help and support they've provided along the way to his journey to the NFL.  'My mom is my queen,' Hall said. 'She is everything to me, how hard she worked raising two kids by herself at first, working two or three jobs. God blessed me with a great stepdad. I refer to him as my father, not my stepdad.'  Hall is confident in his ability to flourish wherever the Seahawks plug him in, having played all over the field in college. He's looking forward to bringing his leadership to the team's locker room after being a team captain at Auburn last season, despite knowing he'll be a rookie.  'That was definitely a lot more significant for me to have that, knowing that my teammates picked me to help be a leader on that team,' Hall said of his last year at Auburn.  'I feel like I'm a guy who could be in that role and flourish, and I feel like I'm the guy to help that team get better. Just continue to grow.'","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvbmZsL2FydGljbGUtMTIxMDMxNTUvTkZMLVNlYWhhd2tzLURlcmljay1IYWxsLWdpdmVuLTEtY2hhbmNlLWxpdmUtYm9ybi1wcmVtYXR1cmVseS0yMy13ZWVrcy5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9uZmwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjEwMzE1NS9hbXAvTkZMLVNlYWhhd2tzLURlcmljay1IYWxsLWdpdmVuLTEtY2hhbmNlLWxpdmUtYm9ybi1wcmVtYXR1cmVseS0yMy13ZWVrcy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The event usually takes place outside along First Avenue in the Warehouse District. However, due to weather concerns, The Venue at Cotton Creek opened its doors Thursday night, May 18, to allow hundreds of attendees to gather, drink, dine and raise funds for the Foundation’s major project of 2023- a complete resurfacing of Miracle Field.  Upon entering the venue, guests were ushered in to the sound of live music from BREZ, enjoyed drinks from cash bars set up in the cocktail area and indulged in delicious appetizers including ratatouille puffs and scallops crafted by the team of Terri Pines and served by Executive Chef Rob Harper.  Dining tables were set with azure runners and fragrant centerpieces of hydrangeas and roses, with lemon accents brightening the atmosphere; all the while, local studio owner Emily Bussman painted the scene in real time for a beautifully bespoke piece to be auctioned as a memento of the evening.

"miracle","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:00:00","[Ed. note: This post spoils the ending of Mrs. Davis season 1.]  Mrs. Davis is a lot of things, but one can hardly call it predictable. Perhaps nothing bears that out than the finale, where we finally learn the origins of the titular AI, Simone’s and Wiley’s epic sagas come to an end, and it all wraps up in… a happy ending?  This is maybe not the outcome people were expecting when it came to the tale of a nun waging a war against an AI and getting drawn into a web of magic, religious conspiracies, and secret societies. But it was important to co-creators Tara Hernandez and Damon Lindelof that this story landed at a point that felt like it could be a final note for the series.  “Look, we live in a day and age where for a show to get made is a miracle; for it to get a second season is a miracle on top of a miracle with a cherry and whipped cream,” Lindelof says. “And so it would be irresponsible for us to have ended the season with a cliffhanger. So we wanted there to be a beginning, middle, and end.”  Still, it’s hard to believe Simone’s quest ends on such an upbeat note. Not only does she find the Holy Grail, and drink from it, and not explode, and make up with her mother, and get Mrs. Davis to shut herself off — she also gets to ride off into the sunset, presumably happy and in love with a not-dead Wiley.  So what is Mrs. Davis?  But so much about Mrs. Davis was about finding a purpose, and how important that ends up feeling in people’s lives, both for their own journey and for others. Simone was able to see Mrs. Davis for what she was, versus what everyone else wanted her to be: “You weren’t made to care,” she tells Mrs. Davis (via her mother). “You were made to satisfy.”  Which, as we learn in the finale, is true. The origin of Mrs. Davis is an AI for a Buffalo Wild Wings app. But the idea that Mrs. Davis as we know it was based on the altruistic intentions of the actual coder (and one whose pitch Buffalo Wild Wings just totally rejects) came from finale co-writer Nadra Widatalla — something Lindelof says the writer’s room loved, even if they didn’t always know they were going to answer that question for the audience.  “Whether or not the show answers the question, we would be irresponsible if we didn’t know the answer,” Lindelof laughs. “And so we did become sort of enraptured by the idea that this all-powerful algorithm that was being given some sort of level of cultural omnipotence by its users was actually just built to sell chicken wings in its earliest incarnation. [And that] really delighted us, and was baked into the premise.”  By acknowledging that her core purpose is satisfying customers, Mrs. Davis admits defeat, telling Simone the program clearly “fell short” and deserved to be turned off. While Mrs. Davis’ journey is obviously more algorithmic than Simone’s or Wiley’s, it mirrors their arcs and the themes repeated throughout. Like Mrs. Davis, Wiley accepts his mortality, and in the finale turns himself in to expire.  “It’s the first time that he’s actually having to follow through on a decision he’s made and not take the coward’s way out,” Jake McDorman, who plays Wiley, says. “And really feel the impact of that decision and get dramatic about it — [all while] sitting in a roller coaster.”  Simone, meanwhile, makes her peace with what it means to love and lose — whether that’s her father, or Jay, or her mother, or even Wiley.  “I think if you asked her in the pilot, she’d be like, Oh, I’m at the end of my arc, I found the love of my life, I’m going to be in the convent forever, I’m fully evolved. [...] Nothing to see here!” Simone’s actor, Betty Gilpin, says. “And I think her having to go back out in the world, and interact with this AI, and Wiley, and her mother — she realizes, Oh, I still have so much work to do.” Through that journey, Simone learned where her faith actually needed to lie: In the people around her.  “I think she learns that being alive and loving someone — you have to take in the possibility that they aren’t always going to be there, or that it’s not only comfort and only safety,” Gilpin says. “And I think that’s being a nun, and that’s being a person. And I think she learns that lesson the hard way.”  Will there be a Mrs. Davis season 2?  Possibly. If Emmy nomination categories are to be believed, then Mrs. Davis isn’t coming back, at least in the way we know it. In a last-minute switch-up, the show was entered into the limited/anthology series categories, seemingly indicating that if Mrs. Davis gets a second season, it won’t be with the same stories we’ve been following here.  But that certainly doesn’t rule out a new season — for all his thoughts about how rare a season 2 renewal is in the current TV landscape, Lindelof tells Polygon that he and Hernandez have more ideas for the show.  “Our hope is that the audience feels like there’s more story to be told there,” Lindelof says. “And if they liked the show, and our end of the show, and feel like there should be more, we would certainly love to get the gang together again — and already have some vague ideas as to what could happen, without undoing what’s already happened.”  Will that involve Simone? Unclear. But for her part, at least, Betty Gilpin hopes it does. “We [went] to the most insane places,” Gilpin laughs. “Ten seasons might kill me, but I’m hoping to do… four.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzI5MDEzL21ycy1kYXZpcy1zZWFzb24tMS0yLWZpbmFsZS1leHBsYWluZWTSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM3MjkwMTMvbXJzLWRhdmlzLXNlYXNvbi0xLTItZmluYWxlLWV4cGxhaW5lZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s a time to understand the causes and effects of stroke.  Statistics show 800,000 people in the U.S. are affected by stroke every year and one Nebraska woman’s recovery from two strokes is nothing short of a miracle.  “She has a speech impediment and I can’t hear. We make a pretty good team,” says Terri Hodgen’s husband, Lyle.  It’s no surprise the Hodgens have been through a lot lately. The couple is recovering from two strokes Terri suffered, just ten days after her first scare.  “I followed her and she fell and leaned against the wall and I caught her and laid her down, got the phone, immediately called Papillion Fire and Rescue and they were there within minutes,” says Lyle.  He’s convinced the timing saved Terri’s life. Her neurointerventionist, CHI Health System Stroke Medical Director Dr. Vishal Jani, agrees.  “It’s a race against time. Time and time we have learned that faster action prevents disability.”  Terri’s speech therapy sessions are evidence of her development. It’s a big improvement and one Terri herself is proud of.  “If you would have seen her two weeks ago, you wouldn’t have believed it. I am very happy with it, and I’m sure you are, too,” says Lyle as Terri smiles and nods.  Pre-op and post-op X-rays of Terri’s brain are evidence of her progress. You can see full blockage, followed by free blood flow after the removal of the clot.  Terri’s thrombectomy saved her life.  “I think overall, this procedure is minimally invasive, we don’t have to open the skull, we don’t have any scars, we don’t have to shave the hair off, and this is a very quick minute, a very fast surgical treatment,” says Dr. Jani.  “It worked out where she’s here today.

Roumie plays Jesus in the popular crowdfunded television series ‘The Chosen’ and Lonnie Frisbee in the blockbuster hit ‘Jesus Revolution’, a film that follows the wave of people turning to Christianity in the midst of the ‘60s sexual revolution.  Jonathan Roumie’s salvation story  Roumie appeared on Fox News Tonight with Kayleigh McEnany, where the actor told McEnany that it was the fifth anniversary since his life changed.  “Today is a special day,” Roumie said. “Because five years ago today, I was literally in a pit and God sort of lent a hand and brought me out of the pit. I was broke. I was in debt. I had enough food for the day to last a day.  “And I literally, as a result of having been struggling for the previous, oh, 15 to 17 years prior trying to make it as an actor, I literally surrendered my entire life, my career, everything that I had and didn’t have over to God,” the actor confided. “And that day, He blessed me with a bit of a massive financial miracle that changed my relationship with Him completely and forever.”  Tastes of playing Jesus  Roumie elaborated that three months later he was offered the opportunity to play Jesus on ‘The Chosen’, adding that the honor of playing the role is “surreal” and “humbling”.  “Everything’s been different since, so today’s five years to the day that actually happened,” ‘The Chosen’ star said. “When I look back at all of the moments in my life that God sort of gave me these little tastes of playing this character, I realized that from the time I was a kid, from the time I was about 11 years old, this, I think, was sort of ordained for me.”  After mentioning that he watched the 1977 ‘Jesus of Nazareth’ miniseries at age 11, he was “moved” by the crucifixion scene to build his own crucifix.  “As an 11-year-old, I, after watching this, the crucifixion, I basically built my own crucifix, processed around my backyard, doing my own sort of way of the cross, and upright through the hammer, the nails in the hands and the feet and painted the blood and reenacted the crucifixion as a kid, Roumie recalled. “So I guess it was — God saw something before I ever did.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvam9uYXRoYW4tcm91bWllLWZyb20tdGhlLWNob3Nlbi1zaGFyZXMtaGlzLXRlc3RpbW9ueS1uLz9vbW5pbD1yZXNyZWxyZWNvbXbSAWZodHRwczovL2VuLmFzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2pvbmF0aGFuLXJvdW1pZS1mcm9tLXRoZS1jaG9zZW4tc2hhcmVzLWhpcy10ZXN0aW1vbnktbi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:01:39","DETROIT LAKES — Lucas Shawstad was given less than a 5% chance of living after a car accident in January 2021.  The 22-year-old was flung through the back window of his truck after it rolled twice. Every bone in his skull and face was fractured, and a portion was shattered beyond repair. He also lost an eye, has a fused spine and had more than 100 staples in his body. He endured infections and more.  “I shouldn’t have survived my accident,” he said. “All the doctors told me that it was a literal miracle that I was alive; that my chances at living and walking were slim to none. I pulled through, and not even the doctors could explain it.”  The truck Lucas Shawstad was in rolled twice. He was thrown out the back window of the truck cab. Contributed / Karen Mitchell  Those miracles, Shawstad credits to God, prayers and his mother’s love.  “Before the accident, I was on a teeter-totter with God,” he said, adding he lost a “decent amount of his memories” in the accident, but to the best of his recollection, time away from the church created a gradual divide in his faith.  ADVERTISEMENT  Even though the son of Karen and Chad Mitchell, of Frazee, and the late David Shawstad had become estranged from God, his church family (Harvest Church in Frazee) prayed on his behalf while he was fighting for his life. They asked for God’s grace, sent him well wishes and sent care packages to his mom, who left her life in Frazee to be at his side every step of the way for almost six months.  The journey from the brink of death to learning to walk again and returning to Frazee had plenty of heaves in the road. One of the most notable tribulations for Shawstad has been coming to terms with the fact that his former self no longer exists.  Shawstad appreciated manual labor, but the fused spine removed that option from his future. His memories are foggy, if there at all. He also had to accept that his appearance has changed, as one eye was replaced with a prosthetic. Adding to the gut punch of the accident’s aftermath was the realization that, when he arrived back home, the world had continued on without him.  “That was so hard for me to wrap my head around,” he said. “I felt left behind.”  Struggling to start again, Shawstad said he began to feel angry and bitter at the world. Before those dark emotions could take root, an old friend, Shelby Johnson, reentered his life. While he admittedly acted out toward her at times, he was granted grace and offered kindness in return.  “She showed me different ways to look at things,” he said. “I can talk to her about anything and not feel pressured.”  Shawstad has seen the truth in the adage that ""time heals all wounds."" He is now focused on recovery, building a new life, creating new memories and advocating for people to buckle up.  “My friend (who was driving the truck) was wearing his seatbelt and he had only a few scratches,” he said. “It doesn’t take three seconds to click it, and it saves lives. And, if you’re tired, don’t drive.”  ADVERTISEMENT  The darkest night brings a new dawn  Shawstad had finished a construction job in Washington and was heading home with another lake area resident in the passenger seat. The two put rubber on the road around 8 a.m. He pulled over after the sun had set.  “I was nodding off,” he recalled, noting his friend took over driving duties as he reclined his seat and fell asleep — without his seatbelt on.  Shawstad woke up about a month later. A nurse was to his left and his mom was to his right  “I remember my mom looked at me and said, ‘Oh my God, he’s awake,” Shawstad said. “The nurse started asking me a bunch of questions: What’s your name? Where are you? Who is the lady next to you? I could surprisingly answer with no issue.”  Lucas Shawstad needed to wear a helmet while healing from a near-death accident, as part of his skull was removed. Shawstad found support during his recovery from his stepfather Chad Mitchell and his mom, Karen Mitchell. Contributed / Karen Mitchell  In time, Shawstad learned the details of the accident. His friend nodded off while driving, then came to and saw they were heading toward a median in the road. He over-corrected, which caused the vehicle to roll twice.  Shawstad was taken to the nearest hospital in Glendive, Montana, where staff determined he needed more care than they could provide. He was then taken to Billings, Montana, where he was stabilized.  While life-saving measures were being taken, Shawstad’s mother, Karen Mitchell, was notified via phone about the accident.  “A month earlier my mom, his grandma, had a scam call with someone claiming to be Lucas (Shawstad) and saying that he needed money because he was in an accident,” Mitchell said. “So, at first, I thought it was a scam.”  ADVERTISEMENT  She Googled the number that called her and saw it was from a hospital in Montana, so she made a direct call.  “When they asked, do you have a Lucas … my stomach sunk,” she said. “Everything they said after ‘a terrible accident and get here as soon as possible,’ I don’t remember.”  Mitchell, her husband, and two younger children got in the car for a 9 ½-hour drive. While closing the distance between her and her son, Mitchell called the hospital again. She asked how bad his injuries were.  “She said, ‘Karen, people don’t come back from injuries like these,'” Mitchell paused, and said the doctors suggested she consider organ donation.  Mitchell explained she has always had a deep faith. So, during the drive, she leaned into God. Her mind twisted between hoping for a miracle and preparing for the possibility that a piece of her soul was about to return “home,” and her child’s heart may be gifted to another child of God.  “I know if it had to be, he would want that (to be an organ donor),” she said. “The drive, I was just so numb; it didn’t seem real to be thinking those thoughts.”  Not long after Mitchell arrived in Montana, Shawstad (and his mother) were airlifted to Swedish Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, where more surgeries followed.  Almost a month after the accident, Shawstad had opened his eyes and took his first steps with the assistance of a walker.  ADVERTISEMENT  “I thought, how is this possible?” Mitchell recalled. “I was told he was going to die.”  She added when he initially woke up a few weeks before he was walking, her son couldn’t sit up on his own without slumping to the side.  “I was watching miracle after miracle,” she said.  Lucas Shawstad's truck visor was where this emblem was kept. He was in an accident where every bone in his skull and face was fractured, he lost an eye, had more than 100 staples put in his body, as well as a fused spine and more. Contributed / Karen Mitchell  Despite his unlikely healing abilities, Shawstad said rehab was filled with setbacks, including a brain infection that required his brain to be bathed in saline. He was also told about his fused spine and that he had lost an eye.  “I was starting to give up hope,” he said.  In those moments when his vision was darkened with despair, he said love provided the light he needed as he endured.  “I kept pushing forward because I had loved ones back home that wanted to see me,” he said. “And, I wanted to see them.”  Shawstad added his mom was “his rock” and that he doesn’t believe he would’ve made it without her. Mitchell also had several rocks. Aside from God, she noted her family provided support and understanding. Even her little ones were telling her “it was OK” when she felt guilty about being away from them for so long.  ADVERTISEMENT  “It is only the strength of God that carried me through that,” Mitchell said. “I think back and don’t know how I got up every day. I just know it was not my own strength; there were so many complications and I was living in fear that he would die. I was always holding my breath.”  Now that Shawstad is home, the two are breathing easier. While he is still adjusting to his new life, he has begun taking steps to find a new normalcy, including taking a test to get his license back. After passing the test, one of his first stops was visiting the friend who was driving his truck.  “He was as pale as a ghost when he saw me,” Shawstad said. “We hugged.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRsLW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9mcmF6ZWUtbWFuLWxlYXJucy10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtcHJheWVyLWxvdmUtYW5kLXNlYXRiZWx0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2019-06-27","Not Discerned","{""ForsythCounty"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:39:26","Nearly four years after an abandoned newborn was found alive in a plastic bag in Georgia, the child's mother has been arrested and charged with attempt to commit murder, authorities announced Friday.  The baby girl was found in good condition in a wooded area in Forsyth County on the night of June 6, 2019, authorities said. A local family told ""Good Morning America"" at the time they had heard crying and called 911 after finding the newborn in a plastic bag.  The baby, temporarily named India, was likely born within hours of being found, authorities said. Her umbilical cord was still attached.  The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office released remarkable body camera footage of first responders recovering the baby from the scene in the weeks following the discovery as they attempted to identify her.  The Forsyth County Major Crimes Unit has been ""tirelessly working"" on the ""Baby India"" case ever since, and on Thursday morning, deputies made an arrest, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office said in a press release.  ""Four years ago, I said in this room, and I told you, we will bring this person to justice,"" Forsyth County Sheriff Ron Freeman told reporters Friday. ""Little did I know it was going to take four years.""  Freeman said investigators have devoted ""thousands of hours"" to the case, and a breakthrough came approximately 10 months ago when they were able to identify the child's father through ""advanced DNA investigative practice."" There is currently no evidence to suggest that the child's father knew of the pregnancy or abandonment, the sheriff said.  DNA evidence further confirmed 40-year-old Karima Jiwani, of southeast Forsyth County, to be the child's biological mother, according to Freeman.  Jiwani faces charges including criminal attempt to commit murder, cruelty to children in the first degree, aggravated assault and reckless abandonment, Freeman said. She is scheduled to make her first court appearance on Saturday remotely from the Forsyth County Jail, where she is being held without bond, officials said.  Based on interviews with family and medical professionals, Jiwani reportedly had a ""history of hidden and concealed pregnancies and surprise births,"" and while pregnant with India ""went to extremes to conceal this pregnancy,"" Freeman said. Investigators have not found any prior criminal acts regarding Jiwani, he said.  India was likely born in a car, and Jiwani allegedly drove the newborn for a ""significant period of time"" before discarding her, Freeman said. There was no attempt to leave the newborn with a ""safe haven"" such as a fire station or hospital, which is legal within 30 days of the birth in the state, he noted.  ""This child was tied up in a plastic bag and thrown into the woods like a bag of trash. I can't understand that,"" Freeman said. ""It literally is one of the saddest things I have ever seen.""  The sheriff wouldn't discuss motive, due to the ongoing investigation. The case will be brought to a grand jury, he said.  Freeman said he would not discuss India, besides to say she's ""happy and healthy.""  ""Baby India is now prospering,"" he said.  People were ""waiting in line"" to adopt India following her miraculous recovery, Tom Rawlings, then-director of Georgia's Division of Family and Children Service, told ""Good Morning America"" at the time.  ""In child protective services we deal with a lot of tragedy, of course, but it's great to have a miracle,"" Rawlings said of baby India's survival. ""And this truly is a miracle.""  Rawlings was not able to disclose too much about where the baby was due to confidentiality reasons.  The first deputy to the scene recounted finding the baby in an interview with ""Good Morning America.""  ""I wanted to give her comfort,"" Forsyth Sheriff's Deputy Terry Roper said in the weeks after the discovery. ""A little bit later I realized it was the first time she had felt love, and I felt honored to be able to give her that.""  Roper was present for Thursday's arrest, Freeman said.  There were additional children in Jiwani's home at the time of her arrest, ranging from ""school age to near adult,"" Freeman said. The sheriff's office has requested that the state's Division of Family and Children Services evaluate the situation and put a safety plan in place, he said.  The night India was found, two sisters heard the baby's cries and went to investigate with their parents, after initially thinking it might have been a cat.  ""It sounded like a baby, but you never would think that it's a baby,"" Kayla Ragatz told ""Good Morning America"" at the time.  When they found the baby in the plastic bag, her sister, Kyler Ragatz, said she ""started bawling"" due to the emotional discovery.  ""I was angry, scared, sad,"" she added.  Freeman thanked the family's efforts in finding the baby during Friday's press briefing.  ""I call it divine intervention -- and I truly believe that still today,"" he said.

"miracle","2021-02-23","Not Discerned","{""Mutoko"", ""MashonalandEast"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-20T03:58:51","Martha Nyambipo and her husband Tapiwa Mutare  Incessant chest and stomach pains are what Martha Nyambipo (32) is left with to remind her of a near death experience in 2020, and a miracle differed.  She is the mother of the famous Siamese twins separated in February 2021 by a huge team of doctors at one of the country’s health institutions.  She told NewsDay Weekender during a visit to her Banket home that the twins tragically died in the same year they were separated.  “I’m reminded of what I encountered through the pregnancy and what happened after that. I had hopes they would grow up against the odds, but it was God’s will and I accept what happened,” Nyambipo said.  “When I was pregnant, I developed chest pains coupled with difficulty in breathing, I approached our local hospital in Mutoko and I was told to go for a scan,” she said, while narrating how she got to know the condition of her unborn babies.  At the hospital, she was made aware of what every mother would dread, that her children were sharing organs.  “They told me to go for further expert tests at Parirenyatwa Hospital and I was told the children were sharing blood,” she said.  Her alternate stay in hospital began then.  Her chest and breathing challenges continued to worsen until she gave birth through Caesarean section (C-section) in December of 2020.  Unlike any mother, her joy of giving birth was short-lived as it was confirmed that the twins were conjoined.  The twins, Anotidaishe and Atipaishe, were joined at the abdominopelvic region and were successfully operated on in a 22-hour surgery performed on February 23, 2021 at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, formerly Harare Central Hospital.  The operation involved sharing the liver and intestines between the two babies. While talking to our sister paper The Standard in 2021 after the successful operation, Nyambipo said at first she had no hope that her children would be successfully separated.  She repeated the same during the recent visit by NewsDay Weekender, adding that her faith was boosted after the operation.  She said she was comforted by the welcoming and good treatment she got from health personnel attending to her and the twins during their prolonged stay in hospital.  “I would have not made it during childbirth, but it is by the Grace of God that I am alive today. It’s all good that I survived to see my remaining children through.”  Apart from the twins, she and her husband, Tapiwa Mutare, have two older children.  “I am grateful for the efforts made by government and the health personnel who tried to ensure my boys made it. It is unfortunate that they didn’t. I had doubts they would make it, not that I didn’t have faith in our health personnel, but something from within kept telling me we may be fighting a losing battle,” she said.  “My stay was made easier by the love I was given while in hospital,” she said.  The first twin died at four months, while the second died at seven months.  So rare are conjoined twins that their occurrence is estimated to range from one in 50 000 births to one in 200 000 births in the world.  The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is approximately one in four.  Owing to the ill-health she carried forward from giving birth, Nyambipo and her husband Tapiwa Mutare living under difficult circumstances, both are not working, but have the mercy of living rent free at her in-laws’ house.  They relocated to Banket from Mutoko during the time she was having complications with her pregnancy.  “Previously, we were into small-scale gold mining in Mutoko, where we both come from. It is my wish to get a simple job to do as I cannot do hard jobs now,” Nyambipo said.  “Apart from the chest problem, I also developed challenges with my stomach which began after I gave birth to the twins.”  “It is my wish to establish what is really wrong with me but financial constraints are making the mission impossible.”  Nyambipo said she is unable to afford proper healthcare beyond paying the nominal consultation fees, leaving her to rely on over-the-counter painkillers.  “I don’t understand where the stomach problems come from because the pains usually start when I eat, I don’t know what it is that is not getting along with my system.  “I was told to go for visual inspection with asetic acid camera (Viac) but they found no problem,” she said.  So dire is their situation that she does household chores for other people to earn money to feed the family.  “Normally, I charge US$2. It is my wish to get well and be able to provide for my family,” she said.  Nyambipo expressed hope of having more children though their current state of living was serving as a deterrent.  Her husband said he has a desire to get a permanent job to ensure that their remaining children have a better life.  “It pains me to see them go to school without proper requirements. The first born is still in Grade Two at 10 years and the second is in Grade One at seven years,” Mutare said.  “I feel helpless seeing my wife facing all those challenges. Sometimes I find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that my wife has had to endure such extremes emanating from childbirth.  “The death of the twins was painful, but we had to accept it because the children were in pain.”  Mervyn Venge, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said linking Nyambipo’s current state of health to giving birth to Siamese twins may not be ideal.  Venge said many reasons could be drawn to explain the twins’ deaths.  “It’s difficult to link the two, but also difficult to dismiss her worries,” he said.  “This (death) depends on a number of factors from the shared organs, birth weight, among other things. Remember Siamese are rare, so it will be difficult for one to say they will survive to a certain stage.” Atipaishe and Anotidaishe became the country’s second successfully separated conjoined twins after the historic first such feat that was executed by surgeon Bothwell Mbuwayesango in 2014 and a team of health personnel.  Zimbabwe has had five documented cases of conjoined twins since independence and only one was referred outside the country, while in two instances, the babies died before surgery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY28uencvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMDAxMTc4MS9mZWF0dXJlLW15LWNvbmpvaW5lZC10d2lucy13ZXJlLW15LW1pcmFjbGXSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzZGF5LmNvLnp3L2FtcC9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvMjAwMDExNzgxL2ZlYXR1cmUtbXktY29uam9pbmVkLXR3aW5zLXdlcmUtbXktbWlyYWNsZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Residents said the NTZ around Lamlash Bay - established in 2008 after more than a decade of campaigning by locals - had allowed sea life to replenish and thrive.  But they insisted such projects had to come from the ""bottom up"" and be driven by the community.  It comes amid the heated debate over Scottish Government plans to designate 10 per cent of coastal waters as Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) by 2026.  The landmark proposals would see effective no-take zones set up in these areas, meaning bans on all fishing, dredging, aquaculture and most other human activities.  (Image: Alasdair MacLeod/Daily Record)  But the plans - aimed at restoring marine ecosystems - have been met with fierce resistance by the fishing industry who claim they could decimate livelihoods in fragile coastal communities.  In Lamlash Bay, Howard Wood - a local diver and award-winning environmental campaigner - said the efforts of the community in establishing the NTZ were vital.  Mr Wood, co-founder of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST), told the Record: “You need both (the government and the community).  “The government has to put in certain measures, but then things like HPMAs have to come from the bottom up.  “And I didn't agree with the 10 per cent, two year deadline. The No Take Zone here took a minimum of 13 years to slowly move forward.  “We don't have 13 years now - we have to move forward.  “To me, they're essential, but they're essential with other measures to recover our seas.""  And he warned: “They need to grow organically. They can't be imposed on people.""  In the 1990s, catches in the Lamlash Bay area fell by a shocking 96 per cent - leading locals to begin their long campaign for better marine protections, which covers 2.67 square kilometres.  Thanks to the NTZ, over the last decade researchers have found a huge resurgence of marine critters, with more abundant, more fertile and bigger species like lobsters and scallops established.  (Image: Alasdair MacLeod/Daily Record)  Seabed biodiversity is up by 50 per cent and local divers, fishermen and anglers say they can see how fish populations are recovering.  It comes as COAST yesterday launched a new research vessel which will ramp up monitoring of sea life.  Net Zero and Just Transition Secretary Mairi McAllan, attending to christen the RV COAST Explorer catamaran vessel, hailed the group's work as a beacon of “community empowerment”.  She said: “This project has over many years been led by the people, with the people, for the people - and I think we would all agree that is the only way to do this.”  It comes after First Minister Humza Yousaf vowed not to impose HPMAs on communities against their wishes.  The special marine conservation areas were a key part of the Nationalists’ Bute House power sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.  (Image: Alasdair MacLeod/Daily Record)  But they’ve sparked a seismic backlash - including claims that HPMAs could impose a modern-day “Highland Clearances” on coastal and island communities.  Local man Andrew Binnie, a former director of COAST, said such claims were “utter nonsense”.  He said: “It's a real pity that the debate around HPMAs has become, frankly, hysterical… this is something that will actually be good for fishing in Scotland.”  Those in favour of NTZs and HPMAs highlight how, once areas have been allowed to recover, fishermen in nearby parts benefit from the “spillover effects” from increased fish populations.  Mr Binnie added: “We’re finding that lobsters are much, much bigger even outside the No Take Zone - and the local creelers like that fact.”  Cicely Gill, chair of COAST and a resident of nearby Whiting Bay since 1968, said underwater films on the organisation’s website revealed the stunning recovery of marine life at the NTZ site.  (Image: Alasdair MacLeod/Daily Record)  She told the Record: “When you’re looking at the bay on the No Take Zone, you’re thinking, ‘Is this the Caribbean?'  “It’s amazing! And so colourful. There are amazing things under there.”  The bay boasts one of the largest areas of maerl beds in Scotland - a coral-like pink seaweed which forms a maze for small species to find food and hide from predators.  The area also has patches of seagrass beds, kelp forests and spectacular boulders covered with sea life.  Joining McAllan for the launch event were Green MSPs Ross Greer and Ariane Burgess, Labour MSP Katy Clark and SNP MP Patricia Gibson.  The Daily Record joined the politicians on board the explorer vessel on a trip out to the bay to learn more about the area’s recovery.  (Image: Alasdair MacLeod/Daily Record)  Speaking afterwards, West Scotland MSP Greer said the fact-finding mission had been “inspiring”.  Greer said: “Across the west of Scotland, we have seen a really steady long term decline in our fishing industry but also massive, catastrophic declines in fish stocks, because of overfishing because of environmental degradation.  “We have an opportunity to fix all these problems through the HPMAs.”  But Labour’s Clark, who also represents West Scotland, said the government had mishandled the policy.  She said: “I've been convinced for a long time that we need to take action to prohibit certain types of activities in areas of the seas.  “I'm really, really disappointed with the way this debate has developed and the way the Scottish Government has handled it - which seems to be about going to war with some of the communities which potentially might be affected.”  Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here .

"miracle","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Eden"", ""UnitedStates"", ""female""}","2023-05-19T16:52:36","IPL 2023  KKR out to get LSG in search of Eden miracle  by Cricbuzz Staff • Published on  Can KKR make a dramatic climb up the table? © BCCI  The side ranked eighth on the points table is one victory away from equalling the wins-tally of the side ranked second. This encapsulates the margins of this IPL. With every team having one game remaining at the time of writing, LSG, ranked third, have 7 wins, and KKR, ranked seventh, have 6 wins. The two sides, however, have had a vastly different journey.  LSG haven't had the best time with injuries, and have won some very close contests. They have had some ugly incidents off the field. And yet, like a gritty accumulator in fifty-over cricket, they've been consistently in the top four without anyone noticing.  They've had a woefully out-of-form captain opening for them, a captain who then got injured, and replaced. They haven't had a whole lot of stability in their XI. And yet, players have put their hand up when required - most recently, Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran in the batting department, quietly digging Ws out of their graves.  Their bowling hasn't been star-studded, but for most of the tournament, it has been reliable, and certainly not a liability. And when it has been, LSG's batters have put their hand up to finish the job, and make up for their shortcomings.  KKR were the side handed the wooden spoon. They had the personnel, but even their star players were limited. Little did the world know, that the two-time champions would become quintessential scrappers, and dig up new stars. Shardul Thakur single-handedly took them to their first win, and Rinku Singh did the unthinkable to notch up their second.  Since then, KKR have found out that one-man shows couldn't sustain them to the title, but they eventually got what they were looking for - consistency in their batting, with Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh leading the charge, and the prowess of Jason Roy and Venkatesh Iyer up top, who have blown hot and cold, but put their hand up when required. Their bowling, too, found their lost panache, with their spinners outplaying CSK in their own game, at their own den last weekend.  In this case, the numbers hardly tell the full story, and the ranks, even less so. LSG have quietly gotten to the top and are on the verge of qualification, and KKR are on their way to scripting their own miracle. Their own underdog's tale. Destiny permitting, of course.  When:Kolkata Knight Riders vs. Lucknow Super Giants, Saturday, May 20, 7:30PM IST  Where:Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect:A typically true surface at the Eden where the powerplay and the death overs are likely to belong to the batters, and the bowlers will typically have a chance to make a comeback in the middle overs.  The surfaces have held up pretty well throughout, and lately it's been the KKR spin trio of Suyash Sharma, Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine that have rediscovered how to bowl at the Eden. They've started to make the difference, bowling miserly spells at the Eden, and forcing the batters into false shots and giving away their wickets.  Head to Head:LSG have won both their games against KKR.  Team Watch  Kolkata Knight Riders  Injury/Unavailability:None reported  Tactics and Matchups:Deepak Hooda and Marcus Stoinis have had trouble picking up Andre Russell's variations, with 4 dismissals in 20 balls for just 8 runs between them. The LSG batters have had no answers to Sunil Narine either, with only one in four of their batters striking at over 100 against him - Deepak Hooda.  Probable XII:Rahmanullah Gurbaz (w), Jason Roy, Venkatesh Iyer, Nitish Rana (c), Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Shardul Thakur, Sunil Narine, Vaibhav Arora, Harshit Rana, Suyash Sharma, Varun Chakaravarthy  Lucknow Super Giants:  Injury/Unavailability:Suryansh Shegde has replaced replaced Jaydev Unadkat in the LSG squad for the rest of the season, as the Saurashtra pacer sustained a shoulder injury during training.  Tactics and Matchups:Quinton de Kock has an average of 37 against Kolkata Knight Riders, at a strike-rate of 152, including a stunning 70-ball 140* against them in the 2022 season - one of the most incredible IPL knocks.  Although recency bias is valid in this case, outside of this knock, de Kock's average falls to a paltry 21 against KKR. However, de Kock has his KKR bowlers he targets - against the spinners (Narine and Chakravarthy), he strikes at 100 and 126 respectively, but he more than makes up for it against the pacers, scoring 89 off 37 at a strike-rate of 240 against Russell, and 44 off 31 at 142 against Shardul.  Probable XII:Quinton de Kock (w), Kyle Mayers, Deepak Hooda, Prerak Mankad, Krunal Pandya (c), Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Naveen-ul-Haq, Ravi Bishnoi, Swapnil Singh, Mohsin Khan  Did You Know?  - The Rinku-Rana pair has been prolific in run-chases this season: Rinku has scored three fifties in six innings, for 238 runs, at an average of 119, and a stunning strike-rate of 167. Rana has three fifties in six innings too, with 279 runs at an average of 55.8, and a strike-rate close to 150.  - Although Andre Russell hasn't been at his best this season, he strikes at a stunning 193 at the Eden Gardens, with 797 runs in 30 innings. Of the 220 runs he's scored this season, he has scored 102 of them in sixes.  - Nicholas Pooran has scored 20 runs in 11 balls against Shardul Thakur, but has also been dismissed three times by him  What they said:  ""I hope no one has the kind of injury I had. My nerves and arteries got block, and the support staff and my family were very supportive. I struggled through the surgery and thought I was never going to play cricket again, because I couldn't lift or straighten my hand. They said that my hand might have had to be amputated if we waited a month more, so I'm just thankful that I can play, and I'd like to keep performing for my team."" - Mohsin Khanof LSG recalls his injury days, and his comeback to defend 11 runs in the final over against MI.  ""The beauty about Narine is that he is very confident, he understands his skills, and after playing in these conditions over and over again, I think he understands what went wrong. The conversations are more about understanding and his preparation for every game. The last few games he has been playing around with the angles and understanding the speed he has been bowling at and compared it to his best. It's amazing that he's had a great comeback at a very important stage for us.""Abhishek Nayar,Assistant Coach of KKR, is all praise for the back-in-form Sunil Narine after a match-winning spell against CSK.  © Cricbuzz  TAGS  RELATED STORIES","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTI2NTk4L2trci1vdXQtdG8tZ2V0LWxzZy1pbi1zZWFyY2gtb2YtZWRlbi1taXJhY2xlLWNyaWNidXp6Y29t0gFmaHR0cDovL20uY3JpY2J1enouY29tL2FtcC9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTI2NTk4L2trci1vdXQtdG8tZ2V0LWxzZy1pbi1zZWFyY2gtb2YtZWRlbi1taXJhY2xlLWNyaWNidXp6Y29t?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On May 18, an intricate cataract surgery was carried out by Koreans at a municipal hospital in Addis Ababa.  That operation was organized by Koreans as part of a project to facilitate eye examinations and complex surgeries such as those for cataracts for surviving Korean War veterans and their families in Ethiopia in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice.  In Ethiopia, 8.8 million of the total population of 115 million, that is 7.7%, are visually impaired, and there are only about 160 ophthalmologists.  Also in 1974, when they became a communist regime, the Korean War veterans were expelled and had their property confiscated for fighting for the opposition. They lived in extreme poverty and were not able to receive proper medical treatment.  The Koreans who planned this project were employees of the cosmetics brand Infresh. Recognizing that even daily activity is a challenge for most Ethiopian war veterans due to their severe visual impairment, they planned this large-scale surgery assistance project in collaboration with Vision Care, an international relief NGO dedicated to the prevention of blindness, and its Ethiopian branch.  They said, “We received great help from the Korean War veterans who sacrificed themselves for Korea, so it is our goal to provide the best support possible for every single one of them.” They announced, “Starting with Ethiopia, we are planning to visit and help veterans from 16 different countries.”  An Ethiopian war veteran who received cataract surgery through the project said, “I am grateful to the Koreans who did not forget what I did. I don’t have much time left to live, but I will remember it.” He then thanked the Koreans who sponsored him.  In response to the gratitude of so many veterans, a Korean who participated in the project stated, “We will always feel grateful for what the Ethiopian veterans did for us. We just did what we were supposed to do as Koreans,” conveying their sincere love for those they helped.  Many Ethiopians applaud this important relationship between the two countries that began 70 years ago with the Korean War as well as the Koreans who have not forgotten to express their gratitude even after such a long time has passed.  https://www.infresh.kr  [email protected]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyZXRoaW9waWEuY29tLzMzOTkyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Compartir Copiar enlace  WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Telegram  They're not done yet. A 2-0 home win against Mirandés on Saturday has kept Malaga's faint chances of survival alive going into the penultimate match day.  Malaga 2 0 - Mirandés  A strong La Rosaleda crowd (around 18,000) witnessed what was, all told, quite an easy win for the Blue and Whites against a side whose own safety is already guaranteed.  That said, there was a strange atmosphere around the ground, with the majority of fans accepting that relegation to the third tier is a foregone conclusion.  To that end, the 'Grada de Animación', the most vocal supporters groups who congregate in the southernmost stand, put on a show of defiance against how the club has been run and the ""mercenaries"" on the pitch.  These fans orchestrated a protest which took place an hour before kick-off outside the ground, with much of the anger directed towards the club's administrator for the last three years, José María Muñoz, and the sporting director until February, Manolo Gaspar.  Once in the ground, there was a distinct feeling of indifference towards the game, with many fans remaining practically silent during the first half.  A dominant performance  Minutes later, Pablo Chavarría wasted a good chance from close range but made amends within seconds of the restart following the break.  After some excellent hold-up play, the Argentinian dinked a cross to the back post where Lago Junior was ready and waiting to convert with a header of his own - his fourth of the season.

KKR are currently in seventh place in the points table with six wins and seven losses, while LSG is third with seven wins and five losses.  So, merely a win will not suffice for the Knights. They will have to beat Lucknow by a significant margin and also hope that other results go in their favour, needing Punjab Kings (vs Rajasthan Royals), Gujarat Titans (vs Royal Challengers Bangalore) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (Mumbai Indians) to win their respective matches. A win, however, would be enough for their opponents, LSG, to seal their playoff berth.  KKR only have themselves to blame for their position, failing to find consistency with the bat, ball, or in the field, ultimately following up some impressive wins with disappointing losses.  KKR have also been unable to take advantage of the home conditions with an apparent lack of communication between the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and the franchise. Their captain Nitish Rana has rued the lack of home advantage, but the Eden Gardens pitch curator Sujan Mukherjee has made it clear that he is not obligated to provide pitches that the home team wants.  KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit, speaking on the eve of the match, shed some light on the matter and said, “Home advantage is a bit of a misunderstood concept. In my experience, I have seen teams failing to win games despite having favourable conditions. It is all about how to win games. Yes, we are playing at home, but despite having this home advantage, we could not win enough games, which was unfortunate.”  “But in the IPL, many other teams have also failed to take the home advantage. However, we should have taken the advantage of playing at home,” he explained. “As far as pitches are concerned, they have changed over time. Nobody can give a guarantee on it, and it happens sometimes.”  Where KKR have also faltered is not being able to crack the code of a winning combination, thereby suffering seven defeats. Out of those seven, four losses were at the Eden Gardens.  The only shining lights in this season have been the performances of Rinku Singh and Varun Chakravarthy. It is probably due to the duo that KKR have kept their campaign alive, albeit mathematically.  Advertisement  Pandit believes their team is focused on winning the game rather than looking at the table. “We won our last game, and momentum is with us, and we want to finish on a good note and make it to the playoffs by winning the game,” he said.  Reflecting on the season, Pandit said, “The tournament was very tough, and despite whatever our team has done, we could have done much better. (We) still want to do much better.”  Jersey Talk  LSG’s decision to wear a special jersey with Mohun Bagan colours on it (with both the teams having the same owner) has led to much chatter on social media. While some fans are divided over whom to support, others have called for mature behaviour and take it as a mark of respect being shown to the 100-year-old football club of the city and not make too much about it.  Another interesting factor will be the presence of LSG mentor Gautam Gambhir, who led KKR to their two triumphs in 2012 and 2014, and he will probably add all his valuable input. But according to KKR coach Pandit, he won’t impact the Knights.  One eye on the weather  Advertisement  Players of both teams will have one eye on the weather amidst predictions of a storm. Over the last couple of days, the city of joy has been witnessing thunderstorms and rains in the evening, and as per Accuweather, there is a chance of a similar event on Saturday as well.  Key Matchups  Varun Chakravarthy has been KKR’s go-to guy in high-pressure situations, be it in the powerplay or at the death.

"miracle","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T06:27:33","LOS ANGELES — Brittney Griner, who less than six months ago was in a Russian prison and fearing she might not ever get home, made her official return to professional basketball Friday night.  Griner, 32, had a team-high 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting, six rebounds and four blocks for the Phoenix Mercury in a 94-71 loss to the Los Angeles Sparks on opening night for the WNBA. It was another milestone in her path back from a harrowing ordeal that included almost 10 months of detainment.  © Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports Brittney Griner scored a team-high 18 points in her return to the WNBA.  “It’s a miracle that she’s here,’’ Mercury head coach Vanessa Nygaard told reporters before the game.  From NFL plays to college sports scores, all the top sports news you need to know every day.  Shortly before tipoff, Griner exchanged hugs with Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who were in attendance at Crypto.com Arena. Other notables included Dawn Staley, Billie Jean King, Magic Johnson and former Lakers stars Pau Gasol and Michael Cooper.  The boisterous crowd of 10,396, full of young fans, some wearing “We Are BG’’ pins in honor of Griner, gave her a long and loud standing ovation.  'TOMORROW'S NOT GUARANTEED' Brittney Griner reflects on ordeal in Russia after opener  ""It was nice to be back for a real game and everything. The love from the fans when I came out was amazing,"" Griner said after the game.  Griner, an eight-time All-Star, quickly made her presence felt on the court.  After winning the opening tip, Griner dished out an assist on the Mercury’s first possession, grabbed a defensive rebound after racing down the court and moments later drained a 21-foot jumper to put Phoenix up 5-0. It was a surreal sight considering the ordeal that began in February 2022 when she was playing for a pro team in Russia.  Griner was detained at a Moscow airport after vape cartridges containing cannabis oil allegedly were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the drug charges and was sentenced to nine years in prison and moved to a penal colony.  Freed in December as part of a prisoner swap, the 6-foot-9 center took the court to rousing cheers at Crypto.com Arena for a game televised nationally by ESPN.  It had been been 578 days since Griner played in her last WNBA game — Game 4 of the 2021 WNBA Finals — and a chance to hear her name during player introductions created ""a swell of emotions.""  ""Didn’t get to experience that for a while, so just taking it in but staying focused because at the end of the day I’ve got a job to do,"" Griner said.  It was the first game of a 40-game regular season that will test Griner’s ability to regain her All-Star form. During the 2021 season, the last she played in the WNBA, Griner was an MVP candidate.  The Mercury open at home on Sunday against the Chicago Sky.

Enter Ian Botham. With his side 41 for four when following on, Botham played one of the great Test innings, smashing 149 to make Australia bat again and set an albeit modest target of 130. Enter Bob Willis. The fast bowler produced the spell of his lifetime, decimating the Australian batting order in taking eight wickets for 43 runs to seal a famous 18-run victory. Instead of being 2-0 down in the series, England went on to win 3-1.  Miracle of Medinah  We need your consent to load this Social Media content.

The United States had dominated the opening two days on their home soil of Medinah in Chicago, opening up a 10-4 lead in the race to 14.5 ahead of Sunday’s singles. But Spanish captain Jose Maria Olazabal channelled the spirit of his mentor Seve Ballesteros and Europe produced a sea of blue on the leaderboard, with Martin Kaymer sealing the most unlikely of victories when he rolled home a 10-foot putt to claim a 14.5-13.5 victory.

Laying prone on the canvas he appeared out cold until midway through the referee’s count, when he came back to life, shot up and was somehow able to carry on. Fury thought he had earlier done enough to be awarded a points victory, but the judges controversially scored it a draw. However Fury dominated the two subsequent rematches and still retains the WBC belt.  Miracle of Istanbul  We need your consent to load this Social Media content.

The SEC filing shows that Commonwealth Equity Services owned 37,673 shares of the basic materials company’s stock after selling 3,700 shares during the period. This equates to 0.07% of Scotts Miracle-Gro, valuing at approximately $1,830,000.  Following this report, numerous brokerages have given their opinion on SMG stock. UBS Group reported a decrease in price target on Scotts Miracle-Gro from $80.00 to $70.00 in May 2021. Raymond James also reduced their target price on Scotts Miracle-Gro from $92.00 to $86.00 during the same time scale as UBS Group.  Truist Financial continued expressing concern with the company’s growth prospects and lowered its target price for SMG from $70 to $65 per share.The downgrades came amidst financial ructions stemming from prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns and related factors affecting sales performance across key markets.  On a positive note, StockNews.com upgraded Scotts Miracle-Gro from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating on Wednesday while Wells Fargo & Company noted that the stock was undervalued at its current levels and reduced their target price from $100 to $85 due to softer-than-expected sales revenues in recent quarters.  Scotts Miracle-Gro currently holds an average rating of “Moderate Buy” with four analysts suggesting shareholders hold and three suggesting advising clients buy into their portfolio amongst those rating shares as hold or buystocks.  Despite fluctuations experienced within its relative industry segment and broader economic environment conditions,Scootsshares opened trading strongly today following announcements regarding management plans for expanding operations whilst implementing effective cost control efforts to boost margins.  SMG stock opened at $68.58 on Thursday, with the company’s market capitalization standing at around $3.85 billion. The business has a P/E ratio of -6.12, which indicates negative earnings from its current operations.Meanwhile, Scotts reported a debt-to-equity ratio of 22.82 as well as viable quick and current ratios of 1.25 and 2.07 respectively.The two-hundred day simple moving average for SMG right now stands at $65.40 with shares trading up week to date by approximately 10%.  In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly impacted sector-specific markets over this past year, as evidenced by changing market valuations and shifting financial strategy guidance issued into recent quarters,much will rely on a range of forward-looking peripheral economic indicators like evolving interest rates in major investment markets,application of fiscal stimulus measures by governments etc., when forecasting how cyclical stocks like SMG may fare moving into the future. For now, shareholders are encouraged to exercise patience as they assess whether or not conditions ahead can bring about positive growth momentum needed to justify their continuation in holding withScotts Miracle-Gro going forward.

The company reported $3.78 earnings per share for the quarter, which beat analysts’ consensus estimates of $3.20 by $0.58. However, their revenue was down 8.8% compared to the same quarter last year.  Despite this decline in sales, institutional investors still hold 68.98% of Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock. Many large investors have also recently modified their holdings of the company, including ExodusPoint Capital Management LP which bought a new position during the third quarter worth $1,988,000.  In contrast to these bullish signals from institutional investors, CEO James Hagedorn sold 25,000 shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro stock at an average price of $67.00 per share for a total transaction value of $1,675,000. Hagedorn still owns just over 179 thousand shares of SMG stock with a total value worth approximately $12 million.  Multiple brokerages have weighed in on SMG’s future prospects as well, with UBS Group decreasing their price target from $80 to $70 in a report released earlier this month while Raymond James reduced their target price from $92 to $86 and Wells Fargo & Company trimmed theirs from $100 to $85.  Overall though Scotts Miracle-Gro seems poised for steady growth with four analysts rating it as a hold while three rate it as a buy and one gave it a strong buy rating according to data from Bloomberg.com which also reports an average price target of $76.29 and labels SMG’s stock as having a “Moderate Buy” rating.

"miracle","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:37:04","According to UN Women, it will take centuries to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SGD) 5 – global gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls – if we continue to progress at our current rate. With the SDG deadline falling in 2030, serious initiatives and work are needed to empower women and promote equality.  However, in 2021 UN Women unveiled a series of innovative financing strategies, in collaboration with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE), to promote gender equality through bonds.  A bond is when an investor loans money to a government or company and receives a certain amount of interest back called a coupon rate. Bonds will also meet a maturity date after which the investor’s loan is repaid in full.  The guidance publication, titled “Bonds to bridge the gender gap: A practitioner’s guide to using sustainable debt for gender equality,” aims to help people “use sustainable bonds to credibly access financing for projects and strategies that advance gender equality objectives and achieve lasting impact.”  Two years on, some bonds are close to their maturity date whilst others are still in the first year of trading. UN Women has begun to release case studies by country that detail how the initiative is going. The case studies are free to download and read here.  In Mexico for example, a bond of approximately $150 million USD was issued by the Fideicomisos Instituidos en Relación con la Agricultura (FIRA) [Trust Funds for Rural Development] with a coupon rate of Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE) +27 basis points (bp). This bond is set to reach maturity in October 2023 so FIRA issued a second one of approximately $175 million USD with a coupon rate of TIIE +16 bp.  The proceeds were used to grant credit recipient status to women and businesses run by women, therefore increasing financial inclusion. The proceeds also meant women and women-ran businesses were able to claim loans for themselves as well as loans helping them to secure productive infrastructure.  In terms of reaching women in Mexico who may be less financially educated, UN Women tell Impakter: “The funds raised on capital markets are strictly allocated to rural women who typically face restrictions such as the lack of productive assets and resources, access to credit, networks of producers, inputs and guarantees for loans that are necessary in the agricultural sector.”  ""Along the way, I started building my new identity and began rediscovering the world,"" says Mervat Azzmy, a small shop owner selling women's products in Egypt. Learn more about Mervat and our work on women's economic empowerment.  👉https://t.co/cOFxAMdFkK Via @unwomenarabic pic.twitter.com/SKvSflBAzJ — UN Women (@UN_Women) May 10, 2023  How do gender bonds actually help?  The guidance will help bond issuers integrate gender equality objectives into the use of proceeds and key performance indicators, as we are now seeing in Mexico.  The use of gender bonds in Mexico is contributing towards achieving several SDGs: Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 5, Goal 8 and Goal 10. By ensuring that everyone has the same access to economic resources, regardless of gender or income, the belief is that this ensures a “level playing field” so that the levels of poverty and hunger can be expected to decrease.  Gender bonds are also meant to increase women’s participation at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life, ensuring women, men and young people can have decent employment opportunities with fair pay regardless of ability.  All of this is designed to help reduce inequalities stemming from gender, race, age, religion or any other factor within the country as well as between separate countries.  A country where gender-targeted bonds are making a notable impact is Finland – perhaps helped along by a very egalitarian society that has long been used to sophisticated financial instruments. Here, impact investor Finnfund issued a bond of €75 million with a coupon rate of +125 bp. The bond will reach maturity date in October 2025 but the proceeds are already helping to meet the requirements of multiple SDGs.  As well as financial inclusion, ensuring affordable health care and bridging the digital gender gap, the bond in Finland is helping to create more sustainable food systems by training women in agribusiness.  In addition to all the SDGs that the Mexican bond is aligned to, the proceeds from the Finnish bond also help to meet SDG 9 – innovation and inclusive, sustainable industrialisation. This is being achieved by levelling up access to the internet and helping small-scale industrial businesses access financial services such as affordable credit.  Inspiring exchange with CEO of @LuxembourgSE @BeckerLuxSE on the place of gender focused bonds in the sustainable bonds market, #AI, #genderfinance and the representation of women in an inclusive society. @LuxembourgSE is a key driver in these fields in🇱🇺. pic.twitter.com/FTus2bXEBK — Luxembourg Ladies Ambassadors Club (@LLAC_Luxembourg) May 15, 2023  Using financial instruments to help meet SDGs, however, implies that many conditions for success are already in place, in particular, familiarity with instruments such as bonds and what they can do. There is potential for bonds to be much more successful in countries where there is already a relatively high degree of gender equality.  The case study for Tanzania states that the bond issuer “had to find an innovative way of reaching out to specifically communicate with and lend to women.”  UN Women say they place “special focus on innovative programs to drive the financial independence of women, including rural entrepreneurs who are typically less included in the formal economy.”  Some countries, UN Women notes, “are in high risk of debt distress or already in debt distress.” This means that introducing the bonds initiative here is more complicated. In order to mobilize foreign capital into these areas, UN Women “plan to continue raising awareness about these instruments and build capacity in the region.”  “Working with the private sector can also allow accelerating the mobilization of financing flows and seeing more gender bonds come to market,” UN Women say.  These case studies, and the SDGs they are addressing, are showing that gender equality is a keystone objective when it comes to meeting many SDGs. By focusing the proceeds of bonds onto communities of women in business or helping them to access financial support, we could be unlocking a fast track to satisfy multiple SDGs at once.

WA DOT WA DOT loading...  Amazing Feel-Good Rescue Miracle Right Here In Washington State  On a busy Saturday, anything is possible on the roads of Washington State. Luckily, Washington Department of Transportation worker Brandon, part of the Incident Response Team, jumped in to save a furry four-legged friend that accidentally wandered onto a dangerous highway. Here is the incident as posted by Washington State DOT on their Facebook account:  On Saturday, May 7, one of our amazing IRT drivers, Brandon, got word from the Washington State Patrol of a dog running loose on SR 520 between West Lake Sammamish Boulevard in Redmond and 140th Avenue Northeast in Bellevue.  Drivers stopped on the highway trying to rescue the pup, who was running frantically in the shoulder. Luckily, Brandon got to the scene quickly and stopped traffic to wrangle up the furry friend, who he appropriately named Frogger.  Although the dog, who we later learned is actually named Maggie, was understandably scared with all that was going on, she eventually relaxed and was relieved to be in the safe and calm hands of one of our first responders.  WA DOT WA DOT loading...  State Patrol later arrived to pick Maggie up and take her to a nearby shelter, where we heard she was later reunited with her family.

"miracle","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Oxford"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T09:18:19","NEW ORLEANS -- It's a cliche that Kymyona Burk heard a little too often: ""Thank God for Mississippi.""  As the state's literacy director, she knew politicians in other states would say it when their reading test scores were down -- because at least they weren't ranked as low as Mississippi. Or Louisiana. Or Alabama.  Lately, the way people talk about those states has started to change. Instead of looking down on the Gulf South, they're seeing it as a model.  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  ""In this region, we have decided to go big,"" said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi's legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country's highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the ""Mississippi miracle."" Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute's CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there's no secret to the strategy.  ""We know how to teach reading,"" she said. ""We just have to do it everywhere.""  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They've dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten, informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don't teach kids how to read but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergartners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading. It's well worth the time, according to Assistant Principal Erika Brown, who said that in college she didn't learn a thing about teaching kids to read.  ""I was winging it,"" she said of her early years in teaching.  During a recent session with four second-grade girls, Brown had the girls spell ""crib,"" asking, ""What are the sounds you hear?""  Like a choir, they chanted back four individual sounds, counting them with their fingers: ""c-rrr-i-buh."" This was one of the techniques Brown had learned in the training; counting four sounds, or phonemes, gave students a clue that the word had four letters. Increased screening also helped the school identify these girls as needing extra help.  ""Are y'all ready for a challenge word?"" Brown asked, and the girls shouted, ""Yeah!"" Their faces fell when Brown revealed the word: bedbug. They had no idea what the word even meant. But with Brown's gentle guidance, the girls broke down the word into six phonemes. They were even ready for another challenge.  ""Can we spell cock-a-roach?"" one of the girls asked.  A second-grader in the school, Joshua Lastie, said he likes how his teacher helps him if he trips over a hard word, like ""happened"" or ""suddenly.""  ""The school is trying to make the words way easier for kids,"" said Joshua, 7.  One challenge that comes with the emphasis on small-group intervention is the strain on scheduling and staffing. Literacy coaches from the state are helping the charter network strategize on how to reach all students. One resource the state can't provide is time, says Lisa Giarratano, the chief academic officer at ReNEW.  In a national climate where education debates are often polarizing, the three Gulf states passed their sweeping education reforms with bipartisan support, starting with Mississippi's in 2013. Louisiana state Rep. Richard Nelson, a Republican who has championed literacy reform, said pointing to laws passed in other Deep South states made it easier for him to introduce legislation and ""sell across party lines.""  ""Every time I present a bill, I say, 'Look, Mississippi has very similar challenges to what we have in Louisiana, and they've been able to make this work,'"" Nelson said.  There is still far to go for children in the Gulf South, especially considering the disruptions to schooling from the pandemic and several major hurricanes and tornadoes. Mississippi, after stellar gains in the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress, saw reading scores drop in 2022, although they are still at the national average. Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group, could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular. In 2019, Alabama ranked 49th in NAEP reading scores for low-income fourth-graders; in 2022, it ranked 27th. Amid the pandemic that saw most states lose ground, Louisiana soared from 42nd to 11th. Mississippi ranks second-highest in the country, after Florida.  Alabama's state superintendent of education, Eric Mackey, says he has confidence in the reforms -- in part because they've worked before. Alabama invested heavily in training on the science of reading, then known as phonics, in the early 2000s, and scores rose. Then the Great Recession hit, teachers and literacy coaches got laid off, and the state lost its gains.  Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  ""We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,"" Mackey said. ""This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1taXJhY2xlLWtpZHMtcmVhZGluZy1zY29yZXMtaGF2ZS8_bmV3cy1uYXRpb25hbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The commercialisation of solar cells that use perovskite follows years of breakthroughs with the mineral, which has been hailed as a ‘miracle material’ for its potential to transform various industries, including renewable energy.  Seoul-based Qcells said it will invest $100 million to roll out the next-generation solar cell technoloy, which until now has been limited to lab tests and academic research.  The investment will fund a pilot production line at a factory in Jincheon, which is projected to be operational by late next year.  “This investment in Jincheon will mark an important step in securing technological leadership,” said Qcells CEO Justin Lee.  “With a global R&D network spanning from Korea, Germany and the US, Qcells will ramp up its efforts to produce high-efficiency advanced tandem cells.”  Tandem solar cells are able to improve the efficiency of standard solar panels by splitting the light spectrum and optimising the harvesting of energy from each section into electricity.  The current world record for solar cell efficiency is 32.5 per cent – meaning nearly a third of solar radiation is converted into eletrical energy – which was achieved with a perovskite-silicon tandem cell in December.  By comparison, traditional silicon-based solar cells are currently only capable of reaching around 22 per cent efficiency.

Griner, 32, had a team-high 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting, six rebounds and four blocks for the Phoenix Mercury in a 94-71 loss to the Los Angeles Sparks on opening night for the WNBA. It was another milestone in her path back from a harrowing ordeal that included almost 10 months of detainment.  “It’s a miracle that she’s here,’’ Mercury head coach Vanessa Nygaard told reporters before the game.  Shortly before tipoff, Griner exchanged hugs with Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who were in attendance at Crypto.com Arena. Other notables included Dawn Staley, Billie Jean King, Magic Johnson and former Lakers stars Pau Gasol and Michael Cooper.  The boisterous crowd of 10,396, full of young fans, some wearing “We Are BG’’ pins in honor of Griner, gave her a long and loud standing ovation.  'TOMORROW'S NOT GUARANTEED'Brittney Griner reflects on ordeal in Russia after opener  ""It was nice to be back for a real game and everything. The love from the fans when I came out was amazing,"" Griner said after the game.  Griner, an eight-time All-Star, quickly made her presence felt on the court.  After winning the opening tip, Griner dished out an assist on the Mercury’s first possession, grabbed a defensive rebound after racing down the court and moments later drained a 21-foot jumper to put Phoenix up 5-0. It was a surreal sight considering the ordeal that began in February 2022 when she was playing for a pro team in Russia.  Griner was detained at a Moscow airport after vape cartridges containing cannabis oil allegedly were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the drug charges and was sentenced to nine years in prison and moved to a penal colony.  Freed in December as part of a prisoner swap, the 6-foot-9 center took the court to rousing cheers at Crypto.com Arena for a game televised nationally by ESPN.  It had been been 578 days since Griner played in her last WNBA game — Game 4 of the 2021 WNBA Finals — and a chance to hear her name during player introductions created ""a swell of emotions.""  ""Didn’t get to experience that for a while, so just taking it in but staying focused because at the end of the day I’ve got a job to do,"" Griner said.  It was the first game of a 40-game regular season that will test Griner’s ability to regain her All-Star form. During the 2021 season, the last she played in the WNBA, Griner was an MVP candidate.  The Mercury open at home on Sunday against the Chicago Sky.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvd25iYS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2JyaXR0bmV5LWdyaW5lci1tYWtlcy13bmJhLXJldHVybi1hZnRlci1ydXNzaWEtZGV0YWlubWVudC83MDIzODY4NzAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T22:09:00","There was a collective sigh of relief when Wyoming’s favorite bear, Grizzly 399, finally emerged from her hibernation den this week with a new cub.  Now comes the difficult part. What to name the cub?  Social media threads were abuzz with name suggestions this week, but as of Friday, 399’s adoring throngs had yet to settle on one.  Wildlife photographer Jorn Vangoidtsenhoven was one of the first to spot 399 and the cub – whose sex remains undetermined – on Tuesday afternoon in Teton Park.  There’s been considerable buzz that the cub should be called “Miracle,” he told Cowboy State Daily early Friday. That might be fitting. It could be regarded as a miracle that at age 27, 399 is still alive and healthy, much less raising a new cub.  Grizzly 399 stands next to her not-yet-named cub. (Photo is owned by Savannah Rose and may not be reproduced) (Cowboy State Daily Staff)  ‘Rascally Little Beastie’  However, the moniker “Rowdy” was gaining some traction as well, wildlife photographer Savannah Rose of Jackson told Cowboy State Daily, adding that she and a friend came up with that suggestion.  It fits the cub’s personality, she said.  “It’s a very rascally little beastie. Loves to play with mom,” she said.  As much as she favors “Rowdy,” Rose said that “Spice” has been another popular suggestion.  That would be a homage to “Pepper,” a deceased cub of another famous Grizzly, Felicia, Rose said.  What About ‘Tuxedo’?  Another avid 399 follower, photographer and videographer Jack Bayles also noted on his Facebook page that the new cub seems extremely energetic and playful.  Some people commenting on his posts had their own name suggestions.  “I think we should name that cub Tuxedo because of the fancy white collar,” Stephen Velasco commented, in reference to a distinctive white marking on the cub’s chest and throat.  However, others noted that the marking could fade, and possibly disappear, as the cub ages.  “Pearl” has come up on several social media postings as another popular choice, others noted.  Do We Go With Dignified, or Cute?  Name suggestions seemed to be falling into two basic categories, Rose said.  “I think there are two schools of thought for the naming,” she said. “Some people like dignified or serious names, and others like the cuter ones.”  It’s not known whether the cub will get an official number, like its mother, Vangoidtsenhoven said.  The numbered IDs are assigned by researchers from the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team (IGBST), which monitors bruins across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Messages left for the IGBST weren’t returned on Friday.  Could Be The Last Offspring  Rose noted that the cub is not only energetic, but also seems exceptionally large, and 399 continues to look healthy and robust.  That’s impressive, because 399 is on the elderly end of the grizzly age scale – and is likely the oldest-ever grizzly momma.  The cub could be her last. It takes two years for young grizzlies to reached independence. By then, 399 will be 29, the age at which female grizzlies typically lose the ability to reproduce, Vangoidtsenhoven noted.  During her long and closely-observed life, 399 has frequently given birth to litters of multiple cubs. Her last brood, born in 2020, were quadruplets.

The 16-year-old spent Christmas in the ICU.  On Saturday, the Fayetteville-Manlius High School student got what his mom calls his “miracle.” He’s going to his junior prom.  Wyatt ended up at a children’s hospital in Boston after he was diagnosed with cancer in his liver and pancreas. Not long after he got there he had a stroke. He was unable to move his right side and lost a lot of his language skills, according to his mom Kadi Luchsinger.  “I was basically bedridden,” Wyatt told Syracuse.com | The Post-Standard on Friday.  After 100 days he was finally allowed to leave the hospital for a meal out.  But Wyatt had another concern. Would he be able to go to his prom?  His doctors said they could make that work, his mom said.  After getting the good news, Wyatt immediately started planning for the prom.  “He was coordinating all of this with his friends,” Kadi said. “As soon as he got the green light that he could go then all of them [said] ‘Okay, we’re gonna go too.’”  In Boston, he picked out a suit. “It’s a dark greyish suit with a white undershirt and then a darker green tie,” he said.  His friends plan to wear green, Wyatt’s favorite color.  He and his friends have it all planned out. A limo will pick them up from a friend’s house and take them to dinner, then prom. Afterward, they will head back to the friend’s house to spend the night, Wyatt said.  “It’s a miracle he gets to attend prom,” said Kadi, who said she’s been emotional about her son being able to go.  His limo ride will be the second luxurious ride of the week.  On Thursday Wyatt got a homecoming welcome fit for a prom king.  His high school resource officer Brian Damon had offered him to set up an escort to welcome him home. Wyatt thought it would be maybe two motorcycles.  On Thursday, about 30 fire engines, police cars and ambulances escorted Wyatt and his family as they arrived home. People lined the streets to cheer him.  “I actually cried a little bit,” Wyatt said. “Just seeing how many people showed up.”  His mom was moved by the turnout.  “We were blown away by the number of people that were lining the streets from Chittenango all the way to our house,” Kadi said.  On Sunday, the morning after prom, Wyatt heads back to Boston.  On Monday he has surgery and Wednesday he starts his eighth round of chemotherapy, Kadi said. His mom hopes he will be home this summer.  Wyatt Luchsinger poses with Brian Damon, a resource officer at Fayetteville-Manlius High School, after the teen came home on Thursday, May 18, 2023.

To celebrate, the Literary Hub staff will be recommending a single short story, free to read online, every (work) day of the month. Why not read along with us? Today, we recommend:  “Miracle Polish” by Steven Millhauser  The problem with Steven Millhauser is that all of his stories are good, so it’s difficult to choose which one to highlight here. (If you’ve been following along from the beginning, you may notice that I’ve found this to be the problem with a number of writers.) But as your resident Millhauser fan, I think “Miracle Polish” is among his best, showcasing both the elevated, candy-coated tone and deep psychological resonance that he does so well. (By the way, if you like this story, NB that Millhauser has a new collection coming out this summer. We are blessed indeed.)  The story begins:  I should have said no to the stranger at the door, with his skinny throat and his black sample case that pulled him a little to the side, so that one of his jacket cuffs was higher than the other, a polite no would have done the trick, no thanks, I’m afraid not, not today, then the closing of the door and the heavy click of the latch, but I’d seen the lines of dirt in the black shoe creases, the worn-down heels, the shine on the jacket sleeves, the glint of desperation in his eyes. All the more reason, I said to myself, to send him on his way, as I stepped aside and watched him move into my living room.

"miracle","2023-06-04","Not Discerned","{""Boyertown"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T00:14:23","Miracle Tent Revival on the Mountain kicks off on June 4 at Laurel Mountain Ministries Chapel, a Boyertown-based non-denominal ministry, featuring music, worship, prayer, water baptism and inspirational speakers through June 24.  The significance of the name Miracle Tent Revival comes from to the Bible, “Signs, miracles and wonders follow those who believe,” explained Chaplain Mark Malizzi of Thunder Outreach Ministries.  “We saw stuff last year that was so beautiful; lives were powerfully and positively touched,” said Malizzi about last year’s inaugural event. “Coming out of COVID, people just needed faith, hope and love. This kind of event was exactly the cure for our spirit.”  “It really is a life-changing experience,” he added.  This year, the Miracle Tent Revival returns bigger. Instead of one week, there will be three weeks of daily events and nightly worship services hosted by three ministries: Revelation 19 Ministries, East Coast Healing Center and Thunder Outreach Ministries June 4 to 24.  “We’re honoring God without the four walls of a building. We don’t care if your pastor wears a red jacket or a green jacket,” said Malizzi. “We’ve created opportunities for worship bands and for different ministries to come together under the big tent.”  He sees this as feeding a community.  “You have all different flavors that can come together but we’re still feeding the spiritual to the people of the community and that’s what’s really neat about this,” said Malizzi. “This is one of those events that really brings pure joy. So many people left the mountain so much happier than when they came. It’s like jumping into a cool pool on a hot day; it’s just refreshing.”  Attendees can listen to music and hear messages of hope. And all are welcome no matter their age, culture or religious denomination.  “This is one moment in time where we’re all here together as one nation under God, one community,” Malizzi said. “So much diversity.”  History  “There’s a lot of history through this part of the country of big tent revivals literally changing church programs,” said Malizzi. “They became very Holy Spirit filled and there was a lot of things that happened that actually converted a lot of the more traditional programs into a lot of the newer church programs that you see in the region … All of that happened from big tent revivals.”  According to a May 2023 Berks-Mont Connections article, “The History of American Tent Revival,” by Walter Ostromecki of Laurel Mountain Ministries in Boyertown, tent revivals, known as tent meetings, are a gathering of Christian worshipers in a tent set up for revival meetings, evangelism and healing crusades. These tent gatherings are believed to have originated from a Scots-Irish tradition of community-based Holy Fairs meant to prepare people for communion. Immigrants brought the tradition to America and reached their peak of popularity between 1890 and 1950.  Ostromecki explained in his article that major revivals took place throughout American history.  The First Great Awakening during the mid-1700s resulted in the birth of American Evangelical Christianity.  The Second Great Awakening in the 1800s led to numerous social reforms such as prison reform, temperance, Sabbath observances and women’s rights as well as fueled the growth of several new religious movements.  The Third Great Awakening, called the Jesus Movement, merged the generation’s counterculture with Evangelicalism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movement brought the formation of Contemporary Christian Music, praise and worship music during services, an increasing prioritization of youth ministry, and trends such as informal dress at church.  Schedule of Events  Pastor Saul Hicks from Glory to Glory Family Church in Kutztown will be the speaker for the opening worship event held June 4 at 7 p.m. at 27 Chapel Lane, Boyertown, free and open to the public. Music and worship will be provided by Glory to Glory Family Church, which was co-founded in 2012 by husband and wife pastors Saul and Patience Hicks.  The Miracle Tent Revival on the Mountain continues from June 5 to June 8 with free evening services at 7 p.m. This week will be hosted by a Boyertown ministry, the East Coast Healing Center, a mobile ministry dedicated to preaching the Gospel with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power. The center’s co-founders Rich and Michele Snyder will speak on June 5 to 8. Prophet T. Jason Price will speak on June 9. Evangelist Rowdy Stanley will speak on June 10.  Special events include nightly baptisms in the Cross-shaped pool, free Divine Healing Training on June 4 to 6 from 1 to 3 p.m. and a Men’s and Women’s Retreat on June 10 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., for $30 per person or $50 per couple. For more information, call 610-781-6332 or email eastcoasthealingcenter.pa@gmail.com.  The following week, June 11 to 17, Revelation 19 Ministries hosts seven nights of Revival worship, testimonies, spiritual warfare, deliverance, Holy Spirit healing, water baptism and prayer at 7 p.m. featuring Rev. Tracey Weiss of Revelation 19 Ministries. Ignite Training will be held Wednesday to Friday from 1 to 3 p.m. Sign up at Rev19.org.  The worship lineup includes A’Hava Worship Sunday and Saturday, Jamie Fitt from Philadelphia Tabernacle of David on Monday, poetic worship by songwriter Angela Logan on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Dave and Wendy Sorrels on Thursday and Friday.

Pastor Barry Perez and his wife, Jan, travel the world spreading spiritual refreshment, revival, renewal, and restoration to the church. Their mission is to equip and empower God’s people to cultivate and operate in the supernatural.  Thunder Outreach Ministries of Boyertown is a faith-based Christian community outreach event and organizer team that started out as an 11-person Bible study group.  This week of Tent Revival services features a line-up of musical worship along with life-changing messages from Pastor Perez and Jennifer Martin of Contagious Love International. Water baptisms will also take place in the Cross-shaped pool. The worship lineup includes Pat Amoroso of Spring City Fellowship Church on Sunday and Monday, Heaven’s Thunder Band on Tuesday and Wednesday, Praise and Worship with Heart of God Family Worship Center on Thursday, and Heaven’s Thunder Band on Friday and Saturday.

Last year her buddy, former NewsChannel 9 reporter Eric Benninghoff, left for Europe to do research on a specific group of people with special needs.  But Caedon played on and almost every Saturday she asked about or talked about her buddy, Eric, who was on TV.  Eric has been in Norway working on what he says is a research story telling project.  ""I wanted to bring some of my experience at Channel 9, some of my journalism experience to my work here,"" says Eric.  He’s making films and documentaries about the transition from school to work for people with intellectual disabilities, autism, learning challenges, and other differences.  For Eric, this project in Norway is personal.  His older brother, Brian has autism, an intellectual disability, and is pretty profoundly impacted by those conditions.  “Seeing both the challenges he confronted as a kid for no fault of his own, but also his amazing abilities and talents, you know, just made me realize how important it is for this group of people to have meaningful activities and have access to community life, just like the rest of us,"" says Eric.

Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg.  U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael Parker of Mississippi's Southern District presented the new Americans with their certificates of citizenship.  ""This is my special day,"" said Daniel Dai Huynh, who emigrated from Vietnam.  The engineering student who lives in Brandon is working on a degree at Mississippi State University.  Citizenship will open up a world of opportunities, Huynh said.  Fight for water:Federal attorneys agree to pause litigation for water violations in Jackson  Parker praised Louiza Olivia Liu for her early show of patriotism. Liu is serving in the Navy and is stationed in Gulfport.  Liu, who lived in Los Angeles before coming to Mississippi, has been in the United States for 10 years. She initially came to the U.S. from China to go to college. After finishing up her education, she decided to join the military to serve her new country as she worked toward citizenship.  Parker recognized Liu for her service.  ""It is incredible to me that we have people who are in harm's way who are not yet citizens who do all the things and more than some of the rest of us do to support our country in such an important way,"" he said.  'Mississippi miracle':Students' reading scores have soared in Deep South states  The new citizens were presented with small gifts and U.S. flags by local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Femi Oloko of Jackson, who emigrated from Nigeria, took the oath of allegiance while his wife Pam Oloko and children 4-year-old Tyler and 3-year-old Paityn watched from the audience. He raised his flag and waved it as he returned to his seat.  ""I'm so happy to become a citizen today and enjoy all the benefits that come with it,"" said Femi Oloko of Jackson, who emigrated from Nigeria. ""This is a lovely country. The people are so good and sweet. I want to be part of it.""  Each of the new citizens had to complete a rigorous program to learn about their new country before they were eligible for citizenship.  Now that they are citizens, they can register to vote and seek political office, with the exception of president, a job that can only be filled by a native-born American. They also can seek jobs with the federal government.  This is especially important to Hannah Hien Nguyen of Petal, who came to the United States from Vietnam. She is working on a degree in accounting at the University of Southern Mississippi.  ""My goal is actually working for the IRS,"" she said. ""This is very important to me. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.""  As new citizens, Parker encouraged the group to get involved in their communities and participate in the workings of government.  He quoted former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Larry Brandeis, telling the group of new citizens, ""The most important political office is that of the private citizen.""

He may have been robbed of the opportunity to grow up, get married and have children…. But perhaps a life that he saves, will do just that. Get married and have children…. And a piece of him will live on in them.  “My hope is that a miracle can be found in such tragedy. Sunday may have been the worst day of my entire life… but my wish is that someone else can receive the best news in the world, they can be given a chance at life. Because my sweet angel saved them. And I know he is proud.  “To my Dylan, I am beyond proud of the young man that you have become. I will love you forever and always and I hope that your resting in the sweetest peace.”  The community has created a Facebook group called “Fundraiser for the Levesque family” in addition to a GoFundMe fundraiser to help the family with expenses.

But he's not ready to give up on life and is fighting to stay alive for his young son.  A Katikati father with terminal cancer has now raised half of the $100,000 needed to fund a “miracle” drug that could prolong his life after an outpouring of community support for his cause.  Roy Nugter has a rare cancer and is so desperate to stay alive for his 10-year-old son that he had resorted to distributing leaflets asking for help to afford to raise money to buy the drug Keytruda – a treatment that could help his immune system fight the cancers.  Nugter, who has stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, shared his story with the Bay of Plenty Times Weekend last week. Because the type of cancer is so rare, it does not meet the threshold for Pharmac funding for Keytruda, he says.  Pharmac funds Keytruda for some cancers, within certain patient eligibility criteria. In March, it announced it would fund Keytruda for some skin and lung cancers.  Nugter has now raised more than $54,000 on his Givealittle page, with a wave of donations flooding in following Saturday’s story.  “I’m halfway there. I’m blown away. I just didn’t expect it,” he said.  Nugter said he received an email every time there was a donation. By Wednesday afternoon he had received 139 emails. More than $17,000 flowed in within two days from people wanting to help.  “I’m replying to every one of them to say ‘thank you’.”  “It’s just a small thank you but it [each donation] means so very much to us.”  The doctors who diagnosed his rare cancer in 2018 estimated he likely had one to three years left. He’s lasted four-and-a-half.  The cancer has since spread, resulting in two brain tumours and others in his body. One sits perilously close to his spinal cord - affecting his use of his right hand and arm - and the other near his trachea. The chemotherapy he was on is no longer effective.  Nugter used to work as an industrial cleaner, earning more than $1000 a week in the hand. Now the family survives on $350 a week from a sickness benefit and superannuation.  His wife Debbie gave up her job when her parents were involved in a horrific crash near Athenree on January 2. Her father David Hard was killed and her mother Glenda was critically injured. Debbie was now the main driver and support for both Roy and her mother, plus Kobie.  Roy Nugter is fighting to stay alive for his son Kobie, 10. Photo / Alex Cairns  The couple considered selling their Katikati home to fund the drug but Roy was concerned his family would end up homeless.  Roy said before last week’s story, he had begun to worry that they would not be able to reach their goal.  “But now, I honestly think I can get there. It’s not going to be easy, and I still need to do things.”  He was already cutting up a fresh batch of leaflets in preparation for distributing them onto cars again.  Roy and Debbie Nugter previously said they were past the point of pride. The need to stay alive long enough to be a father to Kobie, especially since his Poppa was no longer around, was their number one goal.  “The doctors have said don’t start until you can afford a full course. But if can get to $70,000, then I will start it. That will give me seven months to find the rest,” Roy said.  If that meant more leaflet drops and other fundraising initiatives, then so be it, he said.  A full course of Keytruda involves 10 rounds. It is a type of immunotherapy and works by helping immune systems fight certain cancers.  Keytruda is considered a “miracle” drug because of its effectiveness.  Nugter was not sure he would ever be able to thank those who donated enough but he wanted to try, he said.  “It’s just incredible. People are incredible.”  Last week, in response to Nugter’s case, Pharmac director of operations Lisa Williams said it used a unique funding model, working within a fixed budget, which was different from the rest of the world – it meant they had to make difficult decisions [about] which treatments they could fund.  Williams said there was a “separate funding assessment pathway” that allowed consideration of applications from doctors for the funding of treatments “for people whose clinical circumstances are unique or unusual”.  “We empathise with all New Zealanders who are unwell and their whānau who support them. Hearing how medicines impact the lives of New Zealanders is really important in helping us understand what treatments we should be funding.”                ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9iYXktb2YtcGxlbnR5LXRpbWVzL25ld3Mva2F0aWthdGktbWFuLXJveS1udWd0ZXItb3ZlcndoZWxtZWQtYXQta2V5dHJ1ZGEtZG9uYXRpb25zLWFzLXRob3VzYW5kcy1pbi1jYXNoLWZsb29kLWluL1lKR0dGUlAzTEZGRlZNRVpXMkk3NVI3QlQ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""WashingtonPark"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:19:13","The project, from the nonprofit developer Archway Communities, is part of the Urban Land Institute’s Mosaic Community Campus.  The Urban Land Conservancy‘s massive transformation of the former Johnson and Wales campus into the Mosaic Community Campus in South Park Hill hit a big milestone on Thursday.  Nonprofit leaders, financiers, and city and state brass participated in a groundbreaking to celebrate turning four dormitories into 154 units of income-restricted housing. The dorms will be remodeled as a mix of studios for individuals up to three bedrooms for small families.  Most units will be for people making between 30% and 60% of the area median income (currently $24,650 to $49,260 for an individual or $31,650 to $63,300 for a family of three), and 10% of them will be reserved for people making below 30% of the median income (currently under $24,650 for an individual or $63,300 for a family of three).  The units should begin to be available in 2024.  The campus, as a whole, includes community kitchens from Kitchen Network, the St. Elizabeth’s School, the Denver School of the Arts, and affordable housing built directly by the Denver Housing Authority.  The nonprofit developer Archway Communities, which purchased the dormitories from the Urban Land Conservancy, is heading up this part of the development.  Archway’s project’s total budget is $66.5 million — $3.85 million of which came from the city’s Affordable Housing Fund and much of which came through tax credits from the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority.  These projects are massive collaborations with multiple for-profit, nonprofit and government entities that can take years to assemble.  “This is not easy work, and we all know this,” said Sebastian Corradino, the head of Archway Communities.  This particular development included using historic preservation funds — and rules — making it all the more complicated. But also, possibly, palatable to the South Park Hill neighborhood and other surrounding communities, which Councilmember Chris Herndon said have offered few criticisms — a rarity when it comes to new development.  “It’s so thrilling to see what Archway is going to do to bring affordability to South Park Hill, taking these historic buildings and making them part of the community,” Herndon said.  Efforts to build new income-restricted housing and increase density are often pitted against historic preservation. In this case, both forces worked together.  “We know that everybody deserves a safe and affordable roof over their head,” said Laura Brudzynski, the city’s Chief Housing Officer and head of the Department of Housing Stability. “This project adds character and beauty to this area, in addition to providing that pathway to stability. So we’re excited to not only celebrate this project and the affordable units that are coming, but also the historic renovation underway that this project really helps to celebrate. This groundbreaking and support today for our near opening underscores how Historic Preservation can also provide much-needed affordable housing within our community.”  The nonprofit’s board member Lee Berg, a pastor at the United Church of Christ in Washington Park, said “This is a miracle in my world, to have this many organizations come together, lean into it and make it happen.”  The impact a project like this has on individuals with housing they can afford is huge. Yet the dent projects like these put in the overall need is small.  After the groundbreaking, David Nisivoccia, head of the Denver Housing Authority, told Denverite that roughly 60,000 income-restricted units are currently needed and the demand has risen over the past year.  Including the remodeling of the dorms, Denver’s Department of Housing Stability is currently funding 1,870 units under construction at 31 separate sites across the city. Another 599 are in the works.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2RlbnZlcml0ZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9vbGQtam9obnNvbi1hbmQtd2FsZXMtY2FtcHVzLWRvcm1zLWluLXNvdXRoLXBhcmstaGlsbC1hcmUtYmVpbmctdHVybmVkLWludG8taW5jb21lLXJlc3RyaWN0ZWQtaG91c2luZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

To do so with the original cast still largely in situ is something of a miracle. When it comes to staying power, there aren’t so many series that can match that of the Fast and Furious.  It’s funny to think now, looking back now to 2001, that Rob Cohen’s original The Fast and the Furious concerned little more than stolen DVDs and a road race. How quaint it must seem. Two decades have transformed the series’ once grungy verve into a shimmering, multi-billion dollar juggernaut, making A-listers of its stars along the way. The action has ramped way past 11 and budgets swollen farther still.  This week, Fast X, the tenth in the series, hits cinemas as one of the most expensive films ever made. Bolstered by a production budget of well over $300m, the film promises vehicular action like fans have never seen before, set against a global backdrop more expansive than most blockbusters can even dream of.  While each new F&F film has tried to best its direct predecessor, the sense that all the stops are being pulled out for Fast X is palpable. The beginning of the end is here and the familia Toretto are going out with a bang. Part two will follow in 2025.  Also this week comes Kelly Fremon Craig’s Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. This being the hotly anticipated adaptation of Judy Blume’s seminal seventies novel of the same name.  Known for its fiendishly frank relatability, Blume’s book has been celebrated and reviled in equal measure across the fifty years since its publication. It is a tale of teenage anxiety, of bra sizes, hormones and menstruation. It was banned in Harrogate.  Abby Ryder Fortson - Ant-Man’s young Cassie Lang - is a delight as 11-year old Margaret Simon, daughter of Rachel McAdams’ Barbara and granddaughter to Kathy Bates’ Sylvia. It is through Margaret’s wide eyes that the reality of puberty is plated out and through her tightening frame that we feel the cringe. As it turns out, adolescence is no picnic If you can pummel through the exhaust fumes clogging up cinemas this week, a visit to Margaret’s world will reward you with tears of laughter and an ear to ear beam.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbG0tcmV2aWV3LXRvYnktc3ltb25kcy1mYXN0LTA3MTkwMDgxOC5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly91ay5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9maWxtLXJldmlldy10b2J5LXN5bW9uZHMtZmFzdC0wNzE5MDA4MTguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Organizers of a recall petition against Elton Mayor Kesia Skinner Lemoine filed paperwork Tuesday with the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, news outlets reported.  Brandon Kelley, who faced Lemoine in a Dec. 10 mayoral runoff election, told the American Press that the group is seeking to remove Lemoine from office after questions surfaced about the Nov. 8, 2022, mayoral election. An investigation by KPLC-TV found voters who were claiming homestead exemptions in other parishes, some who were registered to vote using vacant lots, and others using addresses of homes that didn’t exist. The investigation found nearly three dozen people with questionable voting credentials.  ""If they found that there were enough fraudulent votes to change the outcome of the election, of course, the people of Elton’s voices were not heard,"" Kelley said.  Lemoine defeated Kelley 211-178 in last year’s runoff following the November primary election in which she had 142 votes and Kelley had 141. Brandilyn Soileau, another candidate in the mayor's race and chairman of the recall committee, garnered 80 votes while Jared ""FireCracker"" Trahan had 74.  A ‘MISSISSIPPI MIRACLE’ AS STUDENT READING SCORES RAPIDLY CLIMB IN THE DEEP SOUTH  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  To trigger a recall election, the committee needs to collect 40%, or 276 of the 689 registered voters who live within the town limits, according to the Jeff Davis Parish Registrar of Voters office.  ""All we have to go on right now is word of mouth, but a lot of people are fairly upset in finding out that there were some election fraud going on,"" Kelley said. ""Transparency should be a big part of city government. We need to make sure that everything is transparent and that if anything wrong has been found, to right the wrong. This isn’t a witch hunt out for anybody. It is just to make sure that the people of Elton’s voices were accurately heard.""  Lemoine declined to comment on the recall effort.  Because the town electorate is under 1,000, the recall must be completed no later than 90 days following a confirmation letter from the Secretary of State's office. The state requires all the signatures to be handwritten and include the voter’s physical address. The Registrar of Voters Office must certify the signatures before the petition is forwarded to the governor. If the required number of signatures is met, the governor has 15 days to call a recall election.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3BldGl0aW9uLWZpbGVkLXJlbW92YWwtc291dGh3ZXN0LWxvdWlzaWFuYS10b3ducy1tYXlvci1hbWlkLWNvbmNlcm5zLXZvdGVyLWZyYXVk0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vdXMvcGV0aXRpb24tZmlsZWQtcmVtb3ZhbC1zb3V0aHdlc3QtbG91aXNpYW5hLXRvd25zLW1heW9yLWFtaWQtY29uY2VybnMtdm90ZXItZnJhdWQuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:59:47","Before they were widely tipped as one of London’s most exciting new post-punk bands, Bar Italia spent years patiently grafting. The trio, consisting of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, put out multiple releases via Dean Blunt’s avant-garde World Music label, including their debut LP ‘Quarrel’ and follow-up EP ‘Angelica Pilled’ in 2020. Second album ‘Bedhead’ swiftly followed in early 2021, before they then shared three standalone singles (‘Banks’, ‘Miracle Crush’ and ‘Polly Armour’) in 2022.  This prolific streak steadily raised the current fanfare that surrounds their percussive yet pensive post-punk, eventually leading to a string of sold-out gigs, worldwide tours and a deal with Matador Records (home to the likes of Pavement, Julien Baker and Snail Mail). It’s an impressive feat, especially when you consider the layers of mystique Bar Italia have intentionally conjured during their rise: from issuing dim and grainy publicity photos to their Microsoft Paint-aided show flyers, they’ve also actively avoided giving any interviews during their emergence.  Despite this reticence, the London trio now seem to have their sights set on making their reintroduction with ‘Tracey Denim’. Recorded and produced by the band themselves with mixing from Marta Salogni (Björk, Black Midi, M.I.A.), their third album should be enough to shift to one side those hasty (albeit somewhat justified) comparisons to The Cure and Joy Division, ensuring that Bar Italia make a lasting impression that’s all of their own making.  Advertisement  ‘Nurse!’, the album’s hypnotic lead single, is a swaggering and devastatingly cool track that quickens and slows without warning, aided by jangly guitars and the buzzing yet delightful distortion that brings it to a close. Fenton may be singing “haven’t felt this way since you were 21” in the direction of a love interest, but the lyric also applies to the feeling you get when hearing something that’s quite as invigorating as this.  On ‘Punkt’, Bar Italia take their listeners on an imaginative jaunt soundtracked by erratic guitars; its spoken word lyrics culminating with Cristante’s infectious repetitive proclamation “I don’t owe you an explanation / I just want to lose control”. The rapid ‘Friends’ particularly highlights the band’s production prowess by fusing together elements of warped and pulsating punk with a melodic pop delivery, while ‘Maddington’ closes the album with lush layering and gentle singing that lures the listener in while creating a wall of sound all around. It works as a perfect bookend for the collection, shining a bright light on the trio’s experimental edge.  The 15 impressively arranged tracks on ‘Tracey Denim’ will only bolster Bar Italia’s discography to date, ushering them, whether they like it or not, even further into the spotlight.

The project, which was undertaken to coincide with Child Month, saw significant renovation works which include the painting of classrooms, the installation of new ceiling fans, the replacement of outdated electrical sockets, the installation of energy-saving light bulbs, the gift of a new refrigerator and a new freezer, and the provision of school supplies, including white boards.  At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, which officially signalled the completion of the project, Sherrie-Ann Wilson-Brown, one of the three VDTI students who formed the project’s management team, expressed profound gratitude to the many sponsors who heeded their call and contributed generously to the successful renovation of the school.  “Thanks to the collective efforts, support, and contributions, we exceeded our initial goal. The staff and students now have a much better learning environment, and I am sure they will all benefit from it,” said Wilson-Brown.

The staff and students will now be able to function much better as things like the new refrigerator and deep freezer will enhance the capacity to store frozen meals, ice cream, and other perishable items, ensuring a wider range of food options for the student,” said Belcher.  Racquel Williams Davis, the school’s principal, expressed much joy and appreciation at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, praising the amazing transformative renovations, which have given them an environment much more conducive to learning, especially as it relates to the improved lighting, colourful classrooms, and much-needed school supplies.  “We are no longer dealing with the lack of proper lighting and the safety concerns posed by uncovered sockets. The renovated classrooms now provide a safer and more conducive environment for both teaching and learning,” said Williams Davis.  Pastor Lincoln Brown, chairman of the board of the church-owned school, praised the project management team for their outstanding work, noting that the renovations, which were completed in just over two months, would have taken the church approximately three years to fund on its own.

Established and endowed by writer and award-winning journalist Edna Staebler in 1991, the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction recognizes a Canadian writer of a first or second published book with a Canadian locale or significance. The award is administered by Laurier, the only university in Canada to bestow a nationally recognized literary award.  The following authors have been shortlisted for the 2021 Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction for the following books: Rachel Matlow for Dead Mom Walking: A Memoir of Miracle Cures and Other Disasters; Vicki Laveau-Harvie for The Erratics; and Jessica J. Lee for Two Trees Make a Forest: In Search of My Family's Past Among Taiwan's Mountains and Coasts. The winner will be announced in late May.  “Creative non-fiction was very personal to Edna,” said Harry Froklage, an award juror and friend who helped edit Edna Staebler’s letters. “During her lifetime, she and the winners of her award often became great friends. As I read this year’s shortlisted books, I thought of her often and wondered what her assessment might be. Of the 2021 shortlist, I think she would be very pleased and gratified at the range of topics and generational voices, young and old.”  The Erratics: A Memoir  By Vicki Laveau-Harvie (Doubleday Canada)  The Erratics is a clear-eyed account of how and where to draw the line with the people we love and survive the aftermath. In this slim memoir, Laveau-Harvie describes returning from Australia to her childhood home in Alberta to check on her aging parents, who disowned her and her only sister years earlier. She worries that her mother — a long-standing toxic and dangerous presence in her life — is trying to kill her blithely acquiescent father. Despite its troubling subject matter, The Erratics is a darkly humorous and deeply engaging read that leaves an indelible, haunting impression.  Two Trees Make a Forest: In Search of My Family’s Past Among Taiwan’s Mountains and Coasts  By Jessica J. Lee (Penguin Random House Canada)  The discovery of her grandfather’s notes about his years as a pilot in the Chinese Nationalist air force, before he and her grandmother escaped to Taiwan and eventually immigrated to Canada, lured Jessica Lee into exploring both her family’s background and the island of Taiwan, her mother’s birthplace. The result is Two Trees Make a Forest, a fascinating interweaving of family history, geopolitical events linking China and Taiwan, and the author’s own extraordinary immersion in the flora, fauna, and geography of Taiwan itself.  Dead Mom Walking: A Memoir of Miracle Cures and Other Disasters  By Rachel Matlow (Penguin Random House Canada)  Dead Mom Walking is structured as a mystery. Why would a smart, life-embracing woman defy the advice of doctors and the pleas of her daughter by refusing medical treatment for a deadly form of cancer? Why would she breezily pursue an eccentric range of homeopathic and holistic remedies until far too late? While she struggles to provide love and support in a bewildering situation, Matlow seeks to solve this mystery, pursuing a deeper understanding of the woman who is her mother, their family, and herself. Their journey is dramatized in a narrative that is powerfully emotional, intimate and leavened with unexpected flashes of humour.  “This year’s shortlisted authors are all memoirs about family, but they demonstrate a remarkable range of style, focus and approach,” said Bruce Gillespie, an award juror and professor in Laurier’s User Experience Design program. “What they share is a commitment to unravelling the complex and often complicated nature of our closest relationships in a way that will keep readers glued to the page.”  The winner of the 2021 Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction will be announced during the week of May 22-26.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHUuY2EvbmV3cy9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzIwMjMvbWF5L2xhdXJpZXItYW5ub3VuY2VzLTIwMjEtc2hvcnRsaXN0LWZvci1lZG5hLXN0YWVibGVyLWF3YXJkLWZvci1jcmVhdGl2ZS1ub24tZmljdGlvbi1mb2xsb3dpbmctcGFuZGVtaWMtcG9zdHBvbmVtZW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Owning a home is also foundational to the American dream,” Gov. Gianforte said in remarks to attendees. “A lot of ink has been spilled about how the American dream is dying. I reject that entirely. The American dream is alive and well, and we’ll keep working to ensure more Montanans can realize it.”  Gov. Gianforte continued, “When it comes down to it, the health and wellbeing of our families, our communities, our businesses, and our economy rely on access to affordable, attainable housing. Hardworking Montanans, like teachers, firefighters, and police officers, should be able to live in the communities where they work. They should be part of the fabric of the community where they work. That’s a central tenet of the American dream.”  The governor described how he launched the diverse, bipartisan Housing Task Force in July 2022. He detailed how the task force explored the underlying issues of the state’s housing shortage and provided solutions to increase the supply of housing to make it more affordable and attainable. The recommendations provided a roadmap for lawmakers ahead of the 2023 legislative session.  Gov. Gianforte shared what his administration has accomplished in the last year, including overhauling housing mandates and zoning regulations, encouraging the development of denser housing, streamlining subdivision reviews, and investing in building a more skilled workforce.  “Now is the time for bold, transformational pro-housing reform. Addressing the crisis of a housing supply shortage is a priority for Montanans,” Gov. Gianforte said. “Coming together, we’ve delivered the most meaningful pro-housing reforms in state history.”  “Working together, we’ve taken a series of steps to increase the supply of housing and make it more affordable and accessible. There is no question there is more we must do,” the governor cautioned. “We must build upon what some have called the ‘Montana Miracle.’”  “And I firmly believe other states can do the same – bring people together, build consensus, and be transformational to make housing more affordable and attainable. Because ultimately, we must remain focused on expanding opportunities so more folks achieve the American dream, including homeownership,” the governor concluded.  Gov. Gianforte discussing pro-housing reforms at the Western Prosperity Roundtable  After the governor’s remarks, he led a roundtable discussion on state strategies for housing development. Two members of the governor’s Housing Task Force were part of the panel: Chris Dorrington, director of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and task force chair, and Emily Hamilton, senior research fellow and director of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center.  “It is great to join the governor and other key leaders from across the West to share thoughtful approaches to the housing crisis, many of those we put to action through the governor’s Housing Task Force,” Dir. Dorrington said.  “The governor’s leadership in creating the Housing Task Force was essential for Montana to address this crisis. Under the direction of Director Dorrington, we brought together many voices on a wide variety housing perspectives and acted with urgency to help the state; most of which came through in legislation this session,” Hamilton said.  Panelists also included Dave Andersen, Managing Director of Growth Management Planning at the Washington State Department of Commerce; Christina Oliver, Housing and Community Development Division Director with the Utah Department of Workforce Services; and Andy Hill, Director of the Community Development Office with the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL25ld3MubXQuZ292L0dvdmVybm9ycy1PZmZpY2UvR292ZXJub3JfR2lhbmZvcnRlX1Byb21vdGVzX1N1Y2Nlc3NmdWxfSG91c2luZ19BZ2VuZGFfYXRfV2VzdGVybl9Hb3Zlcm5vcnNfQXNzb2NpYXRpb25fRm9ydW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Since its inception, Tops is proud to say that $519,846 has been raised for area charities and at a time that these organizations need it most.  These bags support local chapters of organizations near and dear to our community: United Way, JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), Feeding America (including area food banks and pantries), and Children’s Miracle Network (including Children’s Hospitals). Tops even recently introduced a new “Tops in Education” bag that links directly to its “Tops in Education” program, which provides much-needed funds back to area school programs and services. The “Tops in Education” program alone has raised over $1.2 million for area schools.  In addition to its philanthropic mission, the program helps Tops stay true to its environmental commitment of reducing its carbon footprint.

At the regular county board meeting, the removal of Dixon from the MESD Board was placed on the agenda by Prenzler. During the meeting he cited the ongoing issue of that board giving its members insurance.  According to state law, MESD commissioners receive the same salaries as county board members from either St. Clair or Madison County, whichever is lower. MESD commissioners’ salaries are $14,500, the same as Madison County Board members. However, they also have paid health insurance, something the county board gave up years ago.  Prenzler also cited a bill currently in the Illinois General Assembly, HR476, sponsored by State Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Swansea, which would allow MESD to provide health insurance.  Prenzler said it was one of a number of actions taken by the General Assembly in recent years, all sponsored by Hoffman, to shift power away from Madison County. That includes removing one of Madison County’s appointments to the MESD, as well as removing one of the county’s appointments to the Bi-State Development Agency Board.  Prenzler had first recommended Dixon in February 2017, but her appointment was postponed for various reasons until June 2018.  There had been a number of issues brought up about Dixon, including whether she was a Democrat, concerns by residents in Madison/Venice wanting representation on the MESD board, a concern over conflict of interest because her husband is on Granite City’s wastewater treatment board, and other issues.  The subject of insurance had also come up. At the time of Dixon’s original appointment, Prenzler noted that the MESD board was independent of the Madison County Board, and set its own policy.  Most recently, Prenzler attempted to have former MESD employee Randy Presswood, who had also been active local politics, appointed to the MESD Board. That, as well as a previous attempt to simply remove Dixon, had failed.  After considerable discussion Wednesday, the county board voted to postpone action on the issue until next month.  Also Wednesday, a number of other appointments to various committees and board were approved, including: Stephanie Pennington to the Madison County Board of Review; Jay Rensing and Kurt Johnson to the Madison County Farmland Assessment Review Committee; Frank Dunn to the Glen Carbon Fire District; David Schwind to the Madison County Flood Prevention District; County Board members Jason Palmaro, Robert Pollard, Mick Madison and John Janek to the Madison County Stormwater Committee; and Cynthia Worthen to the Miracle Manor-Bellemore Light District.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9hdHRlbXB0LXJlbW92ZS1tZXNkLW1lbWJlci1kZWxheWVkLW1hZGlzb24tY291bnR5LTE4MTA2ODEzLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Tampa"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:01:36","Claim: Twitter owner Elon Musk created a line of CBD gummies that can ""reverse dementia,"" a move that sparked a lawsuit with Fox News. Rating: About this rating False  In April 2023, a rumor began to spread that claimed Twitter owner Elon Musk had revealed a new line of CBD gummies that could ""reverse dementia."" According to the story, Musk's gummy product sparked a ""huge lawsuit"" with Fox News.  However, none of this was true.  Musk was simply the latest famous person to have his image and likeness used by scammers without permission in an attempt to push miracle promises about CBD or keto gummies. He has nothing to do with any of these products.  While the answer here is a fairly simple ""it's all fake,"" the massive reach of these gummy scams might surprise some readers.  Musk's 'New Business Announcement'  As of May 18, the scam was still making the rounds in at least one paid ad on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. The ad on a Facebook page named Aromathy read, ""Media Backlash Over New Musk Business Announcement. Elon Has a Response. His New Business Venture Has Been Under Scrutiny By Media.""  This post served as clickbait to take users to the scam.  The ad led to a fake article on aromasense.shop that was designed to fool readers into believing they were reading from the Fox News website.  Many of the Facebook users who commented on the ad believed that the post was a real news announcement. For example, one person commented, ""MEDIA IS AGAINST ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD!! IGNORE THEM!"" Some users also appeared to think that Musk made the post himself, with one person writing, ""Don't pay attention to the media! So many are fake and bias! Be true to yourself! I trust you.""  In other words, Fox News and Elon Musk may have been included together by scammers to target easily influenced users who have conservative political leanings and a distrust of mainstream news media.  'Elon Musk Reverses Dementia'  To create the fake Fox News article, scammers copied the logo and article layout from foxnews.com and replicated it on the aromasense.shop website. Scammers have been doing this design-replication process with the logos and designs of multiple publishers for years.  The article began with the headline, ""Elon Musk reverses dementia, solution sparks huge lawsuit pressure on Fox, he finally fights back on air.""  This scam article was never published by Fox News.  The body of the fictional story was a template that scammers had used many times before about various TV personalities who had their own shows. However, in this case, the article didn't really make sense to be used with Musk since he didn't have a show.  The fake article began as follows:  (Fox) - In an Exclusive Interview, Elon Musk, a business magnate and investor, CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, Inc. and Twitter, Inc. reveals that the show will be ending after his latest business sparks tension with Martha MacCallum. During a heated episode last week, Elon Musk made headlines after revealing his new CBD line on Live TV. Martha MacCallum was outraged saying she will be filing a lawsuit against Elon Musk and Fox for violating his contract and 'scaring-off' sponsors. Elon Musk responded with this: ""I know Martha is just coming after my timeslot. I am not giving in to 'Cancel Culture'. When I started this whole thing back in 2018, it really was just a part time passion project and a way for me to give back. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make Impact Garden CBD Gummies available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience life pain-free and live much happier lives."" His product, Impact Garden CBD Gummies, has been flying off the shelves within minutes and Elon Musk says his number one struggle as CEO is being able to keep up with demand. His CBD wellness line is 90% cheaper and five times more effective than those being offered by Bayer and other ""Big Pharma"" companies. Marthan MacCallum was furious after seeing multiple sponsors sue Fox News Network. Martha is now calling for Elon Musk to be indicted, saying: ""I am happy Elon Musk found something to replace prescriptions, but his announcement was a direct breach of contract. Fox News should sue him immediately and he should formally apologize."" ... Elon Musk eventually admitted that although Martha MacCallum is enraged, other Fox hosts has been supportive of him. Tucker Carlson even went on Live TV to say that: ""Impact Garden CBD Gummies has completely changed my life and it's clear that MacCallum is attempting a Coup.""  Again, this article was fictional. The story about Musk, CBD gummies that can ""reverse dementia,"" Fox News, Martha MacCallum, and Tucker Carlson all never happened.  If You Were Scammed  For more information on CBD and keto gummies scams, we recommend a recent story about Ree Drummond, another celebrity whose image and likeness were also used by scammers to push these products.  If any readers were scammed and ordered any gummy products after being led to believe that Musk or other celebrities endorsed them, we recommend filing a report with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  We also advise readers to call their credit card company to dispute the charges. It may be a good idea to block future charges from the sellers in question or to get a new card number altogether, as many of these scams sign customers up to be charged subscription fees of hundreds of dollars per month.  Bear in mind that, while it is rare, scammers sometimes use the exact name or a similar name of a real CBD company without permission to push these sorts of scams. In those minority of cases, there's no evidence that the company had any involvement in the activity.  Stranger Things  We've received word from users in recent months who said that they were being charged for these sorts of gummy products despite having no recollection of ordering them. Some people who left messages for our reporters even said that along with having no memory of ordering the products, they also had no charges on their credit card, yet still received the products at their doorstep.  It's possible that some of these apparently unauthorized purchases occurred in the aftermath of what's known as card skimming. The FBI has said of the practice, ""Skimming occurs when devices illegally installed on ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, or fuel pumps capture data or record cardholders' PINs. Criminals use the data to create fake debit or credit cards and then steal from victims' accounts. It is estimated that skimming costs financial institutions and consumers more than $1 billion each year.""  We are continuing to look into various aspects of these CBD and keto scams, including something associated with purported ""fulfillment center"" P.O. Box addresses in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as some activity apparently occurring in Tampa, Florida.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9lbG9uLW11c2stY2JkLWd1bW1pZXMtcmV2ZXJzZS1kZW1lbnRpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With just one full day of tracking left to go, the Swedish pop deity has jumped up to Number 2, meaning that Tattoo could become Loreen's highest-charting single in the UK yet - she previously peaked at Number 3 in 2012 with Euphoria, the decade-defining smash that previously saw her take the Eurovision trophy that year.  Now the first woman (and only the second person ever, after Ireland's Johnny Logan) to win Eurovision twice, Tattoo is in with a chance of knocking off Calvin Harris & Ellie Goulding's Miracle from Number 1, becoming their only challenger as we move into the final 12 hours of tracking.  It certainly looks like tomorrow will see a veritable Eurovision takeover on the Official Chart - with four entries currently on track to enter the Top 10, lead, of course, by Loreen.  Following her lead is chaotic Finnish upstart Käärijä with the manic and inspired Cha Cha Cha, which could make its Official Chart debut at Number 7.  Not far behind is the UKs very own Mae Muller, still riding the wave of public support and still in with a huge shot of scoring her first-ever UK Top 10 single with I Wrote A Song, which is currently expected to be this week's big gainer, and rise to Number 9.  If you want to throw your support behind Mae and see her go even higher, you have until 12am BST tonight to stream, buy or download I Wrote A Song.  Norway's Alessandra could be our final Eurovision finalist to make the Top 10 tomorrow, with the Lady Gaga-esque Queen of Kings expected to bow at Number 10.  Following his inspired performance at the Grand Final, last year's Eurovision hero Sam Ryder could also make a massive impact with his new single Mountain, looking to become his second career entry in the Official Singles Chart Top 40 (26).

"miracle","2016-04-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 02:22:39","Rabbi Leo Dee, the husband of Lucy and father of Maia and Rina who were killed in a terror attack in the West Bank, met for the first time with an Arab Israeli man who received an organ transplant from Lucy that saved his life.  38-year-old Abu Radia from central Israel received a kidney from Lucy on April 7 after she was critically injured in a terror attack. Lucy died not long after, but the organs transplant saved Raida’s life. He had been given a month to live prior to the life-saving transplant.  Rabbi Dee met Radia on Wednesday, receiving a plaque from him which said, “If you save one life it’s as if you’ve saved the world.”  Rabbi Dee gave Raida a framed blessing for “good health and a good life” in Hebrew and Arabic, according to the UK’s Daily Mirror which spoke to Raida.  “I’d have died without this kidney. I cannot thank Rabbi Dee enough. He’s saved my life,” Raida told the Daily Mirror.  Rabbi Dee said, “This is what Lucy would have wanted. Her kidney is a sign of peace and reconciliation. The fact that you are alive is a miracle for us. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Part of my late wife is inside you and it gives our family great comfort to know she continues to do good.”  “And you being an Arab and a Muslim is especially wonderful, as she did so much for reconciliation. It’s a blessing to see you looking so well in your own house. I’ve sadly lost two daughters and my wife but the fact you’re alive because of them – you continuing to live – is a real miracle,” Rabbi Dee told Raida.  Rabbi Dee had also apparently been “warned” not to to come to see Abu Radia by some people. “They said it was impossible to visit him while there was fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza. I was delighted and relieved that he invited me,” he said, referring to the recent five-day-long conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.  Lucy Dee’s organs helped save four other people who were in dire need of transplants. In a highly emotional meeting at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva last week, Rabbi Dee, and his three surviving children, Keren, Tali and Benjamin, met three of the patients who were saved by Lucy Dee’s organs.  One of the patients was Lital Valenci, 51, who suffered from severe heart failure for five years. She waited eight agonising months for a new heart, with doctors warning she had months to live without a transplant. But Lucy Dee’s heart eventually saved her.  Both Keren and Tali got to listen to Valenci’s heart beat through a stethoscope.  “Listening to my mother’s heartbeat made me feel like I am with her. It was moving meeting Lital and all the recipients, we have lost so much but are comforted that so many families were saved from similar pain,” said Keren.  “Nobody can understand what it is like losing a mother and two sisters at once and to hear my mother’s heartbeat was comforting,” added Tali.

"miracle","1978-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Tulsa"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:02:11","Dear Savvy Senior,  Can you recommend some good toenail clipping solutions for seniors? My toenails have gotten increasingly thick since I’ve gotten older and have become very difficult for me to reach down and cut.  — Almost 80  Dear Almost,  Trimming your toenails is a task that most people don’t think much about, but as we get older it can become very challenging. For many older adults, like yourself, toenails can become thicker and harder to cut, and reduced flexibility can make it more difficult to even get into the right position to cut them. Fortunately, there are solutions available that can make this job a little easier.  One of the simplest tricks for cutting thick toenails is to simply take a bath or shower, or soak your feet in warm water, prior to cutting them. The water helps soften them for easier cutting. There are also toenail softening creams you can buy, like “Miracle of Aloe Toenail Soft” and “Barielle Toenail Softening Cream,” that temporarily softens thick, hard nails. Just  rub it into your toenails at bedtime and in the morning, they’ll be easier to cut and file.  Most people’s toenails grow about 1/16 inch per month, so it’s appropriate to cut them every six to eight weeks.  When cutting nails, take care not to cut too far down. Overaggressive trimming and cutting the toenails too short can lead to ingrown toenails. Podiatrists typically recommend leaving a very small bit (about 1/32 inch) of nail past the nail bed when trimming.  You may also want to avoid a rounded cut. It’s best to cut the nails fairly straight across, ensuring that the corners of the nail do not cut into the skin folds of the toe. And use an  emery board to smooth the jagged edges and corners that can snag and potentially tear the nail as it grows.  Top Toenail Clippers  There are a number of medical-grade or specialty toenail clippers recommended by professionals for older adults.  For thick nails the “New Huing Podiatrist Toenail Clippers” is a top option. This clipper has a sharp, curved blade that easily cuts through any toenail, no matter how hard or thick  it has gotten, and a nonslip, cushion grip that allows for comfortable clipping. For those with limited mobility, check out the “Clipperpro Omega Select Toenail Clipper,” which has a long plastic grip that’s much larger than that of a standard set of nail clippers and a blade head that swivels 180 degrees. Both of those features make this clipper much easier to use for anyone with arthritis or mobility issues, since they have more control and an added range they can reach.  And for people who have a hard time bending over, there are long handled toenail clippers like the “DriFeez Long Handle Toenail Clippers” which come in four sizes – 20, 24, 28 and 32 inches long. It also has a heavy-duty clipper with a 1/8-inch-wide jaw opening designed to cut thick toenails.  All of these clippers are available online at sites like Amazon.com or Walmart.com at prices ranging between $10 and $40.  Toenail Trimming Services  If you get to the point that you can’t, or would rather not cut your own toenails, a podiatrist can provide both foot and toenail care. But be aware that routine foot care is not covered by Medicare unless you have an underlying condition or injury that requires a professional to tend to your feet.  If you are generally in good health, regular pedicures at a nail salon is good option for getting your toenails cut and is much cheaper than visiting a podiatrist.

"miracle","1917-10-13","Not Discerned","{""Fatima"", ""Lisboa"", ""Portugal""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:35:40","In 1917, the Virgin Mary appears to three shepherd children near Fatima, Portugal, and states that Russia will soon become Communist “and spread her errors throughout the world.” On her final apparition, Oct. 13, 1917, more than 70,000 people witness an amazing solar miracle, referred to today as the Miracle of the Sun, in which the gathering of people see the sun spin and dance in the sky for 12 minutes. No one’s eyes are damaged even though they stare directly into the sun.  By 1900, Karl Marx is dead, but the theories that he created, still in their infancy, are growing in popularity. Between 1911 and 1916, a severe religious persecution in Portugal kills 1,700 priests and religious, and the socialist persecutors are only a shadow of the evil that will come.  At the same time that Jesus is appearing to Sister Mary, an unknown political theorist named Karl Marx is writing the Communist Manifesto. When he is finished, the Communist League of London publishes his tract, but it gets little attention.  In the mid-1800s, Jesus began appearing to future saints and mystics warning them of a small group of people who, he said, posed grave danger to humanity. This tiny group, still unknown to the world, he called “Communists.” Sister Mary of St. Peter, a Carmelite nun not well known outside of France, reportedly received a request from Jesus to warn the local archbishop that a special devotion was needed to spiritually destroy the work of the Communists. The archbishop failed to act and none of the devotions requested by Jesus were implemented at that time.  Only weeks after this amazing spectacle, Russia falls to Communism, and Vladimir Lenin, the leader of this revolution, begins to stamp out religion from the country. By 1939, the Russian Orthodox Church claims only hundreds of parishes, down from 54,000 in 1917. Tens of thousands of priests, monks and nuns are persecuted or killed.  As Communism and atheism rise during the 20th century, humanity undergoes sufferings at a level never seen before. World War II claims approximately 50 million lives. Following the war, the eastern half of Europe falls under Soviet domination, and the people living in these Communist countries lose even the most basic freedoms available to citizens of the West.  Then in 1978, a little-known cardinal from Communist Poland is elected Pope John Paul II. Through inspiring public appearances, private conversations and behind the scenes pressure, he manages to keep the Solidarity labor movement seeking greater freedoms from being squashed by Polish authorities.  May 13, 1981, the 64th anniversary of the first appearance of Mary at Fatima, Pope John Paul II is shot in St. Peter’s Square and nearly killed by a man with ties to Bulgarian Communism. The bullet’s trajectory, however, mysteriously curves around the main artery of his heart, sparing his life. The pope later credits the Virgin Mary for saving his life, saying, “One hand fired and another guided the bullet.”  Following the attack, the pope studies the Marian apparitions at Fatima. March 25, 1984, he performs the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, as requested by Mary at Fatima, for the conversion of Russia and the end of Communism. What follows is an amazing series of events in which Communism in the Soviet bloc collapses.  Coincidently, many key events in the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred on Marian feast days. For example, Aug. 22, 1991, the feast of the Queenship of Mary, a military coup against reforms inside the Soviet Union failed. Dec. 8, 1991, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords to establish the Commonwealth of Independent States to replace the Soviet Union. Then, Dec. 12, 1991, the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Supreme Soviet of Russia formally approved the Belavezha Accords and ratified the breakup of Soviet Union. The final domino to fall occurred when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union and announced that the Soviet Union was officially dismantled. The date was Dec. 25, Christmas Day.  As Pope John Paul II later noted, “In the designs of Providence there are no mere coincidences.” Many historians have held that Pope John Paul II “ignited” (to quote Gorbachev) and enabled the decadelong series of events, especially in Poland, that led to the collapse of Communism. And, since the pope’s life was saved by Our Lady of Fatima, then Mary essentially brought about the collapse of Communism in Europe and Russia. This amazing series of events gives us hope for the future, for if Mary’s powerful intercession can enable such significant and powerful events to occur then, the same can be true today.

After 23 years of serving the same NICU unit, Horton said it's not uncommon for families to become friends as they go through such a challenging time that they did not plan for.  ""The families are so strong and they don't even know it at the time. They have no clue because they're going through the absolute worst time in their life,"" explained Horton. ""It doesn't surprise me that they built a relationship that has lasted a lifetime because they went through one of the worst moments of their life together.""  Claire Kopsky TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital NICU Nurse Manager Jamie Horton  As Kelly and Long grew up, Horton stayed in touch on Facebook with their mothers seeing that they met up for play dates over time even though they lived hours apart in Tennessee. In April, she saw that the pair went to prom together.  ""I just thought because we did this, you know, we had gotten in touch again, like a few years ago, and so I just thought it'd be nice to like him to come to Pulaski and come to prom with me because he had never been to Pulaski and I don't know, it was a new experience,"" Kelly explained.  After Long agreed to come, to Kelly's surprise he surprised her with a limo ride.  Kelly said, ""I was like this—That's really cool. I was not expecting it at all.""  Before they left for prom, the pair's mothers had them pose for a few extra photos.  ""It was really embarrassing. I mean, it was kind of like, ‘Hey, you guys have known each other for so long and you like little kids?... Let's just remake all of these [pictures].’ And I was like okay, like, why not?"" Leighton said.  Claire Kopsky According to the March of Dimes, about 10 percent of babies in the U.S. spend time in the NICU after they are born.  The duo realized how special their friendship is and credits their moms with keeping them in touch.  ""When you find someone who's like a really good friend. It's hard to, like, come along those in by those these days especially when everyone kind of in their own worlds. And when you find someone who is like going to be your friend for a long period of time to never let them go and always keep in contact,"" Leighton said.  Kelly said, ""We didn't talk for a good five years, but then when we caught back up and I went to Knoxville, like two years ago, it was like nothing had changed. So just don't give up.""  Their nurse said it is heartwarming to see their story come full circle and hopes it brings hope to other families currently in the NICU.  ""They started life with a challenge and have no doubt they'll handle any other challenge that comes their way. Just with watching them grow up,"" said Horton. ""I got to see how tiny Tatum was and how tiny and critical she was on that first day of life. I'm not surprised she is who she is today because she started out as a really strong young lady as a baby and she's definitely like watching her grow into that has been, it's rewarding.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjaGFubmVsNS5jb20vbmV3cy9uaWN1LW5laWdoYm9ycy10dXJuLXByb20tZGF0ZXMtMTcteWVhcnMtbGF0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-14","15:00:00","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:37:00","BALTIMORE – We’re ready to kickoff a big racing weekend at Old Hilltop, which will culminate in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday afternoon.  The 1 1/8-mile $300,000 Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes is set for Friday at Pimlico Race Course. The 14-race card also will include two Grade 3 races, the Miss Preakness and the Pimlico Special, and the non-graded Dupont Stakes.  The 99th running of the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes features a field of 11 fillies trying to step up within the 3-year-old filly division. No fillies that ran in the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks two weeks ago at Churchill Downs are entered in the Susan. Miracle has scratched from the race  This year’s race will be televised on Peacock (3 p.m.) in a 90-minute telecast as part of NBC Sports’ weekend coverage of the Preakness Stakes.  Let’s take a look at the field for the Black-Eyed Susan (trainer, jockey, odds in parenthesis):  Race 11 – Post Time: Friday, 5:48 p.m. – 1 1/8 miles (dirt) – $300,000 Grade 3 Black-Eyed Susan  1 – Sacred Wish (Weaver, Velazquez, 10-1). Hall of Famer Johnny V picks up the ride on the Not This Time filly who was second last out in the Gulfstream Park Oaks after breaking her maiden in her second career race. Lightly raced filly could move forward here.  2 – Pate (Maker, Barbosa, 20-1). Ships in from Oaklawn, where she has run four races to date. Picks up local jock Jeiron Barbosa to ride the daughter of Super Saver. Flopped in the Fantasy after a decent effort in a non-graded stake at Hot Springs. Late closer will need a hot pace to be a factor.  3 – Hoosier Philly (Amoss, Morales, 10-1). Made some noise early on the Kentucky Oaks trail, but consecutive poor efforts at the Fair Grounds had her on the outside looking in at Churchill Downs. If the Into Mischief filly regains her 2-year-old form, she could be a factor. Work tab at Churchill says she is ready. Minor player in the exotics.  4 – Merlazza (Cox, Geroux, 6-1). Daughter of Medaglia d’Oro comes out of a non-graded stake at Oaklawn and looks to be on the improve. Nice progression of races for the lightly raced filly and has the breeding to stay the nine furlongs. Contender.  5 – Frosty O Toole (Pletcher, Rosario, 15-1). Late-running filly came up empty in the Gazelle for Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher after a promising allowance race at Tampa. Daughter of Frosted has the speed on top and is out of a Distorted Humor mare underneath. Pletcher has fared well in this race in the past.  6 – Miracle (Pletcher, Ortiz, Jr., SCR). Scratched and is pointing toward the Bouwerie at Belmont Park on May 29.  7 – Comparative (Cox, Saez, 12-1). Comes out of a big allowance race at Keeneland, where she beat a decent field. Luis Saez has rode her to two straight wins for Godolphin. Street Sense filly fired a bullet May 13 at Keeneland and looks ready to roll at a price.  8 – Balpool (Atras, Franco, 8-1). Uncaptured filly ships from New York for trainer Rob Atras after winning the Memories of Silver at Aqueduct on an off track. Last two races have been impressive, and morning work tab says she’s fit to run. Inside of the favorite and having some speed could give her the early edge. Contender.  9 – Faiza (Baffert, Prat, 7-5). Heavy favorite comes into the race unbeaten in five starts for Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert. It’s her race to lose as the speedy filly bypassed the Kentucky Oaks to run here. Daughter of Girvin will be forwardly placed, and should make her signature move at the quarter pole to put this group away. The one to beat.  10 – Taxed (Morse, Bejarano, 15-1). Filly on the also-eligible list for the Oaks, but didn’t get in, so her connections pivoted to Baltimore. The Fantasy runner-up to the Oaks favorite has been inconsistent during her career. Trainer Randy Morse's metrics off the layoff are solid with a $2.75 ROI, so don’t overlook the daughter of Collected.  11 - Cats Inthe Timber (Russell, Toledo, 30-1). Daughter of Honor Code will be entering deep waters in the Susan. Local entry is taking a big step up in class. Pass.  12 - Towhead (Maker, Gaffalione, 20-1). Malibu Moon filly ran nicely three back, but recent form hasn’t inspired bettors. When facing stakes company she has struggled. Sitting this one out.

"miracle","2017-09-25","Not Discerned","{""Dublin"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:33:45","Share on Pinterest GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may help restore ‘natural killer’ cells that can reduce the risk of several types of cancer.Mario Tama/Getty Images Results of a small study have found that drugs containing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, may help reduce cancer risk.  The type 2 diabetes treatment was shown to restore anticancer cells which are less effective in people with obesity.  Experts say semaglutide’s anti-inflammatory properties and effect on blood sugar regulation may explain this link. You might have heard semaglutide (sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) described as a ‘miracle’ weight loss aid. Now, new research suggests the drug may also help reduce cancer risk in people with obesity. A small study conducted at Maynooth University in Ireland found that glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs like semaglutide can restore naturally occurring anticancer cells, known as natural killer (NK) cells. The study authors note that people with obesity are at a greater risk of developing cancer due in part to their NK cells being “rendered useless”. They discovered that semaglutide restored the cancer-killing effect of NK cells independent of the drug’s main weight loss function, concluding that the treatment appears to be “directly kick-starting the NK cells’ engine”. So, how do these NK cells fight cancer, why are they not as effective in people with obesity, and what do the results of this study mean for the treatment of obesity going forward? Dr. Semiya Aziz, a UK doctor and general practitioner, describes these findings as significant. “It would be fair to say that this is a very small cohort of people to build conclusions from, however, based on the results within this small cohort, the findings appear significant and could have important implications in understanding the relationship between obesity, the immune system, and cancer risk,” she surmises.  How natural killer (NK) cells reduce cancer risk According to Aziz, what is most encouraging from the study, is that treatment with long-acting GLP-1 analogs, such as semaglutide, can potentially restore the functionality of NK cells in people with obesity, independent of weight loss effects of semaglutide. “Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and play a crucial role in preventing cancer,” she explains. “They do this by recognizing and then destroying cancer cells through a process called cytotoxicity.” It’s not entirely clear why NK cells are rendered less effective in people with obesity, but Aziz points to lower-grade inflammation and altered cellular metabolism as two possible causes. Why does semaglutide appear to restore the function of NK cells, and in return reduce cancer risk in people with obesity? That’s not fully known either. “What we do know is that semaglutide promotes weight loss and obesity is a well-established risk factor for various types of cancers, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer.” Semaglutide has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. “We already know that chronic inflammation can lead to the development and progression of cancers, therefore by suppressing inflammation, semaglutide may mitigate some of the factors that promote cancer development,” Aziz explains. Another factor may be semaglutide’s effect on blood sugar levels. Intended for use as a type 2 diabetes treatment, the drug regulates blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of insulin and reducing the production of glucagon. “Elevated blood glucose levels have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as liver, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer so achieving better glycemic control may contribute to a decreased cancer risk,” Aziz points out.  What these findings suggest about future obesity treatment Dr. Stephen Lawrence, associate clinical professor at Warwick Medical School in the UK, says this study adds to a pool of evidence supporting opportunities to positively influence the body’s systems in people with obesity. However, he notes that as it’s a small study it has limited statistical validity. “The value of this study is best regarded as hypothesis-generating rather than having practical clinical implications,” he surmises. “I would hope the study will form a platform for the design of clinical trials which are powered to demonstrate the significance of interventions.” Furthermore, Lawrence says it’s important to remember that obesity is not the only factor that may impair the immune system and increase our risk of cancer. “A very important contributor to the development of cancer includes unhealthy lifestyle in its various forms, and so one non-pharmacological intervention could be to modify your lifestyle to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes,” he points out. As Lawrence suggests, drugs like semaglutide may not be the best first-line approach when it comes to tackling obesity. Taking the drug won’t help you recognize – and eventually shift – the behaviors and habits that led to your weight gain or encourage you to create healthier habits. “People with obesity carry a high metabolic risk, and so pharmacologically targeting the immune system without addressing the obesity is not a desirable or likely intended approach,” Lawrence points out.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGxpbmUuY29tL2hlYWx0aC1uZXdzL296ZW1waWMtYW5kLXdlaWdodC1sb3NzLWRydWdzLWxpa2Utd2Vnb3Z5LWNhbi1jdXJiLWNhbmNlci1yaXNrc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:02:00","[1/2] Surfer Kelly Slater of the U.S rides a wave during the third round of competition in the Billabong Pro surfing tournament on the legendary reef break in Teahupoo, Tahiti, May 14, 2008.... Read more                May 18 (Reuters) - Kelly Slater is hoping he can pull off one more miracle as the most remarkable career in surfing draws towards a close, setting his sights on a narrow path to qualification for the Olympics being held next year in Tahiti's thumping tubes.  The 51-year-old American, world champion a record 11 times, was last month granted a wildcard for the remainder of the World Surf League's (WSL) 2023 tour after he failed to make the mid-year cut.  With WSL rankings taking precedence for Olympic qualification, the reprieve kept alive Slater's ambition to sign off his 30-plus-year professional career at Teahupo'o, the site of the event for the Paris 2024 Games.  ""My hopes are still up for it and it would be a real dream come true for me to make that happen,"" Slater told Reuters in an interview.  ""When I started, we didn't have surfing in the Olympics, so it was never my ultimate goal. That it has presented itself, it just lines up so well for me for when I want to stop competing.  ""It would be an almost perfect time for me to call it a day as far as full-time competition.""  Surfing joined the Olympics at the 2021 Tokyo Games, with Slater just missing out on making the U.S. team. He is currently well behind John John Florence, Griffin Colapinto and four other countrymen seeking only two places.  Few would write him off quite yet though.  Slater has won every stop on the world tour among his unprecedented 56 event victories and conjured some improbable comebacks since his first professional win as an 18-year-old in 1990.  And one further path to the Olympics is available. A win by the U.S. men's team at the ISA World Surfing Games next year would earn them an additional spot at the Olympics.  Having won at Teahupo'o five times and made the semi-finals there last year, Slater would be an obvious choice to take on the perfect, but dangerous, reef pass.  ""I've obviously had a really good record at Teahupo'o,"" Slater said. ""It's a wave that suits my strengths and I know the wave really well.""  Missing out on the Olympics would not be the end of the world, Slater added, and he has alternative retirement plans on the cards ""in the next year or two"".  They would most likely involve a last ride as a professional at Hawaii's iconic Pipeline, where he stunned the world to win for a record eighth time last year.  ""There's a lot of good outs for me - there's no bad path,"" said Slater, speaking ahead of the launch of a new company making sandals inspired by turtle shells and the moon.  ""If I don't make the Olympics maybe I help out in some capacity there with the guys that do.""  As well as designing sandals, surfboards, surf fins and a range of clothing, Slater also had a hand in designing ground-breaking wave pool technology that he believes could have role in Olympic competitions of the future.  The pools generate near identical waves to order, taking out some of the luck factor in ocean surfing and allowing a more ""apples to apples"" comparison of skills, Slater said.  While pools also make scheduling of events much easier, the lure of the ocean is hard to resist for a man who has spent so much time in it.  ""As far as fairness goes, it makes a lot of sense,"" he said. ""But surfing is an artistic, creative thing and you're trying to decipher what nature throws at you.""

A birchbark canoe, which complements the Games’ logo branding, is making the rounds across 13 Mi’kmaw communities in Nova Scotia to help promote the 2023 event, set for July 7-15 in Halifax and area.      The so-dubbed Canoe Relay, which stopped at Membertou’s Greenlink Municipal Park on Thursday, was set out to attract local residents and recognize athletes of Team Mi’kmaw Nova Scotia with a community celebration.  From lett, Neal Alderson, Geri Francis, Kahlaya Isaac, Gideon Paul, Journey Joe, Macy Francis, Charlie Joe, Addison Marshall, Trennan Paul, Ariah Gould, Rebeccah Slaunwhite of RBC, Miracle Johnson, Jeff Ward and Leon Paul, Membertou Youth Centre co-ordinator. IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST - IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST  ‘MADE ME FEEL PROUD’  “Seeing it made me feel proud to represent Membertou and the province,” said 16-year-old Charlie Joe of Membertou, who will be representing Team Mi’kmaw Nova Scotia’s softball team. “It also makes me feel more connected to our community.”  Added Ariah Gould, 19, also of Membertou, who’ll be on the team’s volleyball squad, “It’s very traditional, and it makes me aware of our culture and everything. I’m glad that we still do stuff like this.”  In all, 16 athletes from Membertou will take part in the Games — each competing in various sports such as archery, basketball, softball, swimming and volleyball.  Many athletes, along with representatives from Membertou, sponsors RBC, the Membertou Youth Chief and Council and other spectators, viewed a smudging, a water ceremony and drumming to The Honour Song, while within a 10-minute span, the weather went through cloudy, rainy, hail then sunny conditions.  “Welcome to Cape Breton weather; wait 10 minutes and things will change,” said ceremony MC Jeff Ward.

Marshall, Youth Chief Miracle Johnson, Jali Christmas and Anastasia Kabatay, the latter of whom is also participating in the North American Indigenous Games. IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST - IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST  BUILT SPECIFICALLY TO REPRESENT GAMES  The birchbark canoe was designed by Todd Labrador, from southwestern Nova Scotia’s Acadia First Nation, Kesputkwitk District, a practising Mi’kmaw builder of such traditional canoes recognized internationally. Labrador, along with his daughter Melissa and other family members, constructed the 19-foot vessel.  “He built this specifically for the Games, but originally it was done for the 2020 edition,” said Neal Alderson, director of marketing and communications for the North American Indigenous Games.  The Mi’kmaq regularly travelled great distances along the waterways of the Maritimes and depended on the canoe for transportation. As Alderson explained, it’s why the canoe is featured prominently in the Games logo.  Elder Katy MacEwan, second from right, delivers a special dedication prayer during a Canoe Relay ceremony at Membertou on Thursday. IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST - IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST  'CONSIDERED WATER PEOPLE'  “The Mi’kmaw people are considered water people and travelled a lot by canoe … using waterways and oceans that they’ve travelled for thousands of years. And this is such an educational opportunity for our non-Indigenous community to learn about the Indigenous people, their history, the culture they have and belonging together.”  Labrador’s reputation within his community tied him into the North American Indigenous Games’ group,” Alderson said. Normally, Labrador would build canoes sized up to 16 feet, but for the Games the canoe built for the display tour ended up being 19 feet in length.  A water ceremony is conducted by Membertou Youth Chief Miracle Johnson as rain turns to hail on Thursday. IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST - IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST  ‘ACKNOWLEDGES OUR PEOPLE’  Ward, general manager of Membertou Heritage Park, said he recalled hearing from his elders about 24-foot canoes, ones big enough to put sails in them and use them for sailing purposes.  “The canoe represents our ancestors and acknowledges our people,” Ward said. “It represents our ancestors and acknowledges that our people are still here and the resilience that we have.  “One of the greatest inventions we brought to the world. And it’s still the best way to travel.”  Membertou athletes and respective sports participating on Team Mi'kmaw Nova Scotia:  Journey Joe — U16 Basketball  Nevaeh Doucette — U16 Basketball  Malaki Denny — U19 Basketball  Karis Christmas — U19 Basketball  Anastasia Kabatay — U19 Basketball  Charlie Joe — U16 Softball  Kingston LaPorte — U16 Softball  Nicholas Basque — U16 Softball  Geri Francis — U16 Softball  Macy Francis — U16 Beach Volleyball  Kaiden LaPorte — U19 Volleyball  Ariah Gould — U19 Volleyball  Trennan Paul — Archery  Addison Marshall — Archery  Kahlaya Isaac — Swimming  Gideon Paul — Swimming    CRAFTSMANSHIP  For Alderson, it’s also about the traditional craftsmanship that Labrador and his family put into the design of these traditional canoes.  “Every time I look at one of these, I continue to notice new intricacies within the designs.”  The 2023 Games plans to welcome more than 5,000 athletes, including 756 nations from all over North America. Events will take place across 18 facilities between the Halifax Regional Municipality, Sipekne’katik and Millbrook First Nations.  The Canoe Relay will continue its tour through Cape Breton’s Indigenous communities on Friday at Eskasoni Fisheries (4115 Shore Rd., Eskasoni, 5 p.m.), May 31 in Wagmatcook (57 Fishery Rd., 10 a.m.) and We’koqma’q (Sky River Trail, 4 p.m.), and June 1 in Potlotek (located TBA, 1 p.m.).  - Ian Nathanson is a multimedia journalist with the Cape Breton Post.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an ""absolute miracle.""  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  Also Read:  ""He drove off. He's depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. ""He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.""  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil's Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.  He said he was not really depressed but that he felt down because times were bad in the world, according to the affidavit.  ""Asked if he felt suicidal, he said, 'You know, not like a plan, not usually,'"" the affidavit said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEtcmFkaW9sb2dpc3QtaW50ZW50aW9uYWxseS1kcm92ZS1mYW1pbHktb2ZmLWNsaWZmLXdpZmUtc2F5cy_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvc2FuZnJhbmNpc2NvL25ld3MvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1yYWRpb2xvZ2lzdC1pbnRlbnRpb25hbGx5LWRyb3ZlLWZhbWlseS1vZmYtY2xpZmYtd2lmZS1zYXlzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:30:00","Michael Shayan plays his mother in the one-man show “Avaaz,” running at South Coast Repertory until May 27.  At the age of 12, Michael Shayan was turning water into Manischewitz wine. It wasn’t a miracle, it was magic.  “That’s when my mother knew I was gay,” he joked.  Magic brought him to the stage. He’d put on his uncle’s double-breasted suit jacket and perform at bar mitzvahs. He even had his own magic company. Shayan lied about his age and auditioned for the Hollywood Magic Castle — the age requirement to be a junior magician member was 13. They let him in anyway.  “That’s when I knew I was gay,” he quipped.  Shayan’s fascination with magic stemmed from his upbringing.  “We were in this small apartment and magic was my escape,” he said. “It was the way of imagining a new life for myself and also for my mother.”  Advertisement  Shayan’s latest trick is turning into his mother six times a week at the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, or at least a character inspired by her. He called it “every gay man’s dream or nightmare, depending on how you feel about your mother.”  As the character Roya in his one-man show “Avaaz” — running until May 27 — he welcomes audiences to “Tehrangeles,” a.k.a. Westwood. It’s Nowruz, Iranian New Year, and Roya is serving chicken, tea and looks (designed by Joshua “Domino” Schwartz). But behind the extravagant affair unfolds a personal family tale about how Roya immigrated from Tehran to America and started a new life.  “Avaaz,” written by Shayan and directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, developed out of a channeling exercise for playwriting he did with Luis Alfaro during a fellowship at the Lambda Literary Writer’s Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Voices in 2017. Alfaro, the then- associate artistic director of Center Theatre Group , instructed the fellows using a method popularized by Cuban American playwright María Irene Fornés, telling them to place a hand over their hearts and feel the heartbeat of a character.  “He said, ‘Just listen,’” Shayan recalled Alfaro saying. “I did that and I felt the presence of my mother.”  “I felt like an outsider in some ways,” Michael Shayan said. “Too Jewish for my Iranian community, too Iranian for my Jewish community and too gay for both of those.” (Jenny Graham)  When he told his mother the visions that came to him during the exercise, many of them ended up being true to her experience. He went on to interview his mother about her life, even though she had never talked about her past before. “It was like this taboo subject,” he said.  “I think that interview really opened something up for her and she told me things in that interview she never told me before,” he said.  The experience opened his eyes to the life she lived and their complicated relationship. The mother and son did a lot together. They went to school at the same time. They did homework and rode the bus together. They lived in a small, one-bedroom apartment in Westwood and slept on twin beds “so close we could feel each other breathe,” Shayan said, reciting the poignant lines of the play.  “It felt like we were really growing up at the same time and she acknowledges that too,” he said.  As he started to explore playwriting — with a nudge from his former Harvard professor — he saw how theater could be a vessel for the larger questions he had about his identity as a queer Jewish Iranian American.  “I felt like an outsider in some ways,” he said. “Too Jewish for my Iranian community, too Iranian for my Jewish community and too gay for both of those.”  Michael Shayan and his mother, Sheri Rabeie. (From Michael Shayan)  During the run of “Avaaz,” he witnessed how the show connected his various communities. After one performance, a group of gay men cheered “mother” as Shayan walked out of the theater. Another time, a large group of queer Iranians saw the show and shared their coming-out and mother-son stories afterward.  “I have Iranian women coming up to me after the show, many of whom shared that they’ve never stepped foot inside of an American theater,” Shayan said.  One woman’s response, in particular, has stuck with him. “Thank you for every second,” he recalled her saying in Farsi. “Thank you for every feeling. Thank you for telling my story.”  Shayan dedicated “Avaaz” to the protest movement in Iran against compulsory hijab . While working on the play, he learned that his mother and aunt as young women were taken to the same detention center as Mahsa Amini — the 22-year-old woman who became the symbol of resistance in Iran after dying in police custody, where she was being detained for wearing a hijab headscarf in an “improper” way — for refusing to wear hijabs.  “I’m humbled to be a part of an emergent group of Iranian American artists trying to give voice to our stories,” Shayan told The Times in an email.  Although more than half of Iranian immigrants in the United States live in California, Iranian stories are largely missing in arts and entertainment. But the tide is turning.  In “Avaaz,” Michael Shayan explores his mom’s journey from Tehran to America. (Jenny Graham)  Last week, Iranian American playwright Sanaz Toossi won a Pulitzer Prize for drama for her first produced play, “English,” about a language test-prep class in Tehran. Iranian American actor Arian Moayed received a Tony nomination earlier this month for his lead role in “A Doll’s House.”  In the future, Shayan hopes to tour “Avaaz” (his mother has Broadway ambitions for it) and develop a TV pilot for the story. While he’s performing “Avaaz,” he is also working on the Audible play “Cruising,” directed by Tony nominee Stephen Brackett.  During tech rehearsal for the South Coast Repertory show, Shayan learned that he was nominated for a writing Emmy in the daytime nonfiction program category for “The Book of Queer.” At the time, he was scrambling to bring the magic of Tehrangeles to life and pushed the news to the side to process later.  The time to process has come.  “It feels like my communities are finally getting their due, and I know we’re just getting started,” Shayan wrote to The Times.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdGltZXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtYXJ0cy9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA1LTE4L21pY2hhZWwtc2hheWFuLWF2YWF6LW1vbS1zb3V0aC1jb2FzdC1yZXBlcnRvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is all thanks to a local non-profit and security group teaming up to help save lives.    The opioid crisis is a national epidemic and unfortunately overdoses are on the rise here in Nashville. “I was narcanned seven times,” overdose survivor, Rich Johnston said. Johnston says he was addicted to heroin and calls Narcan a miracle drug. “I would 100% not be here if it were not for Narcan,” Johnston emphasized.  Jack Byrd says his teams at Solaren Risk Management, a private security group who works with more than 100 downtown businesses, partnered with TEMPO, which is Gibson's program to offer opioid emergency response kits.  One of the bars receiving these Narcan kits is Dierks Bentley’s Whiskey Row on Broadway. “It’s just like an AED that when you open it up, it will start playing a video that tells you how to properly put on PPE to make sure you’re safe and everyone else is safe,” Byrd explained. Byrd says these kits will go up right next to the bars' AEDs.  He says this kit gives step-by-step instruction on how to administer Narcan so this way if someone has training or not, they act and respond immediately.  “Seconds matter. Absolutely and when you encounter someone experiencing that kind of crisis,"" Byrd said.  Unfortunately, it’s a crisis that Nashville’s bars and restaurants are seeing more of every month.  “As a management company on Lower Broadway, we have a very close relationship with Metro Nashville Police Department and we know what’s going on in Nashville, so being a part of this program is our way to help prevent and educate people on this crisis and what we can do to help stop it,” Lissa Druss with RIOT Hospitality Group said.  This initiative will hopefully help stop people from dying.  “I work as an interventionist now and it’s something that cannot be replaced and the importance of which cannot be overstated,” Johnston emphasized.  Byrd says by Friday, thirty of the downtown bars and restaurants will have these Narcan kits installed right next to their AED and then they will begin the next phase.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZm94MTcuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbmFzaHZpbGxlLWJhcnMtYW5kLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWdpdmVuLW5hcmNhbi1zYWZldHkta2l0cy10by1oZWxwLWZpZ2h0LW9waW9pZC1lcGlkZW1pY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Semaglutide, which is also sold under the brand name Wegovy and Ozempic, is an appetite-suppressant drug usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, but is increasingly being used for weight-management.  The research, carried out by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine, assigned the injection to 201 adolescents classed as clinically obese.  The study’s results found that, for those on semaglutide, almost 45 per cent of them were able to drop below the clinical defintion for obseity.  The report’s conclusion said that administering the drug once a week gave “historically unprecedented” results, and brought about “clinically meaningful improvements”.  Semaglutide has received various high-profile celebrity endorsements, with figures such as Twitter boss Elon Musk having claimed to have used the drug. A Twitter user asked Mr Musk last October how he remained “fit, ripped, and healthy”, to which he replied “fasting” and “Wegovy”. And, many believe others, including Kim Kardashian, make use of it, too.  The “game-changer” drug is set to be available on prescription on the NHS after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) gave it the green light.  However, the drug can come with some unpleasant side effects, and some have issued warnings about the dangers of dramatic weight loss.  What is Wegovy?  Wegovy is an injectable medicine used for adults with obesity or a (body mass index) BMI of 27 or more.  It suppresses appetite by mimicking a hormone named glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is normally released after eating. This makes people feel full, meaning they eat less and lose weight.  Patients will be required to inject themselves weekly.  Prof Nick Finer, honorary clinical professor at the National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes at University College London (UCL), said: “The efficacy of semaglutide is a true game-changer for the medical treatment of obesity, a chronic disease that shortens life through its many complications.”  It has been reported that some users have hailed the drug as a miracle given the dramatic weight loss they have enjoyed.  Who can use Wegovy?  Those with a BMI of 30 or more, or those with a BMI of 27 or more who also have a weight-related medical problem, can use the drug.  Patients who are prescribed the medication will have the injections as part of a thorough weight-management programme and an increase in exercise.  Nice says that weight-related conditions that will make obese people eligible will include “Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia (unbalanced or unhealthy cholesterol levels), obstructive sleep apnoea, and heart disease”.  A study found that people who were given the drug, which comes as a weekly injection, saw their weight drop by 12 per cent on average after 68 weeks.  Does Wegovy have any side effects?  Nice has said it will be approving the injectables for a two-year course of treatment at a maximum, with side effects minimal when used correctly.  Mild nausea, diarrhoea, and headaches are some of the side effects but they were found to be “mild to moderate in severity and subsided with time”.  When will Wegovy be available in the UK?  The injectable is already available privately through pharmacists and costs on average £130 per month. The drug will be available to NHS patients soon when the launch of the drug in England is confirmed by manufacturer Novo Nordisk.  Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said: “For some people, losing weight is a real challenge, which is why a medicine like semaglutide is a welcome option.  “It won’t be available to everyone. Our committee has made specific recommendations to ensure it remains value for money for the taxpayer, and it can only be used for a maximum of two years.  “We are pleased to finally publish our final guidance on semaglutide, which will mean some people will be able to access this much-talked-about drug on the NHS.”  Sky News reported that in February, it had transpired that some high street chemists in England will prescribe the drug, if suitable, through their online doctor services.

"miracle","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:00:00","From the 78 teams that have competed in the 2022-23 Champions League through the qualifying, group and knockout phases, we now have our two finalists: Manchester City will face Inter Milan on June 10.  Reigning Premier League champions City took a major step toward becoming European champions for the first time by eliminating Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in Wednesday's dominant 4-0 win. That result was also a huge statement in their quest to become only the second English club to win the treble (domestic league, domestic cup, Champions League), after Manchester United in 1999.  Inter, meanwhile, made a statement of their own by beating local rivals AC Milan 1-0 on Tuesday to win their semifinal 3-0 on aggregate and reach their first Champions League final since 2010, when they lifted the trophy for a third time as part of their own treble.  - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)  But who will win in Istanbul 3½ weeks from now? Will City make up for their loss in the final two years ago and finally become champions of Europe, or will Inter beat the odds and claim the continental crown for the fourth time in their history?  We asked ESPN writers Gab Marcotti, Mark Ogden, Julien Laurens and Rob Dawson for their early thoughts ahead of the final and their predictions on which team will win it all.  play 1:27 Ogden: Man City absolutely tore Real Madrid apart Mark Ogden reacts to Manchester City's sensational 4-0 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinal.  Who has been your player of the tournament so far, and why?  Marcotti: Erling Haaland. A reluctant choice, since, frankly, if he weren't there City would probably still be in the final. But that applies to all the other City guys, too. This is a team built on the collective, so if any standout performer doesn't produce, then there are others to step in. Actually Inter are very much based on the collective, too; it's just that pound-for-pound they have a lot less quality.  I know that Haaland didn't do much at the Bernabeu and arguably missed a hat trick of chances in the second leg at the Etihad. But he's the Champions League top scorer with 12 goals (for the second time already in his young career), and he's genuinely different from what City would otherwise offer, giving them a different dimension. I don't have strong feelings on this one, but if you force me to choose, I'll choose him. Nobody at City is irreplaceable (except maybe coach Pep Guardiola) but Haaland -- and midfielder Rodri -- are less replaceable than any of the other guys.  Ogden: Kevin De Bruyne, Let's put the stats to one side and focus on a player who is about more than mere numbers to his team. De Bruyne is the heartbeat of Guardiola's Manchester City side, and he has produced key moments to get his team to the final. His goal in the semifinal first leg against Real Madrid hauled City level and ensured a 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu. That provided the platform for the 4-0 demolition job in the return fixture at the Etihad, in which De Bruyne set the ball rolling for hosts with the pass for Bernardo Silva's opening goal.  While goal scorers tend to win the biggest games, success is built in midfield, and that has been a thread of Champions League success through the ages. From Roy Keane driving Manchester United to the final in 1999 (which he missed through suspension), Steven Gerrard inspiring Liverpool to glory in 2005 and Luka Modric (Real Madrid) and Xavi (Barcelona) on more than one occasion for their teams, Champions Leagues are won by dominant midfielders. De Bruyne is that guy for Manchester City, and he is peaking at the perfect time in this season's competition.  Laurens: John Stones. To watch him play as a hybrid centre-back and central midfielder against Bayern Munich and Real Madrid is just incredible. What Guardiola has done with him, how he has transformed his game is wonderful. Of course, he still loses the ball at times and his touch can be a bit heavy but he brings so much to this team. He covers so much ground and is a weapon that opponents haven't been able to work out yet. City are a better team with Stones in this new role.  Dawson: Ruben Dias. City have always scored goals in Champions League knockout games, but the difference this year is how well they've defended. In six knockout matches this season they've only conceded three times while keeping clean sheets at home against RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. Dias doesn't get the attention that John Stones attracts because he's not the one pushing into midfield with the ball at his feet, but he's the glue that holds it all together. He's quick, strong, good on the ball and physical when he needs to be and he's been outstanding at the business end of this season's Champions League. In two games against Karim Benzema, the France striker -- who won the Ballon d'Or last year for driving Madrid past top opponents like City to win the Champions League -- barely got a sniff at goal.  play 1:58 How will Inter's attack line up against Man City in UCL final? Alejandro Moreno and Craig Burley explain why Simone Inzaghi should start Lautaro Martinez and Edin Dzeko in the UCL final.  Which duel do you think will be the most decisive in the final, and why?  Ogden: This is not really a duel, but more a dilemma for City to solve if Inter coach Simone Inzaghi continues with his front two of Lautaro Martinez and either Edin Dzeko or Romelu Lukaku. It is a rarity in the modern game for a top team to operate with two outright forwards and it will be a different challenge for City's defenders to overcome. They will be accustomed to one marking and one being spare, but Inter won't give them that luxury if Inzaghi sticks with his favoured approach. He may opt to be more pragmatic by playing with one forward and packing the midfield, but it seems unlikely, so it will be intriguing to see how Guardiola handles the threat and which defenders he selects to play at centre-back. They will have to deal with Martinez's movement and mobility and the more physical threat of former City striker Dzeko or Lukaku, so Guardiola's selection will be key.  Laurens: We will have many great matchups in the final, but the one with the best story will be Francesco Acerbi against Haaland. Inter centre-back Acerbi is 35, his career is behind him. No one expected him to reach this kind of level and play in a Champions League final, even before he underwent chemotherapy for testicular cancer in 2014. Yet, here he is, preparing to face Haaland, a goal-scoring phenomenon 13 years his junior who will want to make up for his misses against Real Madrid. Acerbi will be physical like Antonio Rudiger but is also smart like David Alaba. The Inter back five will be a challenge for Haaland; whoever wins that battle will win the game.  Dawson: The key duel might end up being between Pep Guardiola and his own mind. He joked before the semifinal second leg against Real Madrid that he wouldn't ""overthink"" his tactical plan after being accused of just that in big Champions League ties in the past. City fans will still remember that he inexplicably started the 2021 Champions League final against Chelsea without a holding midfielder, and many of the supporters travelling to Istanbul will not feel comfortable about their chances until they have seen the teamsheet. Very few Inter players would make it into a combined XI, which tells you that, on paper, City are the better side man-for-man. There is no reason for Guardiola to deviate too much from the team that thrashed Real Madrid, but then there was no reason to make such a big change for that loss against Chelsea, either.  Marcotti: City vs. Inter in transition. We know the script for the final will involve City having the bulk of possession. And we know that the longer they play in Inter's half, the likelier they will create chances and, eventually, score. That's why it's critical that, when Inter do turn the ball over, they manage to retain possession for at least a few minutes or, find the ""out ball"" to Lautaro or Lukaku. City did a fantastic job of this against Real Madrid, who have better passers to break the press and, in Vinicius Junior, a better target for them than Inter do. If they can do it again in Istanbul, it won't be much of a game. But if Inter can take the sting out of the press by keeping the ball or stretching them with long passes, forcing City into the tactical foul, if they can slow the pace of the game, then it could be a key to their success. One of the few keys maybe, but a key nonetheless.  play 0:52 Guardiola promises not to overthink his tactics vs. Real Madrid Pep Guardiola speaks ahead of Man City's Champions League semifinal second leg against Real Madrid.  Give us one good reason why Inter can overcome the odds and beat City in the final  Laurens: I expect Inter to cause City problems by harking back to the principals on which La Grande Inter won back-to-back European Cups in the 1960s under coach Helenio Herrera. By that I mean slow the game down, be difficult to break down, play quite deep and be aggressive. Set pieces could be key and the form of players like Martinez and Nicolo Barella, plus what Lukaku can bring, could be decisive for Inter. Tactically, Inzaghi has been excellent in the Champions League this season and I expect him to put up a tactical plan which will be hard for Pep to counter. The only way this Inter side can win the final is by producing a tactical masterclass like Chelsea did under Thomas Tuchel back in 2021. There are similarities between that Chelsea and this Inter, so the Italians could repeat the trick.  Dawson: It's a one-off game. City would be far too strong over two legs, but over 90 minutes (and possibly another 30 of extra time and a penalty shootout after that) anything can happen. City started the 2021 final against Chelsea as favourites but were beaten 1-0 in a tight game, and that will give Inter hope that they can do something similar. The build-up will be dominated by City and talk of a possible treble but Inter have some very good players. It's easy to forget that they came through a group that included Bayern Munich and Barcelona, so it's not as if they have fluked their way to the final -- even if their route through the knockout phase was kinder than City's. Guardiola's side will be fancied to lift the trophy but in a high-pressure final, you never know.  Marcotti: As I mentioned, if they can transition out of pressure either with spells of possession or counterattacks then it's a big plus. It can frustrate City and the longer they keep a clean sheet, the more Inter will grow in confidence. The other factor is set pieces. Inter have excellent free-kick takers in Hakan Calhanoglou, Dzeko and Lautaro. And, on corner kicks and free kicks, they have plenty of size with the likes of Acerbi, Alessandro Bastoni, Dzeko and Lukaku. Plus they have a goalkeeper who can get hot like Andre Onana and, on the day, be a difference maker. It's one game, anything can happen. City are overwhelming favourites, but let's not forget they failed to win eight of 35 Premier League games that they have played so far this season. There's a reason for that; the best team doesn't always win.  Ogden: Belief. Inter have hit a winning streak in recent weeks and they have beaten neighbours AC Milan twice in their eight-game winning run. So confidence will be high and that will enable them to face City with the knowledge that their players are in form and Inzaghi's game plan is working. Inter's experience will feed into that belief. This is a seasoned team of proven performers who won't be intimidated by the prospect of facing City, and they won't be cowed into playing a different game to take them. They are Inter Milan, a club with a great history and huge fan base, and that brings an assurance and self-confidence. City are by far the better team, but Inter can pull it off if everything works in their favour.  play 1:36 Win the UCL or win the World Cup? Bernardo Silva plays You Have To Answer Bernardo Silva picks between Portuguese icons and Manchester City teammates in You Have To Answer.  Give us your predictions for what the score will be in the final, and why  Dawson: City will win, and relatively comfortably. They've hit form at just the right time, and the way they blitzed Real Madrid is evidence of a team playing with swagger and confidence. It will be very hard to stop them winning the treble if that is still on the cards. In the past couple of months, City have put four goals past Arsenal, Liverpool and Real Madrid and three past Bayern Munich. Guardiola's team are controlling games and scoring goals in abundance. They will need to have an off night if Inter are to win and there has been very little over the last 27 games to suggest that might happen. City to win 3-0.  Marcotti: Logic says City because they are more talented, more athletic, fresher, more of a unit (though Inter have become one this season), are more accustomed to these sorts of games and have a better manager. There is no pretending they're anything but overwhelming favourites. So I'm going for a 2-0 City win.  Ogden: Like Gab, my head says City will win and win well. They have just dismantled Real Madrid in a 4-0 rout and one thing about Guardiola's team is that they neither show mercy nor take their foot off the pedal. So while I expect a 3-0 City win, I could still see a 1-0 Inter win if the Nerrazzuri score first. And let's not forget what happened the last time the Champions League final was held in Istanbul; Liverpool stunned the football world by fighting back from 3-0 down to beat Carlo Ancelotti's great AC Milan team in 2005, so maybe Inter can use that as a motivation and hope they can achieve their own Miracle of Istanbul.  Laurens: There is no way City are letting this one go. They would have learned a lot from the defeat against Chelsea two years ago, they are a better team, and they have momentum and confidence. I expect a tough game against a low Inter block but a moment of magic from De Bruyne, Haaland or Bernardo Silva will win it 1-0 for City.

Beyond its delightful aroma and use in culinary creations, cinnamon possesses remarkable properties that can transform your hair. In this article, we'll explore how cinnamon promotes hair growth, strengthens follicles, and provides that coveted volume. Get ready to unlock the potential of cinnamon and enjoy a head of stunning, healthy locks.  Benefits of Cinnamon For Hair  Here are the benefits of cinnamon for hair.  1. Stimulates Hair Growth  Cinnamon is rich in antioxidants, which help stimulate blood circulation in the scalp. Improved blood flow means better nourishment for hair follicles, promoting hair growth. Additionally, cinnamon is packed with vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin E and iron, which are essential for healthy hair growth. Incorporating cinnamon into your hair care routine can help revitalize dormant follicles and encourage the growth of stronger, thicker hair.  2. Strengthens Hair Follicles  Cinnamon possesses antibacterial and antifungal properties that can combat scalp infections, dandruff, and other issues that hinder hair growth. By maintaining a healthy scalp environment, cinnamon helps strengthen hair follicles, reducing breakage and promoting overall hair health. Stronger follicles translate to less hair loss and the potential for fuller, thicker hair.  3. Adds Volume to Hair  If you're seeking voluminous locks, cinnamon can be your secret weapon. When applied to the scalp, cinnamon helps unclog hair follicles and stimulates hair shafts, resulting in increased volume. The improved blood circulation nourishes the hair roots, making them more resilient and less prone to damage. Regular use of cinnamon-infused hair treatments can give your hair a natural lift, adding body and fullness.  DIY Cinnamon Hair Treatments  Incorporating cinnamon into your hair care routine is simple and can be done with readily available ingredients. Here are a few DIY treatments to try:  Cinnamon Hair Mask: Mix two tablespoons of cinnamon powder with equal parts honey and olive oil. Apply the mixture to your scalp and hair, massaging gently. Leave it on for 30 minutes before rinsing thoroughly. This mask helps stimulate hair growth, strengthens follicles, and adds shine.  Cinnamon Hair Rinse: Brew a strong cup of cinnamon tea by steeping cinnamon sticks in boiling water. After shampooing, pour the cooled cinnamon tea over your hair as a final rinse. This rinse enhances hair texture, improves scalp health, and adds a subtle cinnamon scent.  Cinnamon Oil Scalp Massage: Dilute a few drops of cinnamon essential oil with a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil. Gently massage the mixture into your scalp in circular motions for a few minutes. This massage promotes blood circulation, nourishes the scalp, and encourages hair growth.  Precautions and Tips  While cinnamon offers numerous benefits for hair, it's important to exercise caution when using it. Cinnamon can be potent and may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. Always perform a patch test before using cinnamon on your scalp or hair. If any adverse reactions occur, discontinue use immediately. Additionally, consult with a healthcare professional if you have any underlying scalp conditions or allergies.  Cinnamon truly is a miracle ingredient for achieving luscious, thicker hair. Its ability to stimulate hair growth, strengthen follicles, and add volume is unparalleled.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbm93bmV3cy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvdy10by11c2UtY2lubmFtb24tZm9yLWhhaXItZ3Jvd3RoLWFuZC10aGlja2VyLWhhaXItYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDAzNDE4NTLSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ob3ctdG8tdXNlLWNpbm5hbW9uLWZvci1oYWlyLWdyb3d0aC1hbmQtdGhpY2tlci1oYWlyLWFydGljbGUtMTAwMzQxODUyL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

BUT, YOU KNO  Advertisement WATCH: Bardstown home security cameras capture 4 cars stolen in mere minutes Police say a group of teens believed to be from Louisville started their crime spree in Mount Washington before ending up in Bardstown. Share Copy Link Copy  Home security cameras captured chaos early Thursday morning on Bardstown's Edgewood Drive. A group of young people believed to be from Louisville ran from car to car, hoping to get in and drive off. Ultimately, the group got away with four cars.Bardstown Police Chief Kim Kraeszig said crimes of opportunities like that have spiked in recent months.""Everytime they come out here, they're leaving with valuable items, whether it be guns left in cars or the vehicle. So, they come out and it’s a win-win for them,"" Kraeszig said.Jason Miracle, who lives on Edgewood Drive, had two cars taken, a Ford Taurus and Ford Expedition. They were parked in his driveway, and he says they were locked with the keys safely inside his house.He's unsure how they were stolen but thinks the group had a 'jammer' because his ring cameras didn't capture the thefts until the cars were driving off around 2:15 a.m. Thursday morning. And, Miracle said, that was after they traded out cars.""They stole one guy's car down the road, drove it up three blocks and then got in mine. So he got his back and they got mine,"" he said.Thanks to one very observant neighbor who called 911, police were in the neighborhood not long after that crime spree began. And they were able to follow two of those cars to the downtown area until it became unsafe, and that’s when the decision was made to back off.""These individuals blacked out their vehicles, turned off all their lights and took off at a high rate of speed so we don't ever want to put any innocent lives in danger,"" Kraeszig said.The suspects ultimately got away. While they were driving two of Miracle's cars, he says he has not lost all hope they'll be found.""The police seem to think so, but what kind of shape they’re in? Who knows, but fingers crossed,"" Miracle said.So far, one of the cars stolen has been recovered in Louisville's Portland neighborhood.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndsa3kuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmFyZHN0b3duLWhvbWUtc2VjdXJpdHktY2FtZXJhcy1jYXJzLXN0b2xlbi1sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlLzQzOTM0Mjk30gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xreS5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvYmFyZHN0b3duLWhvbWUtc2VjdXJpdHktY2FtZXJhcy1jYXJzLXN0b2xlbi1sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlLzQzOTM0Mjk3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo: David Van Der Sandt / Gallo Images)  The Blitzboks head into the final league of the Sevens World Series this weekend in London needing a couple of results to go their way in order to automatically qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympic games.  After a season of consecutive uncharacteristic lowly finishes — which only includes two podium finishes — the Springbok Sevens need to pick themselves up and clinch only their second gold medal of the season in order to have a chance of securing a place in the quadrennial event next year.  “Talk of Olympic qualification has been somewhat of an elephant in the room lately, as it’s been a goal of ours all season long,” said forward James Murphy from London.  “Some things have gone our way and others not, some of it due to our own mistakes and also because of outside reasons, but we are not going to point fingers, as the results only say ‘Springbok Sevens’ and as players, we have to take responsibility for those results.”  The Springboks finished tied for seventh place in Toulouse at the penultimate Sevens leg which made their quest for Olympic qualification even tougher.  “We didn’t do ourselves any favours in Toulouse last weekend, but our focus now is on doing the best we can this weekend, as we’ve got the capabilities. We will do our very best to finish first or as close to first as possible, as we don’t want to rely on favours from other teams,” added Murphy.  “Automatic qualification is certainly not over, and we will give everything we’ve got this weekend. But we can’t focus too much on the other teams, as that could lead to us falling — a bit like a game of chess.  “The better we do, the fewer favours we’ll need and that is why we’ve got a ‘no excuse’ mindset this week as we aim to finish as high as possible. If we can win, the rest will look after itself.”  Parameters  Sevens World Series champions New Zealand along with Argentina and Fiji have already booked their flights to Paris next year through their placings on the overall season standings. While France are also guaranteed a spot as hosts.  That leaves one last spot vacant for automatic Olympic qualification. Last season’s Sevens Series champions, Australia, are in pole position to grab the spot as they currently sit fifth in the standings with 125 points.  They are, however, being hotly pursued by Samoa and South Africa who have both accumulated 116 points.  A first-place finish in London will give South Africa an additional 22 points and take them to 138 overall for the season. But even in that scenario, the Blitzboks would need Australia to finish sixth place or lower in London to drop below them on the standings.  “I also think it will be good for our confidence going into next season if we can go all the way and win this tournament, and hopefully qualify for the Olympic Games as well,” said hulking forward Impi Visser.  “It’s a big ask, but we are capable of doing it, so we’re looking forward to finishing the season on a strong note.”  To add an additional layer of intrigue to this weekend’s fixtures, Samoa and Australia have been drawn in the same pool this weekend alongside France and Spain.  Big-hitters France and Samoa beating Australia in the pool stages and knocking them out before the quarter-final stages of the London Sevens will help quell South Africa’s qualification anxieties early.  Seeking improvement  The Blitzboks, however, have to hit their straps throughout the final Sevens leg to give themselves the best chance of claiming their second Sevens Series title of the season — after bringing home gold in Dubai in December last year.  That will start during the pool stage where South Africa will face champions New Zealand, Great Britain and USA.  Last weekend, the Blitzboks faltered at their first hurdle during the pool stages, losing 31-7 to hosts France.  “Looking back, we let ourselves down in some of those games, and we have to ensure we are 100% focused 100% of the time,” said Murphy.  “This weekend, we can rectify the mistakes, such as a few restarts that didn’t work out, or missing some soft tackles. We are pulling tight as a group and our focus is on that first game against Great Britain.  “Only if we get through that game, we’ll look at the USA and then New Zealand, the benchmark and best team in the world at the moment. But there is no such thing as an easy game on the World Series and we will have to fire from the word go.” DM  Blitzboks fixtures – Saturday, 20 May (South African time)  12h07: SA vs Great Britain  15h15: SA vs USA  19h33: SA vs New Zealand","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWF2ZXJpY2suY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLTA1LTE4LWJsaXR6Ym9rcy1ob3BpbmctZm9yLWEtbWlyYWNsZS1pbi1maW5hbC13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMtbGVnLWluLWxvbmRvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2015-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Hume"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:25:11","Hume on Miracles  ST 4143 Miracles 3: David Hume versus Donghwi Kim  Don’t believe that any miracles have ever occurred! And, for God’s sake, don’t believe that miracles prove the existence of God! That’s the message of David Hume on miracles.  For more than two and a half centuries, Hume on miracles has been less welcome at a theologians’ barbecue than an invasion of blood-drinking mosquitoes. Hume’s predacious sting to miracle accounts simultaneously infects both miracles and the entire body of our religious thought. Can the theologian be protected by a philosophical form of DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide)? Is there a Hume repellent?  Yes. Let me introduce you to Donghwi Kim. I write this while reading Mr. Kim’s dissertation, Miracles Reconsidered: A Fresh Assessment from Philosophy, Science, and Theology. On May 17, 2023 Donghwi passed his oral defense. Mister Donghwi Kim is on the cusp of becoming Doctor Donghwi Kim.  In this and some future Patheos posts I plan to expand on Kim’s research and reflection.  Hume on Miracles  But first, Hume on miracles.  David Hume (1711-1776) defines a miracle as “a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent” (Hume 1748, X.90).[1]  Hume accepted as dogma the worldview derived from Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727). This is the mechanistic worldview in which the laws of nature function like gears in a Swiss watch. It’s the clockwork universe. There is no room in the clockwork for an extra gear or an unpredictable movement. There is no gap within which God can intervene with a miracle.  With Newton’s clockwork worldview and this definition of a miracle as premises, Hume proceeds to argue that miracles do not exist.  Why? Because no events transgress a law of nature. How do we know that no events transgress a law of nature? Because we have experienced nature as consistently regular and uniform. We have induced by reason that the clockwork universe is regular and uniform.  The determined clockwork universe is hypothesized on the basis of our past experience with nature’s regularity. Therefore, says Hume, any new experience with an irregular event must be rejected. Is this sound reasoning?  No. At least not according to evangelical Patheos columnist Jeremy Neil in “Do Miracles happen? Really?”  “In particular, to assemble evidence that miracles are highly improbable things is not to demonstrate that miracles do not occur! It is simply to demonstrate that they are highly improbable. To try to leap to the next argumentative level and, on the basis of the assertion that miracles are improbable, to say that miracles must (1) not ever occur, or (2) ought never to be believed by prudent persons, strikes me as being too aggressive with the argument’s conclusions.”  Hume’s shadow in recent centures has obnubilated New Testament studies because the marjority of scholars assume prior to investigation that Jesus’ miracles could not be historical. Jesus’ miracles could not be historical because they break a law of nature. And, we know at the level of assumption that no historical event breaks a law of nature. This is a nice tidy assumption that predetermines historical investigation before it starts.  Hume’s First Fallacy: Begging the Question  Let’s look at this again. Hume’s main argument concerning miracles is that miracles–by definition–are singular events that deviate from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws, we know, are codified as a result of past experiences. On the basis of past uniform experience, then, Hume says, “we readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree” (Hume 1748, X.93). The uniformity of experience establishes the uniformity of nature, he contends.  Might there be a fallacy operative here? How about the fallacy of begging the question? This fallacy is also known by other names such as petitio principii, arguing in a circle, and assuming the consequent. Here’s how it appears in Hume’s treatment of miracles.  Hume assumes that common sense experience tells us correctly that the laws of nature are ordinary, uniform, and consistent. The laws of nature never go on a holiday, so to speak. When then, one perceives a miraculous event that differs from the laws of nature, one must dub this a delusion, a misinterpretation, or a lie told by overzealous religious believers.  What Hume assumes is what Hume concludes. This is the fallacy of arguing in a circle, of begging the question.[2]  Hume’s Second Fallacy: Argumentum ad Hominem (abusive)  Hume engages—hilariously, in my opinion–in another fallacy, namely, argumentum ad hominem (abusive). This fallacy is committed when one attacks the intelligence, character, motive, ethnicity, or some other such attribute of one’s opponent. In his denial of miracles, Hume argues that those who believe in miracles are ignorant, uneducated, and certainly uncivilized.[3]  “We cannot trust testimonies of witnesses to miracles? Why, because such testimonies do not come from a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good-sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others” (Hume 1748, X.92).  Or,  “It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them, that people will be found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors, who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend received opinions“ (Hume 1748, X.94)[4]  Hume’s argument seems to beg the question again: those who deny miracles are more trustworthy than those who affirm miracles. And, of course, only trustworthy people are to be trusted. That’s a slam dunk argument, right!  Donghwi Kim’s Response to Hume on Miracles  Donghwi Kim summarizes Hume on miracles.  “Hume’s argument is two-pronged: (1) a general a priori argument that miracles are not scientifically possible, since they are by definition violations of the laws of nature and are absurd in themselves, and then (2) [an] a posteriori argument concerning the type of testimony provided on behalf of miracle claims” by premodern ignorant religious people (Kim 2023, 125).  I tried to show above that each of these two prongs entails fallacious reasoning. But something more important is worthy of mention. As Kim points out, Hume never explicitly demonstrates that miracles are impossible. The uniformity of nature Hume affirmed is based on induction from our experience of uniformity. This uniformitarian worldview is not a conclusion drawn from empirical science. In principle, then, a new experience with a miraculous event could worm its way into the uniformitarian worldview Hume presupposes.  From the Laws of Nature to Unique Historical Events  Every historical event is unique. Every law of nature, in contrast, describes regularities in the form of general principles. One cannot deduce a unique historical event from such general principles.  Hume puts a noose around his own logical neck by inducing his laws of nature from the cumulative human experience with unique and unrepeatable events in history. Kim stresses that miracles are unique and unrepeatable events belonging to human experience. So, miracles should count inductively in Hume’s construction of our worldview.  “In his logic on the implausibility of miracles, in my judgment, Hume clearly confuses matters of science with matters of history in the sense that he seems to treat the probability of events in history, like the miraculous, in the same way he treats the probability of repeated events described through scientific laws. In other words, Hume could be charged with contending from a category mistake (Kim 2023, 131).  The categories that Hume confuses are natural law, on the one hand, and historical event, on the other.  In blunt form, instead of studying the actual history of miracle claims, Hume makes an a priori assumption that miracles cannot occur. “In tracing the historicity of Jesus’ mirackes, the a priori assumptin that the reported miracles are impossible is a philosophically or culturally imposed premise”(Kim, 291), Kim observes. “Therefore, it is necessary to abandon such prejudices and follow reliable historical evidence”(Kim, 292).  Hume’s Third Fallacy: Misplaced Concreteness  I would cite Alfred North Whitehead here. Hume has committed the fallacy of misplaced concreteness (Whitehead 1929, 1978, 7-8). This fallacy is committed when we confuse what is abstract with the concrete experience that gave rise to the abstraction in the first place.  What is concrete, in Hume’s argument, are our unique and unrepeatable historical experiences. We then induce from the uniformity of some experiences the laws of nature, we then imagine abstractly nature’s processes to be uniform, regular, and universal. What’s concrete here is our experience. What’s abstract is our formulation of natural laws. The latter dare not trump the former without committing a fallacy. I simply add this to Kim’s critical analysis of Hume.  Donghwi’s Conclusion  Here is Donghwi’s conclusion regarding Hume on miracles.  “I conclude, therefore, that Hume’s principle would demand that a researcher say that an alleged miracle event never occurred, based upon unproven, circular, and a priori judgment, and other claims which are untenable….In other words, there is no legitimate reaons to exclude the feasibility of miracle claims on the basis of scientific ‘in principle’ objections” (Kim 2023, 132-133)  Here is the alternative definition of miracle that Kim offers us.  A miracle “is a unique occurrence that happens due to divine will, which is a temporary and inexplicable exceptionto the ordinary course of nature for the purpose of showing that God has acted in history and nature”(Kim, 2023, 432).  Ted’s Conclusion  In sum, the almost Doctor Kim and I have pointed out numerous fallacies committed by Hume on miracles. But Hume’s fallacies are by no means a vaccination that will protect us from infection by the skeptic’s virus. David Hume’s reliance on a uniformitarian worldview still threatens religious belief in general and miracles in particular. We must face the proposition that the physical world is a closed causal nexus with no gaps within which God can elbow in providential care.  “A miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a system of religion,” touts Hume (Hume 1748, X.99). If the Christian faith is founded on one or more miracles, Hume’s challenge remains.  Here’s where we have been and where we are going.  Patheos ST 4141 How to see a miracle?

Watch for his new 2023 book, The Voice of Public Theology, published by ATF Press.  ▓  Notes  [1] Do theologians define miracle the same way philosopher Hume does? No sireee! At least according to evangelical Patheos columnist Roger Olson . “It is my considered, scholarly opinion, as a historian of Christian theology, that very few modern Christian theologians—whether liberal or conservative—would define ‘miracle’ as a violation of the laws of nature. But our best attempts to explain miracle otherwise have mostly fallen on deaf ears.” How should we theologians think? “My point is that the generally-agreed-on worldview of especially modern Christian theologians is not deistic and excludes any idea of God outside of nature such that in order to do something unusual within it he has to violate”natural laws.”  [2] Kim cites both G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis here. Chesterton likens reasoning in a circle to a silly dog chasing its own tail (Chesterton 1925,1955, 135-136). According to Lewis, “Now of course we must agree with Hume…if there is absolutely ‘uniform experience’ against miracles….Unfortunately we know the experience against [miracles] to be uniform only if we know that all the reports of them [miracles] are false. And we can know all the reports to be false only if we know already that miracles have never occurred. In fact, we are arguing in a circle” (Lewis, Miracles 2015, 162).  [3] Only premodern ignorant people believe in miracles. Modern educated intellectuals have discarded both miracles and religion. At least according to atheist Richard Dawkins. “The nineteenth century is the last time when it was possible for an educated person to admit to believing in miracles like the virgin birth without embarrassment…it embarrasses [educated Christians] because their rational minds know that it is absurd, so they would much rather not be asked” (Dawkins 2006, 187).

"miracle","2019-05-03","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:10:19","Carlo Ancelotti's side were hammered 4-0 by Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, with Pep Guardiola's side earning revenge for last season's defeat by Los Blancos at the same stage.  This time the second leg was not at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid produced a string of astonishing moments to overcome Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and City on the way to winning last season's competition.  Madrid, who have won five of the last nine Champions Leagues, have grown used to pulling off spectacular and sometimes inexplicable comebacks in Europe.  Even when Madrid have been outplayed, they have clung on by their fingertips and found a way through. Many across the continent thought it was about time for that to change. However, the way the match began seemed to set things up for another Madrid survival masterclass.  Guardiola's City dominated, just as they did last week at the Bernabeu in the 1-1 first leg draw, before Vinicius Junior sucker-punched the English side on the counter. At the Etihad, Erling Haaland was foiled twice by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the second of which was a brilliant, bewildering save.  Different story  However, unlike in the first leg, Bernardo Silva broke free of Eduardo Camavinga's shackles and was decisive. The Portuguese midfielder struck twice, leaving Madrid with an uphill struggle - although they have come back from those before. Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos hit the crossbar with a rocket from distance.  ""On this occasion things didn't go our way like they did last year,"" lamented Courtois, referring to the German's piledriver. Last season Rodrygo Goes struck two late goals in less than two minutes to force the second leg to extra-time, and Madrid improved after the break, with a comeback still not off the table.  However, City eventually stepped up another gear to whisk the game away from Madrid, scraping around for another moment of inspiration but finding the cupboard bare.  Eder Militao deflected Manuel Akanji's header into his own net for City's third and Julian Alvaraz rolled the fourth past Courtois to wrap up their emphatic victory.  ""Evaluating what happened in this moment what happened makes no sense to me. It's a defeat that hurts but sometimes it can happen in football, in the Champions League semi-final against a strong opponent that played better than you,"" Ancelotti told 'Movistar'.  The Italian coach said he was planning on seeing out the last year of his contract, which expires in June 2024. Madrid's board and president Florentino Perez have backed Ancelotti staying over the past couple of weeks, at least in public, but his future will inevitably be debated during the weeks ahead.  When Madrid's magical concoction of individual skill, never-say-die spirit and luck runs out, questions get asked. Perez may wonder if Madrid need something more tangible than miracles next season.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc29jY2VyLmNvbS9uZXcvbWFkcmlkLXMtbWlyYWNsZS13ZWxsLXJ1bnMtZHJ5LWF0LWV0aWhhZC0xMjU0NDA10gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzb2NjZXIuY29tL25ldy9hbXAvbWFkcmlkLXMtbWlyYWNsZS13ZWxsLXJ1bnMtZHJ5LWF0LWV0aWhhZC0xMjU0NDA1?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Following the success of their sell-out viral Miracle Cream, Revolution Pro has just announced the launch of their new £8 Miracle Balm which is an all-in-one protectant balm that instantly moisturises, smooths and hydrates dry and chapped skin as well as providing protection from future irritation and dryness.  The multi-tasking supercharged skincare balm calms skin from the first use and can be used on the face, lips, neck, hair, and cuticles. It can even be applied to the cheek bones for a natural dewy finish.  Elizabeth Arden 8hr cream dupe Revolution Pro Miracle Balm - £6.40 (was £8) An all-in-one protectant balm that instantly moisturises, smooths and hydrates dry and chapped skin while providing protection from future irritation and dryness. It can be used on the face, lips, neck, hair, and cuticles, and even to the cheek bones for a natural dewy finish. From £ 6.40 ASOS Buy now  It’s infused with a calming, subtle Rose aroma and enriched with skin-loving Vitamin E which hydrates and protects the skin.  Shoppers are already calling the new Miracle Blam a dupe for the renowned Elizabeth Arden 8 hour Cream which costs significantly more, priced at £29.  The Revolution dupe is even on sale right now on ASOS for just £6.40 - so it's the perfect opportunity to snap it up for even less!  The balm has already racked up plenty of five-star reviews on the Revolution website, with one delighted customer saying: “This balm is great. I've used it on my lips and cheeks during the day, on my feet and hands overnight and on my face. It's on par with Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream but the tube looks more stylish and the price is a lot more reasonable. This is a product I'll be buying regularly.”  A second shopper added: “I usually use a much more expensive balm (8 hour cream) but thought I’d give this a try. I’m impressed! It works well on dry or sensitive areas of the face and body. A little goes a long way. It has a light scent which doesn’t overpower. It is also much cheaper than my usual balm. I’ll definitely be buying again.”  While a third, calling it a ‘one product wonder,’ continued: “As with the whole miracle range I now won't be without this. I use it as an overnight face mask and I am now so happy with my skin I have even stopped wearing foundation. I also have very curly hair and a smidge of this works wonders for frizz! What a product indeed.”  For best results, warm a small amount of product in between fingers and gently apply to areas of concern for instant skin relief and protection.  You can pick up the Miracle Balm for just £8 here or it's even on sale right now on ASOS for just £6.40 - but like all products within the Miracle range, we expect it to be another sell-out product, so don’t wait around.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy1kZWFscy9zaG9wcGVycy1zd2FwLWVsaXphYmV0aC1hcmRlbi04LTMwMDEzNzgw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L3Nob3BwaW5nLWRlYWxzL3Nob3BwZXJzLXN3YXAtZWxpemFiZXRoLWFyZGVuLTgtMzAwMTM3ODAuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2017-07-16","Not Discerned","{""ColoradoSprings"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:37:06","There are many skeptics that say testimonies of healing in Christian crusades are a farce.  Then there are Christians that say that God’s healing power was only for biblical times and does not happen in the modern world.  Evangelist Mario Murillo says that, since his ministry is flooded with reports of miraculous healings, it “starts to become background noise and we tend to lose our sense of credibility of what people say.”  Here are two incredible healing testimonies, Murillo told Charisma News’ John Matarazzo, that are simply undeniable.  It all begins with a man named Steve, who attended one of Murillo’s tent crusades in Colorado Springs, Colorado, last July. According to Steve, he lived in a house, alone, for seven years, and he refused to venture out into the public because, as Murillo said, “he lived on a level of pain that few human beings can understand.”  Steve took several medications every day to deal with the pain of five ruptured discs in his spine.  “There he was, not a Christian, lost, with no hope and in darkness,” Murillo said.  Some friends brought Steve to the Murillo crusade and Steve became annoyed. Not because it was painful for him to sit, but because thought he was coming to a concert and not a Christian event.  “He was perturbed; a lot of anxiety about it,” Murillo said. And Murillo wanted to make it clear that the following was all God, and he had nothing to do even with the opportunity for Steve’s healing.  “I’m in the pulpit, and I point to the back,” Murillo said. “I said right there is a man whose spine is being healed. And at that moment, Steve felt these fingers—and these vertebrae go back into place. Seven years of indescribable pain was gone in an instant.  “And it scared him! He stood up and he ran to the front to be saved. And he was dramatically converted. He went from being a house-bound pain victim to when every single time the doors opened at Radiant Church in Colorado Springs, he’s there. He’s always there. He’s the first one to arrive and the last one to leave.”  The second miraculous testimony comes about a woman named Bri. Murillo says that she had parasites in her stomach. The medication doctors gave her to deal with these parasites started an “autoimmune war in her body where it began to cannibalize itself.”  Murillo says the autoimmune activity affected Bri’s motor skills. It wiped out her energy, and she, a woman 5-feet-9 inches in stature, became helpless as her weight plummeted to 94 pounds.  “When they brought her to the front, they carried her and she’s on her knees,” Murillo says. “But again, her motor skills, her inability to really coordinate … she looked like a skeleton. And she’s in front of the tower of speakers on my left.  “All of a sudden, the power of God came on me and said, ‘Go over there and I’ll be glorified.’ I prayed for her. She knew in that moment that God had touched her. She understood it.  “Within the next few weeks, she could eat whatever she wanted, had no pain, no weakness, her motor skills were restored and she gained 30 pounds. She’s absolutely a walking, talking miracle nearly a year later. We just had her testify a few weeks ago. Those are two of the many things that happened in Colorado Springs, and that’s why we’re going back.”  Murillo says he and his team will return to Colorado Springs for another tent crusade from July 16-19. Catherine Mullins will lead worship at the event.  “It’s going to be a remarkable … we are already flooding the city with workers,” Murillo says. “And we’re going to see miracles.”  If it is anything like the ones Colorado Springs has seen in the past, the enemy better be prepared, because the Holy Spirit is getting ready to do His mighty work once again and destroy satan’s plans. {eoa}  Shawn A.

Example video title will go here for this video  CYPRESS, Texas — If you're looking for a lesson in courage, look no further than the Green-Wright family.  Last year on September 12, Zoe Moody, 16, and her friend were on their way to the Bridgeland High School Homecoming Parade when they crashed on the Grand Parkway in Cypress. Zoe had been nominated to be a homecoming princess and was supposed to ride on a float.  ""It's always hard,"" she said. ""Like move my hands, and that’s a trip for me and talking in general. That’s a trip for me.”  It's been a long road to recovery for Zoe.  ""She's a miracle,"" her mom, Scarlett Green-Wright, said. ""There's a reason why she's here.""  That night, the car she was riding in rolled several times and she was ejected.  “I don’t remember the crash at all. That’s why I’m able to fall asleep in the car when I get in the car,” Zoe said.  She was put into a medically-induced coma for 40 days due to swelling in her brain and spent the next two months in the hospital before coming home.  “It’s been a journey, for sure, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs,"" her mom said.  There's been setbacks, but also lots of little victories.  “We celebrated when she would chew ice, we celebrated when she opened her eyes, we celebrated when she didn’t have to eat with a feeding tube,"" her mom said.  Zoe returned to high school in April, going to classes three days a week. Her days now start early.    ""We get up at 5:30 in the morning and we stretch her, because all of her legs, arms, all that good stuff has to be stretched in the morning,"" her mom said.  However slow it may seem at times, Zoe is making progress. Life is unquestionably different for everyone, but no one ever lost hope.  “I think you just take it day by day and focus on what you have right here and right now, be thankful for what you have,"" her mom said. ""A lot of the things I was worried about didn’t end up happening.  ""She believed she could so she did, that’s my motto,” Zoe said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raG91LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY3lwcmVzcy10ZWVuLXJvbGxvdmVyLWNyYXNoLXJlY292ZXJ5LWhvbWVjb21pbmcvMjg1LTMxZTU1ZjIzLWI1NzgtNGEwZi1hZjllLTYwODU1MzJiOGRhYtIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raG91LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2N5cHJlc3MtdGVlbi1yb2xsb3Zlci1jcmFzaC1yZWNvdmVyeS1ob21lY29taW5nLzI4NS0zMWU1NWYyMy1iNTc4LTRhMGYtYWY5ZS02MDg1NTMyYjhkYWI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hood, an award-winning 80-year-old writer, doesn't use the word 'miracle' herself – ""there are so many crackpots around"" – but admits her story is pretty extraordinary.  Photo: PETER MCINTOSH / Otago Daily Times  In 2011, the eye disease glaucoma stripped Hood of the ability to read and write. Twelve years later, she tells Jesse Mulligan how a placebo treatment administered in a chronic pain trial has restored her eyesight.  Visual impairment from the ""fairly rare"" form of glaucoma Hood was eventually diagnosed with came on quite quickly, Hood says.  ""I was reading in bed and my left eye went blurry. I thought 'oh, time to put the light out' and in the morning it was still blurry and something had happened.  ""[Once glaucoma was diagnosed] the expectation was that it would never get any better and they would just try and make sure it didn't get worse too fast.""  Eventually, the effects of glaucoma forced Hood to stop writing and only allowed her to read very, very slowly.  Still struggling with pain from a pelvis fracture caused by a 2020 fall, earlier this year Hood signed up for a trial of chronic pain treatments at the University of Otago.  ""You sat in a chair in the neurology research section with a thing like a bathing cap on your head full of electrodes, five days a week for four weeks for half an hour each time.""  Until the trial was completed, Hood did not know whether she was in the test group - who received electrical stimulation into the brain - or the placebo group who had the electrical current passed across their scalp. It was the latter.  ""The beauty of all these wonderful people in neurology at Otago is they've got such flash equipment. They could look at my brain and what had happened and during the [electrical stimulation] process the part of my brain that turns electric signals from my eyes into words and pictures and colours had got very excited.  ""What appears to have happened was the current went into my eyes and the cells in my retina went 'hey guys' and sent all these messages down to my brain to make words and pictures and colours.""  With her colour vision previously ""crap"", Hood now enjoys visiting the Dunedin Public Art Gallery and of course has already returned to reading and writing.  Dr Divya Adhia's research team is now designing another study - to run alongside the chronic pain study - which will investigate what happened to Lynley Hood and how electrical stimulation could be used to improve low vision for other people.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ybnouY28ubnovbmF0aW9uYWwvcHJvZ3JhbW1lcy9hZnRlcm5vb25zL2F1ZGlvLzIwMTg4OTA4ODcvdGhlLWFjY2lkZW50YWwtbWlyYWNsZS10aGF0LXJlc3RvcmVkLXNpZ2h0LXRvLWR1bmVkaW4td3JpdGVyLWx5bmxleS1ob29k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The LYMA Laser claims to be the world’s first medical-grade at-home laser device.

An at-home skincare solution beloved by A-list stars including Kim Kardashian (pictured) is winning rave reviews.

And it promises results in as little as 12 weeks.  Unlike many lasers, LYMA Laser has two lights.  The first is a blue LED light that aims to help eliminate bacteria that causes breakouts on the skin’s upper layers.  The second is a single “cold” laser that penetrates the skin’s deeper layers to repair signs of sun damage, pigmentation, and ageing at a cellular level.

And it doesn’t cause any harmful cell damage in the process, meaning there is no downtime and it’s suitable for all skin types.  Since the device launched in 2020, it has repeatedly sold out and been labelled the “at home skincare product of the decade”.

So, big thank you to LYMA for guiding me on the usage”.  Another added: “I’ve been using the LYMA Laser for about two months now. I am so pleased with the results I’m seeing on cystic acne and scarring! It is the only thing that has ever helped”.  Others have shared incredible before and after pictures showing just how well - and how quickly - the laser has worked, with some describing it as a “miracle buy”.  Gwyneth Paltrow is one of a host of fans. Credit: Instagram/Lyma Life  LYMA Laser is proud of the fact it is the only laser that works on people with darker skin tones, who have previously had to stay away from laser treatments due to increased risk of scarring.  The nifty laser can also be used to reduce redness and inflammation, fade bruising, and reduce the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks.  For the first three months, LYMA recommends you use it every night.  After this, you can go down to a couple of times a week to maintain your results.

In order for Sentinels to break into the VCT postseason, the team must cheer for three upsets to occur over the course of this weekend, starting with an Evil Geniuses victory over NRG. EG currently sits in fifth place with a 4-4 record, while NRG is in third, ahead of EG by a full series and two more map wins.  In order for @Sentinels to earn a spot for the #VCTAmericas playoffs, we have to see three upsets this week.    EG wins vs. NRG  LEV wins vs. LOUD  MIBR wins vs. 100T — VALORANT Esports NA (@valesports_na) May 18, 2023  The next upset victory needed might be one of the most unlikely ones of the weekend, with Sentinels cheering for Leviatán against the top squad of the split in LOUD. With a 14-7 map record and a single series loss, LOUD has established itself as a true championship contender. LEV, on the other hand, is coming off of a lopsided 2-0 loss to Cloud9 and has tumbled down the ladder recently, sitting in sixth place just above Sentinels and barely in the playoff picture themselves.  Related: Coach Kaplan on Sentinels’ VALORANT comms: ‘It went from a want to a need for players to step up and have a voice’  Lastly, Sentinels fans will be rooting for MIBR as they collide with 100 Thieves in the final matchup to watch this weekend. If this ninth-placed roster can pull together a series win to stop the Heist, then Sentinels’ miracle run will be complete, and one of North America’s most popular teams will have broken into the playoff picture.  This season has been a roller coaster for Sentinels fans after the roster struggled to find early success, on top of a handful of roster changes that made viewers doubtful of their postseason dreams.  But after some superheroic efforts from Zachary “zekken” Patrone and the return of Tyson “TenZ” Ngo, an incredible comeback story could be blossoming in front of our eyes—but only if they can get to the playoffs first.

(The Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart measures radio airplay on a select group of full-time dance stations, along with plays during mix shows on around 60 top 40-formatted reporters.)  Additionally on Dance/Mix Show Airplay, Steve Aoki, Galantis and Hayley Kiyoko bound 16-10 with “Hungry Heart,” the sixth, 10th and first top 10 for each respective act.  Shifting to the multi-metric Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, David Guetta, Anne-Marie and Coi Leray lock in top Streaming Gainer honors with “Baby Don’t Hurt Me” (5-4), after the song’s official video premiered May 5.

"miracle","2017-10-14","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 02:03:02","Yoon Hee Keun, commissioner general of the Korea National Police Agency    [Photo provided by Korea National Police Agency]  I recently visited the U.S. to meet with the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discuss comprehensive security cooperation, including action plans against cybercrime and terrorist threats. During the business trip, I visited the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. to express respect and gratitude to them. Many Americans watched me in police uniform raising my hand in salute. They might have wondered who I was and why an Asian showed this honor and respect for fallen American soldiers. In truth, I was contemplating why the U.S. government built the memorial for those who shed blood for another country in the middle of the capital and people continued visiting to remember fallen military veterans. Then I realized the “ethos of this society” that remembers and honors those who sacrificed themselves for the community.The American people are well aware that, though war veterans risked their lives on behalf of other countries, they simultaneously sacrificed for freedom and peace - the universal values of humankind. They are very conscious that “remembering and honoring” the fallen soldiers is the backbone to safeguard a peaceful daily life and future prosperity.All U.S. citizens know the value of reward for patriotism better than anyone, I believe, and that has enabled the country to be the world’s most dominant economic and military power. It is said that there is a strong belief among American soldiers and law enforcement officials that “if I dedicate my life for the community and my country, the people will remember me and take care of my family.”It is unique in every developed country, including the U.S., to go all out to remember and honor those who sacrificed themselves for the public good. The elements of the state are the population, territory and sovereignty. Reward for patriotism, in particular, can be a key factor that makes it possible to protect the territory and nation and exercise the sovereignty.There is a saying that “a nation that forgets its past has no future.” As a law enforcement officer, I would like to put that in this way, “if we don’t remember those who devoted themselves for our nation, there will be no peace and prosperity for the country.” In this respect, it is greatly encouraging to see the new veterans’ ministry, being upgraded to a cabinet-level body from its sub-ministry status.The police recently launched a campaign of “the miracle of 100 KRW.” It is a fund-raising campaign for the children of police officers who died in service. I personally hope that this will be an opportunity for the children losing a parent to feel our deep affection for them. Hopefully, they recognize that we are proud of their parents and will never forget the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation.This small but heartfelt action will bring hope and courage to the children of fallen heroes. It also serves as an opportunity for us to be proud of who we are. The idea that small but meaningful efforts can make a big difference has grabbed the attention of huge number of police officers.I floated this idea with a calculation that if all police officers across the country join the drive, I could raise and deliver roughly 13.85 million won ($10,600) per month to children who lost a parent, but I was wrong. The idea has brought us more than 40 million won ($30,000) in just two months since it began. It would help the children, particularly those having medical needs, to relieve the financial burden caused by the death of a parent.I reasonably call this campaign a small miracle for three reasons. First, this has driven 140,000 police officers together. Secondly, a salary statement showing the deducted 1000 won reminds us of their sacrifices. And last but not least, this small donation could give hope and courage to the children of fallen heroes. The inscription on the wall of the National Academy training FBI agents epitomizes the sentiment shared by us, law enforcement officials.“May we never forget.”(With 32 years of service, Yoon is the commissioner general of the Korea National Police Agency and has worked in various policing areas including the police administration and management, intelligence and public safety.)

Barca have a big advantage in the paint and seemed to learn from the last year's mistakes, which could be crucial in Friday's matchup.  Credit: Tolga Adanali/Euroleague Basketball via Getty Images  No Guerschon Yabusele, no Gabriel Deck, no Vincent Poirier. The frontcourt of Real Madrid is bleeding, and so are the chances of them moving forward.  Oh, but we are back to single-elimination format again, and if there's a team that might go on a crazy run to steal the game, look no further than Chus Mateo's squad. Partizan Belgrade fans could co-sign on this.  However, Barcelona look like a clear favorite here after sweeping Zalgiris Kaunas in the quarterfinals. Madrid, on the other hand, has many questions to answer.  Who is going to guard Nikola Mirotic? Should they double him, knowing that his primary defender will probably be lighter and not as strong as him? How to answer Barca's counters against Edy Tavares protecting the paint?  For Sarunas Jasikevicius, the key factors are clear. They must limit transition opportunities, solve Tavares' catches inside the paint & slow down Madrid's pick-and-rolls with Sergio Rodriguez, Sergio Llull, and Dzanan Musa.  Let's look at examples from the most recent El Classico's to understand how tomorrow's semifinal will shape up.  Stopping Nikola Mirotic  Everybody in Europe knows that post-ups are a huge part of Barcelona's offense. According to InStat play type data, in 14 head-to-head matchups during these two seasons, the Catalans used it on almost 12% of their possessions, while other teams against Madrid used it for only 6% of the time.

"miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 15:45:50","In the early hours of May 1, a light aircraft flying over the Amazon rainforest in Colombia issued a mayday alert over an engine failure before vanishing from radar systems.  Rescue teams later found the wreckage of the Cessna 206 and three adult bodies inside—including that of Ranoque Mucutuy. But Mucutuy’s four children, which included an 11-month-old baby—were missing. On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared some wonderful news.  “After arduous searching by our military, we have found alive the four children who went missing after a plane crash in Guaviare,” Petro tweeted, referring to the Colombian province where the aircraft went down. “A joy for the country.”  But local media reports soon contradicted the celebratory news. Defense sources told Colombia’s El Espectador newspaper that the three kids—aged 13, 11, and 4—and the baby had not been confirmed found.  On Thursday, Petro deleted his tweet and apologized, saying the initial information had “not been confirmed.” “I’m sorry about what happened,” he added. “The Military Forces and the indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for.  Earlier on Thursday, the country’s Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) issued a statement about the confusion, saying that it had received information from a contact that the children had “appeared alive and in good health,” according to El Espectador, but that soldiers involved in the search “have not been able to have contact with the children” due to weather conditions and difficulties operating in the search area.  An official confirmation of the children’s well-being has not yet been made as of Thursday morning. But local plane operator Avianline, which owned the downed Cessna, put out a statement saying it had received reports that the children had been found alive, according to the BBC.  Avianline said one of its pilots landed in Cachiporro near the crash site and was told by locals that they had been contacted by people in a place called Dumar where the children had been found. The company said it could not confirm the information’s accuracy but said it’s possible that the children had not yet been taken to Cachiporro by boat due to heavy rains making the river dangerous.  Indigenous radio stations have similarly reported that the children would be brought by river to Cachiporro after they had been found by a local.  Rescue efforts were stepped up on Wednesday after a search party discovered a shelter built with sticks and branches that indicated there could have been survivors.  Authorities also published photographs online showing a hair band and a pair of scissors that were found during the search, while a baby bottle and some partially eaten fruit were also discovered.  The family are from the Indigenous Huitoto people who live in Colombia’s southeast and the north of Peru. A message was reportedly played over the remote rainforest search area in the Huitoto language from a helicopter, in which the children’s grandmother instructed the kids not to attempt to move through the rainforest.  More than 100 soldiers have taken part in the rescue mission along with sniffer dogs. Military aircraft have also been deployed to assist the search teams on the ground moving through the dense jungle.  The crashed Cessna was carrying seven passengers on a flight between Araracuara, in Amazonas province, and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province. Along with the children’s mother, the body of the pilot and another adult were found in the doomed aircraft.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2NvbG9tYmlhLW15c3Rlcnktb3Zlci1taXJhY2xlLXJlc2N1ZS1vZi00LWtpZHMtaW4tZGVhZGx5LWFpci1jcmFzaC1pbi1hbWF6b27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And Thursday morning, National Honor Society students presented a $1,200 check to Children’s Miracle Network.

(WKRN) — God, gear, and training were credited for saving the lives of several deputies in Giles County after a standoff turned into a shootout Thursday morning.  “It’s a miracle… God’s on our side, and thank God for it,” Giles County Sheriff Kyle Helton said. “I know I have four deputies that could be hurt real bad right now or even could be fatal.”  The Giles County Sheriff’s Office first responded to the home on Fairview Road in Lynnville about an unwanted guest trespassing shortly before 1 a.m. on Thursday, May 18. Helton said the man who later fired at deputies was the one who made the call.  “The person in custody had contacted about trespassers. He didn’t respond, so they left,” he explained. “And then they get called back a couple hours later about shots fired.”  When the deputies returned to the house around 2:30 a.m., officials said they safely removed the family members from the scene.  After hearing additional gunshots, authorities headed toward the house, which is when the barricaded man allegedly fired on them.  “Four of our deputies approached the house, and they’re the ones that took on the fire, the gunfire,” said Helton.  However, the department’s tactical gear stopped those bullets, allowing all four deputies to survive the incident, according to Helton.  “We had one deputy take a shot in the chest today, and his ballistic vest stopped it, and then another officer took on two rounds to his shield, and that stopped that,” Helton said.  Helton used a similar bulletproof vest to show News 2 where the first deputy, who was taken to a Pulaski hospital, was hit.  “I think it was just right in the chest area that the shot hit, and it’s a miracle,” he said.  At least one other deputy returned fire, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), but the man inside the house was not hit.  📧 Have breaking come to you: Subscribe to News 2 email alerts →  After the shootout, Helton said the deputies backed up and called the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) and its tactical unit to assist with the standoff, which ended when the man surrendered to authorities around 8 a.m.  “It brings things in perspective that what this is really about and the dangers behind it, and I praise our guys for the training that they do and the way they handle it,” the sheriff said. “By the grace of God, they are here today, and that’s the most important thing.”  The suspect is reportedly being housed in Maury County amid the TBI’s ongoing investigation into the deputy-involved shooting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndrcm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pdHMtYS1taXJhY2xlLWdpbGVzLWNvdW50eS1zaGVyaWZmLXByYWlzZXMtZ29kLWdlYXItYWZ0ZXItZGVwdXR5LXNob3QtZHVyaW5nLXN0YW5kb2ZmL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndrcm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pdHMtYS1taXJhY2xlLWdpbGVzLWNvdW50eS1zaGVyaWZmLXByYWlzZXMtZ29kLWdlYXItYWZ0ZXItZGVwdXR5LXNob3QtZHVyaW5nLXN0YW5kb2ZmL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:00:00","Getting to Tallahassee was enough of a prize.  Head Coach Chad Davis and the Cardinal Mooney High beach volleyball program (24-2) had already won one state title, from the Sunshine State Athletic Conference tournament, in April. Reaching the Florida High School Athletic Association state tournament, held May 12-13 in Tallahassee, would be a strong way to end the season; whatever happened after that was a bonus.  Not only because of the quality of the teams at the tournament, but because Davis knew three of his top players — seniors Madeline Carson, Gracie Page and Sawyer DeYoung — would not be available to play in the tournament because they would be at the school's graduation, walking the stage in their caps and gowns.  It's why Davis put such and emphasis on reaching the tournament at all: he wanted his seniors to go out with a win. The rest of the team will be back in 2024, with room to improve, so anything they did in Tallahassee would be experience for next season. Davis got what he wanted: with a hard-fought 3-2 win over Berkeley Prep (16-2), the Cougars were bound for the state tournament.  That's when things got interesting.  Mooney Coach Chad Davis said he's proud of the way his team rallied to reach the Final Four without three key players. Photo by Ryan Kohn  In a weekend Davis now calls ""The Miracle in the Sand,"" Mooney went to Tallahassee down three key players and took wins over Merritt Island High (4-1) and Bradenton Christian (3-2), the latter coming down to a final set win from freshmen pair Layla Larrick and Violet Weiser. The two wins put Mooney in the state final four, where the Cougars faced defending champion New Smyrna Beach High (28-0), who is ranked No. 2 in the country by MaxPreps as of May 16.  It took some maneuvering. With the seniors gone, Davis and his assistant coaches Derrick Duquette and Rick Fisher had to flip the team's pairings. Instead of breaking up the team's bottom three pairs, the coaches moved sophomore Ella Shuel into the top pairing alongside junior Helena Hebda, then created a brand-new second pair in sophomore Zoe Kirby and freshman Madi Robinson. The idea, Davis said, was that the team's bottom three pairings were so strong, they had an advantage over other teams with less depth. Moving members of those pairs into the top pairings would have only caused more inconsistency. The plan worked exactly as Davis hoped, especially against BCS; Davis said the team's bottom three pairs were ""incredible"" in the postseason.  Cardinal Mooney junior Helena Hebda was the team's most veteran player at the FHSAA state tournament. Photo by Ryan Kohn  Mooney, which is ranked No. 8 nationally, lost 3-1 to New Smyrna Beach, but Davis said he was blown away by the heart they showed. Mooney was the only team to take a game from the Barracudas in the postseason; New Smyrna repeated as champions with a 3-0 win over Westminster Christian (19-2) in the state title match.  ""It shows how close we really are,"" Davis said. ""It was a great season for the girls. To make it that far under the circumstances, it showed how strong the team was across the board. If most teams were put in that situation, there would be a 1% chance they would win any match. To make it to the final four and then take a pairing off basically the top team in the nation, it's unbelievable.""  Davis was speaking from vacation in California, a trip he said was much needed following the grind of indoor volleyball, travel volleyball and beach volleyball that has been happening since the beginning of the school year. To Davis, all three shades of the sport have equal value. Davis said he'd like to see beach volleyball continue to grow in popularity over the next few years, and one way to do that is by adding lights to the school's newly-constructed home courts. The project has not yet been approved by the school; Davis said he's still putting together the schematics. But if it is approved, Davis believes it is an addition that could happen relatively quickly, and one that would make a huge difference to the sport's perception in the community.  ""It would take this thing to a (NCAA) Division I level complex,"" Davis said. ""To have night games, to have more students out there and involved, to have double-headers. It just adds something. It has a totally different feel. It's super special.""  Davis said he was happy with the program's attendance figures in year one of the school's home courts, but because most of the team's games were played in the afternoon, it prevented many of the school's student-athletes from attending, as they were busy practicing their own sports. And after playing in a few matches under the lights in Tallahassee, Davis is more bullish about the possibilities than ever.  He's also excited about the talent that he'll have in 2024. While Carson, DeYoung and Page will be gone, junior Helena Hebda, who Davis called ""the best player in the area,"" will return. Also coming back are the pairings of sophomores Kate Montesano and Riley Greene, who lost just once during the season, and of sophomores Katie Powers and Izzy Russell, who lost just twice during the season.  ""We're going to be even better next season,"" Davis said. ""That's something to look forward to.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXJvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xOC9kZXNwaXRlLWxvc3MtY2FyZGluYWwtbW9vbmV5LWJlYWNoLXZvbGxleWJhbGwtZW5kcy1zZWFzb24td2l0aC1taXJhY2xlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-10-17","00:00:00","{""Akron"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:57:01","Strong and resilient: these two words encapsulate the mentality that MNUFC2 have demonstrated in the first eight games of the 2023 MLS NEXT Pro season. They’ve battled through seven road matches, scored 19 goals, and produced some incredibly entertaining games with their never-say-die attitude.  There’s no doubt that this group of young men is full of admirable examples, but one midfielder’s influence has taken center stage during the squad's second year of play.  With six goals and two assists in just eight games, Diogo Pacheco is leading his team in more ways than one. His play on the field has been clear for all to see, but it’s his intangible qualities that have proven to be the most invaluable to his team’s performance this season.  Players like Diogo aren’t developed in a day; they’re the product of years of commitment and dedication. He’s battled for this his whole life, whether that was on the pitch with his team or off the field facing a cancer diagnosis.  Growing up outside of Lisbon, Portugal, soccer was always a natural path for Pacheco. He began playing futsal at just six years old, earning a life changing call just a few years later.  “It was probably one of the best days of my life,” he said. “My dad got a call from Benfica saying they were interested in me and wanted me to come on trial for a week. When he told me, I started crying. I was so happy about it. Then two days later, Sporting [CP], another big team in Lisbon, also called my dad. He said that since he spoke to Benfica first, I would train with them. I supported Sporting growing up, so it was very tough for me, but my dad and I have the same principles, and we stuck to our word. After a few days, I signed, and it was amazing.”  Pacheco stayed with Benfica until the age of 15, playing and learning alongside some of soccer’s most exciting names, including Renato Sanches and Rúben Dias. The lessons he learned with the club helped him earn a move to Belenenses, where he played until he was 18. After graduating from the youth ranks, he went to the Portuguese third division to pursue a professional career, but found his game stalling before too long.  “I couldn't really find anything that I was looking for, which was a first or second-division team,” he said. “So I started with a third-division team and just felt kind of stuck during the season. A coach reached out to me about going to the US. He said I could get a degree and play soccer there, and maybe in one or two years, I could be playing in MLS. At first, I didn't really know if that was what I wanted for my career. But I talked to my family, and they said, ‘Listen, Diogo, I wouldn't even think twice. I think it's a big opportunity for you, not just as a player but as a person, to get your degree.’ And the more I thought about it, I thought they might be right.”  With his mind made up to head stateside, Pacheco began looking for the right school. The biggest problem? He knew nothing about the American college landscape. With such a big decision ahead of him, he sought help from someone who had gone through the same thing.  That someone turned out to be the number one overall pick in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft, João Moutinho. He likewise grew up playing in Lisbon but went through Sporting CP’s academy while Pacheco was at rival club Benfica. Having played one season for the University of Akron before going pro, Moutinho’s experience was exactly the kind of thing Pacheco was looking for.  “I didn't know anything about soccer or universities—which ones were better or anything,” Pacheco said. “So I talked to João, who was in Akron at the time. He told me I had to go there. He put me in contact with the coaches, who were all amazing. We started talking, and they asked for some videos, some information. They helped me a lot with the process of getting visas and all this stuff, which was very complicated. But yeah, if it wasn't for Jomo, I had no idea where Akron was; how could I go there? I’ve got to thank everyone in Akron for where I am today, that's for sure.”  From the beaches of Portugal, Pacheco made his way to Northeast Ohio in 2018. When he arrived for preseason, he was buzzing for the journey ahead of him and ready to get started right away. However, his American Dream had to wait a bit longer.  “A few days after I got to Akron, my dad called me and said, ‘Oh, you remember the medical exams that you did last week? The doctor just called and said that you have cancer.’ And I thought— this is crazy—but I didn't even care. I was just so happy to be in Akron to start this season and this new experience on the other side of the world. I told my dad I'd go back for Christmas like we planned and take care of it then. And he said, ‘No, you're not understanding. You have to come now. The doctors say you have to remove it now.’”  Within 24 hours, Diogo flew back across the world he had just traversed. Days later, he went under the knife to remove the tumor from his thyroid, an operation that went smoothly and ended with a healthy patient. While most would take their time to recover from such an experience, Pacheco had different plans.  “I stayed in the hospital for two days, I think,” he said. “My family was always there to support me, and I'm very thankful for that. I stayed in Portugal for 10 days, way shorter than everyone was expecting when they thought, ‘Oh, you’ve got cancer? It's probably going to be the whole season.’ But I got back to Akron about 20 days after the surgery.”  Though his body had not yet fully recovered, Diogo’s spirit appeared completely undamaged. He returned to training straight away, sporting a sore neck and a hoarse voice. Not only did he get back into the team, he excelled, netting a hat trick in Akron’s 4-3 win against VCU in their third game of the season.  “I was just so happy to be back,” he remembered. “Those are the types of things that can bring someone down. But growing up, I just learned not to feed myself with those adversities. Because you can always make the decision to give up when something bad is happening to you. But why? You can say, alright, I'm gonna turn this around and I'm gonna use it as motivation to become better. And that's always what I tried to do—just focus on what I could control. I feel like for me, adversity and pressure are the two things that really drive me to be better.”  Pacheco’s time at Akron was anything but easy, but it was rewarding and formative. After four seasons as a Zip, it was time to move on with valuable experience and perspective.  In 2022, he made his way to MNUFC2, moving even further from the Portuguese beaches he loves to pursue his professional soccer dream. He was part of the team and league’s inaugural season, growing as both a man and a leader all the while.  “If you asked me two years ago if I would consider myself a leader, I would tell you no, never,” Diogo said. “I would never have thought I would wear the armband. But you know, last year, that was one of my goals. I said I was going to commit to myself; I'm going to be a leader for this team. I'm going to help the coaches reach the players. I'm going to help the players raise their game. Because I want the team to be better. And I know when they get better, I'm getting better. I’m just trying to be a positive guy, helping everyone. That's really what I'm trying to do here.”  A standout performer for the Twos, Pacheco’s strength and resilience are on full display when he pulls on the Black and Blue. On and off the field, he is an integral part of his squad’s success.  Being captain is about more than wearing the armband; it’s about understanding what it means to struggle and helping others find the courage to come out of those struggles even stronger. It certainly seems like MNUFC2 have found the perfect man for that job.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1udWZjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Rpb2dvLXBhY2hlY28tdGhlLW1hbi1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLW1pcmFjbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cincinnati Bearcats running back Charles McClelland was one of those players. McCelland was one of the bigger-school prospects to land with the Titans.  #Bearcats running back Charles McClelland is signing with the Tennessee Titans as a UDFA. — Justin Williams (@Williams_Justin) April 29, 2023  McClelland was extremely productive for the Bearcats in 2022. McClelland led the Bearcats in rushing with 849 yards and seven touchdowns via 146 attempts (5.8 yards per carry). A dual-threat option, McClelland accounted for 965 total yards of offense by adding 14 receptions and 116 receiving yards to his offensive totals.  McClelland was a big-play threat. McClelland was an explosive game-breaker who rushed for 30-plus yards on six different rushing attempts, and 60-plus yards on two separate carries. McClelland rushed for 100-plus yards in three contests for Cincinnati.  McClelland did not test particularly well at Cincinnati’s Pro Day. He ran the 40-yard dash in a disappointing 4.56 seconds. Mcclelland also leaped a 32-inch vertical. McClelland’s testing results led to a lackluster 2.36 Relative Athletic Score. McClelland relies on instincts and football I.Q. as opposed to high-level athletic traits. The Titans prioritized athletes via undrafted free agency. McClelland was an exception to that rule.  Charles McClelland is a RB prospect in the 2023 draft class. He scored a 2.36 #RAS out of a possible 10.00.

Derrick Henry remains a workhorse back. The Titans drafted Tyjae Spears with a top-100 selection. Spears is guaranteed a role as a chance-of-pace back.  The Titans also have last year’s fourth-rounder Hassan Haskins, who is an outstanding special teams player. McClelland’s opportunity could arrive if the Titans decide to keep four running backs on the initial 53-man roster (which they did last season). In that case, McClelland would be competing with 2022 undrafted free agent Julius Chestnut.  We’re excited to monitor McClelland’s progress throughout training camp and the preseason.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11c2ljY2l0eW1pcmFjbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzUvMTcvMjM3MjM5MjcvdGl0YW5zLXVkZmEtcHJvZmlsZS1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXJiLWNoYXJsZXMtbWNjbGVsbGFuZNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11c2ljY2l0eW1pcmFjbGVzLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjAyMy81LzE3LzIzNzIzOTI3L3RpdGFucy11ZGZhLXByb2ZpbGUtY2luY2lubmF0aS1yYi1jaGFybGVzLW1jY2xlbGxhbmQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Today we played a little better, but it was compromised by the result in the first leg,” he said (via MilanNews).  “It’s Inter’s way of playing that bothers us and we’re unable to find countermeasures, then we’ve also struggled against teams less strong than Inter in the recent period…”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWFsZGluaV9mcnVzdHJhdGVkX2J5X3BlcmZvcm1hbmNlc192c19pbnRlcl93ZXJlX3VuYWJsZV90b19maW5kX2NvdW50ZXJtZWFzdXJlcy9zMV8xNTk2NV8zODgyMjQ3NtIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1wL21hbGRpbmlfZnJ1c3RyYXRlZF9ieV9wZXJmb3JtYW5jZXNfdnNfaW50ZXJfd2VyZV91bmFibGVfdG9fZmluZF9jb3VudGVybWVhc3VyZXMvczFfMTU5NjVfMzg4MjI0NzY?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 'Big Three' of Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer have dominated the ATP Tour for nearly two decades but age and injury have been catching up with them in recent years.  Top seed Djokovic's 6-2 4-6 6-2 defeat by Rune on Wednesday means that for the first time in 19 years neither the Serb nor the injured Nadal will play in the Rome final.  Djokovic, who has now lost two in a row to Rune, said the next generation of players led by world number two Carlos Alcaraz is like a breath of fresh air for the sport.  ""A new generation is here already,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""Alcaraz is number one in the world from Monday, obviously he's playing amazing tennis. I think it's also good for our sport that we have new faces, new guys coming up.  ""We've been saying this for years that we can expect that moment to come when you have a kind of shift of generations.  ""I'm personally still trying to hang in there with all of them. I still have the hunger to keep going. Let's see how far I'm going to play.""  Nadal and Djokovic share the record for most men's Grand Slams with 22 titles each, while Federer won 20 before retiring last year, but the gruelling Tour is taking a heavy toll on their bodies.  Nadal has not played since injuring his hip at the Australian Open in January and has missed the claycourt swing ahead of the French Open, where he is a 14-times champion.  Djokovic, who battled an elbow injury recently, called for the physio during his match against Rune and took a painkiller to get him through it.  When asked if Roland Garros would be the most open tournament in years, Djokovic smiled and said: ""It depends if Nadal plays or not.

The day-long trip was enjoyed by 35 seniors with Happy Wanderers Coordinator Linda Ruehrmund, a retired Cardington teacher.  The group climbed aboard a comfortable bus in Mount Gilead and enjoyed a ride to the Great Lakes Museum on the Maumee River in Toledo. There the group heard from archaeologist Terri Stolden who studies ship wrecks on Lake Erie.  Stolden told the story of exploring several of the 600 shipwrecks in Lake Erie and some of the history of the estimated 2,000 shipwrecks in the Great Lakes.  Participants had an hour to tour the museum with its exhibits about the Great Lakes. There were many artifacts from ships and shipwrecks along with hands-on experiences and videos.  Following lunch at Tony Packo’s restaurant, noted for its connection to Jamie Farr in the TV series “MASH,” the group travelled to Tiffin’s American Civil War Museum.  This unique community museum is run by volunteers in a repurposed United States Post Office. It has many displays about Ohio’s contribution to the Civil War, along with information about Civil War prison camps, clothing and uniforms of the war, and progress of trains and telegraph of the era.  Happy Wanderers is open to all who enjoy travel and fellowship. The group is in its 26th year and was founded by Ruehrmund. Wanderers come from all over Morrow and Marion counties.  An additional nine trips are scheduled this year. Most are in Ohio with the exception of the Sight and Sounds Theater in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  The remaining trips include the following:  • May 23: A matinee “Dear Soldier Boy” at the Ohio Star Theater with lunch and shopping in Walnut Creek, Ohio.  • June 23: Malabar Farms and Kingwood Gardens with lunch at Malabar Farm Restaurant.  • July 13: “Tied up in Knotts,” the story of Don Knotts of the Andy Griffith Show told by his daughter, along with lunch and shopping at Walnut Creek.  • Aug. 17: Indian Lake boat ride – a pontoon boat ride with a stop for lunch.  • Sept. 21: “Grumpy Old Men,” a musical comedy with dinner at LaComedia in Springboro, Ohio.  • Oct. 4: Jack Pine Studio in Laurelville, Ohio, glass blowing and other craft demonstrations with lunch in Circleville, Ohio.  • Nov. 11 is a Saturday Mystery Trip, “Timeless Treasures,” a red, white and blue day.  • Nov. 16-18: “Miracle of Christmas,” at the Sight and Sount Theater in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with additional activities to be announced.  • Nov. 29: “Miracle on 34th Stree” at LaComedia in Springboro, Ohio.  • Dec. 12: Ohio Star Theater, “Rhythm of the Dance,” followed by a visit to the David Warther Museum of carving.

The lease was days from coming due, and we needed to downsize. But the real deal is that on this planet, that car could have got me shot. Three times in the past few months, I’d inadvertently gotten into other people’s cars — all the same make, model, and color — parked in various parking lots throughout Santa Barbara, only to realize I had entered into someone else’s unlocked four-wheeled abode. And no, I didn’t steal anything. Fortunately, no one was home at the time. Two White cheerleaders in Texas — not so lucky — recently got shot for doing the same thing.  Naturally, none of this was my fault. It was my car’s.  It’s a perfectly fine car — better than that, even. It’s a RAV4 hybrid, a dignified, professional-looking charcoal gray. Good visibility, commodious, and pseudo-responsible from an ecological standpoint when it comes to greenhouse emissions. It is, however, the single most anonymous, invisible car on the road — perhaps the planet — a steel-ish tortoise shell on four wheels that pretends to be a compact SUV. Every Saturday afternoon at thousands of shopping malls across America, thousands of hapless Dagwoods — zombie dads — can be seen clicking their key fobs in the vain hope of finding their RAV4 via echolocation.  It’s a wonder more of them haven’t been shot.  It’s a wonder so many leave their cars unlocked.  Fortunately, my backup car doesn’t have the same issues. That’s because it’s a bike. And absolutely no one will ever accidentally happen to just hop on it, either. Back when I got it 37 years ago, my bike was custom-built — by local builder Mike Celmins — to suit the idiosyncratic geometry of my body parts. But in the intervening years, I’ve beat the crap out of it. Only remnants of the original sky-blue paint remain, and most of the frame is covered with semi-oxidized blotches of naked steel tubing. Functionally, however, it’s a thing of joy — imagine careening downhill on the equivalent of a steel coat hanger. It’s a mechanical miracle that makes me grin like a fool, at least for a moment, no matter how pissy the mood inhabiting me.  I mention all this because it’s National Bike to Work Month. I am told Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse and Goleta Mayor Paula Perotte will celebrate this event by ceremonially riding bikes off Stearns Wharf in municipal tandem.  I mention it as well because in America, you are what you drive as much as what you eat, with whom you fornicate, or what — or perhaps whom — you happen to shoot. The numbers in this regard are not what they could be. In America, we have 336 million people, 466 million guns, 278 million cars, and only 100 million bikes. Of the 154 million people who work, 116 million drive to the job. All but 10 million of those drive alone. According to the U.S. Census, only 616,000 bike to work.  John Burke | Credit: Jeff Kennel  For a host of obvious reasons, cycling to work is not a viable option for everybody. But for many it is. Given that 70 percent of all trips taken in the United States are less than two miles, the bike could be used a whole lot more than it is. (Given that we’ve already had 200 mass shootings this year, we can also say the gun could be used less. And no, those two Texas cheerleaders don’t qualify as a mass shooting.)  Given our climate, weather, and geography, there’s no reason why Santa Barbara isn’t the bike commuting capital of the world. Throw in the exhilarating emergence of the e-bike and it should make it the capital of the universe — and yes, I know, those kids are out of control. In a recent podcast with Trek Bikes mogul — and part-time Santa Barbara resident — John Burke and Trisalyn Nelson, chair of UCSB’s Geography Department and emerging brainiac in bicycle activist circles, Burke observed that 35 percent of all trips made in Copenhagen — that’s in Denmark — are made by bike. Even in Copenhagen’s cold and wet Decembers, he said, the number is 35 percent. But in sunny, beautiful, and beckoning Santa Barbara, the number is closer to 5 percent. Five percent! With the advent of e-bikes, our hills no longer qualify as viable excuses. Burke, by the way, is the one responsible for the flotilla of white electric bikes for rent seen buzzing throughout downtown and adjacent neighborhoods.  Trisalyn Nelson | Credit: Courtesy  Nelson is currently creating a data dashboard to track bicycle-involved accidents, near-accidents, and their locations. For those with a story about such events, go to bikemaps  .org and tell it. Among other things, Nelson is trying to pinpoint problematic locations to alert prospective riders and to goad the powers-that-be to take remedial steps.  Nelson is a data freak, intent on filling a major void when it comes to policy matters. Right now, she’s dealing with the stigma inflicted by stupid kids — two to a bike, helmet straps dangling, and distracted by cell phones. How many have been involved in actual accidents? Go to her website and log in. Her solution? How about slower e-bikes, for starters, ones that top out at 20 mph as opposed to 28. Teenagers on e-bikes should be embraced as a great and wonderful thing, she says. To be modified, absolutely. But mostly to be celebrated.  At a time when monthly payments for new cars have skyrocketed to $729 a month — up 24 percent — and for used cars to $563 a month — up 40 percent — shouldn’t our next car be a bike? And that doesn’t include the cost of insurance, registration, gas, repairs, or parking. As for RAV4s, I understand the manufacturers have just added the letter “J” to the brand. It stands for joyous. But if you rode a bike, you’d already be there.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2NvbWUtb24tc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1odWcteW91ci1pbm5lci1iaWtlL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2NvbWUtb24tc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1odWcteW91ci1pbm5lci1iaWtlLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Perhaps one of the toughest losses he has ever suffered in his career came in the game publicly known as ""Fail Mary.""  The most exciting play in American football is the hail mary, where a team desperate to score a touchdown to tie or win the game tries a last gasp deep throw to the end zone and hopes for a miracle.  That's exactly what the Seattle Seahawks tried to do in Week 3 of the 2012 season in a Monday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers. It was Russell Wilson's third-ever game in the league, and both teams came into that game with a 1-1 record.  70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now  We've seen Aaron Rodgers throw it plenty of times, but he has also been victim of the hail mary.  The 2012 referee lockout became a huge problem for the NFL  Now that you're here, it's time for some context. At the start of that season, the primary NFL referees were all out of the league as the NFL and the officials' union could not come to terms on a new collective bargaining deal.  With the officials' lockout, the season started anyway, and the league hired replacement referees. But the problems arised quickly: in Week 2, a referee had to be removed from a New Orleans Saints game because he was a fan of the team, and on Thursday Night Football of Week 3, the game-winning field goal for the Baltimore Ravens against the New England Patriots was clearly over the crossbar, but the referees called it in.  That was nothing compared to what was to come.  Aaron Rodgers, Packers on wrong side of Fail Mary  Now, we should be real with our readers. Except for the final play, that Monday Night Football game was boring, and nothing good was supposed to come out of it. Except that, with 12 seconds left and losing 12-7, the Seahawks had one final shot to throw the ball to the end zone and score the game-winning touchdown.  That's exactly what Russell Wilson did. Or, well, kinda. (You have to click on the video to go to YouTube, since NFL blocks the video)  It's clear as daylight that the ball wasn't caught by Golden Tate! The Seahawks receiver had nothing to do with the ball, which was 100% intercepted. But the referees signaled the touchdown and gave the victory to Seattle.  The levels of confusion right after the play were as high as it could get, and obviously, the Packers were not happy. Rodgers himself issued an apology to the league fans.  ""First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do, and I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport (has) generated a multi-billion dollar machine, by people who pay good money to come watch us play. And the product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control.""  But Rodgers and the Packers didn't have to wait for the primary officials to return. After the debacle, the league negotiated a new deal with the union as quick as they could, and they were back three days later for the Thursday Night Football in Week 4.  But the Fail Mary will always be a bad look for the league, and unfortunately for Rodgers and the Packers, they were on the wrong side of it.

This is a historic visit as Scholz will be the first German leader to come to Seoul in 13 years since former Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip in 2010 to attend a G20 summit.    This surely reflects the strength and importance of the partnership between the two nations. His visit is expected to open new avenues for economic and many other cooperations between the two countries.    Especially during his visit here, Chancellor Scholz has chosen to witness the Korean Peninsula's division firsthand at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This holds great symbolic value. Having experienced its own division and reunification, Germany is open to sharing its valuable insights and experiences with South Korea.    Both countries and their businesses underwent strong transformation processes after World War II and the Korean War, respectively. Koreans speak respectfully about Germany's ""miracle of the Rhine"" while Germany highly recognizes South Korea's ""miracle on the Han River"" and its global triumph of the K-wave.    Now facing common challenges such as de-carbonizing the industry production, e-mobility, diversification of supply chains and digitalization, German and Korean companies are competing and collaborating to find the best solutions.    The summit between Chancellor Scholz and President Yoon is expected to foster deeper economic cooperation between the two countries. A remarkable total of $14.6 billion German investments in South Korea between 1962 and 2020 showcases the strong history of foreign direct investment and numerous joint business projects between Korean and German companies demonstrate the collaboration on equal footing, between esteemed and valued partners.

"miracle","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 01:06:39","My son Ivory was born three months early, weighing less than a kilo. When I was allowed to hold him, after a few weeks, he was so small he fit into my hand.  It's a miracle we survived. I suffered eclampsia – a dangerous condition that causes high blood pressure – and my liver and kidneys failed: he spent three months in the hospital's special care unit.  Ivory is five years old now. Every day when he gets home from school we have a five-minute hug. I make the most of those moments as I know they won't last forever. My daughter, Afrika, is 14 and on her way to being a young woman.  I am incredibly proud of them both but I have to admit that when I meet women who don't have children, I have a guilty feeling of envy. Bringing up children has brought me joy – but it's also been my greatest struggle.  So I can well understand why more women that than ever are choosing not to have children, or to limit themselves to a single child.  NANA AKUA: My son Ivory was born three months early, weighing less than a kilo. When I was allowed to hold him, after a few weeks, he was so small he fit into my hand  Our birth rate is plummeting, something Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured), a father of six, has flagged up as potentially devastating to Britain's economy  READ MORE: Some realms may want to ditch the King - but they DO know the enduring power of the Commonwealth Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/columnists/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->  Our birth rate is plummeting, something Jacob Rees-Mogg, a father of six, has flagged up as potentially devastating to Britain's economy.  And it's true. Unless we take drastic action, in just 40 years' time, there won't be enough younger workers to fund our pensions.  The 'replacement' fertility rate required to keep the population stable is 2.1 children per woman. In the UK (and many other Western countries) that is down to 1.6 and continuing to fall.  Immigration may fill some of the gap, but what we urgently need to do is to support the people we most want to have children – and that's hard-working men and women who will contribute to the public purse.  Some, like Tory MP Danny Kruger, seem to think our reluctance to have children is down to the narcissism of the 'me' generation, but the women I talk to are making practical decisions, shaped by the cost-of-living crisis, shortage of housing and student debt.  We all know bringing up children is tough. When someone tells you they're pregnant today, you might instinctively say 'Congratulations!' but you're probably also thinking 'Wow, get ready for the financial hit…'  Money has always played a part in our decisions to have children. There was no way I could afford a child in my 20s. By the age of 37, I had bought two properties and sensibly saved enough money to live on, but the year I took off work with Afrika set me back more than financially: it set me back ten years in my career. I had to fight to get back into the workplace – and that was tough.  I'm still climbing out of the financial pit that childcare cast me into. I hired an au pair, which may sound like a luxury, but it was cheaper than nursery. At times, I was borrowing against one credit card to pay another.  NANA AKUA: Immigration may fill some of the gap, but what we urgently need to do is to support the people we most want to have children – and that's hard-working men and women who will contribute to the public purse (stock image)  I'm a single mother, but not by choice. My relationships with Afrika and Ivory's fathers did not work out. And with the divorce rate so high, many women find themselves coping alone like me.  For them especially – and even for many couples – the cost of childcare is ruinous. We need a complete rethink of the way women are treated by the tax system and in the workplace environment.  As Penistone and Stocksbridge MP Miriam Cates says, we incentivise the purchase of solar panels and use tax breaks to encourage businesses to invest – so why should the state remain neutral when it comes to matters of family and fertility?  As things stand, parents who work more than 16 hours a week and earn less than £100,000 are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a week for children aged three to four. And from April next year, some free childcare provision will be provided to younger children. That's a start but we need to do much more.  We fund schools. I'd like to see education extended to a fully funded provision of nurseries. We know children thrive in these settings: they become better-socialised and faster learners.  And we know there is a benefit to the economy in having women in the workplace. So, men, it's time to step up. The rich countries with the lowest fertility rates are those where women get the least help with the household – like South Korea where the birthrate is at a perilous 0.84 and women do 4.43 times as much domestic work as their partners.  We have to find a way of relieving the pressure on parents. For the last eight years, I've been giving motivational talks to teenagers and when I ask if they see children as part of their future, fewer and fewer are saying yes. That's sad – if we want to turn it around we need to do something, fast.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2FydGljbGUtMTIwOTY2ODEvTkFOQS1BS1VBLWNoaWxkcmVuLU1yLVJlZXMtTW9nZy1ydWlub3VzLWNvc3QtY2hpbGRjYXJlLmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvY29sdW1uaXN0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMDk2NjgxL2FtcC9OQU5BLUFLVUEtY2hpbGRyZW4tTXItUmVlcy1Nb2dnLXJ1aW5vdXMtY29zdC1jaGlsZGNhcmUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In 1948,as the world picked up its pieces from the ashes of WW2, the Jews who were dealt a particularly heavy hand established the Independent state of Israel.  Advertisement  As the war had raged on exposing man’s darkest side, Jews were disproportionately targeted. By the time the war ended with the decisive defeat of the Nazis, some six million Jews had been killed.  As with any new beginning, Israel encountered steep challenges from the onset. From its establishment, the new state of found itself besieged by formidable enemies and beleaguered by monumental internal challenges. Wars were fought in 1967,1973 and 2006. Even until this day, Israel remains a state in a constant state of war.  Advertisement  Israel remains surrounded by hostile Arab countries and has had to fight just to exist.  But it has not all been bombs, bullets, and bayonet for Israel. Its adversity-driven culture has also resulted in a boom, producing battlefield entrepreneurs that have worked stupendous economic and technological miracles which belie its tiny size and population of just under ten million people. For a country this small and hounded, its spectacular achievements are some of modern history’s most impressive feats.  Advertisement  In their seminal book“ The Start-up Nation: The story of Israel’s economic miracle” authors Dan Senor and Saul Singer examined in luminous detail how a community of penniless refugees transformed a land described by Mark Twain as ‘a desolate country …a silent mournful expanse,” into one of the most dynamic entrepreneurial economies in the world one which produces more startups than Japan, China,India, Korea, Canada and the UK,  According to Senor and Singer, in 2008, for each person venture capital investments in Israel were 2.5 times greater than in the United States, more than 30 times greater than in Europe, 80 times greater than in China, and 350 times greater than in India. Comparing absolute numbers, Israel—a country of just 7.1 million people—attracted close to $2 billion in venture capital, as much as flowed to the United Kingdom’s 61 million citizens or to the 145 million people living in Germany and France combined. And Israel is the only country to experience a meaningful increase in venture capital from 2007 to 2008.  Advertisement  Even the wars Israel has repeatedly fought have not slowed the country down. During the six years following 2000, Israel was hit not just by the bursting of the global tech bubble but by the most intense period of terrorist attacks in its history and by the second Lebanon war. Yet, Israel’s share of the global venture capital market did not drop—it doubled, from 15 percent to 31 percent. And the Tel Aviv stock exchange was higher on the last day of the Lebanon war than on the first, as it was after the three-week military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2009.”  As a country, Israel has also remained wonderfully open to migrants. At its founding, Israel became the only country in history to explicitly address in its founding documents the need for a liberal immigration policy. In 1950, Israel’s new government made good on that declaration with the Law of Return, which until now guarantees that “every Jew is entitled to come to this country.  Advertisement  Israel’s economic miracle is due as much to immigration as to anything. At Israel’s founding in 1948, its population was 806,000. Today, numbering over 9.364 million people, the country has grown more than nine-fold in seventy-five years.  Israel is also no diplomatic shrinking violet. The wars the country has had to fight have congealed into age-long enmity between Israel and its Arab neighbours. However, over the years, as a result of Israel’s rapid economic and technological advancements, many countries who were formerly hostile to it have sought the improvement of diplomatic ties.  Advertisement  Israel’s burgeoning reputation as a diplomatic and democratic heavyweight underpinned by its considered economic and technological status has made it a key player in diplomatic relations.  What more can be said of this country which produces more water than it needs despite more than half of the country being a desert? Can anything more laudatory said of a country whose startups and technological inventions have gone on to redefine irrigation, pharmaceuticals, weapon technologies and even warfare?  Advertisement  What more can be said of a country that was given zero percent chance of surviving at its founding but has today become a model for how to thrive in the face of adversity.  In a world riddled by conflicts and crisis, Israel points the way in how to transform adversity into advancement.  Advertisement  There is no doubt that an ailing world can learn a ton of lessons from this most innovative of countries.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5pb25uaWdlcmlhLmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtYXMtYS1tb2RlbC1vZi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UtcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5LWFuZC1jb21wZXRpdGl2ZW5lc3MtYnktaWtlLXdpbGx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 07:11:00","The two-episode finale of 9-1-1: Lone Star was a bittersweet journey that saw a wedding getting delayed, a toddler being brought back from the dead, and Wyatt learning about his heartbreaking fate. Just before Carlos and TK were getting married, Carlos' father was murdered, which prompted him to delay his wedding and investigate his father's killer.  The two episodes of 9-1-1: Lone Star was titled Best of Men and In Sickness and In Health. Both of them aired on May 16, 2023, on FOX.  9-1-1: Lone Star Season 4 finale recap: Carlos delays his own wedding after his father's murder  The episode began with a focus on Wyatt. After a terrible accident, he was finally recovering slowly. He was even happy about his progress. He was also supportive of his father Judd, who later saw a miracle.  The episode then shifted to a case where an inebriated man carjacked a four-wheeler with a toddler name Piper in the back seat. He was very high and drove straight into a swimming pool. Thankfully, the car's owner, Piper's mother, called 911 and the APD and AFD responded quickly. The driver saved his own life but left the toddler inside.  Owen arrived at the scene and bravely saved Piper. Tommy and the team recovered the child's pulse. This was a miracle since she had died for a few minutes in the pool.  Judd received a call from Marleen, informing him that there was a chance that their son Wyatt would never be able to walk again. Everyone was extremely upset about this and nobody knew how to break the news to him. Ultimately, Marleen and Judd decided to break the news to him, leaving him heartbroken.  Judd decided to take care of Wyatt and keep him in his own house. He informed Owen that he was quitting his job, a move that the latter supported.  Meanwhile, Carlos got offered a job by his father Gabriel with the Texas Rangers. He turned the offer down by saying that the organization was racist.  Gabriel and Carlos didn't share the best relationship as the former was not supportive of his son's homosexuality. But their relationship slowly mended and Gabriel was even excited to attend Carlos' wedding with TK.  Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Gabriel was shot to death by an unknown assailant at his doorstep. Carlos decided to postpone the wedding after his father's murder. He was sure that the culprit was a man called Pablo Martinez who had ties with the cartel, and decided to investigate the case on his own.  But everyone soon made him realize that Pablo was only protecting his father and he was an undercover cop. Carlos realized his mistake and regretted that he was going to kill an innocent man. He even apologized to TK for delaying the wedding and proposed to him again. TK accepted instantly.  The lovebirds were then married in front of their friends and family. Paul officiated the wedding and Iris was Carlos' best man. Even Owen arrived with his own family.  Owen's brother Robert told his family about his disease and his desire to kill himself. Although Owen tried to stop him, a few days after the wedding, Robert took his own life. Owen was beside him when this happened.

"miracle","2017-10-05","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:40:22","New London — The young man, an otherwise unbending high school football player, was speaking now about his hopes and dreams, feelings and emotions, amid a room that fell silent. It was the kind of silence as in a theater, when the conductor taps the music stand and raises his hands, everyone awaiting what would come next.  “My goal in life,” the young man said, “is to have a son and be a better dad to him than my (estranged) dad is to me.”  Imagine this room, a classroom at New London High, all full of rugged athletes about to catch a few tears, listening to their friend’s story. There was no sound. No phones out. Nothing but compassion.  As real as it gets.  This happens weekly at New London High now thanks to former Whaler (and former major leaguer) Rajai Davis, who has come back to his hometown and his alma mater offering a new mentorship program for the school’s athletes. Davis and Larry Delong, pastor at the Miracle Temple Church in the city, offer their life experiences to the kids, who turn vulnerability into strength.  “I'm doing this because I know I wanted this when I was their age,” Davis was saying. “If I had this, I would have made different choices. I've had opportunities to be exposed to a lot more now and I know these kids never will be unless somebody like myself brings it. We never talked about a lot of this. It was always swept under the rug.”  Davis works as the Senior Director of On Field Operations in Major League Baseball, a liaison with the Commissioner's Office as a resource in clubhouses, to whom players can voice their concerns. In that job, Davis did a filming about sexual assault and domestic violence, encouraging players to think about issues and behaviors that too often find their way under the metaphorical rug.  “I've been talking with Phil (New London athletic director Phil Orbe) about doing this kind of program with the kids here for the last year and a half,” Davis said.  The program works through the website acalltomen.org, which aims to promote healthy, respectful manhood through training and educational resources for companies, government agencies, schools and community groups. The program’s “collective socialization of manhood” comes through what it calls the “Man Box,” the community organizing model.  The kids already understand the traps for which the “Man Box” raises awareness: Men need to be strong. They don’t show emotions. They can’t be vulnerable. Except that two days a week after school, Davis and Delong provide this non-judgemental atmosphere awash in openness, honesty and truth.  They talked about their home lives. Their goals and dreams. What’s required for college. They talked about how easy it is for men to objectify women, despite the layers of respect the kids have for their mothers. They talked about how they perceived the behavior of some girls in the building as consistently disrespectful — and their frustration with how they believe administrators don’t believe the boys as much as the girls. They spoke of conflict resolution. They discussed the many traps for teenagers and how, as Delong said, “sometimes, better choices lead to lonelier roads.”  There was one instance when a young man was sharing something from his life and another began to laugh. The speaker immediately quoted new football coach Bobby Sanchez, who invites his players to share. “As Coach Sanchez says, ‘the ones who laugh in here are the ones who end up alone in the future.’”  There was no more laughing.  The kids agreed it was the most worthwhile hour of the day.  “Sometimes,” author Brene Brown wrote, “the most dangerous thing for kids is the silence that allows them to construct their own stories — stories that almost always cast them as alone and unworthy of love and belonging.”  And then here in this room they all belonged. A bunch of kids talking about real life with no fears about vulnerability, disconnection, criticism, failure and conflict. The concept of fear, so frequently a protective barrier and solidifying division that helps keep us apart, suddenly had no place here.  So much for the concept, too, that learning ends at the final bell. There is no more important undertaking on school grounds for the kids than this new program. And it’s going to grow.  “We're building this now as a team so that eventually we will be able to reach everyone,” Davis said. “But we have to start small. But big doors swing by little hinges, right?”  This is the opinion of Day sports columnist Mike DiMauro","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vY29sdW1ucy8yMDIzMDUxNy9yYWphaS1kYXZpcy1yZXR1cm5zLXdpdGgtYWxsLXRoZS1yaWdodC1tZXNzYWdlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The church was filled to capacity forcing other faithful to follow the preaching outside the church and along the streets of Nairobi.

His followers and Muiru's all converged at the church to listen to his preaching.  He was released on the condition that he reports to a police station once a week or as required by State.  Ezekiel was also ordered to refrain from talking about the Shakahola issue.  The preacher is under investigation over the alleged indoctrination of his followers.  He is currently out on a Sh3 million bond with a surety of a similar amount or an alternative of Sh1.5 million cash bail.

"miracle","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:06:49","4 horsemen of the apocalypse? Not yet, but another disaster is coming  With respect to national leadership going forward, it is time to face a hard fact: the United States needs a miracle.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are yet to be revealed, but the three riders of political disaster are already before us as the pace picks up for the 2024 election.  Dementia-Senility, cluelessness, and hubris gallop into view. With every sighting, the need for a miracle becomes increasingly evident as the major candidates for the presidency and vice presidency come closer. Joe Biden, in the view of many, is astride the horse of dementia-senility. Kamala Harris is in the saddle of the steed of cluelessness. Donald Trump is mounted on the stallion of hubris.  There are and will be others, but these are the ones now kicking up the most dust. God help us.  Joe Biden is to be understood and pitied, having lost a wife and young children tragically. One would think it would take a lifetime to get over such grief — if ever. Now this heart-breaking past is mingled in President Biden with the challenges of old age (I understand those challenges well at age 81). The positives of aging can be, among others, wisdom, and experience. However, old-timers must be honest enough to recognize that they may distort the past or forget the consequences of bad decisions in earlier life. If Biden wins the presidency in 2024, he will need all the wisdom he can muster since he would be the oldest elected president in American history.  Vice President Kamala Harris too frequently seems to be thrust into roles for which she has no preparation — like Biden’s appointing her as “czar” of migration in this season of unprecedented turmoil at the nation’s southern borders. True or not, she has come across as being clueless as to what to do about that staggering problem. Harris did not help herself by going to Atlanta for a political fundraiser just as migrants pressed in on the country’s gates, awaiting the end of Article 42, and the near obliteration of the boundaries. “Kamala Harris is to hit Dem Soiree as Title 42 lifts,” shouted a headline in the New York Post.  Then there’s the case of another 2024 candidate, Donald Trump, who seems to have a serious case of hubris, the belief that one is invulnerable and above the clutch of past actions and mistakes. Hubris is a case of intense arrogance.  It is true that there are no perfect people and hence no perfect candidates. We must carefully consider the temperament of Candidates and the impact of their personalities on decisions they might make if they win office.  Dementia-senility can bring confusion and serious forgetfulness, a loss of focus, and emotional control, to name a few of the symptoms. These are not the attributes fit for confrontations with the tyrants and shrewd overlords of the present world disorder.  Cluelessness dims the ability to see through subtleties and propaganda. It blocks leaders from understanding what is really going on. In a national and international scenario populated with crafty masters of bait and switch a clueless national leader can be snookered easily.  The chief of state suffering hubris is prone to take risky actions. He or she underestimates threats on the one hand or, on the other, overestimates his or her own ability to knock out the adversary. This is scary stuff in a nuclear world. While John F. Kennedy might have been afflicted with hubris, nevertheless in the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 he had sufficient intelligence to know the Russians were not likely to ignite a nuclear war. His successor, Lyndon Johnson demonstrated a high degree of hubris about Vietnam, and he underestimated the determination and ability of the enemy in continuing to fight. Fifty thousand American lives were snuffed out because of the continuing miscalculation on the part of both Johnson and Kennedy.  Nixon demonstrated cluelessness regarding the Watergate scandals that brought down his presidency. As a low-level member of the White House staff in that era I knew of aides who urged the president to take the initiative to reform his campaign organization and take full responsibility for ridding it of dirty tricks and questionable strategies. Because higher-level staff prevented those exhortations from going into the Oval Office, or because of Nixon’s own choices, his presidency was brought down.  Gerald Ford, Nixon’s immediate replacement upon his resignation from the presidency, lost the election to a full White House term by revealing during a debate that he was clueless regarding the extent of Communist control in Eastern Europe.  And then there was the striking hubris and cluelessness of Bill Clinton’s abuse of the Oval Office as a hideaway for his sexual escapades. In that, Clinton was following in the steps of Kennedy and who knows who else?  The bottom line: Voters must go beyond soundbites and appearances from candidates and look deeply into their characters, temperaments, and records.  The national and world scenes are far too delicate to be handled by a president whose age prevents him or her from taking reasonable approaches to crises, or so clueless that he or she cannot discern what is really going on behind the charade by which shrewd enemies conceal the facts, or national leaders who suffer from hubris so great that they overestimate themselves and underestimate their enemies.  The imperative: Pray for a leadership miracle for the United States in 2024.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL3ZvaWNlcy9mb3VyLWhvcnNlbWVuLW9mLXRoZS1hcG9jYWx5cHNlLW5vdC15ZXQtYnV0LWFub3RoZXItZGlzYXN0ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mack played in the XFL this past season for the San Antonio Brahmas. Mack recorded 28 receptions for 230 yards and one touchdown this season.  #Titans signed tight end Alize' Mack following a successful tryout, per his agent @mike_delledonne @XFLBrahmas and preseason last year with #Packers. Former #Saints seventh round pick from @NDFootball — Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) May 17, 2023  The No. 231 overall selection in the 2019 NFL Draft, Mack originally broke into the league with the New Orleans Saints. Mack has spent time with five different NFL organizations. Mack played collegiately at Notre Dame.  The 2023 XFL season reached its conclusion with the Arlington Renegades defeating the DC Defenders in the 2023 XFL Championship Game. XFL players became eligible to sign NFL contracts starting this past Monday. Mack represents the first XFL signing for the Titans.  Mack is joining a tight end room that contains Chigoziem Okonkwo, Josh Whyle, Trevon Wesco, and Kevin Rader. Some of these roles are written in stone. Okonknwo is Tennessee’s clear-cut No. 1 tight end as an explosive playmaker that’s expected to take a step forward in 2023.  Whyle is an exciting fifth-round selection that could play himself into an immediate role. Wesco is one of the league’s best blocking tight ends. That skill set matters to the run-heavy Titans, who are looking for Wesco to replace Geoff Swaim. Rader is a holdover from the conclusion of the 2022 campaign. Thomas Odukoya and Justin Rigg are also on the roster.  Mack probably needs the Titans to keep four tight ends in order to compete for a 53-man roster spot. Stranger things have happened, especially given Tennessee’s lack of receiver depth. Mack will receive an opportunity to compete.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11c2ljY2l0eW1pcmFjbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzUvMTcvMjM3Mjc3MDcvcmVwb3J0LXRpdGFucy1zaWduLXhmbC10ZS1hbGl6ZS1tYWNr0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXVzaWNjaXR5bWlyYWNsZXMuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMTcvMjM3Mjc3MDcvcmVwb3J0LXRpdGFucy1zaWduLXhmbC10ZS1hbGl6ZS1tYWNr?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hilda Effiong Bassey is a popular Nigerian chef known on social media as Hilda Baci, CNN reports. Motivated by her Naija roots, Bassey set out to set a new world record for her home country, hosting a marathon to cook the most consecutive nonstop hours by an individual. Hosted in Lagos, Bassey worked to beat the previous record of 87 hours and 45 minutes set in 2019 by Indian chef Lata Tondon. Tondon sent in her well wishes via social media as Bassey began cooking on Thursday, finishing up on Monday and setting a new world record with a whopping 100 hours of nonstop cooking.  Bassey said her motivation for the challenge was putting Nigerian food on the global radar, creating over 55 recipes and more than 100 recipes throughout the cookathon.  “Nigerian cuisine is the best out there. The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food,” Bassey told reporters.  Many showed up in droves to support the chef as she danced and waved at fans from her kitchen. Popular Nigerian artist Tiwa Savage visited Bassey to encourage her along with politicians, the Governor of Lagos state, reporters and locals, including Udak Obong who traveled through the night to come out.  “I drove 12 hours to be right here to support my sister, my friend. She’s just amazing,” said Obong.    Enioluwa Adeoluwa, an influencer who served as MC for the cooking marathon said this type of community is common in Nigeria and they were all supportive of Bassey’s efforts.  “When a Nigerian is doing something we all come out to show support…We are super excited. She’s doing such an amazing job.  Bassey admitted that the journey was laborious, saying she even thought about quitting, but with the massive amounts of support shown, she pushed through and was happy to accomplish such a major feat.  “The first day was the most difficult. I was ready to give up 6 hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible,” said Bassey.  She is still waiting for the Guinness world record committee to confirm that all criteria has been met before officially naming Bassey as the new record holder. But all of Nigeria and the diaspora agrees that after cooking for 100 hours straight, Bassey has just blazed a trail that will open doors for generations of chefs to come.  “She’s opening the door to the African food market and showing all the youth out here that if you can dream it, you can achieve it,” said actor Damilola Ogunsi.

This show marked the first show on the Westville's calendar for 2023, and had over 4600 fans in attendance for this most righteous Dead cover band.  The evening's festivities began on a lovely New England afternoon. The band took the stage around 6:15pm, and wasted no time by diving into an exploratory build up prior to ""Eyes of the World."" Drummer Joe Russo dug into deep percussion early, and keyboardist Marco Benevento unfurled a beautiful sequence on the piano. A bluesy jam ensued, followed by a funky transition into ""The Music Never Stopped."" The vibe became mellow as the music flowed into a ""Black Peter"" tease, but quickly picked up, with a raging guitar jam via guitarists Tom Hamilton and Scott Metzger back into ""The Music Never Stopped.""  Joe Russo welcomed his two young daughters with pint-sized guitars on stage before the band performed ""Here Comes The Sun"" for the first time. Both Russo and Hamilton contributed vocals to this classic Beatles' tune. The girls remained for the rest of the set, and unleashed a few rock star moves of their own.  A very spacey jam lead into ""Estimated Prophet,"" proceeded by a layered jam, with notable contributions by Metzger. A slower, more melodic improvisational section gave way for an edgy jam into ""The Wheel,"" with an emphasis by bassist Dave Dreiwitz. Both Dreiwitz and Hamilton raced through an incredible build up that transformed into a perfectly placed ""Real Morning Party"" tease, which is a song by Benevento. The music rolled into a deliciously psychedelic ""Uncle John's Band,"" before these fine musicians stopped for a breath of air. With Russo like a freight train on the drums, ""Bertha,"" was up next, and concluded this stellar set.  The band returned for round two, and picked up where they left off with ""St. Stephen."" This raging opener lead into more improvisational pleasantries on the piano by Benevento. The guitars elevated this jam, ushering the music back into ""St. Stephen,"" before a face melting segue into ""I Need a Miracle."" I need a miracle everyday, indeed. The crowd assisted Metzger with these famous lyrics, followed by a boot scooting, bluesy breakdown. The music rolled into a euphonious ""Ramble On Rose,"" with a breezy jam by Hamilton.  More psychedelic goodness emerged with ""Scarlet Begonias,"" which flowed into a reggae inspired improvisation that was almost spooky at times. Benevento's daughters Illa and Ruby joined their father on the keys as the band moved into a heated ""Fire on the Mountain."" The layers of piano brought a huge smile to proud papa Benevento. This tune was all Hamilton, from the soulful vocals to the galvanized jam. After returning to ""Scarlet Begonias,"" Russo announced, ""It's daughter night here at JRAD. Big hand for Illa and Ruby Benevento. It's feeling like Father's Day on Mother's Day. We're just lucky to be here. Happy Mother's Day.""  The music was not over quite yet, as this talented bunch served up a monster, sixteen minute ""Throwing Stones"" that went into type two territory. A melodious jam skillfully jettisoned back into ""Throwing Stones."" The set ended on the heart felt ""So Many Roads."" The band returned to play a high energy ""Good Lovin,"" which returned to ""The Wheel,"" before ending the show with an affirmative bang.  Joe Russo's Almost Dead always brings fresh jams and vibrant tunes. We as fans are extremely lucky to experience music from them with their children, on top of that.

Most Read from Bloomberg  That’s the thinking of Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  “The tale of optimism does not exist,” she told Bloomberg Television. “Is there a possibility of a congressional miracle? Who knows — but right now folks are pricing that this is going to be a very tumultuous debt ceiling. If it at all comes in a little bit easier than we expect, that right tail is very cheap.”  The volatility market is looking for action in stocks, and equities need to drawdown before Congress takes action, she said, adding that she expects an “eleventh hour, 2011-type” situation. Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the Cboe Volatility Index or VIX, has been trading below 30 — a level considered a sign of heightened volatility — for most of 2023. The VIX was also tamped down in 2011 amid a similar standoff around the debt ceiling before it peaked near 50 in August and remained above 30.  “That’s what these bets in the market are saying right now,” she said. “They think we’re going to get back there.”  Lawmakers took a cautiously optimistic tone after a Tuesday meeting between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, saying that while they remained far apart, parties were hopeful they could find some middle ground. Contracts on the S&P 500 rose in premarket trading on Wednesday morning.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that her department could run out of cash as soon as June 1. Rates on short-dated Treasuries expiring around that so-called X-date have soared, but analysts have pointed to a lack of reaction from equity markets, with the benchmark gauge stuck in a narrow range.  Story continues  Silverman explained that the VIX is low because bullish S&P calls are cheap, and she pointed to “bearishness across the board.”  “The most underpriced reality right now is the idea that this debt ceiling situation actually gets resolved quicker and easier than we think,” she said. “Folks are very, very well prepared for a debacle. And so if we don’t get it, it would be very interesting to see all these hedges roll off.”  --With assistance from Jonathan Ferro and Tom Keene.

It seems like heady stuff, and it’s true that avant-garde cinema is not for every taste, but there’s an intoxicating compulsion and approachability to Barney’s work. His is the stuff of violent mass spectacle, human achievements on grand architectural and operatic scales, secret societies, and arcane rituals, and how the miracle of it all that creation is just an imperfect, Frankensteinian mirror to the mysterious and overlooked functions of biology.  Barney’s work emerges from tension, the titles of his pieces providing the ends of threads that, once pulled, open him up for contemplation, contextualization, and sometimes dissection. He is known for an ongoing video and photography series called Drawing Restraint, which describes a line between muscle growth and artistic production; River of Fundament is a three-act opera based on Norman Mailer’s Ancient Evenings; “Redoubt” employs the voyeurism and punishment myth of Diana and Actaeon in the exploration of what he called “humanity’s place in the natural world”; and now “Secondary,” which dramatizes a fateful American football game in which Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley is paralyzed in 1978 by a violent hit from Oakland Raiders defensive back Jack Tatum. Moving between the worlds of fine art and provocation, Barney is probably best known for his epic, eight-year, and five-film project “The Cremaster Cycle” (398 min), undertaken between 1994 and 2002.  Metrograph is hosting a rare screening of all five parts in the order in which they were created, which is not the order in which they are numbered, culminating with an in-person conversation with Barney and frequent collaborator Maggie Nelson. It is the first New York screening of this work since 2015. Barney has vowed there never be a broad home video incarnation.  “The Cremaster Cycle” is named for the muscle in male anatomy primarily responsible for raising and lowering testes in response to temperature. Its most disturbing, and arguably most sophisticated sequence is in the middle of its final and longest installment, “Cremaster 3,” in which its wordless hero, The Entered Apprentice (played by Barney himself), is strapped into a dentist’s chair at the center of the Chrysler Building, partially stripped and forced to ingest the crushed metal sepulcher, a violently-compressed 1938 Chevrolet Imperial, of serial murderer Gary Gilmore. Gilmore is played by Barney in “Cremaster 2” as a being born from a seance, gestated in a fleshy umbilicus stretched between two cars parked at a remote gas station, where the killer murdered attendant Max Jensen (Michael Thompson).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvZ2VyZWJlcnQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3RoZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGl2ZS1wb3dlci1vZi1tYXR0aGV3LWJhcm5leXMtY3JlbWFzdGVyLWN5Y2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He was born in Jacksonville, Florida on November 14, 1939, a son to the late Peter Arthur and Jewel Edith (Miracle) Dignan.  On June 17, 1972, he was united in marriage to Joyce Ann Bradley in Akron, Ohio.  Arthur was a 1958 graduate of Florida School for the Deaf and Blind. For seven years after graduating, he worked as a typesetter for a newspaper where he was self-taught. He then attended Gallaudet University in Washington D.C. where he studied and graduated with his degree in Sociology in 1971. Arthur began working as a teacher at Montana School for the Deaf for two years. Before going on to further his education, he would marry the love of his life in 1972. He then attended California State Northridge where he gained his Master’s in Education.  After achieving his first Master’s degree, he and Joyce moved back to Florida where they welcomed their first son, and he started teaching at his high school alma mater. His family then moved to Utah and he taught at Utah School for the Deaf. It was in Utah that his brother-in-law, Raymond Bradley, would lead Arthur and Joyce to Christ in 1977, and they would welcome their second son. This year was a life-changing year for him and his young family.  Arthur went on to teach at various other institutions for the deaf including California School for the Deaf, Southwest Collegiate Institute of the Deaf, and Oklahoma School for the Deaf. While teaching in Big Spring, Texas, he would welcome his third child and only daughter. He decided to continue his education and received his second Master’s degree, which was in Counseling. After this achievement, he would continue to teach at schools in Florida, California, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, before making a final move to Missouri where he taught at William Woods University from 1996 until his retirement.  He was incredibly dedicated to the deaf community. Arthur was a true pioneer for the deaf culture and for sign language. Nationally known for his influence in the deaf community, he made a way for individuals to know that they can succeed and have the best things in life. He truly made a long-lasting, positive impact on the world that will continue to bless people for generations to come.  Arthur was a very brilliant, dedicated, and driven man. Along with his many accomplishments in education and career, he was also successful in creative ventures. For many years he had a one-man comedy show, authored a book, and acted in a movie about the Book of Job. He was actively engaged in his church life where he was a deaf leader, Sunday school teacher, and held various leadership positions. His love for God and people shone through everything that he did.  It is important to note that Arthur was a huge football fan. He was successful in the sport, earning the title of All-American in high school. His passion for the game would be passed down to his sons who also earned the All-American title, and eventually would trickle down to his grandchildren. Their common love of the game created an extremely special bond.  After his retirement from teaching, Arthur’s main goal and priority was spending time with his family and grandchildren. He loved attending his grandkids’ sporting events and rarely missed a ball game. He never missed church, always showed up with a smile, and loved being involved. Even when his health began to decline, Arthur never complained. His family was his greatest pride and he loved them deeply. He will be missed immensely by those who know and love him.  He is survived by the love of his life and wife of nearly 51 years, Joyce; children, Randy (Janelle) Dignan of Jefferson City, Nick (Ashley) Dignan of Groves, Texas, and Jennifer (Jorge) Morales of New Bloomfield; grandchildren, Briella, Rayana, Grant, and Clara Dignan, Cade Madelyn, Colt Arthur, and McKinley Ann Dignan, and Amelia, Benton, Conan, Darrion, and Emalie Morales; nephew, Philip Van Dignan; niece, Nelda Knapik; and numerous additional nieces and nephews.  He was preceded in death by his parents, Peter and Edith; and brother, Philip Dignan.

The family were airlifted to hospital from the scene, between junction 3 for the Pilsworth Interchange and junction 4 for Simister Island.  Tragically, 38-year-old Frankie, who was 18 weeks pregnant, died from her injuries on Monday (May 15).

"miracle","2023-04-09","00:00:00","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:13:33","Guest Viewpoints  Easter is the Christian celebration of Jesus Christ’s miraculous triumph over death. After His death by crucifixion, He rose from the dead three days later. The Christian belief is that Jesus sacrificed Himself on the cross and bore the sins of all the people. His Resurrection grants eternal life for all those who believe in Him, and the celebration of Easter stands as one of the most important and holy days on the Christian calendar.  Orthodox Easter, or Pascha and Catholic Easter, have the same roots and both celebrate the miracle of resurrection. The main difference is they are celebrated on different days. The Catholics follow a different calendar than the Orthodox; Orthodox Easter usually falls after Catholic Easter.  Greek Orthodox Easter holds unique traditions different from the Catholic traditions. Worshippers work together to bring the miracle of resurrection to life.  Preparations for Pascha begin 40 days prior to Easter; Greeks would commence in fasting, prayer, and the attendance of liturgy services during this time. Great Lent prepares believers to reach for, accept, and attain the calling of their Savior. Observance of Great Lent calls for the abstinence of many foods including all meat and dairy, repentance, and restitution for all sins committed in the past year. The duration of this period is finalized on the Sunday of the sixth week, Palm Sunday, which celebrates the beginning of Holy Week. Jesus’ arrival in Jerusalem, where He was greeted by people waving palm branches. Worshippers welcome Jesus into their hearts and show their willingness to follow Him by this greeting. The Palm Sunday tradition is that all gather in the church prior to the Divine Liturgy and fold the palm leaves into cross shapes. The church is then decorated with the palm leaves. Concluding the Palm Sunday mass, the priest distributes the blessed palm crosses to all as a symbol of victory and peace.  The church services during Holy Week run for hours, and there is a different service every day to follow the Passion of Christ, the days that led Him to the cross, and to Resurrection, according to the Greek Reporter website.  On Holy Wednesday, the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is held. This evening is devoted to repentance, confession, and the remission of sins by the Lord. Those who attend are given the opportunity to repent their sins in Confession in preparation for communion. The service closes with the priest blessing each person with anointing oil, which many people believe has healing powers.  Holy Thursday follows with a depressing liturgy as Jesus’ betrayal is recalled and He is eventually led to His death. Four events are celebrated on this day and the ‘Twelve Gospels’ are read during service to prepare for Good Friday.  On Good Friday, the people are in mourning and the church bells ring throughout Greece to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. People will gather at the church Friday night to participate in a funeral procession for Jesus. They follow the priest and the ‘Epitafios’, a wooden construction carrying the precious cloth depicting the body of Christ and adorned with flowers. Mourners are given candles with red cups, and all share the holy light as they walk outside to mourn their savior. The processions are accompanied by a police escort, and the roads are closed for them to walk. People must be extra careful while holding the candles as there have been many instances where coats and even hair have accidentally caught fire. The Good Friday Procession is arguably the most renowned event of Holy Week, as it thoroughly recreates the biblical scenes and brings the story of Easter to life.  On Holy Saturday, or the service of the ‘Anastasi’, Greeks gather at the church at midnight for the Resurrection ceremony. Greeks ditch the dark-colored Good Friday Candles for white candles, or ‘lampathes’. Lampathes are gifted to children by their godfather or godmother and are often decorated. Children keep their lampathes for the year as they have been blessed by being lit from the Holy Flame that comes from Jerusalem. At midnight, the priests join the Greeks outside the church and chant “Christos Anesti!” and the people respond “Alithos Anesti!” This can be translated to, “Christ is risen,” “Truly, He is risen,” respectively. Greeks celebrate Christ’s Resurrection and pass around the Holy Light to bring home and bless their houses.  Returning home from Midnight vigil, it is customary to make a cross out of candle smoke above the front door to symbolize the Resurrection. Then, it is time to celebrate.  The family sits around the table to crack red eggs, symbolic of the blood and tomb of Christ. Everyone gets an egg, and it becomes a competition to see whose egg is the strongest. Families will go around the table saying the phrase “Christos Anesti,” “Alithos Anesti,” as they smash their eggs against each other. The person with the strongest egg is said to have good luck for the next year.  After eating the eggs, the traditional midnight meal is served. ‘Magiritsa’ is a special Greek soup made with lamb intestines, kidneys, and other innards. It has a distinct taste and most definitely does not appeal to everyone, but it serves as a festive way to signify the end of the 40-day fasting period.  The Easter celebrations continue throughout the day, where Greeks prepare to break their fast and enjoy lamb. The lamb is traditionally cooked for hours, rotating on a spit, which can serve as a frightful sight for a young child, or non-Greeks. ‘Tsoureki’, a sweet bread, is also prepared and served at the Easter table. Food is an integral part of Greek Easter, and most anticipate this feast all year.  Greek Easter is a day full of family, dancing, food, and celebrating. It is a day meant to be spent with loved ones. People are given a chance of rebirth as they repent their sins as they honor Jesus’ death. The belief is that Jesus died for the sins of the people, and with the miracle of His Resurrection, people are given a second chance.

"miracle","2018-12-02","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 19:44:21","click to enlarge  Wow! What a winter!  Breaking all records, the long drought has ended and, at least temporarily, plentiful precipitation has saved the day.  It’s given new meaning to the moniker, “Greatest Snow on Earth,” which fell “greatly” in all-time record amounts across the state—over 900 inches at Alta—and clobbered the mountains across both central and southern Utah. Not everyone is happy; the ear-nose-and-throat specialists will have a “dry season” and the gastroenterologists will be scraping for business.  Confused? To the dismay of those particular medical specialties, Utahns will be cured of their dry coughs and will no longer be hopelessly resigned to “farting dust.” Drink up, folks!  It’s just one more disastrous crisis averted in Utah’s roller-coaster history that will likely be attributed to a miracle. Surely, Gov. Spencer Cox and most of the residents were praying that the drought would end, saving our much-treasured, amply-sized lawns and the trees that were never meant to grow here, and ensuring that Utah’s biggest industry—ski tourism—would continue its healthy growth.  The renewed water supply will also mean that pink flamingos will, once again, choose to vacation on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and that the wandering naturists will be able to see water during their Sunday walks on the GSL shore.  Utah’s invariably-temporary end of the drought is likely to become another folk legend. It’ll go something like this in the history books: “Luckily, the seagulls had been poised and ready for takeoff. Flying from California, with their buckets of snow, they managed to make the 2022-2023 ski seasons one of the most profitable ever, dumping more than 30 inches of water and delighting everyone with endless schussing.” Then again, maybe that white stuff—all 75 feet of it—wasn’t snow at all! Ha-ha.  What, but a miracle, could explain the bonanza of welcome water? Sure, the relentless “atmospheric rivers” of moisture were an essential element, but we need to remember that it’s the “lake effect” that plays such a big part in the Wasatch Mountains' annual snowfall. Without those unique evaporative lake-effect contributions to the Wasatch snow depths, Utah’s northern ski resorts would have far less snow. It’s frankly amazing that so much snow could have fallen during a season when the GSL had retained only about 75% of its total surface area—shorted of almost 800 square miles of evaporative capability. That’s a miracle!  Sadly, there’s truth in the adage, “Be careful what you pray for.” Record precipitation is presenting the possibility of a replay of SLC’s 1983 snowmelt, when rivers flowed on the city’s primary thoroughfares after record temperatures changed the snow to wild torrents. Should that happen, we should try to have the seagulls ready and waiting, using their buckets, once again, to save the day.  Despite the ailing Brigham Young’s hearty verbal embrace of the vision before him when he arrived at the Salt Lake Valley— “This is the right place”—Utah has not exactly been the perfect spot to settle and thrive. Fraught with problems from the very beginning, it’s been a challenging location for living. Its high-altitude aridity is an unavoidable fact. Nevertheless, Young’s dreamy prediction of making the “desert blossom as a rose” has been mostly spot-on. Chalk it up to ingenuity, some fortuitous luck, and lots of hard work, Utah and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake have become a remarkably successful venture, one that would have surely baffled its early detractors.  Arriving late in the year 1847, the Mormon pioneers lost no time in planting the crops they’d need to sustain them through the next year, but autumn conditions didn’t favor a bounteous harvest, and they barely survived. The spring of 1848 brought a second planting of crops, and those did pretty well until a hoard of “Mormon"" crickets (not sure they had actually been baptized) descended from the skies. The pioneers exclaimed, “Oh, sh-t!” and things looked pretty grim.  We all know the story: The people prayed and then, voila! A flock of hungry seagulls, divinely conscripted for that specific campaign, descended on the crickets and ate every last one of those crunchy little critters. That event became a popular folk legend, though some historians have questioned whether the birds actually saved the day or only made a small contribution. Most important, miracle or not, the settlers enjoyed a healthy harvest and were able to make it through another winter.  But, that’s not where the legends about seagulls end. Despite the rudeness of Californians—describing the garbage-eating and disease-carrying birds as “flying rats”—it is rumored that seagulls equipped with special saddles brought a plentiful array of pretty, young women to early Salt Lake City, who, at just the right moment, parachuted into the fledgling town, and helped Young to fill all vacancies in his 56-wife harem. Yes, that’s right; the seagulls, once again, provided fortuitous relief to the problems of the saints. And we all know now that those 56 wives contributed to wildly-plentiful offspring and a permanent economic and political “Young” dynasty.  Utah is a great state. Endowed with amazing natural wonders and geological treats, replete with intelligent and industrious people, blessed with one of the best economies and lowest jobless rates, it stands as a living monument to the American Dream.  It’s certainly worth asking: Without the seagulls, where would we be today? Audubon would be proud.

"miracle","2017-10-09","Not Discerned","{""Scottsdale"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 18:53:46","The journey to motherhood is different for every woman. Sometimes traditional approaches to motherhood do not work and when they fail that is when women on the journey begin taking different paths to motherhood. Alison Murray is a woman whose motherhood journey includes becoming a blended family, pregnancy and loss, adoption and a miracle. Murray’s story is as much a story of the journey to motherhood as it is a testament to faith and seeking professional support and resources unapologetically.  EBONY spoke with Murray to discuss her unique path to motherhood and to hear the lessons she has learned from her journey to motherhood.  EBONY: What was your journey to motherhood?  Alison Murray: My journey to motherhood is not what I dreamed it would be. I had it all planned out in my mind after I got married. Dwayne [her husband] and I would wait a couple of years and then start growing our family. What I wasn't thinking or appreciating at the time was the fact that I became a mother the moment I got married, as I gained my bonus son, Deuce. So, as planned, we waited a few years and then started trying to conceive. The desert that I would find myself in over the next seven years would be so devastating, I seriously doubted whether motherhood would be a reality for me. After four second-trimester miscarriages, one infant loss, and the miracle of our two sons (one through adoption and the other live birth), I can humbly say that my journey to motherhood has been one fraught with so many trials but ultimately one of triumph.  What led to your decision to adopt?  The decision to adopt came after our second pregnancy loss. I was sitting in church while a presentation was being given about adoption and fundraising to support birthmothers associated with a local adoption agency. My stepson gave me a hard jab to my ribs and then a not-so-secretive nod to the pulpit. Dwayne was in the choir loft, so I had no idea what he was thinking. However, after church, we started to have an initial discussion about what going down the path of adoption would mean for our family. It was not a backup plan or a second option. We desperately wanted to add to our family, and we were presented with a way that we honestly hadn't considered. The adoption process is not for the faint of heart, and we learned and are still learning that the process is a challenging one.  How did you overcome miscarriages and loss during your journey?  I didn't. I'm still not over them. Even when I was finally able to give birth to my son, the scars of that time and trauma remain. After Joshua died, the doctors forced me to take a break from trying. That was a very difficult space to be in. I was 35 and thought that the door was closing. What I held onto was that Joshua was the first child to survive, albeit a short time outside my body. Joshua was God's promise that Malachi was coming. That's why I advocate so heavily for mental health for those dealing with infertility, grief, and bereavement from pregnancy loss and infant loss. Therapy saved my marriage and my life. It gave me space to work out all my thoughts and emotions. To be quite honest, I still don't attend baby showers. It's a personal preference. One of my mantras is ""Protect my space and Protect my peace"". Gently declining things like baby showers are how I accomplish that. But I still make sure the momma-to-be gets an awesome gift.  What words of encouragement or advice would you offer to other women on a similar journey to motherhood?  No journey is the same. In the valleys or the desert, it's okay not to be okay. Try to hold on to ""your happy"". Most importantly, lean on Romans 8:28. He hasn't failed me yet, and I know He won't fail you either.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVib255LmNvbS9hbGlzb24tbXVycmF5LXN0b3J5LW9mLXByZWduYW5jeS1sb3NzLWFuZC1hZG9wdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""We got admitted to Addenbrooke’s two weeks before she was actually born. When she started to struggle inside me and her heart rate was dropping, the doctors decided to deliver her early.  ""We knew that she was going to be a low birth weight, but we didn’t expect her to be extremely low, weighing only 530 grammes.  Winnie-Rae was born 13 weeks earlier than planned, Supplied (Image: Supplied)  ""When she arrived, we were told there was a low chance that she would survive, which is obviously hard to hear for parents.""  Miss Holroyd said that Winnie-Rae's loud cry during the delivery gave her hope that everything was going to be well.  She added: ""When I saw her for the first time, she looked like a little bird fallen out of the nest, all just skin and bone.  Winnie-Rae was born 13 weeks earlier than planned, Supplied (Image: Supplied)  ""We were just told that we had to take it hour by hour.""  The parents stayed at a charity-run hotel at Addenbrooke's Hospital and were supported by other family members.  Winnie-Rae is nothing but a fighter, battling chronic lung disease and metabolic bone disease, a large PDA (hole in the heart), Klebsiella sepsis, among an array of serious challenges.  Her mum added that Winnie-Rae made a huge improvement under the care of Ipswich Hospital staff.  Then the big day came, Wednesday, May 3, when the family was able to take Winnie-Rae home - more than 200 days after she was born.  Winnie-Rae's parents celebrated that day by getting engaged, after going through one of the toughest journeys parents can experience.  Miss Holroyd added they are very happy that their daughter is home after spending more than half a year in hospitals but are also a bit scared of not having nurses’ support 24/7.  She added: ""It's just that worry of her getting ill because she's so small and she's still on the oxygen support.  ""She’s got a feeding tube and stoma, which is a lot for a parent to take in.  ""She’ll need her oxygen support until her lungs grow enough.  ""We've been told that she can potentially come off that when she’s two.

Winnie-Rae's great aunt, Astra Sansiviero, opened an online fundraising to celebrate her 40th birthday and to say a big ‘thank you’ for the help the family received from Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust.  She said: ""This remarkable little one is super fierce and has the strength from her parents, who have been by her side all the way.  ""As a family, we are eternally grateful for the love, care, compassion, and kindness from all those who supported Winnie on this journey.

There was to be no miracle comeback from AC Milan as they lost 1-0 on the night against Inter and 3-0 on aggregate, crashing out in the semi-finals but also losing a fourth derby in a row against the Nerazzurri in which they did not score.  Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s goals in the first leg meant that a minor miracle was needed to reach the final in Istanbul next month, but it never came and Lautaro Martinez’s goal in the second half last night stamped Inter’s ticket.  Pioli spoke to Mediaset after the game to try and reflect on what was obviously a memorable run for the team deep into the competition, but another hurdle fallen at when it comes to their city rivals.  “It’s a big disappointment, let’s face it. We’ve had a great journey in the Champions League yes, also thinking about what we did last year, but we wanted to get to the final because that counts. There is disappointment,” he said (via MilanNews).  “Unfortunately we conditioned this semi-final with the first 15 minutes of the first leg, then for the rest we were up to a very strong team.  “We had two chances to reopen the tie I can’t reproach my players for anything. We tried with everything we had. Now we have to finish the season well, it would be a shame…  “The regrets are clearly for the first few minutes of the first leg, but then Inter won both games, not really dominating. Today much more similar to the second half of the first leg. Then we didn’t manage to score.  “We were doing well with positions, we lacked quality and precision. I was preparing changes and we conceded, then the match was almost over there.  “We weren’t able to be as dangerous as we usually are, due to Inter’s compactness and a pace and precision that should have been better.  “We tried today, but we weren’t as precise and composed. Inter in these matches scored against us with their first chances, we weren’t able to do the same thing.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGlvbGlfcmVmbGVjdHNfb25fYmlnX2Rpc2FwcG9pbnRtZW50X29mX3VjbF9leGl0X2ludGVyX3dvbl9ib3RoX2dhbWVzX25vdF9yZWFsbHlfZG9taW5hdGluZy9zMV8xNTk2NV8zODgyMjUyN9IBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1wL3Bpb2xpX3JlZmxlY3RzX29uX2JpZ19kaXNhcHBvaW50bWVudF9vZl91Y2xfZXhpdF9pbnRlcl93b25fYm90aF9nYW1lc19ub3RfcmVhbGx5X2RvbWluYXRpbmcvczFfMTU5NjVfMzg4MjI1Mjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an “absolute miracle.”  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  “He drove off. He’s depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. “He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.”  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil’s Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.  He said he was not really depressed but that he felt down because times were bad in the world, according to the affidavit.  ""Asked if he felt suicidal, he said, ‘You know, not like a plan, not usually,’"" the affidavit said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2NvdXJ0LXJlY29yZC13aWZlLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZG9jdG9yLXB1cnBvc2VseS1kcm92ZS1mYW1pbHktOTk0MTE3NzbSAWtodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9VUy93aXJlU3RvcnkvY291cnQtcmVjb3JkLXdpZmUtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1kb2N0b3ItcHVycG9zZWx5LWRyb3ZlLWZhbWlseS05OTQxMTc3Ng?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Makeup legend Bobbi Brown’s Jones Road Beauty opens its new East Hampton store on Wednesday, May 17.  The new store, located at 55 Main Street, is the first on Long Island for the brand though Brown has long had a home in the Hamptons.  “I love to work where I live and really love living in Sag Harbor. It’s so relaxed,” Brown tells Behind The Hedges.  In fact, her new company’s name comes right from East Hampton.  “We had worked with some copywriters and were racking our brains on the name for weeks and nothing was sticking,” Brown remembers.  “Then one day, my husband and I were driving to the Hamptons and I was navigating. I looked down and there it was on the Waze navigation app: Jones Road. I immediately loved the name and so did my husband and the team. We checked to see if it was available and it was, so the brand became Jones Road. I’m also obsessed with all things British so I liked that it sounds like a bespoke UK brand.”  Jones Road was created with the philosophy that the world doesn’t need more beauty products but instead needs better beauty products. The clean, high-grade formulations are meant to work with every skin type and tone and are simple to use.  “I’m a makeup artist and I love formulating and creating new products,” explains Brown, who left her well-known namesake company in 2016 (Estée Lauder bought the company in 1995 and Brown stayed on with the company for nearly two decades. She is no longer affiliated or associated with Bobbi Brown Cosmetics or Bobbi Brown branded products).  “When I started working on Jones Road, I was thinking about what I wanted and what I know other women wanted because they were asking me on my social media channels. I was focused on creating a clean beauty brand that over-delivered on my expectations and Jones Road is it: an edited indispensable collection of clean, high-grade formulations designed for all ages, skin types and skin tones.”  Jones Road launched in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a direct-to-consumer cosmetics line. The flagship store opened in Montclair, New Jersey, where Brown and her husband also reside, in 2021 and there is also a store in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.  “When someone is wearing Jones Road, I want them to feel like themselves on their best day. The most powerful beauty product is self-confidence. I want our customers to feel good in their own skin, with just the right amount of makeup,” Brown says.  Brown says she set out to create the makeup equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife, “products that were clean, easy to use and multi-purpose that worked for any skin type or skin tone.” Many of the products fit that description, but her favorite is the Miracle Balm, “a one-of-a-kind game-changing product.” It’s now available in nine shades.  “On my social channels, I do a lot of educational content about Miracle Balm to show consumers how to use it. You use your fingers to press into the balm, breaking the seal so all the emollients mix into the formula. Then, you just rub your fingers together and pat the Miracle Balm onto your cheeks and/or lips (for a subtle glow and to add luminosity). It makes you instantly look better,” she says.  “The Jones Road aesthetic — cool, clean beauty — aligns perfectly with the Hamptons vibe,” Brown says. “It’s hard to find the perfect space so when we saw this location open up, we jumped on it. We love the neighborhood, it’s one of my favorite alleyways. We’re so looking forward to opening our doors.”  Several launches are planned this month. Jones Road recently released a lab sample of its first fragrance called “Shower” and it sold out within 48 hours – not to worry, though, Brown says it will be back on the shelves this fall. Jones Road is also introducing a collection of tinted powders later this month, just in time for the summer.  For Memorial Day weekend, the brand is releasing a limited-edition set of mini Miracle Balms “that I think will be gone in days,” Brown says. “We are so excited to launch a new bronzer this June.”  Email [email protected] with further comments, questions, or tips.

The town council has agreed to give Kerry Irving, who has a massive global following online for his escapades with his spaniels, the highest order of merit the local authority can give.  The Freedom of the Town is given to someone who is, in the opinion of the council, a person of distinction and has rendered eminent services to the local area.  There is no material honour or special privilege attached, although historically there was and these are now symbolic.  He will be bestowed with the honour at a special ceremony to be held at Hope Park – the home of the statue of Mr Irving’s beloved spaniel Max – on Friday May 26 at 1.30pm.  Max died last year but has left a huge legacy behind. The popular dog was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE – the PDSA Order of Merit – and raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities and supported people through the Covid-19 pandemic through social media updates of adventures with Mr Irving in the Lake District.  Mr Irving credits Max for turning his life around after a traffic collision left him with chronic pain and unable to walk as well as mental health issues.  There will be a short council meeting at the park to confirm that the authority will confer the honour, and then the mayor, Cllr Steve Harwood, will present Mr Irving with the Freedom Scroll before a short speech is delivered.  Council clerk Vivien Little said the honour was being conferred on Mr Irving because he had raised the profile of the town so much, had done incredible work for charity and for Hope Park.  He had also done a huge amount to bring mental health issues to the forefront nationally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vY3VtYnJpYWNyYWNrLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L21heC10aGUtbWlyYWNsZS1kb2ctb3duZXIta2VycnktaXJ2aW5nLXRvLWJlLWdpdmVuLWZyZWVkb20tb2YtbGFrZS1kaXN0cmljdC10b3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Christ is Risen!  Once again we are assembled for the Clergy Laity Assembly of the Holy Metropolis of New Jersey. I have just returned from a pilgrimage to the Patriarchate of Alexandria, and I would share some of the inspiration that all of the pilgrims – received, from His Beatitude Patriarch Theodore, from the faithful clergy, and the lay leaders we encountered.  For this ancient and venerable Church – founded by the Apostle and Evangelist Mark himself, has embraced a healthy and positive zeal for mission throughout Africa, despite the many and arduous challenges She faces.  As we engage today on behalf of our Metropolis, with many reports and useful information, I will uphold the example of our Alexandrian brethren, to inspire our labors to even greater heights. They serve an entire continent, and for their fidelity to the canonical order of the Church, they have endured an uncanonical invasion of their rightful ecclesiastical domain by the Russian Church. This unfortunate state of affairs speaks to the righteousness of the Alexandrian cause; for they suffer for standing with our Most Holy Ecumenical Patriarchate, by supporting the independence and autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Against such pressures, our problems cannot loom very large, for we are blessed to live in a country of freedom and prosperity. And the Metropolis of New Jersey is a network of successful communities who receive great benefits, merely by being American.  Therefore, today as we consider all the items on our agenda, I want all of us to keep our Alexandrian brothers and sisters in mind. They do not allow a paucity of resources to keep them from ministry. They not only make do with what they have, they multiply the effects of their ministries through their love and devotion. They take the little, and they turn it into the great. Much like our Lord Jesus Christ did when He fed the Five Thousand.  Everyone remembers the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, the only miracle to occur in all Four Gospels. There are two ways to look at it. First, we can easily say that for the Lord, Who created Heaven and Earth, to multiply five loaves and two fishes to feed the thousands, would have surely have been simple. But there is another way to think about this miracle.  Perhaps, when the young boy offered all that he had – and I note here the detail from the Gospel of John, that the boy’s loaves were of the poorest quality – perhaps the people who witnessed his pure offering were inspired. Perhaps many of those thousands had brought food with them, that day, but were keeping it hidden only for themselves. When they witnessed the generosity, and the Lord’s blessing, their hearts were freed to be generous with others. I am not saying that one version is better or worse than the other. But I think you will all agree with me. We can consider them both miracles.  Therefore, when I consider the wonders of community building, of missionary activity, and all the superb efforts of the Patriarchate of Alexandria on behalf of all Africa, I see a similar miracle. They are doing so very much with so very little. And here in the God-saved Metropolis of New Jersey, we are no different, except our resources are certainly more abundant. What is needed is to maintain and augment our generosity of spirit, our capacities to love and forgive, our commitment to philanthropy and compassion. The blessings of this Metropolis are self-evident: outstanding clergy and lay leadership, established communities, and a desire to live the Gospel.  Let us then, my beloved sisters and brothers in the Risen Lord, take inspiration from our brethren across the sea. And let us apply ourselves at every stage of Church life with the same passion and the energy that is transforming Africa.  We have every advantage. We have every opportunity. With God’s help, and through the intercessions of His Holy Mother and those of the Metropolis’ heavenly patron, Saint John Chrysostom, we shall succeed.

Now, the mom is recalling the thrilling experience.  Milsom, 29, is already mom to Leon, 13. She and her beau, Paul, got engaged in May 2020, eager to see their family grow.  But an ectopic pregnancy and a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can affect fertility, dashed her hopes of a baby.  A human one, that is.  While Zoe Milsom was pregnant, Beau curled up on her belly and rarely left her side. Jam Press  Milsom and Beau experienced losses — a void that baby Alfie helped fill. Jam Press  The couple soon welcomed Beau, the French bulldog, into their home as their beloved “fur baby.”  “She was the second child I never had and quickly became one of the family, going on holidays and any trips with us,” Milsom told Jam Press.  Her 2022 pregnancy, then, came as quite the shock, as did Beau’s seven months later.  “I couldn’t believe we were going to be mommies together,” Milsom gushed.  For Milsom, Alfie was a miracle after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy and believing she’d never conceive another child naturally. Jam Press  While the couple weren’t “very happy” about their pup’s pregnancy because it “definitely wasn’t the right time,” they welcomed the challenge.  “I was very excited, as the feeling of being a mom is amazing,” she continued. “It’s a new life being brought into the world — or in her case, nine — and we planned on keeping at least one puppy for her to have a motherly bond with.”  Milsom couldn’t wait to see how Beau interacted with Alfie, who was born in November 2022, after the pup cozied up to her belly for nine months.  Two weeks after Alfie arrived, Beau gave birth to a litter of nine, but none of them survived due to complications from an infection.  Beau and Alfie are best buds now. Jam Press  “I understood her pain having lost a baby of my own,” Milsom said, recalling how forlorn Beau appeared as she moped around the house. “I couldn’t stop crying, and I tried all I could to save them, but nothing worked.  “I felt like I had let my little girl down, as she had gone through all of that for nothing — it was heartbreaking,” she added.  While Beau has since been spayed, her bond with little Alfie is “amazing.”  “It’s amazing seeing them together, as she protects him with her mothering instincts and sees him as one of her own,” Milsom said of her “miracles.”  “I look at them both everyday, and my eyes fill with tears because of how in love and proud I am of my two little babies,” said Milsom. Jam Press  When Alfie cries, Beau attempts to soothe him by licking his face. Jam Press  When Alfie cries, Beau soothingly licks his face and often “falls asleep with him at night.”  Where Beau filled a void for Milsom, Alfie is doing the same for the Frenchie.  “I’m so grateful for both of them, they’re miracles,” Milsom said.  “I look at them both everyday, and my eyes fill with tears because of how in love and proud I am of my two little babies.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2ktZ290LXByZWduYW50LWF0LXRoZS1zYW1lLXRpbWUtYXMtbXktZG9nLXdlcmUtYW1hemluZy1tb21zLXRvZ2V0aGVyL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2ktZ290LXByZWduYW50LWF0LXRoZS1zYW1lLXRpbWUtYXMtbXktZG9nLXdlcmUtYW1hemluZy1tb21zLXRvZ2V0aGVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — WNY has played a huge role in celebrating the history and preserving the future of one of New York State's most iconic recreational areas, the site of two Olympic games, Lake Placid.  In February of 2020, Daybreak took you up for the start of what was then a $100 million renovation, but ultimately the project grew to a $550 million overhaul spanning several years, modernizing 6 different venues (five in the Adirondacks and one in the Catskills) as well as the construction of a new administration building for the Olympic Regional Development Authority in Lake Placid. Now that it is complete, the upgrades are getting high marks.  At this year's Miracle On Ice fantasy camp, the men behind the miracle, like former Sabres' captain, Mike Ramsey, got their first peak at the renovated complex.  ""It's a wonderful town, it's a pretty cool place to visit and obviously it holds a pretty special place in my heart,"" Ramsey said.  This project wasn't just a fresh coat of paint and new furniture, it was a restoration and reimagining of all of the sites, bringing them back to international competition standards, and beyond. Among the projects, Whiteface, Belleayre & Gore Mountains received updates to snowmaking, electrical, lodge, lift improvements or replacements, and E-groomers.  At the Olympic Jumping Complex they built Intervales Lodge, added new LED lighting, elevated deck, frost rails and in-run reinforcements, elevator replacement, gondola, and summer surfaces. It is now the only facility in North America certified for summer and winter training and competition. At the Olympic Center they added LED lighting, 1932 and 1980 arenas modernization, Oval modernization, refrigeration plant, e-zamboni’s, a new public space called Miracle Plaza, and a brand new Lake Placid and Olympic Museum.  Among the biggest investments was at Mt. Van Hoevenberg, where they built a new 55,000 square foot building called the Mountain Pass Lodge, along with new snowmaking, electrical improvements, a biathlon stadium, e-groomer, roller loops and roadway paving, Nordic competition trails, and even a mountain coaster. The facility also features the nation's only indoor refrigerated bobsled and luge start track.  All of this work, has a strong Queen City footprint, beginning with the original architectural design work, done by the Buffalo team of CannonDesign. Jamie Graham says it is a project that will stay with her.  ""It's a once in a lifetime project. A project with so much history. It was really great just to see that from beginning all the way through the end and when it opened back up.""  Buffalo's Hadley Exhibits brought much of that work to life, in one of the new centerpieces, the Olympic museum.  ""It was a lot to start with and I never really thought about 1932. There was a whole 'nother game"" company president Ted Johnson. He said this was definitely a project of passion said.  ""It was such an emotional connection, remembering where I was for the miracle on ice. My mother never showed emotion and there she is and she's crying and I'll never forget that.""  Another WNY connection came with the pennants on the wall in the museum. The recreations are the handy work of Buffalo's own Oxford Pennant.  There is history all around, but the mission here was to celebrate that history and replace the artifacts that were still in use, like the mechanics in the Olympic Center's refrigeration plant, that supports the ice surfaces of three indoor rinks and the outdoor speed skating oval. It was the same system that was in use when Herb Brooks' team won gold, and Eric Heiden took home 5 gold medals during the 1980 games.  Facilities Superintendent Eric Martin, a Rochester native, says he was having to get very creative to even keep things going.  ""It was old and dated. I was finding parts on eBay, hot-wiring things here and there, the parts just weren't available,"" Martin said.  Olympic Center General Manager Chadd Cassidy, who grew up right next door to the center, says this is about keeping the facilities sustainable for the next 50 years or more.  ""We can do everything that we did before, but we do it a lot better,"" Cassidy said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Z3J6LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGVsZXZpc2lvbi9wcm9ncmFtcy9kYXlicmVhay93bnktY29tcGFuaWVzLWhlbHAtcHJlc2VydmUtbGFrZS1wbGFjaWRzLWxlZ2FjeS1vbHltcGljcy83MS1mMmI4NGJiMy0yM2E5LTQxZTctODg0OC0xZjFmNTY5ODNjN2HSAawBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2dyei5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90ZWxldmlzaW9uL3Byb2dyYW1zL2RheWJyZWFrL3dueS1jb21wYW5pZXMtaGVscC1wcmVzZXJ2ZS1sYWtlLXBsYWNpZHMtbGVnYWN5LW9seW1waWNzLzcxLWYyYjg0YmIzLTIzYTktNDFlNy04ODQ4LTFmMWY1Njk4M2M3YQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Psalms 34: 18 KJV  Today we celebrate the life of our beloved Cynthia Denise “Footsie” Travis, a wonderful daughter, loving mother and grandmother, a beautiful sister, aunt, Godmother, cousin and friend.  On May 7th, 2023, as the sun begin to set, Cynthia transitioned from this Earthly Realm in the comforts of her home in Benton Harbor, Michigan. She was employed by JVIS Manufacturing, Benton Harbor Michigan for several years where she worked in numerous capacities.  Cynthia graced the world with her presence on November 11, 1960, to the proud parents of Delores Carter Travis and Bill Robinson in Berrien Center, Michigan. She was coined with the nickname “Footsie” by a family friend. She was short in stature, yet she had the heart of a giant.  Cynthia accepted Christ as her personal savior at an early age under the spiritual guidance of Reverend C. L. Woodson at Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church, where she was a member of the youth choir and was crowned many times as the Tom Thumb Queen. She enjoyed spending time with family and friends and she never met a stranger.  Cynthia received her formal education in the Benton Harbor Area Schools District and was a proud graduate of the Benton Harbor High School class of 1978 in which she remained a faithful member.  Cynthia was formerly employed at Mercy Hospital as a Pharmacy Tech (her 1st job), the Manager of Burger King for many years, and Wollin Products where she received her miracle child.  Upon graduation, Cynthia enlisted in the United States Army where she proudly served as PFC Cynthia Denise Travis, and upon completion of her tour she became a member of the Michigan Army National Guard where she served for many years. She would often celebrate with fellow soldiers and Captain Newton, whom she loved and respected dearly.  In 1986 she married the love of her life, Mr. Leonard Brock, and to this union a precious little girl was born whom they affectionately named Lenesha Denise.  Cynthia continued living life her way and as graduation was drawing near for Lenesha, she showed us once again that her story would be told her way. To all of our surprise Cynthia and Eddie French welcomed a miracle, literally, and what better way to express their gratitude as the name of their new bundle of joy, their baby girl, Miracle Denise Delores Travis. A special thank you to God and an honor to her Mother and Miracle’s grandmother, the late Mrs. Delores Carter.  Cynthia loved her girls Lenesha and Miracle, with her whole heart and adored her grandchildren Dontrall, DeAndre, Jamylah and Jaylen.  Cynthia was an awesome sister to all of her siblings and the bond she shared with each of them was established at an early age, as Mama Delores made sure of that.  Cynthia enjoyed life and lived it unapologetically. She told her story, her way.  Cynthia would often say that “she was tired and I’m going to go lay down” and in true “Footsie” fashion, this time she meant it. Her favorite song in which she sang as a child was “I Shall Wear A Crown”. It is our prayer that our Lord and Saviour heard her plea.  Our dearly beloved Cynthia Denise, we will cherish the many memories and hold dear in our hearts your love and kindred spirit, you’re free.  She leaves precious memories to be cherished in the hearts of her daughters: Lenesha Travis and Miracle Travis of Benton Harbor, MI and Gwendolyn Williams Wallace of Indianapolis, IN.

It’s an aptly bold reintroduction for the artist’s first real statement since coming out as gay and nonbinary, and following their big move from Nashville to New York. Titled “Cheerleader,” the release sees Anne redefine themselves with a queer anthem and accompanying visual to reclaim nostalgic environments that often leave out LGBTQ+ people.  From bouncing through choreo with pom poms in-hand to making out passionately in the bleachers, the entire video is a power-pop run through every classic high school scenario — only in Anne’s world the misfits are centered and popular kids are all pushed to the side. This, for Anne and their castmates like co-star Eva Victor , “became a therapeutic catharsis” and led to a much “lighter feeling” after all was said and done. And this joy is palpable, with Anne repeating the sunny hook, “I’ll be your cheerleader,” amidst other satisfying “woo’s!” and a pitched down “chic electric!”  ""The Gay Miracle"" — A Poem by Liza Anne  There is so much found in a sacred beginning.  Maybe the most sacred thing is when you realize it’s not a beginning at all.  My nose pressed to the glass of all the moments in yesterday when  my body, my love, my spirit, my language, my perspective, my emotions  all hinted at, nearly screamed towards, what I only recently had full context for.  The miraculous slow uncovering of what has been pulsing in me since birth  The slow melt into oneself - finally and on time.  That is the gay miracle ...  to notice - and deeper, still ... to recognize  not because it is new but because it is ancient.  As known in your earthly body as breath and a window into the great celestial  A promise that everything everywhere is expanding and healing and there are seconds  Second chances, second winds, second childhoods.  We are the conscious plant, aware of their growing, blooming from the soil of those around us saying  “I see you and when you are ready, you will, too.”  That patient, generous holding that comes from a community who understands - with a sobering weight - the process of becoming.  I am here now because I have been loved in a way that makes sense to me.  I am not scared anymore - I am comforted by the context that comes with the miracle of being gay.  Every second that goes by, I understand more.  The grief I felt, the discomfort, the itchy skin because clothes felt wrong  How hugging my friends flushed my face pink and gave me a fever  How many times I felt almost, not quite - othered within either.  And all of the sudden I look around at the piles of pain  Cataloguing what didn’t seem related  And I am healing.  Being gay is a miracle.  Wherever there has been loss, ten fold it is recovered in the undeniable sense of belonging that comes with it.  Leaning into the parts of myself that felt other and finding a deeper sense of home - that is the gay miracle.  Coming around the corner to a second childhood - that is the gay miracle.  Holding each other in a way that can only bloom from what has been historically and secretly shared - that is the gay miracle.  It is the quiet self being given a megaphone, finally.  It is another childhood but this time with what you needed, tenfold.  It’s the truth put on and danced around in.  It is the constant wonder of softening, lightening, opening, widening - it is the conversation I want to be having over and over again.  My movement towards joy holds hands with, is twisted up with and completely meshed with being gay.  One couldn’t happen without the other. I am so happy to be here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVybWFnLmNvbS9saXphLWFubmUtY2hlZXJsZWFkZXItMjY2MDI4MzM2Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Addressing the media at the PHU office, at Etul Kotte, MP Gammanpila said that having made controversial remarks regarding Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism, ‘Pastor’ Fernando couldn’t be allowed to continue with his sowing of discord with other religions.  ‘Pastor’ Fernando flew out of Bandaranaike International Airport, on May 14. After President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s directive to investigate ‘Pastor’ Fernando, over his recent statements, he announced his intention to come back home over the coming weekend.  ‘Pastor Fernando’ declared open the ‘Miracle Dome,’ built at a cost of Rs. 3 bn, about a year ago. The construction of the state-of-the-art building was launched in 2015. The Catholic Church has denounced ‘Pastor’ Fernando, while urging tangible measures against him.  Attorney-at-Law Gammanpila said that ‘Pastor’ Fernando, who calls himself a ‘prophet’, should be dealt with under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Lawmaker Gammanpila said that actually ‘Pastor’ Fernando had caused more harm to Catholics by his ‘miracles’ and utterances than to other religions.  Explaining how ICCPR applied in ‘pastor’ Fernando’s case, MP Gammanpila said that if found guilty he could face a prison term of up to 10 years. The former minister urged the police to take a court order to ban ‘prayers’ at the Miracle Dome as the failure to do so could create an environment for violence.  The MP said that if the police failed to act, they would be forced to launch protests against ‘Miracle Dome’ gatherings.  The MP told The Island that the police should investigate whether ‘pastor’ Fernando deliberately insulted other religions to cause a violent backlash. “We have had experience of catastrophic situations as a result of violence inspired by people. We shouldn’t allow that to happen again,” the MP said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHA6Ly9pc2xhbmQubGsvdWRheWEtZGVtYW5kcy1oYWx0LXRvLXByYXllcnMtYXQtbWlyYWNsZS1kb21lLWFycmVzdC1vZi1wYXN0b3ItamVyb21lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But the Englishman's fireworks failed to lift the Punjab Kings which slumped to a 15-run defeat to the already-eliminated Delhi Capitals in its make-or-break IPL game in Dharamsala on Wednesday.  The defeat was a biter pill to swallow for the Kings who have been now pushed to the brink of elimination by a team that miraculously rediscovered its batting mojo.  With nothing but pride to play for, Delhi put on 213 for two on the board on the back of South African Rilee Rossouw's stunning 82 off 37 balls.  Even skipper David Warner was fluent during his 31-ball 46.  And the enigmatic Prithvi Shaw, playing his first match in almost a month, returned to form with a sparkling 38-ball 54.  If only these batters had come up with efforts like these in the early stages of the tournament, Delhi would still have been in the race for the playoffs.  But their stroke-filled knocks have now dealt a huge blow to the Punjab Kings' hopes of making the playoffs.  With just 12 points from 13 matches, the Kings are still in with a mathematical chance.  On Friday, Shikhar Dhawan's team will take on Rajasthan Royals, another team on 12 points from 13 games, in another make-or-break game.  The winner of that clash is still unlikely to get into the playoffs as the Royal Challengers Bangalore (12 points from 12 games) would take a big step forward if it beats the Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday.  The RCB would then qualify if it beats the Gujarat Titans, the first team to reach the playoffs on Sunday and Mumbai Indians (14 points from 13 matches) loses to Sunrisers Hyderabad on the same day.  Among the teams battling for the remaining three playoff spots, Chennai Super Kings (15 points from 13 matches) and Lucknow Super Giants (15 points from 13 matches) are comparatively better placed.  But none of these team can take anything for granted when they play their final league matches on Saturday when Chennai takes on Delhi and Lucknow faces Kolkata Knight Riders (12 points from 13 matches), who is still not out of the race.

"miracle","2014-04-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:10:41","Two Healing Miracles for Sainthood  ST 4142 Miracles 2  Two healing miracles. That’s how many it takes to be dubbed a “saint.” Are you a saint? I’m not.  In this Patheos column, we plan to ask: would a scientific confirmation of a miraculous healing help us in determining sainthood? What do you think? Let’s explore the question.  How do Roman Catholics understand miracles?  If you’re a Roman Catholic you’ll likely think of miracles as…  “…wonders performed by supernatural power as signs of some special mission or gift and explicitly ascribed to God…. Hence the miracle is called supernatural, because the effect is beyond the productive power of nature and implies supernatural agency.”  In short, a miracle is a proof of sorts, a proof that God is at work. We read in the Catechism of the Catholic Church how miracles provide evidence to tantalize our rational sensibility.  “Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints, prophecies, the Church’s growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability are the most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence of all; they are “motives of credibility” (motiva credibilitatis), which show that the assent of faith is by no means a blind impulse of the mind” (Vatican 2003, 1.1.3.156.).  So, let’s wonder out loud: might we examine miracles scientifically? Especially, might we examine scientifically the two or more healing miracles each saint performs?  After all, Pope Francis enlists science in the service of rendering a theological judgment. “The process of Saints’ Causes moves from the scientific evaluation of the Medical Council or technical experts to a theological examination.” So, may I respectfully ask about a scientific investigation into healing miracles?  Let’s ask Cardinal William Joseph Levada  I got my chance to ask this question. It was during a meeting of the CTNS (Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences) board one Saturday in late Spring 2014. Seated next to me at the meeting was fellow board member, Cardinal William Joseph Levada (1936-2019).  The cardinal was the right person to ask. Not only was he interested in the interaction between faith and science, but he had also served as Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Vatican from 2005 to 2012. And, only a few weeks prior to our conversation, on April 27, 2014, Pope Saint John Paul II along with Pope Saint John XXIII had been canonized. This meant the investigation of Pope Saint John Paul II’s two miracles had recently concluded, something the Cardinal would likely know all about.  The Two Healing Miracles of Pope Saint John Paul II  In the case of Pope Saint John Paul II, one miracle involved a French nun, Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, who had suffered from Parkinson’s Disease. In 2005, her congregation prayed to the pontiff in heaven to intercede on her behalf. She was then healed.  The second miracle involved Florabeth Mora of Costa Rica who was healed of an otherwise fatal brain aneurysm. The healing, she said, was the result of John Paul’s intercession during prayer.  These claims were investigated by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The results of the investigations were then reported to Pope Francis, who promulgated the canonization decree.  How did Cardinal Levada answer?  With this in mind, during coffee break I asked Cardinal Levada about the two healing miracles this way: “do you think the investigation into the veracity of these miracle claims counts as an example of science serving faith?”  Our conversation took two coffee breaks to follow the long, long train of logic: could scientific investigation confirm or disconfirm that God had acted miraculously? Or, to be more precise, could science determine that what happened “can only be attributed to divine intervention”?  Finally, the Cardinal demurred. “No, I don’t think so.”  “Why?” I pressed.  “Because in almost all cases we’re talking about healing miracles. And healing miracles are especially difficult. They’re ambiguous. It’s difficult to distinguish between a supernatural cure and a spontaneous remission. Even after medical investigation, it’s not crystal clear exactly what was responsible for the healing.”  I was reminded of my friend Paul Lange who would describe healing miracles prosaically as examples of the freak rate.  Jesus’ miracles were unconvincing.  Not everyone who witnesses a miracle is persuaded by what they see. Even Jesus’ miracles were ambiguous to some viewers. In the healing miracle of the man with the withered hand, for example, Jesus only raised the ire of the Scribes and Pharisees.  On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. The scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. Even though he knew what they were thinking, he said to the man who had the withered hand, ‘Come and stand here.’ He got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, ‘I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to destroy it?’ After looking around at all of them, he said to him, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ He did so, and his hand was restored. But they [Scribes and Pharisees] were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus. (Luke 6:6-10)  The Scribes and Pharisees witnessed exactly what others witnessed. But, they could not believe that the healings had come from God. So, they began to plot against Jesus.  I gather we should conclude with Cardinal Levada: healing miracles are ambiguous. Regardless of what you perceive objectively, you can still subjectively deny that divine power had anything to do with it.  Conclusion  Is this the best definition of miracles? Miracles are ”wonders performed by supernatural power as signs of some special mission or gift and explicitly ascribed to God.”  I think the problem is with the phrase, “explicitly ascribed to God.” In the case of Jesus and in the case of Pope Saint John Paul II, the healing miracles remain ambiguous to those who witness and to those who investigate them.  Here’s where we have been and where we are going.  Patheos ST 4141 How to see a miracle? Miracles 1  Patheos ST 4142 Two Healing Miracles for Sainthood. Miracles 2  Patheos ST 4143 Hume on Miracles.

It was the call she and her family had been praying for: the hospital found a kidney that would match Charlene’s daughter, MaryAshley.  “Within a few minutes of getting the call, our faculty jumped in,” said Charlene, who works at a school in Charleston, South Carolina. “One of the teachers got on the computer and got us a flight booked [to LA.] Our principal went out and stopped the traffic so we can get out.”  There’s a reason the community jumped to action as soon as the Barbots got the news that a kidney is available for MaryAshely. It took 10 years to find a kidney that would be suitable for the 19-year-old.  Get Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.  Born with a kidney defect as well as developmental delays and speech/hearing impairments, MaryAshley had her first kidney transplant surgery before her second birthday. Several years later, her body rejected the donated organ, so the family had to resume the grueling journey of looking for a donor for Ashely.  “We knew at that point the possibility of another transplant was slim to none,” Charlene says. “Close to 400 people tried to be living donors for her. We went down that road for 10 years. Hundreds of people tried to be donors for years including family, but no one was a match.”  Because MaryAshley has unusually high levels of antibodies in her blood, her system would fight and reject any new organ into her body.  “There are what I call ‘good’ antibodies and ‘not-so-good’ antibodies,” explains Dr. Dechu Puliyanda, a pediatric nephrologist who has been taking care of MaryAshley. “Good antibodies like COVID fight off infections. But like in MaryAshley’s case, when you have antibodies against another person, it means if that person gives you the kidney, those antibodies will attack the kidney immediately.”  When MaryAshley turned to the Cedar Sinai’s transplant program for help a decade ago, the extent of her antibodies was 99.9%, which is why she could not get any donors.  Fast-forward to now, it’s been seven months since MaryAshley had a kidney transplant at Cedars Sinai. Her medical team believes all the signs are pointing the right direction.  “I got a call from the biopsy, saying there was no rejection. My jaw fell off,” Dr. Puliyanda recalls. “It was a big miracle.”  With a new lease on life, MaryAshley doesn’t want to miss a beat in everything she does, according to her mom.  “She has far more energy than we do. She doesn’t want to waste a second of it,” Charlene says. “She’s always asking me, ‘What are we going to do tomorrow? What are we doing the next day?’ She’s ready to take on the world every day.”  In her quest to finding joy in everything in life, MaryAshley has been keeping busy. After attending her first prom, where she was a nominated as a prom queen runner-up, the teen also had her first job-shadowing experience by observing nurses at her school.

"miracle","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""English"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:00:50","Home Reviews Grace Thomas May 17th, 2023 - 8:00 AM  Energetic, experimental, genre-blending  Nearing their 30th anniversary, San Francisco experimental group Deerhoof have a long history of bold artistic choices. While most aptly described as noise-punk, the band has dabbled in a wide range of styles over the years, from jazz to psychedelia to contemporary classical. It’s no surprise that Miracle-Level, their newest album, is so electric with creative risks.  In many ways, Miracle-Level is a typical Deerhoof album – from the first bars of “Sit Down, Let Me Tell You a Story”, listeners are met with needle-sharp electric guitar, jagged riffs playfully warring with the softness of the vocals, set to a backdrop of machine-gun drums. In other ways, Miracle-Level is entirely different: most notably, the entire album is in singer Satomi Matsuzaki’s native Japanese.  When asked for the reasoning behind this choice, band members have cited both a desire to appeal to the rising popularity of J-rock in English-speaking countries and the desire to reject English, the language of “the world’s policemen.” While certainly unconventional, this double-edged philosophy works perfectly for a band so skilled at striking delicate balances as Deerhoof.  The overall sound of Miracle-Level is energetic and rock-forward, but songs often fall into gaps of contemplative silence or dissolve into silly rock n roll riffs as in “My Lovely Cat!”, switching their tempo and energy at the drop of a hat. Unlike more traditional punk (including earlier work by Deerhoof), the clean and simple production of Miracle-Level gives a sharp, art-pop feeling to the album, in the same way that a paint-splattered canvas might look refined when placed in a frame.  If there’s a major gripe to be had with Miracle-Level, it’s that the album isn’t exactly approachable. Between its frantic instrumentation and wild melody lines, the experience of listening all the way through feels kind of like sitting in a speeding car without a seatbelt on. Frequently, songs break down midway through and collapse into spiraling, repetitive riffs, a motif that may grow tiresome to some listeners by the end of the album.  Luckily, Deerhoof has a talent for apportioning breathers. “The Poignant Melody” and “The Little Maker” take down the tempo, offering a bluesy sound that highlights the wavery charm of Matsuzaki’s vocals, and “Miracle-Level” begins as a soft piano ballad, a welcome relief after the thrash and clamor of “Jet-Black Double-Shield.” When the energy builds so high as to become grating, Deerhoof knows how to pull it back down just as skillfully as they ratchet it up.  However, even these songs don’t give listeners full respite. Just as the more punk-forward songs on the album insist on complexity, the more mellow songs still carry a certain tension. Though uneasy high notes and dissonant, echoey piano chords prevent the listener from finding true comfort, these choices give the album a sense of artistic cohesion. Even in its calmer moments, Miracle-Level is a live wire, a current thrumming beneath its surface.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbXVzaWMubXhkd24uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvcmV2aWV3cy9hbGJ1bS1yZXZpZXctZGVlcmhvb2YtbWlyYWNsZS1sZXZlbC_SAVNodHRwczovL211c2ljLm14ZHduLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3Jldmlld3MvYWxidW0tcmV2aWV3LWRlZXJob29mLW1pcmFjbGUtbGV2ZWwvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Friday, May 5th, UBS Group lowered their target price from $80.00 to $70.00. Raymond James had also lowered the target price from $92.00 to $86.00 on Thursday, May 4th while Stifel Nicolaus had lowered it from $80.00 to $78.00 on the same day with Barclays following suit on Wednesday, April 26th when they too reduced Scotts Miracle-Gro from an “overweight” rating to an “equal weight” rating thereby bringing down their price objective for the company from $105.00 to $70.00. Furthermore, Truist Financial had decreased their price objective on Scotts Miracle-Gro from $70.00 to $65.00 on Thursday, May 4th.  Interestingly though, four investment analysts have given Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock a hold rating while three gave it a buy rating with one offering it a strong buy rating delivering it with overall Moderate Buy consensus ratings coupled with a consensus price target of $76.29 as stated by Bloomberg.  Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock opened at $65.53 on Wednesday with its fifty-day simple moving average located at $70.88 and its two-hundred-day simple moving average situated at $65.38 as observed by financial indicators.This type of behavior is scaring some investors since this indicates an uncertainty about future revenue since the value has continually being adjusted downwards despite previous optimism.  However,it is important to note that Scotts Miracle-Gro has continued to demonstrate its resilience within its field of specialization;with major areas of focus including lawn care products,gardening services both for indoors spaces and landscape as well as hydroponic hardware and growing environments. The company has consistently offered valuable products and services to meet consumers’ needs.  Looking deeper into the recent news, it is observed that on Thursday, February 16th, EVP Denise Stump sold 2,503 shares of the stock at an average price of $86.51 thereby attaining a total transaction of $216,534.53. Following the sale,the executive vice president now directly owns 39,875 shares in the company valued approximately at $3,449,586.25.On Friday May 12,Ceo James Hagedorn sold 25,000 shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock price at an average value of $67 amounting to a net worth of $1,675,000.00.The Chief Executive Officer now directly owns 179,899 shares in the company equating to approximarely $12 million dollars.The transaction was disclosed in a document filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission through which valuable information can be obtained.Also,during this timeframe,EVP Denise Stump had sold an additional number of stocks.  The above data depicts instability since there is no statistical constant variation between value purchased or resold by executives,and its analysis reveals that insiders own 27.28% of the enterprise’s Shares.  Institutional investors and Hedge funds made several acquisitions and dispositions respectively in recent times.Subsequently,hedge fund owners have initiated series of negotiations leading to possible transactions with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.  Overall,it is important investors need to weigh various factors before making investment choices ,however it’s advisable not make any rush decisions solely upon seeing information about target pricing.A good understanding should be reached as pertaining to all relevant factors before any decision making thereby edifying one from mistakes that could culminate into financial loss.At last count around 69% percent ownership belonged to institutional investors and hedge funds,speaking volumes for vested interests in the stability of this stock.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdHN0b2Nrcy5jb20vc2NvdHRzLW1pcmFjbGUtZ3JvLXVwZ3JhZGVkLXRvLWhvbGQtcmF0aW5nLWFuZC1jL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Weekly injections of semaglutide were found to significantly reduce the weight of adolescents in a major trial of the new drug.  Experts said the findings support calls for children as young as 12 to be given the appetite-suppressing medicine, in a bid to drive down childhood obesity levels.  Researchers described the results of the treatment - which saw children lose an average of three stone - as ‘transformational for many teenagers.’  Almost half of 12 to 18-year-olds using the drug dropped below the clinical cut-off for obesity, according to the research involving 201 youngsters  They suggested early intervention could help protect children from a lifetime of obesity and its associated health complications.  But they warned it was likely children would pile on the pounds once they stopped using the treatment, meaning they would potentially be taking it ‘for life.’  Almost half of 12 to 18-year-olds using the drug dropped below the clinical cut-off for obesity, according to the research involving 201 youngsters.  On average, those taking part weighed 17 stone and lost 3 stone during the 16-month trial.  Three-quarters (74 per cent) of those taking semaglutide had an improvement of one or more BMI categories compared to fewer than one in five (19 per cent) taking a placebo.  Overall, it was found to reduce the proportion of children with the most severe degree of obesity from 37 to 14 per cent.  Presenting his findings at the European Congress on Obesity in Dublin, Dr Aaron Kelly, from University of Minnesota Medical School, said semaglutide should be available on the NHS for all teenagers with obesity ‘as part of a comprehensive treatment approach’ including lifestyle advice.  It was found to reduce the proportion of children with the most severe degree of obesity from 37 to 14 per cent  He said: ‘Semaglutide is transformative for many children who are able to get access. It can be lifechanging.  ‘Nothing brings me more pleasure than hearing the stories from adolescents who have been struggling their entire life to manage their weight of it. This gives them a tool to help take control of their weight, it’s transformational for many teenagers.’  The earlier children started taking the medication the better their outcome would be, he added, ideally tackling obesity before it could fully progress.  But he admitted those given the ‘lifechanging’ drug would likely need to stay on it for life, or risk the weight piling back on.  He added: ‘Obesity is a chronic disease. So chronic diseases require chronic treatments. You have to stay on that medication probably for the rest of your life.  ‘If you take that treatment away, it's like a rubber band, the weight goes right back to where it started.’  Going under the brand name of Wegovy, the weight loss drug has recently been given the go-ahead for use in adults on the NHS.  Regulators have yet to decide whether to grant its use - alongside a programme of diet and exercise - for obese teenagers.  A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said: ‘Following clinical trials and a formal review by the MHRA, our medicines are granted a licence which will outline the approved indication and recommended dosage for UK adolescent patients.’  Commenting on the study findings, Professor Alex Miras, Professor of Endocrinology, Ulster University, said he was keen to see the drug approved by NICE but suggested delays in its availability could slow proceedings.  ‘Children in this trial have lost a very significant amount of weight. What is interesting is that so many achieved normal BMI which is a remarkable achievement,’ he said.  ‘We were expecting the medication to become available for adults in May but this has been postponed yet again. We don’t even know whether it will become available this year.  ‘I think that NICE is unlikely to move forward, unless it has got more certainty that the medication will be available.’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUtMTIwOTQ4NzUvRmF0LVRFRU5BR0VSUy1naXZlbi1taXJhY2xlLW5ldy13ZWlnaHQtbG9zcy1qYWJzLXJlc3QtbGl2ZXMtZG9jdG9ycy1zYXkuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUtMTIwOTQ4NzUvYW1wL0ZhdC1URUVOQUdFUlMtZ2l2ZW4tbWlyYWNsZS1uZXctd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3MtamFicy1yZXN0LWxpdmVzLWRvY3RvcnMtc2F5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Tennessee"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:55:00","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It’s a cliché that Kymyona Burk heard a little too often: “Thank God for Mississippi.”  As the state’s literacy director, she knew politicians in other states would say it when their reading test scores were down — because at least they weren’t ranked as low as Mississippi. Or Louisiana. Or Alabama.  Lately, the way people talk about those states has started to change. Instead of looking down on the Gulf South, they’re seeing it as a model.  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  “In this region, we have decided to go big,” said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  Second grader Demi Hill, 8, listens during class at Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network, in New Orleans, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (AP)  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country’s highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  “We know how to teach reading,” she said. “We just have to do it everywhere.”  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten, informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read, but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading. It’s well worth the time, according to Assistant Principal Erika Brown, who said that in college she didn’t learn a thing about teaching kids to read.  “I was winging it,” she said of her early years in teaching.  During a recent session with four second-grade girls, Brown had the girls spell “crib,” asking, “What are the sounds you hear?”  Like a choir, they chanted back four individual sounds, counting them with their fingers: “c-rrr-i-buh.” This was one of the techniques Brown had learned in the training; counting four sounds, or phonemes, gave students a clue that the word had four letters. Increased screening also helped the school identify these girls as needing extra help.  “Are y’all ready for a challenge word?” Brown asked, and the girls shouted, “Yeah!” Their faces fell when Brown revealed the word: bedbug. They had no idea what the word even meant. But with Brown’s gentle guidance, the girls broke down the word into six phonemes. They were even ready for another challenge.  “Can we spell cock-a-roach?” one of the girls asked.  A second-grader in the school, Joshua Lastie, said he likes how his teacher helps him if he trips over a hard word, like “happened” or “suddenly.”  “The school is trying to make the words way easier for kids,” said Joshua, 7.  One challenge that comes with the emphasis on small-group intervention is the strain on scheduling and staffing. Literacy coaches from the state are helping the charter network strategize on how to reach all students. One resource the state can’t provide, says Lisa Giarratano, the chief academic officer at ReNEW, is time.  Literacy interventionist Liz Snapp talks with third grader Jakeem Henderson, 8, at Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network, in New Orleans, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Literacy interventionist Liz Snapp Jakeem Henderson, 8, 3rd grade (AP)  In a national climate where education debates are often polarizing, the three Gulf states passed their sweeping education reforms with bipartisan support, starting with Mississippi’s in 2013. Louisiana state Rep. Richard Nelson, a Republican who has championed literacy reform, said pointing to laws passed in other Deep South states made it easier for him to introduce legislation and “sell across party lines.”  “Every time I present a bill, I say, ‘Look, Mississippi has very similar challenges to what we have in Louisiana, and they’ve been able to make this work,’” Nelson said.  There is still far to go for children in the Gulf South, especially considering the disruptions to schooling from the pandemic and several major hurricanes and tornadoes. Mississippi, after stellar gains in the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress, saw reading scores drop in 2022, although they are still at the national average. Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group, could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular. In 2019, Alabama ranked 49th in NAEP reading scores for low-income fourth-graders; in 2022, it ranked 27th. Amid the pandemic that saw most states lose ground, Louisiana soared from 42nd to 11th. Mississippi ranks second-highest in the country, after Florida.  Alabama’s state superintendent of education, Eric Mackey, says he has confidence in the reforms — in part because they’ve worked before. Alabama invested heavily in training on the science of reading, then known as phonics, in the early 2000s, and scores rose. Then the Great Recession hit, teachers and literacy coaches got laid off, and the state lost its gains.  Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  “We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,” Mackey said. “This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.”  ___  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

"miracle","2015-09-18","Not Discerned","{""Columbus"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:42:00","Even after a recovery that many see as miraculous from a severe traumatic brain injury, and even after earning a law degree and launching a successful attorney practice with personal injury clients, Cameron Fathauer still feels a darkness descend every so often.  To clear his head that sometimes fills with suicidal whispers, he finds the silence of a cemetery near his family’s New Albany home. And the former Christian seminarian drops to his knees and cries out to God.  At age 25, an often vigorous time in life when some may feel invincible, the Columbus native is making peace with trials and hardship and hurdles. Major depression and suicidal ideation is a natural spinoff of more severe traumatic brain injuries.  “So much of the Christian life is paradoxical,” Fathauer said during a recent visit to Columbus. “The centerpiece of the Christian faith is a cross and, historically speaking, a cross was a form of capital punishment. It was an ugly, horrendous image.  “And now we put it on our buildings, we put it on our tattoos, we wear necklaces. So how did that happen?”  “Only God could turn such a horrible symbol into something so marvelous that we see today. And it’s a juxtaposition between pain, suffering, trial, difficulty, testing, and then resurrection, life, hope, and eternity. It’s this combination.”  Therein lies a short summary of Fathauer’s life nearly eight years after a skateboarding accident nearly killed him in front of the home of parents Brett and Lora Fathauer on Marilyn Drive in Columbus. He sustained a serious head injury when he was struck by a vehicle Sept. 18, 2015, and was taken by Lifeline helicopter to Indianapolis for specialized care.  The medical diagnosis: a severe diffuse axonal brain injury, degree three, down to his brain stem.  Indianapolis IU Health Methodist Hospital doctors, well acquainted with serious head trauma from serious accidents at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, initially and repeatedly told Fathauer’s family that the then-17-year-old’s progress toward everyday living and functioning probably would require an 18-month timeline.  “They (once) said I’d have the mental capacity of a 9-year-old,” he recalled.  Yet he came home walking and talking five weeks after the accident.  Shortly after that, he spoke and taught at a Christian seminar he earlier had organized at YES Cinemas downtown as part of his school senior project. He still meets people with technical knowledge of such injuries who cannot fathom his life today not only as a polished professional in a highly technical field, but a husband and father of four, including nearly 3-year-old triplets with wife Chelsea.  A few weeks ago, he met a registered nurse who heard just a part of his story.  “I’m so glad your (brain ) injury wasn’t that bad,” she said, unaware of quite the opposite.  He looks back at the trauma and drama of 2015 with a view that God somehow found a way to use for good even the darkest, most horrific moments of his life.  “I’m not much of a cook or a chef,” he said. “But I understand how you know the basic process and procedures for making a good dish. And you take these individual ingredients, the spices and the meat and the flavoring, whatever it is, and you put them in a pot of some sort, you turn on the heat, and then out comes a delicious meal.  “And I’ve thought about that since the accident. That’s when I think the Lord started cooking in my life — when I was hit by that car. And that’s when he turned up the heat.”  Wife Chelsea has been alongside him for the whole process. At age 19, she accepted his marriage proposal a month before the accident. She has witnessed extreme highs and frightening lows.  “She has said to me ‘I feel like I am married to a roller coaster,’” Fathauer said. “I’m not afraid for you to write that down. Absolutely, I think she is.”  His boss, Matthew Schad, at Schad Law in New Albany, is well aware of everything in Fathauer’s struggle and success. Schad met Fathauer when he became his attorney through the aftermath of the 2015 accident. Schad’s friendship influenced Fathauer’s decision to pursue law.  The former Columbus resident saw how he could use the empathy, determination and faith learned from his tragedy to help others.  “I tell people that I became a personal injury attorney because of what happened to me,” Fathauer said. “And I became an estate planning attorney because of what could happen to you.”  The accident also has marked wife Chelsea’s new career plans. She is currently studying medicine at Indiana University to become a doctor.  “It definitely was inspired largely by his injury and all the wonderful care that he received,” Chelsea said.  She added that the extra care taken by surgeons, nurses, physical therapists to form real, longer-term relationships with them touched her deeply. She wants to do the same for families in whatever medical field she eventually chooses.  She, like her husband, remains astonished at his recovery, and brushes aside some of her spouse’s praise for her care and persistence during a restoration that stretched at least a couple years or more. It included relearning some proper social cues and behaviors that his brain had lost.  “His recovery obviously doesn’t make too much scientific sense,” said his wife. “I’d say it’s definitely a miracle. “But I think that a lot of it also was his personal strength and desires. When your loved one is injured, I think the natural human desire is to want to protect them and prevent their failure and their feeling self-conscious. But Cameron was never really like that.  “He always really wanted to know every area that he could improve. And I tried to foster his independence and let him dream and set goals.”  She recalled his biggest battle: cognitive function. She recalled his biggest dream: law school.  And she recalled her biggest immediate reaction: “OK. This is going to be really hard.”  Her husband who until then had dreamed of pastoring felt an abrupt change.  “It was like an Etch-a-Sketch where God shook the screen and erased everything else,” Fathauer said.  He acknowledged that law school was more than tough, especially amid the stress of starting a family. Yet, more than once in a conversation, he mentioned that a raw and real Christian life sometimes is one marked partly by suffering and setbacks, even after there have been apparent life-saving miracles.  “The response to affliction, the response to difficulty in trial, at least in regard to especially suicide and depression,” he said, “is just to hold on.”  And therein lies another paradox and a substantial spiritual twist. The man whom some see as a literal, walking miracle finds light in his darkest times and feels renewed life — at a cemetery.  Presentations  The New Albany attorney and former Christian seminarian mixes his passions these days at churches and elsewhere with free presentations he calls “Receiving and Returning: A Practical Theology of Estate Planning.” The presentations cover everything from the theology of private property to wills and trusts. Plus, he intersperses elements of his personal story into the mix.

Although the shops are almost done being renovated, the owners wanted to continue to pay homage to the Desert Passage roots. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae  The Miracle Mile Shops on the Strip is set to complete its first set of renovations in 16 years in the next few weeks.  The renovations for the mall located at the Planet Hollywood resort were meant to brighten and modernize its interior, which houses 170 tenants, according to Robert Buchanan, the vice president and general manager of the Miracle Mile Shops.  The last time the mall — which first opened in 2000 under the name Desert Passage — was renovated was in 2007 when it changed its name to Miracle Mile.  “It was just time, and of course for us really wanting to stay vibrant and a viable option for people to come shopping on the Strip,” Buchanan said.  The Miracle Mile renovations include adding modern light fixtures, interactive displays and more seating areas in the mall’s walkway, installing new ceilings in certain areas, installing projection technology for light shows inside the mall and placing over 21,000 square-feet LED screens throughout the interior and exterior of the property.  Over 20,000 square-feet of LED screens were installed on the mall’s exterior and about 1,600 square-feet of LED screens were added to the interior. The focus on adding LED screens is meant to help Miracle Mile stand out amid the many shopping and entertainment options on the Strip, according to Buchanan.  “There is a lot of visual stimulation (on the Strip) and you really need to, you really need to take advantage of that opportunity,” Buchanan said. “We’re competing with everything else out there.”  The renovations are slated to finish in June, according to Buchanan, although installation of some exterior LED screens could continue until November.  Other updated features of Miracle Mile include two indoor light shows. One will be a continuation of the Rain Show that happened in the past at Miracle Mile. New features of the Rain Show will include two walls of water that can have light displays shown on them, according to Buchanan.  The other show, called “Elements” and reflecting elements like ice, fire and earth, will be shown outside the V Theater.  Putting more shows inside Miracle Mile is meant to provide more entertainment and experiences in the mall, according to Buchanan.  “People are looking for those experiences,” he said. “The Vegas experience, even if it’s a store that customers might find in their market, for example that we put in, it’s the Vegas version of that store.”  Buchanan said there have been plans to renovate Miracle Mile since 2017. Officials were set to start the renovations in 2020 but those plans were delayed by the pandemic. He said the renovations started up again in January 2022 and have focused on individual sections over the last year and a half so the mall could stay open during the renovations.  Despite a lot of updates to the mall, some old favorites of Miracle Mile will stay, including the painted ceilings above some of the walkways and portions of the Moroccan facades that were original to the Desert Passage mall. Additionally, the mall is keeping the facade of the Desert Passage ship.  “The way I characterize it is that we’re renovating, we’re updating but we’re not losing that Desert Passage character,” Buchanan said.

Photo / Stephem Jaquiery  Dr Divya Adhia attaches cables to a cap covered with electrodes, which unexpectedly helped to restore Dunedin author Dr Lynley Hood’s vision recently. Photo / Stephem Jaquiery  Scientists are calling it “an accidental miracle” after research aimed at alleviating chronic pain was found to restore the sight of a Dunedin woman who has had an acute form of glaucoma for more than a decade.  Now University of Otago researchers are trying to replicate the result, in a bid to create new treatments for people with vision loss.  Prominent author Dr Lynley Hood (80) fractured her pelvis in a fall in 2020, and has had severe lower back pain ever since.  So she decided to participate in a University of Otago chronic pain treatment research project involving the placement of a cap on her head, wired with electrodes that use electrical currents to stimulate the brain.  Project co-leader Dr Divya Adhia said the Dunedin School of Medicine research began in May 2021 and looked at the effects of brain stimulation on chronic pain.  Dr Hood attended brain stimulation sessions five days a week for a month, she said.  There were two study groups — the main group, who received the electrical stimulation into the brain, and the placebo group, who had the electrical current pass across their scalps.  Dr Hood was part of the placebo group, and over the four-week period her eyesight steadily improved to nearly 100 per cent, Dr Adhia said.  “Surprisingly, her vision improved so much that her ophthalmologist said it was a miracle.  “Miracle is not a word we use very often in science, but it was — an accidental miracle.  “It wasn’t the intended outcome, but to see that my research has actually made an impact with people is really miraculous.”  Dr Hood said she had been living with severely reduced vision for the past 12 years.  She had no central vision in her left eye, her right eye was like “TV static” and it was difficult for her to adapt to changing light conditions.  It had effectively stopped her from reading and writing and she had to give up her work as an award-winning author.  She was told her eyesight was never going to get any better, so she took it in her stride and decided to help others with low vision by becoming a founding member of the Visual Impairment Charitable Trust Aotearoa (Victa).  To have her vision slowly return following the procedures was life-changing, she said.  “At first, I thought I was imagining it.  “They’ve got such flash equipment that they could trace every millisecond of the current — it went across my scalp and into my eyes.  “The equipment showed that the cells in my retina went, ‘hey guys, something’s happening’, and it sent a whole lot of messages down my optic nerve to the parts of my brain that makes pictures and words and colours out of electrical messages.  “It’s really important that other people benefit from this.”  Dr Adhia said the research team were now designing another study to run alongside the chronic pain study, which would investigate how it had happened and how it could be used to improve low vision for other people.  Dr Hood was also excited.  She said the “side effect” had given her a new lease on life and she now had plans to return to writing and had several new books in the pipeline.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L256L3NjaWVudGlzdHMtYWNjaWRlbnRhbC1taXJhY2xlLXJlc3RvcmVzLWR1bmVkaW4td29tYW5zLWV5ZXNpZ2h0L0pPQktER01QS1ZDQkRMWUpJNE9aR1NYSFNNL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Something fishy  It sounds like something out of a myth: once or twice a year, amid a dramatic thunderstorm, fish plummet from the sky onto the streets of Yoro, a town in Honduras. (The jury’s still out on the science, but the leading theory is that the creatures are sucked into the sky from the nearby Atlantic Ocean by giant water spouts.)  Where some might see a miracle, the ad agency Ogilvy saw an economic opportunity for the town, where most residents live on under $1 a day. In partnership with sustainable fish company Regal Springs, Ogilvy worked with the town to create a plan to compensate locals for catching the falling fish.  This year, on April 23, when the fish began to fall, locals ran out to catch it, filling bags and even wagons. The “Heaven Fish,” as Regal Springs called the product, were then cleaned, processed, packaged and sent to restaurants and grocery stores. Locals made about $6 a pound on their catch, transforming a strange phenomenon into a most unusual livelihood.

Women in Kabul found themselves confined, no longer allowed to work outside the home.  But some, like Husneya Saidi, age 21, have found creative ways to pursue their dreams. Stuck at home, Saidi found refuge in an online storytelling course created by human rights advocate Homeira Qaderi. The course gave her a way to express her experience: “[The Taliban] may have closed the doors of the university to me, but I will fight them with the might of my words,” Saidi said. “My pen will serve as my unyielding weapon.”  View this post on Instagram A post shared by KIMIA (@kimia_arts_)  Yes! reports that many Afghan women have turned to writing or art to portray the difficulties they’re going through — and imagine a better future. “The Taliban may impose restrictions on our public lives,” said Kimia, a 23-year-old artist who managed to complete her final semester at Kabul University under Taliban rule, “but they can never extinguish our unwavering determination to learn and relentlessly pursue our dreams.”  Read more at Yes! Magazine  Not just horsing around  In rural parts of Mexico, many people depend on horses, mules and donkeys for transportation and work in the fields. But historically, veterinary care in such areas has been lacking. Through the Rural Veterinary Experience Teaching and Service (RVETS) program, veterinary students and volunteers have been bringing free care to underserved rural areas since 2010.  Not only are these rural clinics a boon for local livestock owners, but they also provide hands-on experience for the students — vaccination, dental work, castration and more. As 24-year-old student Dereck Alejandro Morín told the New York Times, “What they teach you in school is one-third of what life in the countryside is really like.”  RVETS’ work isn’t easy: funding can be hard to come by, and sometimes security risks restrict travel. But as Dr. Víctor Urbiola, director of RVETS Mexico, put it, “if we can help even one donkey that carries 80 kilos of water for an old woman, all the effort we make is totally worth it.”  Read more at the New York Times","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uc3RvYmVjaGVlcmZ1bC53b3JsZC9ob25kdXJhcy1maXNoLWV4dHJhLWluY29tZS1mcm9tLXNreS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-12-01","14:00:00","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:59:50","He can’t afford the project, so he’s trying to sell the 1930s building. Most interested buyers are parking lot companies wanting to demolish it.  Lifelong Coloradan and pastor CB Barthlow used to hang out on Downtown Denver’s streets when he was a heavy drug user. One building that always caught his eye was the Carson Press, a distinct, abandoned structure at 2019 South St., with red brick framing, massive windows and a concrete entrance with an impressive arch — a relic of 1930s Denver.  Now boarded up, the Carson Press is a stone’s throw away from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless headquarters, the Stout Street Clinic and some massive new luxury condos, at the nexus of Denver’s growth and despair.  A few years back, Barthlow decided to open up Beacon Church. His mission: Serve unhoused residents and drug users, people like he used to be. He wanted a spot near downtown, at the epicenter of Denver’s drug and homelessness crises, close to many fellow service providers’ offices.  The Carson Press was his dream spot for his new endeavor. But getting it proved tough.  According to city records, the building has traded hands six times since 2017. Barthlow kept striking out as he attempted to buy. Beacon Church couldn’t afford the asking price.  Eventually, the church came into a windfall, and Barthlow struck a deal with then-owner Benjamin Weinstein, for a little over $1.5 million. Barthlow knew, at the time, the building would need work.  “It’s a shell,” he said. “It doesn’t have infrastructure.”  Just bringing it up to code to be allowed inside was going to cost the church roughly a million dollars. A full build-out was more than Barthlow could imagine paying, and as a new entity, taking out a loan was impossible for the church.  So while the building has remained vacant, Beacon has been holding services at the Bluebird Theatre, on a stage Barthlow used to play as a soul singer and musician.  Homeless encampments often set up in front of the old press. Barthlow will ask the people sleeping outside if they need anything and encourage them to keep an eye on the building.  From time to time, people break through the boarded-up door and inside to use drugs or get out of the cold.  Once, upon returning from vacation, Barthlow realized 30 people were squatting inside. They had brought in couches, beds and desks. The place was filled with trash, including used syringes.  At first, Barthlow said, he “freaked out.” Then, he mustered the courage to go inside and tell the people they had to leave, that he was operating a business there, and that he’d be calling the police. He called the non-emergency line and waited outside for six hours for the cops to show up and escort people out the back.  “I had to hire a hazmat company to clean out what was in there,” he said.  When the Beacon Church first priced the buildout, pandemic-era supply chain issues had driven costs of construction up. The church decided to wait for construction prices to drop.  But costs have only gotten higher since Beacon first bought in 2021.  “The buildout costs when we got the building were three million,” Barthlow said. “Now they’re closer to four-and-a-half.”  While the church has been around a few years now, taking out a $4.5 million loan is out of the question, so Beacon has put the Carson Press back on the market.  Scott McClean, of Development Advisors, is the listing agent on the building. It’s being sold for $1.8 million and advertised as a shell property.  So far, there has been some interest, but most has been from parking lot companies with underwhelming offers looking to demolish the building and turn the land into a surface lot.  “I’m just praying and waiting for our God to do something amazing,” Barthlow said. “We need a miracle of $4 million dollars, so I can turn that into a church and outreach center.”  If that doesn’t pan out, he hopes the proceeds from selling the building can pay for a long-term lease in a nearby spot.  Pulling off a new project is going to be tough to afford. Barthlow said that’s why so many churches, like his, are formed in the suburbs, and away from the centers of greatest need.  “There are so many parts that are changing the way Denver is right now,” Barthlow said. And the class disparity between people living on the streets in tents and suffering from addiction and the newcomers to the neighborhood who can afford $1 million condos across the street troubles him.  As he sees it, the rise in property values and rents Denver has experienced in recent years makes it tough to help the people with the greatest needs.  “I love my city, and I’m here to serve my city, regardless of what clothing or what apparel she wears,” Barthlow said. “But I know the way things have changed recently have made it prohibitive for entities such as ourselves to do good.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGVudmVyaXRlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2Rvd250b3duLWRlbnZlci1jYXJzb24tcHJlc3MtYnVpbGRpbmctZm9yLXNhbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Carlo Ancelotti's side were hammered 4-0 by Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, with Pep Guardiola's side earning revenge for last season's defeat by Los Blancos at the same stage.  This time the second leg was not at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid produced a string of astonishing moments to overcome Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and City on the way to winning last season's competition.  Madrid, who have won five of the last nine Champions Leagues, have grown used to pulling off spectacular and sometimes inexplicable comebacks in Europe.  Even when Madrid have been outplayed, they have clung on by their fingertips and found a way through. Many across the continent thought it was about time for that to change.  However, the way the match began seemed to set things up for another Madrid survival masterclass.  Guardiola's City dominated, just as they did last week at the Bernabeu in the 1-1 first leg draw, before Vinicius Junior sucker-punched the English side on the counter.  At the Etihad, Erling Haaland was foiled twice by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the second of which was a brilliant, bewildering save.  - Different story -  However, unlike in the first leg, Bernardo Silva broke free of Eduardo Camavinga's shackles and was decisive.  The Portuguese midfielder struck twice, leaving Madrid with an uphill struggle -- although they have come back from those before.  Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos hit the crossbar with a rocket from distance.  ""On this occasion things didn't go our way like they did last year,"" lamented Courtois, referring to the German's piledriver.  Last season Rodrygo Goes struck two late goals in less than two minutes to force the second leg to extra-time, and Madrid improved after the break, with a comeback still not off the table.  However, City eventually stepped up another gear to whisk the game away from Madrid, scraping around for another moment of inspiration but finding the cupboard bare.  Eder Militao deflected Manuel Akanji's header into his own net for City's third and Julian Alvaraz rolled the fourth past Courtois to wrap up their emphatic victory.  ""Evaluating what happened in this moment what happened makes no sense to me,"" Ancelotti told Movistar.  ""It's a defeat that hurts but sometimes it can happen in football, in the Champions League semi-final against a strong opponent that played better than you.""  The Italian coach said he was planning on seeing out the last year of his contract, which expires in June 2024.  Madrid's board and president Florentino Perez have backed Ancelotti staying over the past couple of weeks, at least in public, but his future will inevitably be debated during the weeks ahead.  When Madrid's magical concoction of individual skill, never-say-die spirit and luck runs out, questions get asked.  Perez may wonder if Madrid need something more tangible than miracles next season.  rbs/cw","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tYWRyaWRzLW1pcmFjbGUtd2VsbC1ydW5zLWRyeS0yMjAyNDMyOTMuaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL21hZHJpZHMtbWlyYWNsZS13ZWxsLXJ1bnMtZHJ5LTIyMDI0MzI5My5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her beloved daughter survived one challenge after another. Now they're enjoying every moment with this miracle baby. Madelyn Mire was born weighing only one pound, four ounces. The frightening journey began when her mother, Jennilee, was 20 weeks pregnant.  ""Everything was going really well until then! I almost skipped that appointment, so there are a whole lot of miracles surrounding that, but I found out my cervix was 100% effaced,"" explains Jennilee. That's considered a medical emergency and could have forced Jennilee into labor at any moment, so doctors performed a procedure to try to delay it.  At that point, Jennilee was told she had to get to 24-week pregnancy, or her baby wouldn't survive. They had already been through so much. ""Our previous daughter was born at 26 weeks, she actually passed away. And so, we this was our rainbow baby and here we are, going through this again,"" explains Jennilee.

Tiny Madelyn was born at 23 weeks and two days and the courageous feats to save her life began. She and her mom had the same infection.  ""She had contracted E. coli, which was her most immediate danger at the time. It crossed the blood-brain barrier, because when they're that small, they don't really have one, and it became meningitis. She also had a brain bleed and cysts on her brain. She had respiratory distress syndrome, which most of the preemies do, but she was on a ventilator for that. She had a heart PDA, which is an issue that they have when born preterm. And then of course they're always worried about their eyes and are hearing when they're that small,"" states Jennilee.  Jennilee went into action beyond medicine to save her newborn. ""I went in ready for battle, spiritual battle and I just started praying and casting death off of her, pleading the blood of Jesus over her. I had actually been introduced to a ministry called The Supernatural Life and had some spiritual deliverance in my life, and it really opened my eyes to the fact that we're in a spiritual battle. In Mark 16: 17-18, it says that the signs shall follow those who believe and at the end of that, it says they shall lay hands on the stick, and they will be healed and I knew that I had seen healings right in front of my eyes,"" says Jennilee.

I almost collapsed, and the doctor caught me and told me to keep praying,"" she added.  From that day on, Jennilee says little Madelyn began to thrive.

CHINESE PROPAGANDA PROGRAM IN US SCHOOLS QUIETLY CHANGES HEADQUARTERS NAME TO AVOID SCRUTINY  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  ""In this region, we have decided to go big,"" said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country's highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  ""We know how to teach reading,"" she said. ""We just have to do it everywhere.""  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten, informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read, but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading.

"miracle","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:00:00","A border enforcement policy used by both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump expired last week. The policy, Title 42 , allowed immigration officials to immediately expel immigrants who did not meet asylum standards. Its conclusion has led to a predictable surge in illegal border crossings.  With or without Title 42, it is inevitable that more people will come to this country. In 2022, the United States had about 2.76 million people cross the southern border — a new record even though Title 42 was being enforced.  HOW TO STOP THE LEFT'S DANGEROUS, DESPICABLE WAR ON WORK  The real question for policymakers is: What should replace Title 42? What policy changes and innovations can get the border under control and stop illegal immigration?  House Republicans passed a proposal last week to bolster border security. But until the U.S. begins expanding legal pathways in addition to its border security efforts, it will remain frustrated with the modern world’s migration challenges.  The Republican package hits many of the usual notes — a restart for border wall construction and increased penalties for violations of immigration law. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), the House Majority leader, called the bill “the strongest border security package that Congress has ever taken up.”  Yet the legislation is noteworthy for what it’s missing: legal pathways into the country. Despite what many critics of the legislation will argue, border security investments and policies are important and valuable. They complement legal pathways. There’s no silver bullet or miracle cure for illegal immigration. Instead, we need a suite of policies that both expand legal immigration and build up the border.  By leaving out expanded legal pathways, the Republican proposal leaves out a critical ingredient. We need to see legal options as key pieces of border control rather than as antithetical to border security.  The agricultural guest worker visa program , the H-2A visa, illustrates this well. When agricultural visas were expanded from 1995 to 2015, illegal border entries fell because workers were able to come legally. The relationship between illegal and legal entries is basically a one-for-one exchange.  As a scientific matter, much of immigration’s flows are determined by trends outside of the U.S. Take Guatemala , for example. It has the opposite economic problem of the U.S. It has more people than it has jobs, so the mismatch draws people to the U.S., where jobs are more readily available.  We should also see legal immigration as an opportunity to strengthen America. The U.S. has a huge labor shortage. States across the country have more job openings than unemployed people.  In fact, this labor shortage dwarfs the immigration surge. Even if every single one of the 2022 crossers were admitted and allowed to work today, the U.S. would still be millions of workers short.  These needs are already known in Washington. On April 18, a bipartisan group of more than 50 legislators sent a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services pointing out how farmers and businesses that use current guest worker programs need help affording the visa application process .  In recognition of this reality, the Chamber of Commerce announced its own immigration proposal package on May 1. It includes many of the border security improvements that Republicans passed but marries it with expanded legal immigration routes. That’s the right recipe for border security.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA  An effective immigration policy will require both a high wall and a wide gate. Immigration reforms that enable businesses to find the workforce they need will keep our economy on its strong path.  Congress must take action and build new bridges, not just walls. We’ll find success only if we embrace both smart border security investments along with new legal pathways.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9uZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Jlc3RvcmluZy1hbWVyaWNhL2ZhaXJuZXNzLWp1c3RpY2UvYW1lcmljYS1uZWVkcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tYS13YWxsLXRvLXRhY2tsZS10aGUtYm9yZGVyLWNyaXNpc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

That Canelo ring walk was spectacular, which was acclaimed by millions of viewers around the world. Televisión Azteca produced the signal that reached all corners of the world through more than a hundred platforms. Rodolfo Vargas has become a very important asset for world boxing, with great management and leadership skills.  The municipalities of Zapopan and Guadalajara worked in unison to ensure that the previous events during the week generated great expectations and a sense of belonging among all Jalisco. Governor Enrique Alfaro demonstrated his great sense of humanity and gave himself, body and soul, to achieve the collaboration and coordination of all so that El Rey returned home.  I was impressed by the modernity of Guadalajara, with spectacular restaurants and delicious food, entertainment centers, friendliness, and hospitality. I keep singing mariachi songs in my mind and flashes of what that week was like, and that I will never forget. I am sure that we will not have to wait 30 more years for the next great boxing show in our country.  I had the great good fortune to celebrate Mother’s Day with my precious and adoring mom. It is a blessing to have her so healthy and in perfect condition with us.  Our family was formed based on unity, love, and respect, and it was my mother who was always and continues to be aware of everything. She is the undisputed boss.  My brother Hector gave us a beautiful letter dedicated to Dona Martha.  “Mothers are the earth, the seed, the rain that gives life, they are the miracle that creates miracles giving life, they are love without barriers, they are guides, teachers, warrior defenders, sweetness and they are the reason why life flourishes and grows with the purest and most unconditional love. Relentless guardians and are our shelter from storms. They are our Sun and our shade, as well as our Moon and our Light in the dark.”  On Saturday in South Africa, Kevin Lerena beat Ryad Merhy, from Belgium, in a good fight, thus winning the right to dispute the Bridgerweight world championship against the current champ, Lukas Rozanski from Poland.  This division continues to produce great results, as all the fights are of great interest, being in themselves small heavyweights who compete with each other with skill and power without giving advantages to the mastodons of boxing’s mother division.  This coming Saturday is so special: the best of the best from Men and Women will meet in the rings of Las Vegas and Ireland. Vegas will host one of the most anticipated fights of the year. The undisputed WBC, WBO, IBF and WBA world champion, the undefeated Devin Haney will face who was The King, pound for pound, just three years ago, Vasiliy Lomachenko. That same day undisputed super lightweight champion Shantell Cameron will defend against undisputed lightweight champion Katie Taylor. What an unbelievable weekend of boxing.  I traveled to Mérida to inaugurate a gym at the Arrayanes Institute, a very well-established place under the leadership of José Chapur and the great champion Guty Espadas.  I was able to greet many dear friends of sports and society in that town, especially Mr. Jorge Carlos Ramírez Marín, Mr. José Manzur, and the two Guty Espadas.  This gym is first class, equipped with a ring, speed balls, punch bags, all from the Cleto Reyes brand, and everything necessary to comply with the WBC certification.  Now it remains to promote Yucatecan boxing and to find the champions of the future soon.  DID YOU KNOW…?  Devin Haney started his career in fights that took place in bars and nightclubs in Tijuana.  Devin is the reversed American dream. His father, Bill, trusted our country to take care of them, and thus be able to start his career at a young age. Not being able to fight in the United States because he was a minor, he found a helping hand to develop in Mexico. Many fights took place in Tijuana, many lessons, times of shaping to be a great contender winning WBC affiliated championships. Devin won The WBC World Youth championship, the NABF, The Continental Americas and the Silver championship before winning the interim title, the WBC world title, and now is the undisputed king of the division.  TODAY’S ANECDOTE  My mom accompanied my dad on a trip to the Orient, something unusual, and in one of the stops, they attended a world title fight in South Korea.  The attention to my mom was as if she were a queen. Already in the arena, she was seated next to the Minister of Sports of that country. Everything was going well until in the third round, Guty Espadas Sr. knocked down the local idol with a crushing right hand, and my mother stood up to shout euphorically, in favor of the Mexican, while the stadium was completely silent before the fall from Korean.  Don José turned around and firmly said: “Madam: shut up and sit down please!”  Eventually, Guty did not manage to be crowned, the local hero from Korea won. Regardless of that fact, the Minister no longer spoke to my mother a single word.  Little by little, in our family we learned that in boxing there are no nationalities, colors or races. All fighters are the same and they are loved in an extraordinary way, regardless of whether they are champion or challenger, and that’s how you feel: a legitimate and sincere pity and respect for the loser, at the same time there is joy, jubilation, and pride for the winner.

Suddenly, 2-year-old Willow, a Border Collie-Goldendoodle mix, jumped into the raging waters of a box culvert next to the freeway.  “She just jumped up and over the cement barrier,” Jessop said, adding that Willow has never tried to jump into the water before.  Willow was immediately swept through the tunnel that traveled under Interstate 15.  “We just wanted our dog—we didn’t know we loved her so much” This is Willow.

The family raced downriver, hoping to get ahead of Willow. But after about 40 minutes of searching alongside animal control, police, firefighters and other city employees, Jessop said they were beginning to lose hope.  “We just wanted our dog. We didn’t know we loved her so much,” an emotional Jessop said.  Suddenly, a call came over the police radio saying that Willow may have been found.  “I didn’t know if that meant dead or alive,” Jessop said.  Willow was alive and uninjured, but scared as she hid in the bushes along the creek. She had managed to get out of the runoff-swollen creek on her own.  “She was just up on the bank. She was dirty. She was wet. She was cold. She was shaking,” Jessop said. “I don’t know how she would have climbed out with that current so strong.”  After the joyous reunion, the family is watching Willow very closely and keeping her on a leash near water. Jessop also expressed his gratitude for employees of Lehi City who helped in the search.  “We just had a reunion that we didn’t think that we would have,” he said. “It was an unexpected happy ending. It was an answer to prayer and a miracle that we all experienced yesterday morning.”  Jessop is also warning other families with pets and children about the dangers of Dry Creek.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzU1MDcxMS9sZWhpLWZhbWlseS13YXJucy1vZi13YXRlci1kYW5nZXItYWZ0ZXItZG9nLWp1bXBzLWludG8tY3JlZWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Holmes, who was granted an immediate stay of her April 27 prison-reporting date by virtue of a hail Mary appeal filed by her lawyers, was celebrating her second Mother's Day on Sunday at the beach in San Diego. The UK Daily Mail scored some paparazzi shots of Holmes carrying her newborn daughter Invicta and partner Billy Evans carrying two-year-old son William and some balloons down to the beach near their reported $9 million home (a rental).  As we learned recently via an odd and fairly softball profile of Holmes in the New York Times, she and Evans relocated from Woodside, where they'd been living until sometime last year — maybe until Holmes's November sentencing — to San Diego, which is where Evans's family lives. This is perhaps practical from a childcare standpoint, given that Evans is about to become a single dad, save for some miracle or untold legal strategy that grants Holmes more continued freedom.  As NBC Bay Area reports, Holmes's attorneys just filed a new motion in the state appeal of her fraud conviction, which gives the state 21 days to respond. Once the state responds, the lawyers have another 21 days to respond to that. So, this maneuver seems designed to give her another month or so with her newborn child before beginning what's to be an 11-year sentence.  Though will she really end up serving all of that? Half of that?  The privilege that has pervaded this entire case and trial has been pretty obvious, apart from the actual sentence by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila. Holmes's attorneys had tried to argue for no jail time at all, while she faced a maximum of 20 years for each of the four fraud counts on which she was convicted.  Judge Davila rejected Holmes's appeal of her conviction on April 10.  Holmes's co-defendant and co-conspirator at infamous blood-testing startup Theranos, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, was tried separately and sentenced in December to 13 years. Balwani also appealed his conviction to the Ninth Circuit, that appeal was denied, and he began serving his time not far from San Diego last month.

That's because Gath vows he wouldn't have the best pacer he's trained, Miracle Mile winner Catch A Wave, unless Yambukian came along.  Yambukian is Catch A Wave's older half-brother and impressed Gath and his wife, Kate, from day one.  ""I'll always have him to thank because he's the reason we have Catch A Wave,"" Gath said. ""Yambukian was showing us plenty and that's why we bought the next one out of the mare (Coppagoodone) as a yearling.""  While Yambukian has built a more than creditable record with just 29 starts netting 11 wins, six placings and $145,530, Catch A Wave is one of Australasian harness racing's hottest properties.  Catch A Wave's 22 starts have netted $1,123,120 in earnings from 17 wins and a second.  He hasn't raced since completing the huge Chariots Of Fire and Miracle Mile double with his Mile win at Menangle on March 4.  But he's back at Team Gath's Long Forest property and turning plenty of heads.  ""He spelled really well. He had about a month out and has come back noticeably bigger. It's everything you hope for,"" Andy Gath said.  ""He arrived back here on April 15 and should be back racing by late July.""  Catch A Wave is one of Australia's best pacers. Picture: Stuart McCormick  Catch A Wave's next major target is the world's richest harness race, the inaugural $2.1m TAB Eureka, at Menangle on September 2. He is the $3 pre-post favourite.  ""I'd say he'll do his lead-up racing in Victoria, probably two runs before the Eureka,"" Gath said.  ""But, we'll finalise all that closer to it.""  So while his baby brother starts to get fit again, Yambukian has taken the opportunity to shine.  The big, strong five-year-old returned from his own spell with a good Melton win last Saturday night.  Life gets harder from the back row (gate nine) when he backs-up in the Western Ford Pace (2240m) at Melton this Saturday.  ""He was entitled to win the other night because he had a nice run in front,"" Gath said.  ""He's run most of his best races up on the speed, so the back row makes it harder this week.  ""But he seems to have come back well and is still pretty lightly raced for his age.  ""He's worked his way into a strong grade now, so he's going to have to keep improving to keep the wins coming.""  Another highlight of Saturday night's Melton meeting will be brilliant trotting mare Queen Elida's quest for a fifth successive win in the I Didn't Do It Free-For-All (2240m).  She returns from a Sydney trip where she brilliantly won the Group 1 Macarthur Mile at Menangle two week's ago.  Queen Elida will still need some luck from inside the back row (gate eight) against fit and proven open-class performers Ultimate Stride (four) and One Over All (five).  One Over All is a stablemate of superstar Just Believe, who was flown out of Melbourne on Tuesday night, headed to Sweden for the huge Elitloppet Trot at Solvalla in Stockholm on May 28.  * Adam Hamilton is a paid contributor writing on harness racing for News Corp","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2VuZXQuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaGFybmVzcy1yYWNpbmctYW5keS1nYXRoLWhhcy15YW1idWtpYW4tdG8tdGhhbmstZm9yLWNhdGNoLWEtd2F2ZS0yMDIzMDUxN9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2VuZXQuY29tLmF1L2FtcC9uZXdzL2hhcm5lc3MtcmFjaW5nLWFuZHktZ2F0aC1oYXMteWFtYnVraWFuLXRvLXRoYW5rLWZvci1jYXRjaC1hLXdhdmUtMjAyMzA1MTc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-07-01","14:00:00","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:02:20","For six months, chemotherapy tore my body down. Every part of my body was reduced to ruin, from loss of hair and loss of weight to the mind-numbing fog of chemo brain. Things you wouldn’t think would be affected were affected, like my urinary system, my joints, my mouth, and even my vision — all proof of what the oncologists said every time they saw me: “We’re killing you to save you.”  By the fifth and sixth cycles, I looked like a skeleton. I sometimes frightened myself when I looked in the mirror.  As a poet, I wrote about my experiences. The poems are now available in my book, “Running from the Reaper: Poems from an Impatient Cancer Survivor.” One of the poems is about the horror I saw reflected in the mirror:  CHEMO CYCLE BLUES  I was brushing my teeth this morning  when I looked up after spitting.  There in the mirror was a bald man  holding a toothbrush, his eyes  full of bewilderment and incredulity,  his face pallid and gaunt,  his eyes deeply sunken, lips chapped,  his beard and hair gone.  I leaned closer to the glass to better glimpse  the stranger holding my toothbrush.  I was so skeletal that at Halloween that I could have been an emaciated zombie. I wouldn’t have needed any make-up or anything to play the part. At times, I worried that I’d never return to the old me. I worried that even if I survived, I’d be this ruin of a man, weak and pathetic, shuffling around like the undead for the rest of my life. There were times when I was so distraught that I thought about giving up, just calling it quits.  But I was surprised at the resilience of the human body. My body began to repair itself almost immediately once the chemo cycles ended and the chemicals were out of my system. As I sit here writing this today, it’s only been three months since my last cycle and my last infusion. And yet, almost like magic or a miracle, my body has mostly recovered. I’ve gained back three-fourths of the weight I lost. I think I’ll be back to my pre-cancer weight by summer. My hair, including my facial hair returned as good as ever (see photo).  The brain fog I suffered is gone, as if a warm wind blew away the obscuring clouds that confounded my thinking. I’m keeping a Recovery Journal in which I chart my growth with graphs (how much I weigh, circumference of my biceps, how much I can bench press or leg press, etc.) My strength is returning. I’ve been playing racquetball for almost the entire time since the chemo cycles ended.  Yesterday, I played four games without breaking a sweat or being short-winded. I win most of the time. I’m getting stronger every day. Even my libido has returned (thank goodness).  Friends who haven’t seen me in a while remark how much better I look. “Your face is fuller, and your skin color looks healthier,” they tell me. One friend, who recently saw me walking down the hall at the university, said he could tell that I was stronger by my determined and self-assured gait. “That’s the old John I’ve always known,” he said as we passed.  If I have any advice to impart to others going through cancer it is this: Who you are at the lowest point, when your body is most wrecked, is not who you will remain. Don’t despair. Have hope. When the cancer treatment ends, your body will begin to rebuild itself. It will heal. It may not happen as quickly as it did for me, but it will happen. One day, you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror and see only the post-cancer you.  For me, even though it’s only been three months since my treatment ended and I was pronounced “cured,” there have been days when I almost forget that I ever had cancer at all.

"miracle","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Aston"", ""Hertfordshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:00:00","From “diet” soft drinks to fat-free yoghurts and cereals, these days there’s a sugar-free alternative to just about everything. In most cases, we have artificial sweeteners to thank for this.  On paper, sweeteners are a miracle ingredient, helping us to reduce our calorie intake and protect our tooth enamel, all the while avoiding sugar-induced energy crashes and the dips in mood that follow. But a wave of fresh evidence suggesting these calorie-free additives might contain underlying health risks is sparking a backlash – and not for the first time.  This week, the World Health Organisation said long-term use of artificial sweeteners (NSS) could raise the risk of various health problems including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and does not help people manage their weight over a prolonged period.  Another study of 4,000 people published earlier this month, in the Nature journal, linked erythritol, a popular sugar substitute, to increased risk of blood clots. In 2022, the findings of a nine-year study of 103,000 French adults gave a similar conclusion: researchers linked aspartame to an increased risk of stroke, concluding that sweeteners “should not be considered a healthy and safe alternative to sugar”. So should we be reaching for the sugar cubes instead?  It seems even the experts have mixed views. Responding to the French study, Helena Gibson-Moore, nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, acknowledged there can be “conflicting messages around the safety and health effects of artificial (or low calorie) sweeteners, which can cause confusion among consumers. This is often because messages are based on evidence from individual studies, rather than the totality of the evidence”.  It’s worth remembering that studies even of this scale are limited, she added, and there may be many other factors that lead a study participant to suffer from adverse symptoms. Others have pointed out that you’d have to consume an extreme amount of sweetener every day to put yourself at risk (or be very unlucky). One message it seems nutritionists can agree on is the well-established recommendation of “everything in moderation”.  Understanding sweeteners  Sweeteners were used during the sugar shortages of the First and Second World War, later becoming more popular as a result of 1960s diet culture, when they were marketed for weight loss. But their history dates even further, to 1879, when a US scientist experimenting with coal tar derivatives accidentally tasted on his hands some of the chemicals he had been working with, leading to the development of saccharine.  There are now several different types of low- or-zero-calorie sweeteners approved for use in the UK, but the ones most commonly used in food and drink include aspartame, saccharin, sorbitol, sucralose and stevia. In toothpaste, chewing gum and mouthwash, it’s most likely to be xylitol.  For a long time, scientists believed that most sweeteners were more or less the same, and had no nutritive impact on the body. But recent studies have shown this may not strictly be the case. “If your brain detects something sweet, it doesn’t matter if it’s natural sugars, artificial sweeteners or something else: it sends a signal for our bodies to react in some way,” says Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian who teaches nutrition to medical students at Aston University. “Whether or not that reaction is significant is a different matter,” he explains.  In addition, different sweeteners cause different signals: “Aspartame, which is broken down in the body, has a different effect to others like saccharine,” Mellor adds as an example, “and this can have other effects on the bacteria in our gut microbiome.”  The biggest change in thinking in recent times, he explains, is a shift in thinking by nutritionists. “Rather than seeing sweeteners as a wholesale replacement for sugar, we should be using them as part of a step-by-step approach in working to reduce our sugar intake overall”.  In other words, replacing that daily can of sugary Cola with two cans of the “diet” or “zero” alternative gets a big thumbs-down from the experts. Drinking the odd can of “diet” Cola as a way of weaning ourselves off the habit is a far better, if less appealing, option.  Further to this, sweeteners could be guilty of luring many of us into a false sense of security when it comes to healthy living. Guidance published by the WHO last year on the use of sweeteners in the context of reducing type 2 diabetes concluded that there was no evidence that replacing sugar with sweeteners contributes to weight loss.  The paper was controversial, Mellor notes, but the fact remains: when it comes to having a balanced, nutritious diet, indulging in sugar-free chocolates won’t cut it. “It’s what we eat around those sweeteners that matters,” he says. “There is no doubt sweeteners can be useful,” he adds, and for diabetics who can’t have sugar at all they provide a safer treat. “But consumers should be aware of the pros and cons.”  Are ‘natural’ alternatives any better?  Fruit and flower-based syrups are increasingly popular for use in baking, hot drinks and other forms of dessert. Agave nectar, for example, has a milder flavour than honey, and molasses and maple syrup are both popular vegan alternatives to honey. The sugar in these may not be refined, but it is still high.  “With any of these options, it’s important to remember that your body is still processing sugar and sweetness,” says Dr Mellor. A squeeze of honey to sweeten something like tea is “OK”, he suggests, “but agave in particular is very fructose-rich, which in large amounts is difficult for your bowel to absorb and can have a laxative effect. It also converts into fat quicker than other sugars.”  It’s important to think about the quantities involved, therefore – you shouldn’t need as much agave as regular honey in your tea or porridge. An even better option is to experiment with herbs and spices: according to Mellor, it’s often a different flavour, and not sweetness, that the body is really craving.  Ground ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg are all strong “sweeter” flavours that can trick the body into satisfying that sweet tooth. Similarly, Mellor recommends adding black pepper to fruit like strawberries: “It stimulates the taste buds in the same way as sugar.”  He concludes: “Sweeteners, fruit, sugar – it’s all fine in moderation. It’s important to enjoy food, and think about new flavours. We don’t always need to reach for that sugary hit.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvaW5ld3MtbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RydXRoLWFib3V0LXB1dHRpbmctc3dlZXRlbmVyLXlvdXItdGVhLTIzNDQwOTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2019-07-08","Not Discerned","{""Nairobi"", ""Nairobi"", ""Kenya""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:40:37","The way societies produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilizing the climate. People in the poorest nations and communities suffer the most, as is the case across the whole triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and pollution and waste. The miracle material has become a disastrous material – at least, in the way we use it.  There is hope in the global deal to end plastic pollution under negotiation, which is due to land by 2024. The report UNEP is launching today, Turning off the Tap, is coming out just ahead of the next round of talks, and is intended to inform negotiators. What does this report tell us?  First, that there are stark negative economic costs of plastic pollution, running in the hundreds of USD billions annually, destroying infrastructure, impacting energy production and tourism revenue, clogging our drains and flooding our cities, and potentially impacting human health through exposure to hazardous chemicals.  Second, the report tells us that the starting point for change is to eliminate unnecessary and problematic plastics. Three shifts are then required: accelerating the market for reusable products, accelerating the recycling market, and reorienting and diversifying the market for sustainable and safe plastic alternatives.  Third, we need to take a full life-cycle approach to plastics – by which I mean rethinking every stage from the design of products and systems, plastic production, use, recovery and disposal. Redesign of packaging, systems and products is crucial. Chemical engineers and manufacturers have to get creative, both on products and packaging instead of defaulting to plastic when designing products. Finally, we also need to ensure the safe disposal of whatever is not yet designed to be circular and deal with a significant legacy of existing plastic pollution.  This is difficult, we know. I speak to you from Kenya, which is one of more than 30 countries in Africa to have banned single-use plastic bags. This is brave, but we know that going circular is complicated and challenging. We know that poverty and access remain critical barriers to overcome. We need innovation from manufacturers, importers, exporters and governments to make this possible.  If the global community can deliver, plastic pollution could fall by 80 per cent by 2040. This would dramatically reduce social, environmental and human health costs, cut greenhouse gas emissions and create up to 700,000 jobs – mainly in the Global South.  We at UNEP are asking everyone to get involved in the just transition to a new plastics economy, which will improve livelihoods for millions of workers in informal settings.  Governments can deliver a strong deal to end plastic pollution. Businesses can show innovation and commitment to move away from virgin plastics – starting immediately. The financial sector can put its capital behind the transformation. International Financial Institutions and other large investors need to move significant investments towards solid waste management and collection systems, which must include recyclings and organics. Creative chemical engineers must take a hard look at product design and weed out harmful chemicals and plastics. And citizens can use their voices, votes and wallets.  Plastic can continue to bring huge benefits to humanity, but only if we completely rethink the system to keep it circulating in the economy, and out of the natural world. The science is clear: we must turn off the tap on plastic pollution.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZXAub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLXN0b3JpZXMvc3BlZWNoL2p1c3QtdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1uZXctcGxhc3RpY3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2019-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Davis"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:55:21","Who wouldn’t want a motorcycling, mustached bro-down in the middle of a show where a nun fights an awful AI? Worry not, the hit series Mrs. Davis (now streaming on Peacock) has anticipated this desire, and it has placed the prolific Jake McDormand in the role of Wiley. He’s front and center, helping to lead the rebellion, and his scenes with Betty Gilpin (Mrs. Davis) are always loaded.  If McDormand looks familiar to you, it may be because he has plenty of acting credits to his name. His work isn’t confined to science fiction and genre, but he does appear in such projects often. In continuing celebration of the madness that is Mrs. Davis, we’re running down our favorite roles performed by the talented Mr. McDormand.  Limitless (Brian Finch)  One of McDormand’s biggest showcases was in this 2015-2016 CBS series. It was a spin-off from the Bradley Cooper movie of the same name. A mysterious drug gives Brian (McDormand) the chance to unlock the full potential of his mind, and Cooper’s character from the movie is on hand to guide him. Running for 22 episodes, the series also featured Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as well as Ron Rifkin and Colin Salmon in recurring roles.  RELATED: Margo Martindale’s Greatest Sci-fi/Genre Roles Outside of Mrs. Davis  Response to the series was mixed, but the response to McDormand was not. He was a natural stand-in for Cooper, we liked him, and we were very interested in where his journey could have gone. He was able to make Brian’s shifting back and forth between different areas of the show believable. He would have taken the series to some incredible places, but CBS canned the whole thing after one season. They didn’t see limitless money there.  What We Do in the Shadows (Jeff Suckler)  He only appears in three episodes in Season 1 (and one episode in Season 2), but McDormand makes an impression. That’s not an easy thing to do in this series because every single person on the screen (and behind the screen) is a genius.  Technically, he played the role of “Jeff.” In reality, he was the reincarnation of Gregor, a former lover of Nadja (Natasia Demetriou). Her influence leads Jeff to a mental breakdown, but eventually he discovers his true self. McDormand is hilarious, but also touching, which is the key to the entire series. He demonstrates it perfectly.  With a passion for farewell topiaries and getting beheaded, Jeff/Gregor was a fun addition. There could always be a way for him to return to the series.  Watchmen (Nelson Gardner)  McDormand was only in one episode of this landmark miniseries. Why do we mention it? For one thing, every episode of this 2019 miracle show is special. For another, the episode that he appeared in was “This Extraordinary Being.” It’s the installment where Angela (Regina King) gets the true history of Hooded Justice.  Nelson Gardner, aka Captain Metropolis, was an integral part of the Hooded Justice story. They were lovers, but Nelson also refuses to help at a critical point. He is all about hiding true identity and being careful about when to become involved, and McDormand plays it all perfectly. It is a heartbreaking addition to the already heartbreaking history of Hooded Justice.  RELATED: “Yes, Tyler Durden Inspired Wiley’s Look in Mrs. Davis”  Live Free or Die Hard (Jim)  Dad’s not dead. McDormand has the honor of kicking off this 2007 Die Hard sequel by groping Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in a car. Bad move, Jim. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is on the scene right quick, and he’s taken on both Hans Gruber and Ellis. Pathetic frat-rapist Jim is toast.  There’s not much to it, but Jim is another character in the Die Hard series who cannot possibly die soon enough. He’s not at the Ellis level (no one is), but it’s a tradition in this series. He helps to illustrate the John/Lucy dynamic, which will be important for the rest of the movie. McDormand plays “snot-nosed MRA trash bag” quite well.  Related  Aquamarine (Raymond)  In 2006, McDormand showed off his magical romcom skills. Emma Roberts finds a mermaid in a beach club pool (happens to her all the time) and McDormand falls in love. The romance between Aquamarine (the mermaid, played by Sara Paxton) and Raymond is not the point of the movie, but it’s nice.  Raymond could have been just another brainless, pretty-boy lifeguard who was rejected from both Baywatch and Temptation Island. That’s the role, but McDormand gave it some personality. We’d normally despise a character like this, but we liked him as played by McDormand. That’s huge. Huge! He helped Aquamarine be where the people are.  Bring It on: All or Nothing (Brad Warner)  We felt it necessary to remind everyone that he was in this. It’s not science fiction or genre. It was straight-to-video. McDormand lives and laughs alongside Hayden Panettiere. If Mrs. Davis fans are brutally honest with themselves, then this could be what they are remembering McDormand from.  Admit it, and this will all be over.  Jake McDormand brings it on every week on Mrs. Davis, which streams new episodes on Peacock every Thursday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9tcnMtZGF2aXMtamFrZS1tY2Rvcm1hbmRzLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXJvbGVz0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3lmeS5jb20vc3lmeS13aXJlL21ycy1kYXZpcy1qYWtlLW1jZG9ybWFuZHMtZ3JlYXRlc3Qtcm9sZXM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As Nyairra is rushed to the hospital, her mother Shernisha Cheney is aware that no matter what happens, her daughter's life has been permanently altered.  “The scar, the bullet, the prosthetic eye is definitely a constant reminder,"" Cheney said. ""Just hearing her say those things about how she didn’t want to die that night, that’s what she told me on the way to the hospital. She said, 'Mommy, I don’t want to die,' and I said 'You’re not going to die.' That plays over and over and over again in my head. Every single day.""  We first met Nyairra on April 19th 2022, one month after she was shot.  She was wearing a Be Kind Shirt, her eye covered in a patch, showing off her new Barbies.  She, along with her Mom were asking for anyone with information in her case to come forward. It’s a case that remains unsolved to this day, despite a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.  Now at the age of nine, Nyairra wants to share her story with Mom by her side, because she survived and she knows there are others who don’t.  “I want to know why y’all have guns if you don’t need it to protect somebody. If you don’t need it to protect you,” Nyairra said.  Nyairra also wants people to know the night she was shot and lost her right eye is not the only thing that defines her.  She’s also a singer, active in her church. She's a sister and an aspiring nail and makeup artist.  “You can be shot in a place where you’re not supposed to be here, and God saved you. So just to see her grow and just to see God’s miracle is amazing to me,” Cheney said.  But the scars of gun violence aren’t just visible on the outside, and Mom notices the differences daily.  “She’s still very confident, but she has attachment, she has anxiety, she has attachment issues. She’s never wanted to be around me so much, like we sleep together every night and to see how scared she is, it just makes me feel helpless because how am I supposed to help her? I feel like I do everything I’m supposed to do and she still feels this way,” Cheney said.  And just because her eye is now different, others treat her differently.  “My daughter is getting bullied, like these are the things that come with it. I had a little girl tell my daughter ‘shut up or I’ll shoot you again.’ These are the things we have to deal with,” Cheney said.  Cheney says it’s her daughter’s strength that carries their family through, but catching Nyairra’s shooter is what would really bring some peace of mind.  “It would mean the world to me because anyone that careless should not be out on the street,” Cheney said.  And for Nyairra, a sense of safety.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53a3ljLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvOS15ZWFyLW9sZC1nYXJmaWVsZC1oZWlnaHRzLWdpcmwtc2hhcmVzLWd1bi12aW9sZW5jZS1zdXJ2aXZhbC1zdG9yeS85NS00MGMzMzMzMy1lMDkxLTQ5MzQtYmI2Yi00NGJkYzc1ODlkNGPSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2t5Yy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9jcmltZS85LXllYXItb2xkLWdhcmZpZWxkLWhlaWdodHMtZ2lybC1zaGFyZXMtZ3VuLXZpb2xlbmNlLXN1cnZpdmFsLXN0b3J5Lzk1LTQwYzMzMzMzLWUwOTEtNDkzNC1iYjZiLTQ0YmRjNzU4OWQ0Yw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-06-30","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 22:21:33","The remains of Casa Ramona in westside San Bernardino are being hauled away at last as part of a $4.9 million cleanup fully funded by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.  The historic Mediterranean-style building on West Seventh Street housed the former school for decades, but was leveled in the wake of a 2020 fire that ripped through the boarded-up and abandoned structure.  With nothing but a heaping pile of contaminated debris remaining, Casa Ramona Executive Director Esther Estrada, a former longtime San Bernardino councilmember who attended Ramona School in the 1940s, sought and received federal funding for a costly cleanup.  Crews began removing the remnants late last month and expect to finish by the end of June, Estrada said in a phone interview Tuesday, May 16.  “It’s going very, very well,” she added.  From what Estrada has seen these past two weeks, crews are packaging the rubble into large boxes to be hauled away.  Workers are there five days a week.  San Bernardino-based Brickley Environmental, the company tasked with the cleanup, has placed gauges around the property that alert workers to any hazardous materials in the air, Estrada added. In the event of an alert, crews implement mitigation measures.  Furthermore, Estrada continued, company representatives have engaged with those living near the property and answered any and all questions.  While clearing the Casa Ramona site after three years is reason to celebrate, Estrada worries about what will become of the property as long-range plans to develop affordable senior housing there unfold.  Chiefly, Estrada fears the soon-to-be vacant lot will attract illegal dumping and homeless encampments.  Vandals and thieves already made off with the chain link fence that was placed around the site after the building was razed, Estrada said.  “It’s been very, very disappointing and disheartening,” she added. “We deserve to have a better way of life in San Bernardino.”  Councilmember Theodore Sanchez, whose 1st Ward includes Casa Ramona, is in the same boat, and recently pitched his council colleagues on earmarking $100,000 for the installation of a wrought-iron fence around the property.  “The place will be vacant for a while until Casa Ramona pulls another miracle and secures a couple million dollars to get senior housing built there,” Sanchez said by phone this week. “In the meantime, if it’s a vacant lot on the westside that’s not secured, it will turn into a dump site.”  Casa Ramona presently operates out of Nunez Park.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNic3VuLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2LzQtOS1taWxsaW9uLWNsZWFudXAtYmVnaW5zLWF0LWhpc3RvcmljLWNhc2EtcmFtb25hLXNpdGUtaW4tc2FuLWJlcm5hcmRpbm_SAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy5zYnN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi80LTktbWlsbGlvbi1jbGVhbnVwLWJlZ2lucy1hdC1oaXN0b3JpYy1jYXNhLXJhbW9uYS1zaXRlLWluLXNhbi1iZXJuYXJkaW5vL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(AP) – Three people have died in a truck after someone in it fired at a different vehicle in South Carolina and then the truck crashed into a North Carolina house while trying to get away from law enforcement, authorities said.  The chase started around 1 a.m. Sunday in Blacksburg, South Carolina, and ended with the pickup, which had turned off its headlights, slamming into a house in Shelby, North Carolina, causing significant damage, investigators in both states said.  Three people in the truck between the ages of 15 and 20 died, while three others in the vehicle survived the crash, Shelby police told news outlets.  No one in the vehicle that was shot at was injured, Cleveland County, North Carolina, Sheriff Alan Norman said in a statement.  “Given the relentlessness with which these suspects pursued and shot at the victims, it is a miracle,” Norman said.  The people in the truck fired on the other vehicle several times starting in Cherokee County, South Carolina, and continuing for about 10 miles (16 kilometers) toward Shelby before a Cleveland County deputy started the chase, authorities said.

Loreen’s Eurovision winner is making a charge. After appearing at No. 28 on the U.K.’s First Look chart, which measures the popularity of songs after the first 48 hours of the cycle, “Tattoo” climbs to No. 9 on the midweek chart.  If it continues to stick in the days ahead, “Tattoo” will give Loreen her second U.K. top 10 after 2012’s “Euphoria” went to No. 3. “Euphoria” won Eurovision that year, held in Baku, Azerbaijan.  At Liverpool’s M&S Bank Arena on Saturday night (May 13), Loreen became the first female artist to win Eurovision, with 583 points.  Meanwhile, Mae Muller continues on her mission for a maiden U.K. top 10 appearance with her own Eurovision entry, “I Wrote A Song.” Though Muller’s song wasn’t a hit with the Eurovision jury and viewers, limping-in second-from-last (with 24 points), the English artist’s song rises to No. 6 on the Official Chart Update.  Co-written by Mae, Karen Poole of Alisha’s Attic and Lewis Thompson, “I Wrote A Song” should convincingly outperform its No. 30 peak, set in March of this year.

"miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:28:06","By Nidal al-Mughrabi  GAZA (Reuters) – When an Israeli missile struck the residential block of the Nabhan family in Gaza four days ago, no one was killed, but a family with five disabled members were among 45 people made homeless.  For the five siblings, three of whom are on wheel chairs and all five of whom suffer from physical disability, muscular dystrophy and convulsions, the misery was multiplied, as their wheelchairs, medicine, special beds and bathroom were buried under the rubble.  The family now lives with relatives close to their old shelter. Every morning relatives carry them out as people continued to flock to the site, some showing sympathy at their harrowing experience, and others carrying gifts for the girls.  “The house blew up while we were being moved out. Our wheelchairs, medicine and clothes were inside. Nothing was left,” said 16-year-old Hanin, who has a disability in both legs.  The others are aged 3, 18, 29 and 38. The emotional toll of losing the house seemed to have worsened the older brother’s mental state, as he has become very nervous, always shouting and sometimes crying, his relatives said.  According to officials from Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, the latest round of Israeli air strikes, which began on May 9, have destroyed 15 residential blocks, containing more than 50 apartments. In addition, 940 buildings have been damaged, 49 beyond repair.  The Israeli military says it takes every effort to limit civilian casualties and damage and accuses the militant group of hiding command centres and other military sites in residential areas.  On May 13, Hanin’s older brother Jalal received a call from a private number, but he went out to let his cousin respond as he stutters while talking. The caller was an Israeli officer who ordered them to evacuate the house five minutes before they bombed it.  The cousin, Hussam Nabhan, 45, tried to stall with the officer, telling him the house included disabled people, but it was all in vain, he said.  “He told me you to have five minutes. We rushed to the house and found the girls lying on the ground. Thanks to the neighbours we have been able to take them out and we managed to leave the house by a miracle,” he told Reuters.  The mother, Najah, 57, said they failed to take anything from the house even the identity cards.  “The house was the girls’ shelter, they had got a disabled toilet, wheelchairs, a bed to sleep. Things that had been difficult to get, now there is nothing,” Najah said.  “How am I going to carry her after the wheeler was gone, also the (healthy) mattresses were gone,” she added.  The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million Palestinians in cities, towns, and refugee camps squeezed within an area of 365 square km (141 square miles). Its borders are sealed off by neighbouring Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns with Hamas, which runs the territory.  Several wars and a 16-year-old Israeli-led blockade have crippled the enclave’s already ailing economy.

"miracle","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Austin"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:51:00","Entertainment Ben Affleck’s new movie ‘Hypnotic’ marks a career low at the box office The Robert Rodriguez thriller — hampered by COVID delays, a lawsuit, and almost zero marketing — did even worse than ""Gigli."" Ben Affleck stars in ""Hypnotic."" Ketchup Entertainment  “Hypnotic,” the new psychological thriller starring Ben Affleck, failed to mesmerize audiences at the box office this weekend.  The Robert Rodriguez-directed film earned only $2.4 million at the box office in its opening weekend, the lowest total for a movie released on at least 1,000 screens in Affleck’s decades-long career.  In the film, Affleck plays Danny Rourke, a detective whose search for his missing daughter leads to him teaming up with a psychic (Alice Braga) and chasing a bank robber who appears to have mind-altering powers (David Fichtner).  Even without adjusting for inflation, “Hypnotic” fell short of Affleck’s other noted career bombs, including 2003’s “Gigli” ($3.8 million opening weekend) and 1998’s “Phantoms” ($3.1 million).  Advertisement:  The failure of “Hypnotic” wasn’t a surprise, given that the film faced one crisis after another during its production. A combination of COVID delays, an insurance lawsuit, a seemingly shuttered studio, and a lack of marketing made the chances of the film achieving mainstream success vanishingly small. In fact, it’s a minor miracle that the film was completed and released at all.  Rodriguez originally intended to shoot the film in spring 2020 in Los Angeles, and had already completed a costly pre-production before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In fall 2020, the film’s producers unsuccessfully sued their insurance company, with a judge dismissing the case in July 2021. In total, production was set to start before being shut down three separate times. When filming finally kicked off in fall 2021, production shifted to Rodriguez’s own personal studio space in Austin.  By the time “Hypnotic” began filming, Solstice Studios, the upstart company overseeing the project, had laid off all but 10 people, including its CEO. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the skeleton crew’s sole focus was completing Solstice’s duties to market and distribute “Hypnotic” both domestically and internationally.  Even with the cost-cutting, creative editing, and a slimmed-down runtime of 92 minutes, the film’s budget has been estimated between $65-80 million by various sources.  Advertisement:  In an interview with Chron, Rodriguez described Affleck and co-star Alice Braga laughing as they filmed what was supposed to be a high-speed motorcycle chase scene at 7 miles per hour inside Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios.  “COVID shut us down, and we kept losing money, and having to shoot it faster and faster,” Rodriguez told Screen Rant in a separate interview. “Even my crew was like, ‘Are you sure we can get away with just pipes and a sign? Is that going to work?'”  In February 2023, Deadline released an article stating that “Hypnotic”‘s international buyers were looking to back out of their deals, which required that the movie be released in at least 2,000 theaters in the U.S. Shortly before the article’s release, producers announced that they had found a new distributor with Solstice out of the picture: Ketchup Entertainment.  The little-known company had never handled a film of the size and budget of “Hypnotic” before. Its most well-known film domestically was 2013’s “Linsanity,” which grossed approximately $333,000 in the U.S. and Canada, according to Box Office Mojo.  Director Robert Rodriguez on stage during the Q&A for “Hypnotic” at SXSW in Austin.  In March 2023, an audience at the South by Southwest festival in Austin saw an incomplete “work in progress” version of the film, only two months before it was scheduled for nationwide release. And leading up to its May 12 release, there was a conspicuous lack of marketing for “Hypnotic,” with Affleck doing no interviews for the film.  Advertisement:  In the end, it may have been Rodriguez’s commitment to releasing “Hypnotic,” a film he’d been tinkering with since 2002, that got the movie over the finish line.  Despite a lackluster response from both critics (a 35 percent freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (a C+ grade on CinemaScore), the “Spy Kids” director is proud of what he accomplished. In an interview with Collider, Rodriguez compared the production to working on his first film, 1992’s “El Mariachi,” which had a micro-budget of $7,000.  “It made the movie better to have so much taken away from us,” Rodriguez said. “I had to rely on my own ‘Mariachi’ tricks, and it was really fun. I think people will sense the fun that we had making it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaHlwbm90aWMtbW92aWUtYmVuLWFmZmxlY2std2Vla2VuZC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaHlwbm90aWMtbW92aWUtYmVuLWFmZmxlY2std2Vla2VuZC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2019-03-14","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:24:53","People can’t get the medications they need to survive or live healthier lives because of drug shortages and Congress wants to know why.  Laura Bray testified on Capitol Hill about these issues. Four years ago, her daughter, Abby was diagnosed with Leukemia.  “We were told we were lucky that this Leukemia, unlike many other pediatric cancers, has a cure,” she told lawmakers.  So, Abby started a drug regimen.  “When a child doesn’t want to take her meds anymore, when they can’t take the pain of being poked and prodded again, when they lose their hair, when it’s just too much, we all focus on the importance of the medicine for their survival,” Bray said.  Then, the family got more bad news.  “I was sitting in a hospital room with Abby when I first heard the words ‘we don’t have the drug needed today; it’s on shortage,’” Bray recalled. “My Abby, our fierce middle child, caught it right away and said ‘I thought I needed this. Does this mean I die?’”  Abby’s miracle cure was hit by shortages of three different drugs over nine months. So Bray started a nonprofit with the mission of ending this issue. It’s called Angels for Change.  The family isn’t alone -- The FDA lists more than 120 drugs currently in shortages. Another tally from pharmacists has more than 230 drug shortages. Drugs like common antibiotics, asthma drugs and heart meds have been in short supply.  The conversation on Capitol Hill turned to transparency and collaboration.  “Greater transparency will help us better understand where we need to shore up the domestic production and invest in new technologies,” Rep. Kathy Castor (D) Florida said.  “We must encourage American innovation, increase domestic manufacturing capabilities and promote the adoption of quality generic drugs,” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) Washington said.  Bray told lawmakers it will take a multi-layered approach to solve a problem with such high stakes.  “Together we can ensure no child will ask their parent, ‘will I die if I don’t get my medicine,’” she added.

"miracle","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Anniston"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:26:00","ANNISTON, Ala. (WBRC) - Chief Nick Bowles says they want graduates and their families to celebrate the momentous occasion, but he wants to see it happen safely and responsibly.  Last year, Anniston Police responded to calls from hundreds of people at a party, and several began shooting at one another. Six people were shot, and Chief Bowles says it was a miracle that none of the injuries were life-threatening and no one lost their life.  He says this year, party goers must be vigilant.  “If they see weapons call the police department, we’ll handle it,” said Bowles. “That’s what we’re here to do. We would rather come and run some people off or check some people if they are there with weapons than come and put children in body bags.”  It’s a graphic warning, but Chief Bowles says parents and children need to hear it.  “It starts with this group of ABC people who are invited, and that’s all that’s supposed to be there,” says Chief Bowles. “But this XYZ group decides to show up and may not get along with ABC, and then violence erupts. That may just start with fist fights or words or whatever. But more and more these young folks have been turning to violence with weapons with firearms, and the result is devastating.”  One way to prevent your child’s party from this type of violence is to have security. Chief Bowles says you can hire an officer with their department  “There are legal ways at city meeting centers or places like that it will also bring police officers in for a cost,” says Chief Bowles. “Some of that stuff will really bring down any violence. You know you’re not going to show up to a party with a police officer there that are not going to let them start any trouble.”  He wants to remind adults who plan to chaperone these parties that if they see weapons or any violence, they should contact the police.  “The alternative is not calling the police and having gun violence erupt at your party and then that adult possibly being a part of the people who get charged because they let this happen,” says Chief Bowles. “Parents can talk to their kids as well. If they’re going to send them to these parties, hey, you need to be aware if somebody shows up and starts some stuff starts, fights, leave. It’s your time to go.”  Get news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here.  Copyright 2023 WBRC.

"miracle","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 14:21:03","For the second time since 2020, the Dallas Stars are playing in the Western Conference Final.  After knocking out the upstart Seattle Kraken in seven games with a 2-1 win Monday night, Dallas booked a date in the third round with the Vegas Golden Knights.  It wasn’t pretty, but really, aside from three bad periods in game one, three and six, the Stars proved they were the better team in a lengthy series, and handled Seattle’s strong back-checking pressure and solid goaltending to win.  The two matched up in 2020 on the Stars’ miracle run to the Stanley Cup Final, where Dallas dominated and took it 4-1. Both teams have changed significantly since then- even current Stars coach Peter Deboer was on the bench for the Golden Knights. Here’s a look at some factors that might influence the series.  Home Cookin’  Dallas has been great at home this season overall, but especially in the playoffs. The Stars went 22-10-9 at the American Airlines Center in the regular season, and now are 5-2 in the postseason. Aside from game one against, goalie Jake Oettinger has been his best at home as well, highlighted by a shutout of Minnesota in game five of round one.  Vegas earned the 1-seed in the regular season, so 3-seed Dallas does lose home ice advantage it’s had the entire postseason thus far. Can they earn at last a split at T-Mobile Arena to try to flip the script?  What’s going on with Robertson, Oettinger?  Dallas’ clearest flaws have come from the inconsistent play of team leaders Jason Robertson and Oettinger. After scoring 46 goals in the regular season, Minnesota and Seattle have keyed in on Robertson and held him to just two goals through 13 postseason games. He did show signs of breaking out of it with a three-assist effort in game six vs. the Kraken, but still hasn’t quite been the same player he was in the regular season. Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski have more than picked up the slack, though- combining for 17 goals in the first two rounds.  Oettinger is a different story. It’s been more of a Jekyll-and-Hyde effect through the first two rounds. He was 18.6 seconds away from a second shutout in Monday’s game had it not been for a tally with 18.6 seconds left. On the other hand, he gave up at least three goals in a whopping three times that series. The Stars need him to steal at least two games in Vegas to have a chance- which he is certainly capable of doing (look no further than his 64-save performance in game seven vs. Calgary last year).  Scouting Vegas  After missing the playoffs for the first time in their young franchise history last season, the Golden Knights rallied with a Pacific division title this season. Former Boston Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy has done the opposite of what his former team did this postseason and helped them back to the conference final, led by a new core.  It’s a completely different core led by much less starpower than years past. Former Buffalo Sabre Jack Eichel leads the way with 14 points, while former depth piece Chandler Stephenson has emerged as a top-six player. Big parts of its early core like William Karlsson, Jonathan Marchessault and Alex Pietrangelo are still around.  In net, the young tandem of Adin Hill and former Winnipeg Jet Laurent Brossoit lead the way. Of the teams still remaining in the playoffs, Vegas has split its goalie starts the most, but Brossoit has been the hotter hand of late and will likely start game one.  DSF Prediction: Dallas’ run comes to an end in six games. Vegas has re-tooled and is a deeper, less arrogant team than three years ago. It’s hard to imagine Oettinger being able to steal two or three games on the road, which he’ll need to do- especially if Robertson still isn’t scoring. I don’t think Pavelski and Hintz can carry the Stars past a more solid all-around Golden Knights team by themselves. But hey, it’s been a great run – and I’ve certainly been wrong before.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9uaGwvYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3RhcnNfdG9wX2tyYWtlbl9pbl83X2ZhY2VfdmVnYXNfaW5fY29uZmVyZW5jZV9maW5hbF9mb3Jfc2Vjb25kX3RpbWVfaW5fZm91cl95ZWFycy9zMV8xNjQ2M18zODgxOTE2N9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9uaGwvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYW1wL3N0YXJzX3RvcF9rcmFrZW5faW5fN19mYWNlX3ZlZ2FzX2luX2NvbmZlcmVuY2VfZmluYWxfZm9yX3NlY29uZF90aW1lX2luX2ZvdXJfeWVhcnMvczFfMTY0NjNfMzg4MTkxNjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-04-01","20:00:00","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:49:32","Gabe Vincent has had a tremendous story to his NBA career. Going undrafted, the Miami Heat gave the young guard an opportunity by calling him up from their g-league team in the 2019-2020 season, the same season Jimmy Butler arrived in South Florida. At 26 years old, he has gone from someone who was on 10-day contracts to someone who is now the Heat’s starting PG in the midst of a deep playoff run.  He has had the best year of his career this season. Putting up averages of 9.4 ppg, 2.5 apg, and 0.9 stls on 40% shooting, 87% from the free throw line and 34% from deep.  Vincent is one of those “culture” type of guys where his impact goes beyond the box score numbers. He has been valuable and available all season long. He was playing off the bench (but in the regular rotation) for about half this season. But when Kyle Lowry went down with a knee injury that kept him out an extended amount of time, Vincent earned the starting spot and ran with it.  He has been able to hold it down and run the offense for Miami, and although he doesn’t have those eye popping numbers, he has been very consistent overall on both ends of the floor.  Specifically during this playoff run, Vincent has had huge moments. Including hitting a big time 3 pointer to cut the lead to 1 in the closing seconds of game 5 vs the Milwaukee Bucks.  The Heat went on to tie the game, send it to OT and complete the gentleman sweep of the best team overall in the NBA on the road.  Vincent has had some strong offensive outings including a 20+ point performance in game 1’s road victory against the New York Knicks as well.  The combo guard is set to hit free agency this coming offseason. According to Shams, there could be a significantly strong market around the league for Vincent’s services.  Being that he is unrestricted, Miami won’t be able to match any offer for Vincent. His ability to be a reliable starting PG who can also play well off the bench could be very enticing to opposing teams.  Hopefully, the winning culture, loyalty and already strong built relationships within the Heat team/staff is enough for him to stick around.  Vincent is a very key role player to have on a championship team and is a great “Heat Culture” kind of guy.  If this 8th seed Heat team pulls off the miracle and secures an NBA championship it will be very hard to see Vincent walking away from that. Even if they don’t, Miami is a pretty attractive destination that could make it a long, difficult decision to leave especially for a role player.  All in all though, money talks. We’ve seen it with PJ Tucker just a year ago. The goal would be to find a happy medium in contract negotiations money wise, but there could always be that one team who is willing to break the bank. Especially on a young, versatile player with lots of upside.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGhvdGhvb3BzLmNvbS9wL2dhYmUtdmluY2VudC1leHBlY3RlZC10by1oYXZlLWEtc2lnbmlmaWNhbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 09:52:00","Madeline holding her twins (Picture: Caters News Agency)  A mum born with two uteruses has welcomed twins, conceiving one baby through IVF in one uterus and the other baby naturally in her other uterus.  Madeline Kaklikos, 24, and her husband, Jon, 27, welcomed their miracle twin boys, Cole and Nate, in February following ten rounds of fertility treatment over three years.  Medics described Madeline's case as one-in-50 million, due to the fact they were both conceived using different methods and were each developed in a different uterus.  Madeline, from Melbourne, Australia, discovered that she has a rare congenital condition called uterine didelphys - where a woman is born with two uteruses - when she and her husband began trying for a baby in 2020 without any success.  After thinking they were never going to fall pregnant, Madeline and John were shocked but totally over the moon to learn that were actually expecting two miracle babies.  Madeline said: 'After ten rounds of fertility treatment and years of trying to conceive, it never crossed our minds that we would fall pregnant naturally while undergoing IVF.  'I'd already been diagnosed with PCOS in 2017, when I was 18, and knew it would be difficult to conceive.  'However, during an ultrasound to investigate further, it was discovered that I actually have two uteruses and I was diagnosed with uterine didelphys (UD).'  Jon and Madeline were told it may be difficult to conceive naturally (Picture: Caters News Agency)  Doctors suggested the couple try IVF, and two embryos were implanted into Madeline's 'more accessible uterus' but unfortunately didn't take.  'We kept trying, but by the time I had my eighth round, I was terrified we'd never have a baby,' commented the mum.  'It was a dark time, and I really struggled to find hope.'  A few months later, the next egg collection was able to make 11 embryos, and in June last year the pair got the call that they were finally pregnant.  'I was with Jon, my parents and brother, at the time of the call, and we all erupted into screams and had tears streaming down our faces as we hugged,' said Madeline.  Each foetus developed in a separate uterus (Picture: Caters News Agency)  It was at the 10-week scan that Madeline learned she was expecting twins, with a second spontaneous baby in her second uterus.  'Jon and I looked at each other in total disbelief,' she recalled.  'The doctors explained to us that the chances of having one baby in one uterus and a second in the other were one-in-50-million.  'We also realised that they had been conceived at different times and in different ways. One twin was conceived through IVF, and the other was naturally conceived.'  As the pregnancy was classed as high risk, Madeline was under constant monitoring and was offered a planned C-section as her condition made a natural delivery impossible.  The twins are now three months old and are happy and healthy (Picture: Caters News Agency)  Madeline gave birth to her twins on February 20, at 34 weeks, and says that she was petrified, but her husband kept her calm.  'When I was able to hold my babies for the first time, I felt like my heart was going to explode,' she said.  'We only had 10 minutes before they were taken to special care, but it was everything I'd dreamed of.'  Although Madeline found it hard to be separated from the newborns, she spent as much time with them as possible and found comfort in the fact they were looked after by 'amazing nurses' if she wasn't there.  After 17 days in hospital, Cole and Nate were discharged and able to go home with their parents.

(KALB) - On Tuesday, May 16, a naturalization ceremony in Central Louisiana made citizenship official for several, and it was one of the most diverse naturalization ceremonies to take place in the Western District of Louisiana.  Moments after receiving her naturalization certificate, Milly J. Robinson said this is something she has dreamed about for a long time, growing up in Kingston, Jamaica.  “You have to believe in yourself and trust God because he is a way maker, he is a miracle worker, he’s a problem solver,” said Robinson. “So, a moment like this, it’s all God, bro.”  Robinson was one of 20 immigrants who became citizens at a naturalization ceremony held in Alexandria. They hailed from 18 countries, scattered across six continents. Judge Joseph Perez-Montez presided over the ceremony. He shared with the new citizens his own experience with the naturalization process.  “So, I am the child of immigrants from Cuba,” said Montez. “My entire childhood I was reminded of the value of citizenship and the importance of appreciating what the country has to offer. When you grow up in that environment and you are reminded of things like that, that are easy to forget all the privileges we have as citizens of this country.”  Sinae Baek came to the U.S. from South Korea in 2012 as an international student. Baek is a violinist with the Rapides Symphony Orchestra.  Even after 10 years, Baek admitted that it was hard to contain emotion when she heard her name called.  “Well, initially I was excited,” said Baek. “In the middle of the ceremony, I got a little sentimental and emotional but mostly I am very excited.”  After the new citizens said the Pledge of Allegiance, they were dismissed from the courtroom with strict instructions from U.S. District Judge Dee Drell, ordering them to do the most American thing anyone can do, eat a hamburger.

A Canfield mom has a unique problem and she’s hoping you can help with a miracle.  She didn’t pour the cement, but Kelly Long helped build the special needs playground at Walnut Grove in Canfield.  “I have a set of twin daughters who both have autism. I’m also on the board of directors for the Autism Society. I go out to the school systems and I advocate for services and accommodations in the school systems, because any special parent knows, it’s kind of a battle to get those services,” Long said.  Now, Long has her own battle — a fight for her life.  “I have end-stage kidney failure. I have been a type 1 diabetic for almost 34 years. I’m on the kidney transplant waiting list at the Cleveland Clinic,” Long said.  Long had an evaluation there recently and got some bad news.  “Most people have a few or some antibodies, and I have 64, which is excessive. I’ve been told that only 18% of the population will match me,” she said.  Now, Long is praying for a small miracle.  “So I need to find someone who is O positive, that’s part of that 18% to match me. For anybody that wants to learn more about donating a kidney, you can go to www.ClevelandClinic/KidneyDonor.org. It’s an online process,” Long said.  If you’re not O positive though, there are still ways you can help Long.  “That one person is all we need, but we just need thousands of you to share it and help find somebody to get her better,” said Dana Winters, Long’s longtime friend.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1hdXRpc20tYWR2b2NhdGUtaW4tbmVlZC1vZi1yYXJlLWtpZG5leS1kb25hdGlvbi_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy53a2JuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbG9jYWwtYXV0aXNtLWFkdm9jYXRlLWluLW5lZWQtb2YtcmFyZS1raWRuZXktZG9uYXRpb24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-05-06","Not Discerned","{""Vacaville"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 18:48:54","As sure as the Dixon May Fair comes and goes in early May and Fiesta Days arrives in late May, the Solano Symphony embarks on its annual Pops concert, a program of light classical music, movie themes and often-breezy orchestral arrangements and medleys of musical theater works, jazz and pop tunes. In short, it’s a feast of froth.  Still, by all accounts, it is one of the symphony’s most anticipated and popular annual concerts, a season-ender — and literally ending every year with Sousa’s rousingly patriotic anthem “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” The music gets underway at 3 p.m. Sunday in the Vacaville Performing Arts Theatre.  “We’re almost in the final stages of rehearsals,” longtime symphony conductor Semyon Lohss said during a telephone interview Sunday, adding that the last of two would be Thursday night at the Laurel Creek Elementary School in Fairfield.  The program begins with John Williams’ “Superman” March; followed by Offenbach’s Overture to his operetta “The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,” a piece with tuneful, exhilarating melodies; Faure’s Pavane; Sullivan’s (he of Gilbert and Sullivan fame) Overture to “The Pirates of Penzance”: and Johann Strauss Jr.’s “Orpheus-Quadrille,” in which “Strauss used passages from Offenbach,” noted Lohss, a native of Russia who have lived in Fairfield for decades.  After an intermission, the second half of the program boasts “a beginning that will be rather unusual,” he said, referring to a past silent-auction fundraiser that awarded the winner with the prize of leading the orchestra during the Sunday afternoon concert.  The guest conductor? Nancy Hopkins, who, said Lohss, has never conducted an orchestra but received “a crash course” on conducting with two 45-minute lessons. She will lead the musicians in a rendition of Leroy Anderson’s “Belle of the Ball.”  What would a Pops concert be without a taste Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story” tunes? A lot of hummable ones, for sure: “I Feel Pretty,” “Maria,” “Something’s Coming,” “Tonight,” “One Hand, One Heart,” “Cool,” and “America.”  The program will continue with Hermann’s “Duke Ellington Fantasy,” and Stone’s arrangement of several Cole Porter songs, from “You Do Something to Me” and “Love for Sale” to “Night and Day” and “Anything Goes.”  Like the lilting songs of Jerry Bock’s “Fiddler on the Roof” score? You will hear plenty of them: “If I Were a Rich Man,” “Matchmaker,” “Miracle of Miracles,” “Sunrise, Sunset,” “To Life,” and “Tradition.”  Anderson’s song library returns with “Fiddle-Faddle,” and Sousa’s 1896 march, his best-known work and the official U.S. national march, closes out the symphony’s 36th season with a formidable and riveting blend of wind and brass instruments and percussion that may remind many of the sound patriotism while tugging at the ol’ heartstrings.  Of the annual Pops concert, Lohss expressed “pleasant surprise” about attendance numbers over the years.  After the concert, year over year, he remembered “walking into the (VPAT) lobby and just observing the atmosphere, how people communicate with each other after the concert.”  “Every time, people tell me they enjoyed the program,” Lohss recalled, adding, “They’ll say, ‘I’ve never heard that particular piece of music, but I enjoyed it.’ “  IF YOU GOSolano SymphonyPops concertWhen: 3 p.m. SundayWhere: Vacaville Performing Arts Theatre1010 Ulatis Drive, VacavilleTickets: $10 to $35Telephone: 469-4013Online: www.solanosymphony.org","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc2hlcmFsZG9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9tYXktMTgtdmFsbGVqby12YWNhdmlsbGUtYXJ0cy1hbmQtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1zb3VyY2UtYS1mZWFzdC1vZi1mcm90aC1zb2xhbm8tc3ltcGhvbnlzLXNlYXNvbi1lbmRpbmctcG9wcy1jb25jZXJ0L9IBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc2hlcmFsZG9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9tYXktMTgtdmFsbGVqby12YWNhdmlsbGUtYXJ0cy1hbmQtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1zb3VyY2UtYS1mZWFzdC1vZi1mcm90aC1zb2xhbm8tc3ltcGhvbnlzLXNlYXNvbi1lbmRpbmctcG9wcy1jb25jZXJ0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fact that you exist — and that you’re happy— is a form of protest.”  “I love that you’re so unhappy because I’m happy,” Buttigieg said of his critics. “I love being a dad; I love this life; I love that I’m alive; I love that I made it out of the closet.”  Buttigieg added that it’s important for all LGBTQ people to live their lives openly and joyfully “not only to show other people that you can have it, but to show other people that we’re not going anywhere.”  Buttigieg’s memoir, rewritten for younger audiences, was released Tuesday. It is “the book I wish I could go back in time and hand to younger Chasten,” he said during a recent interview with People.  The memoir, which tells the story of Buttigieg growing up gay in a small Midwestern town, debuts as books with LGBTQ characters and themes are being targeted for removal from school libraries and classrooms nationwide.  Roughly half of last year’s most frequently challenged books were targeted for containing LGBTQ content deemed “sexually explicit,” according to the American Library Association.

The 2023 NBA Draft Lottery took place Tuesday evening, with the 14 teams who did not make the playoffs being drawn to determine the order of picks. Victor Wembanyama of France was widely regarded as a once-in-a-generation talent, who will almost undoubtedly be picked first.  Utah's chances at drawing #1 in the lottery were slim (4.5%), but Jazz fans hoped for a miracle. Some even offered tributes to the iconic ""9th & 9th Whale"" sculpture in Salt Lake City in hopes of landing Wembanyama.  The Jazz ended up with pretty rotten luck, drawing number 9 out of 14.  The San Antonio Spurs were the lucky ones, landing #1. The full order is below:    Spurs Hornets Trail Blazers Houston Rockets Detroit Pistons Orlando Magic Indiana Pacers Washington Wizards Utah Jazz Dallas Mavericks Orlando Magic Oklahoma City Thunder Toronto Raptors New Orleans Pelicans  With ""Wemby"" no longer an option, here are the top 10 draft prospects Utah could end up with, depending on who is chosen by teams 2-8: (ranked by Sports Illustrated)  2.

Example video title will go here for this video  MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — The owners of a doggie retreat in Montgomery County are happy that no one was hurt after a car crashed through their building earlier this month.  According to Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Spokesman Pete Piringer, crews were called to the Sniffers Doggie Depot on Westmore Road around 4:30 p.m. on May 11 for reports of a car crashing into a building.  Video of the crash shared on the Sniffers Doggie Retreat Instagram page, shows a person coming through the door and speaking with staff just moments before a silver SUV crashed through the front windows, moves through the lobby before crashing through another wall and coming to a stop in the kennel area.  No injuries were reported but two dogs escaped during the incident and were later found and returned with their families.  “It's really incredible,"" said Hillary Stains, co-owner of Sniffers Doggie Retreat regarding the fact that no staff members or animals were hurt. ""We can rebuild the building at any time but we can never replace a dog.”  Stains explained that two employees were behind the desk in the lobby area with a client waiting to pick up their dog when the crash happened. A third employee was in the kennel area and didn't even see it coming until the wall came down.  Stains had just gotten home from work when she received a phone call from an employee saying a car had crashed into the building and she needed to come back. It wasn't until she saw the damage that she realized the extent of what happened.  The person behind the wheel was another doggie retreat client who had come to pick up their dog, according to Stains. She says she doesn't know why the car came barreling through the building but is thankful no one was hurt.  ""Really a miracle,"" she said.  Two dogs were able to escape during the crash and Stains said finding those dogs was their top priority. The first dog was located safely that night around 8 p.m. Employees volunteered their time to help find the second dog.  Staff searched for days, but in the end, the dog returned on its own. On Saturday, two days after the crash, the dog was found waiting for an employee who arrived to open the business around 6 a.m. When the staff member opened the business, the dog simply walked inside.  With no injuries reported and the two lost dogs found, Sniffers moves toward fixing the damages. Stains said there is no word on an estimate of how much damage was caused but is working with insurance to get it all sorted out.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dXNhOS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21hcnlsYW5kL3ZpZGVvLWNhci1jcmFzaGVzLWludG8tZG9nZ2llLWRheS1jYXJlLW1vbnRnb21lcnktY291bnR5LzY1LTU2ZjJlODM2LTMyZjYtNGY2Yy04MjA5LWUzODRiZjAzOWZlONIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dXNhOS5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYXJ5bGFuZC92aWRlby1jYXItY3Jhc2hlcy1pbnRvLWRvZ2dpZS1kYXktY2FyZS1tb250Z29tZXJ5LWNvdW50eS82NS01NmYyZTgzNi0zMmY2LTRmNmMtODIwOS1lMzg0YmYwMzlmZTg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Egypt"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:39:13","(JTA) — Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who became an aide to former President Donald Trump, mocked Jews for observing Passover, according to a lawsuit filed Monday by a former assistant who is accusing him of sexual assault and harassment.  “Jews want to go through their freaking Passover all the time, man oh man,” Guiliani once said, according to the complaint, which was filed on Monday in New York Supreme Court and indicates that the comments were recorded. “Get over the Passover. It was like 3,000 years ago. The red sea parted, big deal. It’s not the first time that happened.”  The statement that Jews regularly observe Passover is accurate. Retelling the story of the Israelite slaves’ exodus from Egypt each spring is one of the most widely observed Jewish practices, and is frequently cited as an inspiration by politicians (including the person who holds Giuliani’s old job, New York City Mayor Eric Adams).  Meanwhile, there is no historical record of the Red Sea ever parting. The Torah says that God was able to make the miracle happen with the help of Moses, who led the Israelites to freedom — but there is no evidence that such a phenomenon has happened before or since. Some have sought to offer scientific explanations for such an event.  The vast majority of the $10 million suit focuses on allegations by Nicole Dunphy, a former Giuliani associate, that he pressed her into sexual activity without her consent and harassed her continually almost as soon as she began working for him in January 2019.  The Jewish elements of the lawsuit were first reported by the Forward. In addition to mocking Jewish observance of Passover, Giuliani is also accused in the complaint of disparaging Jewish men’s penis sizes and commenting about the “‘freaking Arabs’ and Jews.” He also made racist comments about other groups, according to the suit.  Giuliani, who was New York City mayor from 1994 to 2001, and in 2021 was barred from practicing law in New York state due to his repeated false claims about the 2020 election. Through a spokesperson, he “vehemently” denied the allegations Monday to the Associated Press.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp0YS5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi91bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzL2xhd3N1aXQtY2xhaW1zLXJ1ZHktZ2l1bGlhbmktc2FpZC1nZXQtb3Zlci10aGUtcGFzc292ZXItaXQtd2FzLWxpa2UtMzAwMC15ZWFycy1hZ2_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-05-12","12:00:00","{""Montauk"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 07:00:14","Released May 12, 2023, the Jonas Brothers’ latest album titled ‘The Album’ is their sixth album released as a band. This is their second album since they regrouped for ‘Happiness Begins’ back in 2019. The overall vibe of the album is perfect for a laid-back day in the sun.  Starting with “Miracle,” we get a funky bass rhythm mixed with an island type of piano riff that continues to drive the song to be very fast-paced but also have you dancing and grooving. The lyrics continue to be a heartfelt letter to a partner about them being a miracle in their life and how they make them feel. Romantic, heartfelt lyrics are something that has always been a staple with the Jonas Brothers and their songs. Upbeat, loving songs that you can dance and even scream out whenever.  “Montana Skies” shifts the pace to something more laid back while describing that although they have friends and people that live in more busy cities like New Jersey or Calabasas, they’d rather go to a calmer setting with lyrics like “Montana skies / Georgia sunsets / you’re the one walking in my head.”  The third song off the record, “Wings,” was the lead single from the record.. Driven by a synth bass rocking the driving pace, it talks about the other person, a partner, being the inspiration for them to fly with these “wings” they will use to fly and go on to new ventures.  “Sail Away” follows a description of transcending their current reality and going off to a different world when they are in the comfort of their partner. Lyrics such as “you make my physical spiritual / when I’m in your arms I sail away” have a choir that helps to emphasize the song and its soulfulness. “Celebrate!” is indeed a cause for celebration as we’re greeted by a choir that rejoices in a time to be alive. Guided by the sound of trumpets and heavy bass to emphasize the dance feel that it has. The lyrics continue to echo this chorus of celebrating through the good and bad times, and this is the time to allow for that stress to leave your body and simply dance.  The record continues with “Americana,” which contains multiple references to American culture as it describes a certain person with their sense of fashion and music taste. A song that highlights a laid-back kind of relationship where “we’re gonna get home when we get home.” Another single from the record, “Waffle House” allows listeners to gain insight into the struggles within the family as this song addresses moments where the three brothers have clashed in the past. But even when the times get rough, things will get figured out through deep conversation. Despite coming from a ‘‘headstrong father and a determined mother,” it’ll all get figured out in due time, and “[they] know it’s all love.”  Throughout the second half of the album, things begin to slow down.“Vacation Eyes” is guided by starting us off with a beautiful piano melody that then gets supported by a steady, easy-going drum beat and a strong bass rhythm. The lyrics tell us how they feel on vacation already just by getting lost in their partner’s eyes. “Little Bird” is a much slower song, as every Jonas Brothers album does have at least one song that’s relatively slower than the rest of the album. “Walls” is the perfect way to wrap up the album by being another relatively slower, more reflective song on how deep in love they are with their partner, and if they were to leave, they’d be devastated.  “Summer in the Hamptons” is more of a catchy repetitive track emphasizing the feelings of getting close to your partner, and “Summer Baby” continues the constant love they have for their partner, continuously falling in love with them every single day.  Overall, this album is an upbeat, catchy compilation where everyone can vibe and relax at the beach or listen on a drive with friends.  Verdict: Jonas Brothers’ “The Album” is the album for the summer and is another heartfelt album that surpasses its previous release.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hsYW5kZXJuZXdzLm9yZy84NzE5MS9qb25hcy1icm90aGVycy10aGUtYWxidW0taXMtdGhlLWlkZWFsLXNvdW5kdHJhY2stZm9yLXN1bW1lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Edge works directing the flow of traffic for special events. And, on Sunday, she was on Woodward Avenue helping direct pedestrians for the Tigers game when she was approached by a stranger.  Edge had never met Zachery Dereniowski but he's well known on social media platforms including TikTok as mdmotivator where he has over 16 million followers.  Zachery's first surprise was a ticket to see the game, but Edge said she was too busy to stop working. So, Zachery cleared with her supervisor.  Edge was stunned and grateful.  ""Being able to come off my feet, you know, for a minute. And then I couldn't believe it. I kept telling myself, 'You got to wake up.

She was barely six when she was cast in her first role as Natalie Hillard in Mrs. Doubtfire, and in a new interview with The Guardian, she revealed that even though her experiences on the sets of her films were generally positive, being in the public eye caused her lasting damage and trauma.  “I don’t think you can be a child star without there being some kind of lasting damage,” Wilson told the outlet. “The thing that people assume is that Hollywood is inherently corrupt, and there’s something about being on film sets that destroys you.”  She continued, “For me, that was not necessarily true. I always felt safe on film sets…I worked with a lot of really wonderful directors, who were used to working with children.”  But, she said, the media was not as compassionate, and the internet was not a safe place for her: “I was still sexualized,” she said. “I had people sending me inappropriate letters and posting things about me online… I made the mistake of Googling myself when I was 12 and saw things that I couldn’t unsee.”  After appearing the the 1996 film Matilda, she said things were difficult because people conflated her with her character, something she didn’t know how to handle at such a young age.  “I saw that [fans] were disappointed that I wasn’t as smart, pretty, nice, as they expect you to be. I think they were expecting me to be Matilda, and she’s wonderful, but she’s not real,” Wilson explained. “She’s brilliant in every single way. She’s smart, and kind and powerful. Then they met me, this nerdy, awkward teenager who got angry sometimes, but couldn’t even channel her anger into powers. I was never going to live up to that.”  Photo: Everett Collection  As she got older and she became less in-demand as an actor, she said she “had this Hollywood idea that if you’re not cute any more, if you’re not beautiful, then you are worthless… I directly tied that to the demise of my career. Even though I was sort of burned out on it, and Hollywood was burned out on me, it still doesn’t feel good to be rejected.”  Though she still works as an actor, Wilson has also become an advocate for child stars. In the past few years she has detailed her experiences in a 2016 book as well as in the HBO Max documentary Showbiz Kids. Wilson has a new book out now called Good Girls Don’t.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9tYXRpbGRhLWFjdHJlc3MtbWFyYS13aWxzb24tZGlzY3Vzc2VzLXRyYXVtYS1iZWluZy1zZXh1YWxpemVkLWNoaWxkLXN0YXIv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L21hdGlsZGEtYWN0cmVzcy1tYXJhLXdpbHNvbi1kaXNjdXNzZXMtdHJhdW1hLWJlaW5nLXNleHVhbGl6ZWQtY2hpbGQtc3Rhci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And that’s why he is a recipient of a 2023 ESL Jefferson Award.  Jipson enlisted in the Marines straight out of high school, just a few years after 9/11.  “The first four years I was in Camp Lejeune. Deployed twice to Iraq in those 4 years,” he said.  During his eight years of service to our country, Jipson went through a lot physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Jason Jipson (WHEC) photo)  At times, he considered taking his own life.  “There was one point when I thought, ‘Tonight’s the night’ and then I was like, ‘I’ll wait until tomorrow’ and the next morning I woke up and I was like, ‘This isn’t okay. The way this feels is not okay.'”  That was the beginning of a decades-long mental health journey. Jipson was one of the first veterans here in Monroe County to take part in Trybe Ecotherapy, an outdoor program designed specifically for veterans to manage the effects of stress, anxiety, depression, or trauma.  When he completed the program, he became a peer mentor to help those vets in line behind him.  “I am not a veteran. I never had military service. I’m a clinician and there’s a level of connection that Jason had with these folks, that I just will never have,” Lindsay Cray, chief program officer of Trybe Ecotherapy.  “He sees people struggling and he’s not afraid to go in where it’s a little dark sometimes and we all need people to grab us by the ears and drag us out of the rabbit hole when we go down there and Jason has been a big part of that for me,” said Thomas Borden, a U.S. Navy veteran.  “He’s always willing to get in the ditch with you. Jason is like, ‘It’s alright. I’m going to get in there and dig with you because I’ve been there before,'” Alan Bartlo, a Marine Corps veteran, said.  His work has helped veterans live better lives.  “I feel like it’s my purpose. It’s why I’ve been put on this earth is to do exactly what I’m doing and I couldn’t be able to do that unless all of that stuff happened,” Jipson said.  And this is not where Jason’s dedication to the community ends.  He’s also a coach for children with special needs at Miracle Field in Webster.  Children like Julian Munoz.  “He spoke to the president of the league and was able to get Julian on the team. We were shedding tears because we never thought Julian would be able to play on a ‘regular’ team,” his father, Dan Munoz, said about Jipson.  It’s brought so much joy to Julian, who thinks Jipson is pretty special.  “Fun, funny, hard worker, determined, helping others,” Julian said.  Lewke: Every part of your life touches other people.  Jipson, teary-eyed: “Yeah. It’s hard. I don’t think about it that way.”  But the countless veterans and children he has helped do.

Hilda Bassey, 27, known on social media as Hilda Baci, began cooking in her kitchen Thursday and continued till Monday evening, preparing more than 100 meals in all.  Baci is hoping to beat the Guinness World Record set by Lata Tondon, an Indian chef who cooked for 87 hours and 45 minutes straight in 2019.  Guinness World Records said it will have to review the evidence to ensure Baci didn’t cook the books.  “We are aware of the record attempt and are looking forward to receiving the evidence for our Records Management Team to review before we can confirm the record is official,” a rep said.  Thousands of Baci’s supporters gathered in the Lekki area of Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial hub, on Monday as she was finishing up her cooking marathon.  Nigerian chef Hilda Bassey, known on social media as Hilda Baci, began cooking Thursday. Twitter / @TheHildaBaci  The renowned Nigerian chef said she hopes her efforts will showcase how hardworking Nigerian women are and shine a spotlight on Nigerian food.  “Nigerian cuisine is the best out there,” she told CNN.  “The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food,” she added.  Baci began cooking Thursday and continued through Monday evening. AP  The chef said she nearly gave up on her first day of cooking but that once she surpassed the previous record, she felt inspired to continue, setting a goal for herself to hit 100 hours.  Tondon, the previous record holder, shared a heartfelt message of support for Baci as she proceeded with her attempt.  “The first day was the most difficult,” Baci said. “I was ready to give up six hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible.”  Baci said she nearly dropped out after six hours of cooking. AP  Crowds gathered in support of Baci as she cooked, and despite forgoing sleep, she remained positive, oftentimes dancing and waving at the many fans who showed up in droves to support her, according to CNN.  Celebrities including Nigerian musician Tiwa Savage and local politicians also came to support Baci.  The determined chef only took 5-minute breaks every hour or accumulated one hour after a stretch of 12 hours.  Thousands of people turned out to support Baci as she attempted to break the record. AP  After Baci surpassed the previous record, President Muhammadu Buhari tweeted that it was a great night for Nigeria.  “Hilda’s drive, ambition and resilience have brought great interest and insight into the uniqueness of Nigerian food,” the president wrote.

Beevers, 33, is now plying his trade the other side of the world in Australia. But he's back on these shores after making a surprise return. He landed back in the UK just in time to shake off jetlag and play a part in the Steel City Derby legends game last weekend.

They have now been married for over fifty-one years. He has two daughters and four grandchildren.Greeson shares, “How do you define the words journey and miracle? What do you base your definition on? Many times, these are defined by what’s happening in an individual’s life or simply by an emotional response to a particular situation. Sometimes, these words are used so often that their meaning and their impact on our lives are actually diminished and can even become inaccurate.“These wide varieties of definitions can make for great discussions and good learning experiences when conducted respectfully and with open minds. In A Journey of Miracles, I share my thoughts on what these two words mean to me. It is written to honor what God has done, and continues to do, in my life. I am not a professional writer, so I know through the whole writing process, I was helped and inspired by the Holy Spirit. I pray they encourage, remind, renew, and engage each of you.“God created you. God knows each of you. God loves you. You are significant to him. You are his miracle. He longs for you to join him on the journey he has for you. Trust God. You are never alone. God has never made a mistake with a life.

Heather, 61, cemented herself as a beacon of Hollywood success throughout the '80s and '90s, thanks to her roles in wildly popular shows like Melrose Place and Dynasty - but in the early 2000s, she embarked on a sudden downward spiral that saw her facing numerous run-ins with the law, multiple hospitalizations, and over 20 stints in rehab.  Ava, now 25 - whom Heather welcomed with her ex-husband, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, in 1997 - never wavered from her side, and it was her long-lasting and steadfast support that was said to have helped the star finally get sober in 2019.  Heather's descend from the top first began in 2008 - one year after she and Richie, now 63, opted to go her separate ways.  Amid Heather Locklear's rollercoaster of scandals, arrests, and addiction issues, there was one person who stuck by her through it all - her fiercely loyal look-alike daughter, Ava Sambora  As Ava, who recently received her masters degree from the University of Southern California, continues to make her mother 'proud,' FEMAIL and recapped their very special relationship  At the time, she was arrested for a suspected DUI, and even though it was later revealed that she was sober when she was taken into custody, the event was the first of many controversial endeavors to plague the Spin City alum.  Over the next decade, police would be called to Heather's home on multiple occasions, and she would rack up eight different charges after allegedly attacking law enforcement officials who were trying to calm her down.  To what she's said about growing up in the spotlight and how she helped Heather overcome her substance abuse struggles to her own impressive achievements and booming career - here's everything we know about Heather's 'miracle' daughter, Ava  And Ava reportedly had a front-row seat to it all. As the now 61-year-old continued her implosion, it was said that her young daughter was left heartbroken, and 'begged' her mother to get the help that she desperately needed.  Even so, the now-25-year-old stood by her mom through it all - in fact, Heather's powerful journey to sobriety has seemed to only make her and her daughter closer.  Ava, who followed in Heather's footsteps and launched her own career as an actress and model, has been very outspoken about how much her mom has taught her over the years - and she even once credited the movie star with helping her to overcome her 'debilitating' anxiety.  Heather has been just as loud about how much Ava means to her, referring to her as a 'miracle' and praising her 'kindness' and 'strength' in previous interviews.  As Ava, who recently received her masters degree from the University of Southern California, continues to make her mother 'proud,' FEMAIL went ahead and recapped their very special relationship from start to finish.  To what she's said about growing up in the spotlight and how she helped Heather overcome her substance abuse struggles to her own impressive achievements and booming career - here's everything we know about Heather's 'miracle' daughter, Ava.  Downward spiral: Heather faced numerous run-ins with the law and was hospitalized multiple times - all while her young daughter Ava 'begged' her to get help  Heather and Richie Sambora tied the knot in December 1994, and they welcomed Ava together in October 1997. They are seen together right after her birth  After 12 years together, Heather (seen with Ava throughout her childhood) filed for divorce in 2006, and when it was finalized in 2007, the exes received joint custody  But soon after she and Richie went their separate ways, Heather's troubles began. She is seen with Ava when she was little  Heather and Richie tied the knot in December 1994, and they welcomed Ava together in October 1997.  However, after 12 years together, she filed for divorce in 2006, and when it was finalized in 2007, the exes received joint custody of then-nine-year-old Ava.  Then, in September 2008, she faced her first run-in with the law, when she was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She plead no contest to reckless driving  But soon after she and Richie went their separate ways, Heather's troubles began.  In March 2008, it was reported that her doctor had called 911 after he started to worry that she was going to end her life. Emergency responders rushed to her home, but said she appeared to be fine.  Then, in September 2008, she faced her first run-in with the law, when she was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence.  Although tests confirmed her blood alcohol level was under the legal limit, authorities believed that prescription medication she was taking for her anxiety and depression had caused her erratic driving.  She ultimately plead no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to three years probation.  In February 2018, she was arrested for domestic violence and battery against a police officer after she allegedly kicked three law enforcement officials while they were trying to calm her down during an argument between her and her boyfriend, Chris Heisser - all of which Ava reportedly witnessed.  In February 2018, she was arrested again after she allegedly kicked law enforcement officials while they were trying to calm her down during an argument between her and her boyfriend  She then headed to rehab, and at the time, a source told Entertainment Tonight that it was her daughter who encouraged her to finally 'get the help she needs'  'Ava begged her mom to go to rehab,' a source told the outlet.

She was arrested again in June 2018 - this time, for allegedly attacking a police officer and EMT after they received a 'disturbance' call from her home  However, Heather's problems weren't over. In June 2018, she was hospitalized after she reportedly threatened to shoot herself over suspicions that Chris was cheating on her.  She also reportedly started choking her mother and hit her father when they tried to calm her down.  She was then put under a three-day psychiatric hold, but days after returning home, she was arrested again - this time, for allegedly attacking a police officer and EMT after they received a 'disturbance' call from her home.  She was released hours later, after paying $20,000 bail, but was rushed to the hospital later that day due to a suspected overdose.  Afterwards, a source told Us Weekly that Ava was 'heartbroken' over her mother's continued downward spiral.  The insider said that the Dynasty star's 'erratic behavior' left the then-20-year-old 'really sad.' They added that she and Heather were 'always incredibly close,' which made it even harder for her.  But thankfully, they said Ava's father was a 'great support system,' and that she was 'leaning on him' amid Heather's on-going struggles.  Road to sobriety: After more than 20 rehab stints, Heather finally turned it around - thanks, in part, to her daughter's unwavering support  In the months that followed, Heather was in and out of treatment facilities '20 times' before she finally got sober in 2019 - and Ava never gave up on her mother. they are seen together in 2013  At the time, Richie exclusively revealed to DailyMail.com that he has assembled a team of doctors and specialists to ensure Heather and their daughter's best interests were taken care of.  'I will of course always be there for Heather, and especially Ava,' he said. 'I am very proud of my daughter for her composure and strength during this difficult time.'  Throughout her downward spiral and numerous stints in rehab, the mother-daughter duo stayed very close, and Ava's support never wavered.

Throughout her downward spiral and numerous stints in rehab, the mother-daughter duo stayed very close, and Ava's support never wavered.  Heather's legal troubles were finally put to rest when she plead no contest to her outstanding eight charges, which resulted in her being sentenced to 30 days in a residential mental health facility.  'Ava has a very loving and supportive relationship with her mom,' a source said to People at the time.  'And as painful it is, she knows that it's in her mom's hands and God's hands. All she can do is like anybody else, just pray and support.'  When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, it was reported by People that Ava was quarantining with her mother, who was a year sober at that point, as well as Heather's parents.  'Heather is gardening, taking walks and cooking like a fiend. She cooks for herself, Ava and her parents. It’s very sweet,' revealed someone who was close to the actress.  In an essay she penned for People in 2020, Ava spoke out about how her mom helped her overcome her own 'debilitating' anxiety. They are pictured together in 2016  She added that Heather 'always made her feel heard' and 'never judged her.' 'She treats every person with respect and makes them feel important,' gushed the now-25-year-old  'It’s really amazing to see how she managed to turn things around. Heather is always happiest when she is with her daughter.'  In an essay she penned for People in 2020, Ava spoke out about how her mom helped her overcome her own 'debilitating' anxiety.  'My mom has shown me kindness in so many ways,' she wrote. 'I lived almost an hour away from her, and when I would have anxiety attacks, she would drive over and visit me.  'Anytime of the day, she would stop what she was doing and come to comfort me. When I would insist she did not have to, she would stay on the phone with me late into the night, until I was calm enough to sleep.'  She added that Heather 'always made her feel heard' and 'never judged her.'  'She treats every person with respect and makes them feel important,' continued the now-25-year-old.  Heather praised her daughter's 'confidence and strength' in the article, while calling her a 'miracle.' They are seen together in 2012  'While she embodies kindness in many ways, her ability to care for and give to others is what I admire most. She is selfless and inspires me to be selfless as well.'  Heather praised her daughter's 'confidence and strength' in the article, while calling her a 'miracle.'  'She never has a bad word to say about anyone, and for a teenage girl, that is something,' she gushed.  'She doesn’t feel the need to put others down in order to feel better about herself. I’ve often seen her transform a potential gossip fest into a conversation about that person’s most amazing attributes.  'Ava is an example to me to always try to find the good in someone. I have watched her from afar and up close throughout her life, and I aspire to be more like her.  'Her kindness is contagious. We are very close, and I am blessed to call her my daughter.  'She is completely unaware of all the good she brings to this world - it’s just who she is. I couldn’t be more proud of her.'  Following in her mom's footsteps: Ava started acting and modeling as a teen - and recently received her master's degree in marriage and family therapy  It's clear that the actress and her daughter have a very-tight bond, and they even turn to each other for fashion advice.

Her other acting credits include the 2018 TV movie Mommy Be Mine and the thriller flick A Dark Foe.  She also appeared in the YouTube series SummerBreak 3, a fake reality series that followed a group of students during their summer break.  But it seems as though Ava (seen in 2019) has opted for a much-quieter lifestyle in recent years, turning her social media profile to private and taking a step back from acting  She graduated from Viewpoint High School in Calabasas in June 2015, and then headed off to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied psychology  After finishing college in 2020 - with a GPA of 4.0 - she enrolled at University Of Southern California, where she recently received her master's degree in marriage and family therapy  She is also a successful model.

'As I got older, I learned to appreciate it more - especially since I would love to follow in my mother’s footsteps.'  She also dished on the important advice that her mom gave her when she started her own career as an actress.  'The best advice my mother ever gave me was not to take everything so personally. There are going to be a thousand times you’ll hear ""no,"" but, it only takes a few yeses, and waiting for those yeses will be worth it,' she continued.  'I think that’s such an important mindset to have in this business. There could be a million reasons why they don’t want you for a part.  As for her love life, she started dating a fellow Loyola student named Tyler Farrar in 2019  But because her Instagram page is now private, it's unclear whether or not they're still together  'It’s not always because you’re not good enough, it might just be because there was another girl that looked more like what they envisioned, or maybe they already had another girl signed on, or whatever it is. So, it’s important not to take it all personally because the yeses will come.'  When asked if her mother is ever 'jealous' over her success by ET, Ava called it the 'most far-fetched thing she's ever heard.  'All she wants in my life is for me to do great things,' she added.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)  Mohegan — Taj McWilliams-Franklin, one of the most popular and productive players in Connecticut Sun history, will have her No. 11 jersey hoisted to the rafters following Sunday’s home opener against the Washington Mystics at Mohegan Sun Arena.  McWilliams-Franklin’s number will join Margo Dydek (12), Nykesha Sales (42), Katie Douglas (23), Lindsay Whalen (13) and Ashja Jones (15) during a special ceremony following completion of the 1 p.m. start.

You are required to pay high prices in bewildering, ever-changing combinations so you can wait in line to have your belongings and your own body scanned before waiting again to squeeze into a small, cramped airplane seat between dozens of other, equally annoyed, possibly less-than-hygienic passengers.  Yes, granted, it's the miracle of flight and utterly amazing that we can safely hurl humans through the air at all, but one feels certain the Wright Brothers' plans included more leg room.  In fact, more than half of all tweets from travelers who mentioned an airport by its Twitter username could be characterized as ""angry,"" according to a Forbes Advisor analysis of 37,000 tweets between March 2022 and March 2023.

No, that honor fell to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, the closest one to Disneyland.  But JAX was a close second.  Of all tweets calling out @JAXairport by name, 60% were negative, according to Forbes, using words like ""line,"" ""TSA,"" ""garage,"" ""delays"" and ""employees.""  Coming in fourth was fellow Florida destination Tampa International Airport (TPA), targeted with 57% angry tweets (""bags,"" ""delayed,"" ""luggage,"" ""security,"" ""canceled"").

It may not be that a majority of travelers are peeved, but they're the ones most likely to talk about it. Happy, or at least not-actively-aggravated passengers tend not to tweet about their experiences, which creates a self-selecting group of seething resentment.  Also, it's been a weird few years for air travel. The pandemic shut things down, then people were masked and anxious, then some were masked and angry. Massive countrywide flight cancellations have popped up from staff shortages, severe weather and even an FAA computer glitch which aren't the airports' fault but may have caused indiscriminate Twitter ire.

Knowing ahead of time that you're going to be frustrated helps, and everything you can do to minimize that is good.  Wear comfortable clothes.  Get there early and bring something to read or do, both for the wait and the flight. Charge your electronics before you leave the house and top them up, if possible, while waiting at the gate. Bring games you like, download TV shows and movies ahead of time.  Apply for TSA Precheck or Global Entry. Pricey, but worth it for frequent flyers who would like to speed things up and keep their shoes on.  Pick your seat for whatever's most convenient for you, whether it's better legroom, easier bathroom access or whatever. Upgrade if you can.  Bring headphones or ear pods, ideally noise-canceling ones.  Bring snacks. If you have a flight with a meal consider the vegetarian option. You'll probably get it faster and it's usually a better quality. Also, a reusable water bottle is perfectly fine as far as the TSA is concerned and you can fill it up past the security checkpoint, or ask a flight attendant (if they're not busy). Hydrate!  Avoid contacts and makeup. Dry air inside the cabin makes both uncomfortable.  Keep moving. Move your legs up and down, walk the aisle between the seats when it's empty, move around during layovers. Whatever keeps the blood flowing. Compression socks, especially on longer flights, can help regulate blood flow in your legs.

A Faction Focus article on Tuesday reveals the Strands of Fate army rule, which has some definite mechanical similarities with the Sisters of Battle’s Miracle Dice.  Eldar players in Warhammer 40k 10th edition will roll 12 Fate Dice at the start of the battle. The results of the dice are set aside – later in the battle, before you roll to hit, wound, damage, advance, charge, or for a battle-shock test, you can use a Fate Die. Rather than rolling one of the dice, you’ll use the stored result on that Fate Die. If you don’t like the result on your first 12 Fate Dice you can roll again, rolling one less die – a process you can repeat until you accept your fate.  The Sisters of Battle’s Miracle Dice were previewed on May 10, and similarly allow you to substitute a stored die result for one you’re about to roll. The difference is that Eldar start the battle with lots of Fate Dice but struggle to get new ones, while Sisters pick up a Miracle Die every turn, every time they lose a unit, and through some unit abilities.  Updated 10th edition datasheets in the article show that some Eldar units have new rules that interact with the Strands of Fate and Fate Dice. The psychic Farseer can, once per turn, change the result on a Fate Dice being used by a unit within 12” into a six. Meanwhile the humble Eldar Guardians generate additional Fate Dice when they hold an objective at the end of your Command phase, giving you a trickle of new dice.  The article also shows the first Eldar Detachment for 10th edition, the Battle-Host. This has a very simple army rule, granting each unit in your force one re-roll to hit and one re-roll to wound every time it shoots or fights. We also get to see the Fire and Fade Stratagem, which for 2CP allows a non-aircraft unit that isn’t engaged to move after it shoots. It can’t charge later in the turn, but this could be a powerful tool to move a unit into cover, or forward onto an objective.  The article reveals the weapons profile for the Prism Cannon, the main ordnance of the Fire Prism gravtank. This massive laser’s Focused Fire mode has the unique Linked Fire Weapon Ability, which allows one Fire Prism to calculate its range and line of sight to a target from another Fire Prism that it can see – one Fire Prism channels its weapon into another Fire Prism’s gun. Popping a Fire Prism out of cover, using it to draw line of sight for another gravtank’s Focused Fire, then using Fire and Fade to retreat to safety seems like a classic Eldar move.  The way that Linked Fire is worded suggests it’s an Eldar-only Weapon Ability, rather than one that’s shared across several Warhammer 40k factions. We saw the Conversion Weapon Ability on the Leagues of Votann on May 11, but though they’re the only force making new Conversion beamers in the 41st Millennium, both the Imperium of Man and Adeptus Mechanicus have a few relics from the Horus Heresy hanging around.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmdhbWVyLmNvbS93YXJoYW1tZXItNDBrLzEwdGgtZWRpdGlvbi1lbGRhci1hcm15LXJ1bGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a recent interview with ESPN Brasil, he voiced his resolve and reflected on the team’s journey so far.  Gabriel Jesus sends out a rallying cry, believing in Arsenal’s chances for the title despite the setback.  Despite some stumbles, Jesus is satisfied with the progress made by Arsenal this season.  With two more games in the Premier League, Arsenal remain hopeful while Manchester City, leading by four points, have one game less played.  As the Premier League title slips out of Arsenal’s grasp, Gabriel Jesus stepped up to rally the team for what seems an impossible task.  Following a disappointing defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion, Jesus’s message to his teammates and Arsenal’s fans is one of resilience: the battle isn’t over yet.  A heart-to-heart with Gabriel Jesus  Speaking with ESPN Brasil after Sunday’s match, Jesus didn’t mince words about Arsenal’s performance.  “I think that, if you look at it, our team didn’t play well from the beginning. We didn’t manage to play,” Jesus said.  “We didn’t manage to have the ball. We played a lot of long ball. And up front, if you don’t win a duel, the second ball. They control the game.  “They play and don’t care if they lose the ball. They take chances. That’s football. Brighton have good players who take chances, who break the first line. The forwards are quick and have quality.  “Our side didn’t work. Our game didn’t work. Our game went way down. We are really upset.”  About the title being unable to win the Premier League, Jesus added, “Impossible, no. Mathematically, it’s not over.  “When I arrived at this club, that’s what I learned. Don’t give up, always try. We still have chances, but it’s obvious that it became very difficult. But we’ll fight until the end.  Looking back at Arsenal’s season  Despite the setback, Jesus is satisfied with Arsenal’s season, acknowledging the team’s stumbles but also recognising the progress made.  “Obviously, many will talk and comment.  “When you’re good, everyone wants to talk and show up. When things happen like you don’t want, then the opportunists appear. But we know that we need to look at our side. We had everything to win the Premier League.  “But, unfortunately, due to some games that we did badly, we ended up losing points we couldn’t. And we got to this situation,” explained Jesus.  Looking ahead  Four points behind Manchester City, Arsenal now face Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side, with one game in hand, are set to play against Chelsea, Brighton, and Brentford.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHljYW5ub24uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvYXJzZW5hbC10aXRsZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtZ2FicmllbC1qZXN1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Odessa"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:31:33","By James Keith  The Center for Women and Infants (CMN) at Medical Center Hospital (MCH) revealed the new Children’s Miracle Network balloon on Tuesday, located at the entrance of the building. The project reached its conclusion after 11 years of planning.  MCH has been a CMN hospital since 1987, receiving funding for varying groups across the hospital. CMN partners with local members of Odessa such as Walmart and Sam’s Club and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each year they’ve been partnered with MCH.  Samantha Serrano, the program manager for CMN, said the unveiling of the balloon is another massive step for the program and its fundraising.  “It’s a game changer for us, I think a lot of people in our community are still very much unaware of what Children’s Miracle Network does here for their local community,” Serrano said. “I don’t think they understand that when they give back to their local CMN hospital it stays here, it doesn’t go anywhere else, it stays in the Permian Basin to bring awareness and to bring back funds for their, you know, maybe even just their neighbor. It may not directly impact them but it brings back funds to support the high standard of care that we want to get here at Medical Center.”  Now under the full branding and label of a CMN hospital, Serrano said the hope is increased awareness and local contributions, ensuring that children can be treated at MCH no matter the cost.  CMN’s executive chair member Kelby Davis provided a personal testament to the impact of the program’s funding. A mother of three, Davis described how CMN has helped with surgeries, intensive care and the general health for all of her children.  “All three of our children were born right here inside this building and all three of them went to the NICU, and that’s not something as a mom you ever think could happen,” Davis said. “You picture them laying on your chest and you having those moments with them, but they all went off to the NICU. But the only thing that made that okay is because I know that we have Children’s Miracle Network resources inside that building with a beautiful team of humans that care so wonderfully for these babies.”  As the partnership between MCH and CMN continues to grow and receive more awareness, the goal between both institutions is still to provide all the support children need.  “I think that they have the resources in that NICU that they need. They have the resources on the pediatric floor that they need,” Davis said. “We have play-dough to bring to a kid after they have surgery or on Halloween Sam brought us all in the NICU just a little piece of Halloween candy from Children’s Miracle Network. Those are the things that matters when your babies need them. Those are the things that matter when you’re kind of walking through the worst of times.”  Like this: Like Loading...

"miracle","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Canada"", ""Puebla"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:26:52","© Sam Island  My body is nearly perfect. Well, not only mine–yours, too. Consider, for one thing, how your fingernail is tough enough to scrape off the blackened residue from the bottom of an enamel pot, yet soft enough that it doesn’t leave a scratch. Despite many decades of work by the manufacturers of scouring pads, brushes and sponges, no other material has been found that so perfectly performs this simple task.  The human body has been getting a bad rap lately. Covid-19 owes much of its power to the body’s occasional tendency to do battle with itself. The coronavirus can set off what’s called a cytokine storm, a sometimes-fatal overreaction of the immune system. In the effort to repel the invading army, the body blows up its own munitions dump.  So in times like these, it might be worth remembering all the ways that, most of the time, the body does a tip-top job.  For example, your nose is full of tiny hairs that catch dust in the air before it enters the lungs. Your throat rarely malfunctions, even though it’s required to do unlikely double-service as a highway for both air and food.  Or consider this piece of genius engineering: The human forehead produces a sheen of moisture on a hot day in a way that helps the body shed heat. The hotter you get, the more sweat you produce. Clever, right?  As Bill Bryson notes in his book The Body: A Guide for Occupants, it is estimated that between one and five of your cells turn cancerous every day. And nearly every time, your immune system locates and kills them. As Bryson puts it: “Our bodies are a universe of 37.2 trillion cells operating in more or less perfect concert more or less all the time.”  Some things, I admit, are not ideal. Take the fact that an adult male of normal proportions will, when run at by a toddler, find that his genitals are at the perfect height for a high-speed collision. If done with sufficient vigour, the impact may even prevent the creation of further children. As sibling rivalries go, that’s not a bad effort.  The arrival of pimples during adolescence also remains a mystery. First of all, do they have to appear on the face, the most visible part of the body? Couldn’t the body choose somewhere out of the way, like the backs of the knees? And why do outbreaks arrive at the exact moment we first become interested in matters of romance? Why can’t we get the pimples over and done with when we’re 10 years old and don’t yet care about our appearance? Or why can’t they wait until we’re 90, when many of us once again don’t care?  If I were an engineer overseeing the evolution of the body, I’d have also spent more time choosing some of the materials. Shouldn’t the hard-working parts—the hips and knees—be made from something a bit more durable? And is it wise that the mouth is responsible for so many crucial tasks—eating, breathing and speaking?  All the same, we should be grateful for what we have. How wonderful it is that our hair grows at the rate of approximately one centimetre per month—fast enough to keep hairdressers in business, but slow enough that both hairdresser and client have something new to talk about when they meet.  And I don’t know where we would be if someone hadn’t thought to equip the human body with a bottom. As Australian writer Tim Winton established in his children’s book The Bugalugs Bum Thief, human beings without backsides can’t sit down; they lower themselves onto a chair and simply slide off.  Plus, without a bottom, we’d be on our feet all day, leaving us too tired for the things that all humans should find time to do—sing a song of praise to the body and all the things it (normally) does for us.  Next, if you've ever had a colonoscopy, you'll relate to this woman's hilarious story.  The post Sure, the Human Body is a Miracle of Evolution—But I’d Still Give It a Few Tweaks appeared first on Reader's Digest Canada.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLWNhL2hlYWx0aC93ZWxsbmVzcy9zdXJlLXRoZS1odW1hbi1ib2R5LWlzLWEtbWlyYWNsZS1vZi1ldm9sdXRpb24tYnV0LWktZC1zdGlsbC1naXZlLWl0LWEtZmV3LXR3ZWFrcy9hci1BQTFiZzJUej9saT1CQjE1SVNXUtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But his story is very different to that of most – he is a burn survivor whose journey of recovery is testament to the power of the human spirit.  Next month will mark five years since the event that forever changed Van Baalen’s life when, just weeks after celebrating his 21st birthday, he was competing in a paragliding competition and collided with power lines. He lost consciousness and when he awoke, he was lying on the ground surrounded by flames and on fire. Still strapped into his paragliding harness, Van Baalen managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage. His injuries left him fighting for his life. Katinka Rheeder, a specialist nurse and manager of the Netcare Milpark Hospital’s dedicated burns unit where he was treated for more than a year, said the burns recovery journey involves many small steps over a long time.  “Kelvin had sustained severe burns to approximately two-thirds of his body surface. Local trauma statistics indicated a mere 30% predicted survival rate for burn injuries of this extent and severity,” she said. Kelvin’s skin had been burnt so badly that it could not heal or regenerate. He spent his first month in a medically-induced coma, underwent more than 27 surgeries including extensive wound debridement and skin grafts. He also had to undergo a gruelling programme of physiotherapy and ancillary health support before being able to come off ventilation. This was more than 300 days after the accident.  Today, his reality is vastly different. He now gets up every day to conduct site checks for a construction company. “I am also studying again. I had originally wanted to become a commercial pilot but now I’m happy to be studying BCom finance,” he said. Even more remarkable is his return to playing sport. “I love golf and play at least once every week, and I recently became an ambassador for the Country Club Johannesburg, participating in disabled tournaments. I am currently playing a two handicap.”  More than a year after his first admission Van Baalen was discharged for the next stage of his treatment at Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital, where he stayed for two-and-a-half months. Complications with infection, graft rejection and organ failure are common, Rheder said. The joints are usually very stiff and if daily physiotherapy is not done it can result in permanent contractures, when the tissue tightens or shortens causing pain and a reduced range of movement. Van Baalen said it had been just three-and-a-half years since he got to come home for good. “That was not the end of digging deep – I had to push myself to walk around, adding more laps each day. But, it was worth it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvcHJldG9yaWEtbmV3cy9uZXdzL3BhcmFnbGlkZXItd2hvLWNvbGxpZGVkLXdpdGgtcG93ZXItbGluZXMtdGVsbHMtb2YtaGlzLW1pcmFjbGUtcmVjb3Zlcnktam91cm5leS0zMGJmYWQwNC0wMjFiLTRkMjctYTViMC01MjBhZTMyODRiYzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sure, Phyllis killed the man in self defense but we all know that she won’t get off without a fight, considering her involvement with him to bring down Diane. And the fact that the police found his body, well, for now, anyways, he’s simply dead.  However, his portrayer, James Hyde, is already making a comeback and it appears that fans can look forward to seeing him in a new Christmas movie titled A Christmas Frequency this holiday season — and, as an added perk, he’ll be joined by another familiar face… The Bold and the Beautiful’s Denise Richards (Shauna), first reported exclusively by our sister site, Variety.  Soap-vet-turned-director, Lindsay Korman-Hartley shared a photo with Hyde and Richards and stated, “Merry Christmas with these two wonderful and talented people. James Hyde and Denise Richards, thank you for bringing the magic to Christmas on air.”  Fans quickly rushed to the comments with excitement, especially at seeing Hyde reunited with Korman-Hartley since their time on Passions where the two shared scenes together as Sam and Theresa. “Theresa and Sam Bennet,” follower Kerry Keil cheered. “Love this pic!”  So, what can you expect from A Christmas Frequency?  As Variety detailed, Richards will star as morning radio show host Brooke Walkins, who is secretly separating from her husband Todd, played by Hyde, but also losing ratings on her show. As a way to save it from being canceled, Brooke agrees to be set up on a series of blind dates live, as suggested by her producer Kenzie, as a way to land her a plus-one to the company’s Christmas party. However, Kenzie learns the guy she’s interested in applied to date Brooke, and when he becomes a hit with listeners, she must choose between her heart and her job.  More: Photo, soap fave’s new wife is pregnant  Considering Korman-Hartley has directed numerous movies for Lifetime and LMN, A Christmas Frequency, which is being produced by Nicely Entertainment, could very well fall into one of the network’s holiday lineups. Stay tuned, as we’ll bring our readers more details as they are released.  In the meantime, and while we wait to see if somehow, someway Jeremy will come back from the dead just in time to get Phyllis off the hook for his murder, look back at other daytime stars who made it in movies and primetime then returned to soaps in our photo gallery below.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc29hcHMuc2hla25vd3MuY29tL3RoZS15b3VuZy1hbmQtdGhlLXJlc3RsZXNzL25ld3MvNjcxODg5L2phbWVzLWh5ZGUtZGVuaXNlLXJpY2hhcmRzLW5ldy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtbW92aWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"miracle","2019-06-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 23:10:27","Last updated on .From the section European Football  Inter Milan have reached their sixth Champions League final - but only their second in the last 50 years  When Inter Milan line up for their ""dream"" first Champions League final in 13 years, they will expect to do so as significant underdogs.  Their opponents in Istanbul on 10 June will be decided on Wednesday, when Real Madrid meet Manchester City to settle their finely-poised tie (20:00 BST).  After completing a 3-0 aggregate win over fierce rivals AC Milan, Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti was quick to state his preference of avoiding record 14-time champions Real.  ""I would like to avoid Real Madrid because the competition seems made for them,"" former captain Zanetti said.  But, regardless of what happens in the final, football journalist Guillem Balague believes it is ""a miracle"" that three-time winners Inter have made it this far.  The Nerazzurri finished second to Bayern Munich in a group which also contained Barcelona, before going on to beat Portuguese clubs Porto and Benfica and prevailing in the first Milan derby in European competition for 20 years.  ""In the next few days we will realise what we did,"" manager Simone Inzaghi said.  ""For us it was a dream but we have always believed in it.  ""It was an extraordinary path and winning a derby in the semi-final like this brings great satisfaction.  ""Madrid and City are two of the best teams in Europe.""  World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez, who scored the only goal in Tuesday's second leg to begin the celebrations among the Inter supporters, echoed his manager's sentiments.  ""It is an incredible joy, I am delighted. I thank my family. This sport is the most beautiful thing in the world,"" Martinez said.  ""Playing in the Champions League final is a dream.""  'Manchester City or Real Madrid will be heavy favourites'  Inter are the first side to reach the Champions League final despite finishing as runners up in their group since both Liverpool and Tottenham in 2018-19  Inter's most recent Champions League triumph came in their last final in 2010, when Jose Mourinho masterminded victory over favourites Bayern Munich.  They will require an upset of perhaps greater magnitude to overcome Real Madrid or Manchester City - tied at 1-1 after the first leg in Spain.  ""Real or City would be heavy favourites but Inter are a well-balanced side,"" Owen Hargreaves, a Champions League winner with Manchester United, told BT Sport.  ""They are going to come up against a super team,"" he added. ""But they will want to finish the job now. They will be a problem in the final for whoever they play.""  Inter failed to compete for the Serie A title this season and sit 17 points adrift of formidable champions Napoli.  But the Coppa Italia finalists have thrived in the cup competitions, and in Europe Inzaghi's organised side have kept a competition-leading eight clean sheets.  ""In the important moments, Inter have always come through,"" European football expert Mina Rzouki told BBC Radio 5 live.  ""I know people think that whoever wins the other tie will overcome this Inter side, but I wouldn't be all that confident.""  Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who won the trophy in 2005, said on BT Sport: ""They are in with a chance, they deserve this chance.  ""They are tough to beat, they carry a threat. Whoever they face, they are in with a shout.""  While keen not to face serial-winners Real, Zanetti, part of Inter's 2010 Champions League-winning team, did not lose sight of what the club had achieved.  ""It is a great emotion. The group deserved to play in a Champions League final after 13 years,"" Zanetti told Sky Italia.  ""We are waiting to know the name of our opponents, but what this group has done is very important.  ""The most important thing is to get there; it was a difficult path.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC82NTYxNzg1MdIBL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvZm9vdGJhbGwvNjU2MTc4NTEuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAY 20TH TORNADO THAT DEVASTATED MOORE AND SURROUNDING AREAS, WE’RE TAKING A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THAT DAY. OKAY. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT JUST WEST OF I-35. THIS IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY JUST RIGHT AROUND THE WARREN THEATER, THE MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, ROYAL PARK, MOORE. THIS IS ALL ON THE WEST SIDE OF I-35. YOU ARE IN THE PATH OF THIS TORNADO. SO I THINK THE MORE MEDICAL CENTER LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THIS AND WHILE THAT DAY IN 2013 WAS FILLED WITH SO MUCH TRAGEDY AND DESTRUCTION FOR AT LEAST ONE FAMILY, A MIRACLE TOOK PLACE. AMONG THAT CHAOS, KOCO ZACH RAEL SPOKE WITH SHAYLA TAYLOR. SHE WAS IN LABOR AS THE TORNADO BARRELED DOWN ON MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. HE HAS AN UPDATE TODAY ON HER SON AND HOW THAT FATEFUL DAY HAS COME FULL CIRCLE A DECADE LATER. LOOKING BACK TEN YEARS LATER, SHAYLA TAYLOR SAYS STORMS, ESPECIALLY TORNADOES, WERE THE LAST THING ON HER MIND AS SHE STARTED HER DAY ON MAY 20TH, 2013. THAT’S BECAUSE TAYLOR WAS SCHEDULED TO BE INDUCED TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER SECOND SON. THAT AFTERNOON. SEVERE WEATHER, TORNADOES, NOTHING LIKE THAT WAS ON MY MIND AT ALL, WAS GO IN, HAVE A BABY, GO HOME. AND THAT’S THE END OF IT. AS IT TURNED OUT, HER DELIVERY WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT SIMPLE. AS SHE GOT TO MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, HER DOCTORS AND NURSES KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE WEATHER FORECASTS. AS IT WAS PREDICTED, STRONG STORMS COULD BE FORMING THAT AFTERNOON WHEN I GOT THERE, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CHECK THE WEATHER AND SEE IF I WAS ACTUALLY IN ACTIVE LABOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BAD WEATHER THAT DAY. WHATEVER THE WEATHER, THE BABY WAS WELL ON ITS WAY. AND TAYLOR WAS GIVEN AN EPIDURAL, WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN NO LONGER MOVE HERSELF FREELY. SHORTLY AFTER, THAT’S WHEN THINGS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORST. A TORNADO EMERGENCY WAS ISSUED AROUND MAYBE TWO OR SO. THEY COME IN AND SAY THAT WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE COVER AND MY FAMILY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE CAFETERIA. I CAN’T GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE, LIKE I SAID, I CAN’T GET OUT OF BED. A RARE F5 TORNADO WAS HEADING RIGHT TOWARDS MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. DOCTORS AND NURSES RUSHING TO GET TAYLOR TO A SAFE SPOT. THEY DECIDE THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE’S NO WINDOWS AS CLOSE AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AS THEY CAN, WHICH ENDED UP BEING THE OR JUST MINUTES LATER, THAT MASSIVE TORNADO HIT THE HOSPITAL HEAD ON, DESTROYING THE BUILDING AROUND HER. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, YOU HEAR LIKE A SILENCE OR LIKE A TRAIN OR WHATEVER WHEN TORNADOES COME THROUGH. BUT IT WAS MORE OF A SILENT THING, LIKE YOU DIDN’T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING. YOU JUST SAW EVERYTHING KIND OF FALLING AROUND YOU. THIS IS A PHOTO OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE O.R. WHERE TAYLOR WAS HUNKERED DOWN. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS AND DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY HITTING WAS WHEN I WAS THE MOST SCARED. TAYLOR AND HER FAMILY SURVIVED. BUT EVEN WITH THE DESTRUCTION AROUND THEM, THAT DIDN’T CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE BIRTH VERY SOON. SHE NEEDED TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT WAS A TASK IN ITSELF BECAUSE I’M UPSTAIRS AND I SAID ALL THE HALLWAYS ARE DARK. EVEN WHEN THEY CARRIED ME DOWN ON THE BACKBOARD, IT WAS DARK GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU KNOW, YOU’RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND. YOU CAN’T REALLY SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. SO THE FIRST LIGHT I ACTUALLY SAW WAS ONCE WE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL, ONCE SHE WAS OUTSIDE, TAYLOR SAYS, SHE STARTED TO REALIZE THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. IT WAS MUDDY. THERE WAS THERE WERE TREES AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. THERE WERE CARS AND STUFF KIND OF EVERYWHERE. SO I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY BAD. SHE WAS THEN RUSHED TO NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE BIRTH AT 7:30 P.M. TO HER SECOND SON, BRADEN. HE WILL BE TEN AND HE HE’S DOING GOOD. HE’S IN FOURTH GRADE NOW. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE DAY HE WAS BORN. SO WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. A DECADE LATER. AND TAYLOR SAYS IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED. COMING UP ON TEN YEARS FEELS A LITTLE SURREAL, LIKE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE IT’S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE TORNADO HAPPENED. OF COURSE, MY DAILY REMINDER IS MY CHILD, TAYLOR, USING HER UNIQUE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO HELP OTHERS SOON TO BE MOMS. TODAY, SHE’S NOW A NURSE AT THE VERY HOSPITAL WHERE SHE GAVE BIRTH AT NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL. IT’S DEFINITELY COME FULL CIRCLE. I WORK IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. IN FACT, SHE EVEN WORKS WITH THAT SAME DOCTOR WHO DELIVERED BRADEN. SHE DIDN’T REALIZE WHO I WAS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER. AND THEN ONE DAY SHE JUST WALKS UP TO ME AND SHE’S LIKE, YOU’RE SHAYLA, AREN’T YOU? AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. AND SO SHE STARTS SHOWING ME PICTURES THAT SHE HAD FROM THE HOSPITAL AND STUFF. AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SHARED OUR PICTURES AND I TOLD HER THANK YOU, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY PEOPLE LOST SO MUCH ON MAY 20TH, 2013, A GLIMMER OF HOPE AND A MIRACLE ALSO TOOK PLACE THAT DAY, SOMETHING TAYLOR SAYS SHE WILL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED.

"miracle","2007-03-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 17:50:18","On the website of La Razón del Istmo, dedicated to citizens’ reflections, lawyer and academician Jorge Gonzalez recalled the benefits of this free service program, which resulted from an agreement signed on March 15, 2007.  The mission, a great work of solidarity, according to the writer, began in the western province of Veraguas, as it was a strategic territory that facilitated access to the deep country as well as to the transit zone and the capital.  Operation Miracle allowed performing approximately 50,000 eye surgeries and its scope of attention covered 75,000 people in total, Gonzalez said.  Many of the surgeries were performed in Panama and some in Cuba.  Among the main diseases that were treated were cataracts, glaucoma, retinal damage and vision disorders resulting from diabetes, he added.  In 2009, the political science graduate said, the newly elected government at the time (referring to the Ricardo Martinelli administration) decided, without any consultations, to terminate Operation Miracle, leaving 69,000 people pending on ophthalmologic services.  After highlighting the role of Cuban physicians in other missions in Panama, such as in 2020 and 2021, when members of the Henry Reeve International Brigade collaborated in the fight against Covid-19, Gonzalez pointed out that the demand for the return of Operation Miracle is not aimed at replacing Panamanian professionals, as he is in favor of deeply social ideas.  Science and technology, works of human accumulation, must be at the service of the people, the analyst remarked.  jg/abo/mem/ga","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BhbmFtYS1jYWxscy1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLWN1YmFzLW9wZXJhdGlvbi1taXJhY2xlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She and her children Henry and Margot are reliving their recent trip to a Queen Creek Costco, one that was anything but ordinary.  The siblings were chosen by Phoenix Children’s as fundraising ambassadors for the hospital's latest charity drive.  “It’s something that they get to do that is associated with Phoenix Children’s, that’s not negative, that’s not scary, that’s fun,” said Calkins.  Seven-year-old Henry was born with a rare autoimmune disease that’s forced him to spend much of his life in and out of the hospital. It's a genetic condition that can cause his own immune system to attack itself.  His sister Margot was recently diagnosed with the same condition.  “Henry’s life has drastically changed since he’s moved to Phoenix Childrens,” explained Calkins.  Specialized medical care provided there has given both of her kids their lives back. But that care isn’t cheap. It costs $2.7 million per day to operate Phoenix Children’s, providing for nearly 270,000 patients each year.  “All those different programs need funding, and it truly makes a difference,” said Calkins.  Last week, Henry and Margot were sent to the Queen Creek Costco with a job to do.  As honorary employees, name tags and all, they checked receipts and processed returns.  The siblings slipped on hairnets and made pizza and decorated cakes, all while urging customers to make a small donation. During the month of May, those donations are matched by Costco, hoping to raise more than a million dollars.  “Henry and Margot were just like jumping around, you could see how excited they were, they were telling them thank you, and telling them what they’ve been through, and why it meant so much,” said Calkins. “A lot of the employees seemed to be really passionate about talking to customers about donating after that.”  It’s clear from the photos that the kids' visit left an incredible impression, giving employees all the motivation they needed to hit their goals and beyond.  For Calkins, the hundreds of paper balloons hanging from the wall representing each donation sent her family and others like it a powerful message from the community.  ""That's why we love where we live, they are always here for us,"" said Calkins. “Get over to your local Costco and donate because you are changing a child's life.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzE1LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VwbGlmdGluZy1hcml6b25hL3ZhbGxleS1jaGlsZHJlbi1oZWxwLWtpY2stb2ZmLW1pcmFjbGUtbW9udGgtYXQtY29zdGNvLXJhaXNpbmctbW9uZXktZm9yLXBjaNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxNS5jb20vbmV3cy91cGxpZnRpbmctYXJpem9uYS92YWxsZXktY2hpbGRyZW4taGVscC1raWNrLW9mZi1taXJhY2xlLW1vbnRoLWF0LWNvc3Rjby1yYWlzaW5nLW1vbmV5LWZvci1wY2g_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Skincare lovers say the new £8 Miracle Balm from Revolution is so good, they've even stopped wearing foundation.  Said to instantly soothe dry lips, skin and hands among a whole host of other uses, some are already calling the new balm a dupe for the renowned Elizabeth Arden 8 hour Cream that’s £29.  Currently on sale at ASOS for the reduced price of £6.40 , shoppers could be saving more than £23 by opting for the so-called dupe, MyLondon reports.  READ MORE: Boots shoppers say £10 ‘miracle’ anti-ageing Olay eye cream ‘works like magic’  Amid the five star reviews on the Revolution site, one shopper said: “I believe in Miracles. This balm is great. I've used it on my lips and cheeks during the day, on my feet and hands overnight and on my face whilst in a dream room. It's on par with Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream but the tube looks more stylish and the price is a lot more reasonable. This is a product I'll be buying regularly.”  Another added: “I usually use a much more expensive balm (8 hour cream) but thought I’d give this a try. I’m impressed! It works well on dry or sensitive areas of the face and body. A little goes a long way. It has a light scent which doesn’t overpower. It is also much cheaper than my usual balm. I’ll definitely be buying again.”  Another calls it a ‘’One product wonder’’, stating that: ‘’As with the whole miracle range I now won't be without this. I use as an overnight face mask and I am now so happy with my skin I have stopped wearing foundation. I also have very curly hair and a smidge of this works wonders for frizz! What a product indeed. It really is a one product wonder.”  The balm has been inspired by the number one best-selling Miracle Cream moisturiser, which went viral as the dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. It sold out twice last year - once in just 48 hours, with 10 pots being sold every minute. We’re expecting the latest product from the range to be just as popular.  The new Miracle Balm is an all-in-one protectant that instantly moisturises, smooths and hydrates dry, chapped skin as well as providing protection from further irritation and dryness.  Infused with a subtle rose scent and enriched with skin-loving Vitamin E, the multi-tasking supercharged skincare balm is said to calm skin from the first use.  But what’s more is that it can be used on the face, lips and neck, as well as cuticles to help manicures last longer. It can even be applied to the cheek bones for a natural dewy finish, or used to prevent flyaway hairs or tame unruly brows.  Some shoppers have complained that the product is ‘too thick’ and have struggled to squeeze it out of the tube, commenting: “Balm doesn’t squeeze out of the tube at all, it’s too thick and you have cut the hole bigger.”  However, when we tried the product for ourselves, we managed just fine. It’s been working wonders on my nail beds between manicures, but I also love using it to smooth down my hair or to comb through my brows for that on-trend fluffy look.  The Miracle Balm is available for £8 at Revolution Beauty Bay for only £8.00, but is currently cheapest for £6.40 at ASOS . You can also explore the entire Revolution Pro Miracle collection here.

"miracle","2018-10-06","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:24:31","OPINION:  Before Elon Musk acquired Twitter and even more often following the transaction, the obituary for the social media giant has been written many times. I wrote a few myself. The Big Tech media corporation had essentially killed itself before Mr. Musk took control.  As the sink-carrying billionaire walked into Twitter headquarters (with a wallet $44 billion lighter) last October, the home base for reporters and influencers was little more than a boring left-wing echo chamber.  While Mr. Musk demonstrates the ability to run successful businesses (the world’s wealthiest people often do), many thought he was too late to save Twitter. The censorship, shadow banning and so-called fact-checking were killing the marketplace of ideas. It drove many users, including me, away.  Many business-saving initiatives are being pursued at Twitter — selling blue checks and subscriptions and sharing ad revenue, to name a few — but nothing seems to be accelerating the successful turnaround that free speech advocates so desperately want to see. While it was a lot of fun to see NPR called state-run media, the business of Twitter still seems to be on thin ice.  The Big Tech media corporations’ legacy of going beyond being just communication mediums is a tough one to overcome. These entities are writing, editing and controlling stories with little regard for truth or actual events. Big Tech is frustrating and disappointing us, but it’s eerily similar to what traditional news outlets have been doing for years.  We know that embracing “woke” culture at the expense of free speech ultimately fails, but can it be stopped in time for a turnaround? Hopefully, Mr. Musk will refrain from exercising his editing skills and remain a free speech absolutist.  Mr. Musk promised a change. He knew open-minded people are hungry for a fair platform that welcomes all ideas and ignores cancel culture. But despite his best efforts, it seems it will take a miracle to turn Twitter around.  That miracle may be happening, however, now that Tucker Carlson announced he is taking his show to Twitter. This is a brilliant move, especially for a media personality particularly critical of the mainstream media, accusing them of bias and hypocrisy and questioning their commitment to free speech.  Within a few hours of Mr. Carlson’s announcement, his video had already reached an exponentially higher audience than anything in a Fox News leader’s wildest dream. His message about the critical value of free speech, truth-telling, and reporting the news without fear of censorship or editorial interference is a rallying cry bringing people together and surely a topic of discussion in traditional network boardrooms.  It doesn’t cost much to be an independent journalist these days, but it costs a fortune to be a corporate one. Anyone with a smartphone, a web connection and ideas can find an audience. Producing a show for a television network, however, can be expensive due to the need for high-quality production equipment, studios and personnel. And the legal costs are surely prohibitive, because when you exercise free speech, some don’t like what is being said.  As he brings his new show to Twitter, Mr. Carlson and the platform will surely be sued, repeatedly. But the Constitution is on his side. Protecting your free speech rights can cost a lot, especially when defending them in court. McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission wasn’t easy even back in 2014, but it was worth it.  Unlike traditional media outlets, Messrs. Carlson and Musk seem unafraid of the cultural fear of threatened boycotts, legal fees, jury awards, and settlements that cause journalists on the left and the right to think twice about expressing their points of view — and news executives outright preventing it.  News executives see the value of free speech falling below what it costs to be associated with retribution for opinionated or firebrand anchors. Simply put, the constitutional freedom at the heart of all the others costs them too much.  The good news for Mr. Carlson is that Mr. Musk already paid the $44 billion bill.  As traditional legacy media continues to lose credibility the same way Twitter was losing users before Mr. Musk took over, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon — for Mr. Musk, for Mr. Carlson and for all of us.  Using Twitter to circumvent the restrictions, regulations and obstacles set up by traditional media networks is a genius move — and could be the miracle that saves Twitter. I know I’m going to give Twitter another try.  • Shaun McCutcheon is a free speech advocate, an Alabama-based electrical engineer, the founder of Multipolar, and the successful plaintiff in the 2014 Supreme Court case McCutcheon v.

Listen to the track below.  The Future Rave-inspired remix earned a colossal reception on the festival’s mainstage, and spurred Guetta to release his take on the single. “It started that day when I was just making my own version for Ultra,” he confirmed on his Instagram.  The French DJ and EDM kingpin is the latest to join the remix roster for the number one hit, following in the footsteps of the likes of Hardwell, Mau P, and Wilkinson.  The original ’90s trance-inspired single, released back in March on Sony Music, marked the first joint track from Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding in almost a decade, and was accompanied by a futuristic music video set in a desert landscape.  Speaking to Apple Music at the time, Harris said: “I've done the trancey-sounding things before, but I've never been this fast, so it feels good. When I was 14, it was '98, '99 – for me it was kind of [a] formative trance and house era. I thought maybe I'll just try and recreate something that could be from back then.”  Next month, David Guetta will kick off his weekly FUTURE RAVE residency at Hï Ibiza – voted DJ Mag’s number 1 club two years running – taking place every Friday from June 2nd, and featuring Dutch DJ Morten and James Hype for a selection of the dates.

"miracle","2023-04-24","Not Discerned","{""PostFalls"", ""Idaho"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:01:14","Ashlee Aurora has been a mom for more than 12 years.  However, it wasn't until April 24 that she gave birth to her first child.  ""This is a new stage for us,"" Aurora, 33, said Thursday, her new son, Waylon, resting in her arms.  ""We've never done the newborn stage before,"" she said. ""It's all new. The lack of sleep is new. All of our kids, when we got them, were old enough they were sleeping through the night, so that’s new. But it’s great. I love it. Definitely gives a whole new purpose.""  Aurora was told at age 16 she would never conceive because she has polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause infertility. Doctors said if she did conceive, she wouldn't be able to carry to full term.  She and her high school sweetheart husband, Justin Aurora, have been together for 16 years. They had accepted they would have to adopt or foster if they wanted to be parents. It just happened sooner than they could have imagined.  Their oldest kids, Justyce, 15, and Jacob, 14, came into their lives when she and Justin were still kids themselves.  Ashlee worked as a nanny in Post Falls when she and Justin were 20. The grandfather of the family told Ashlee he knew of an older couple who needed help raising two young kids and asked if she would meet them. They went to dinner with the family the next day.  ""We met these two little spitfire toddlers who were super shy and quiet,"" Ashlee said.  The children came to the elderly couple, of no relation, from birth parents who were not capable of caring for them. Ashlee and Justin began watching them in 2010, and within a month the siblings were living with them. By 2012, the Auroras had legal guardianship of the siblings, although they still stay in touch with the older woman, who they consider a grandmother.  ""We were still young and doing our own thing,"" Ashlee said. ""I knew at some point I wanted to have kids some way. I always thought it would be cool to go to Indonesia and do a mission trip. But it all just kind of happened. It totally was a God thing. God arranged it how it was supposed to be.""  She credits Justyce and Jacob for jump-starting their adult lives. They went from carefree young adults to grown-ups with the responsibility of caring for little ones who needed them.  ""It changed a lot for us, but totally for the best,"" Ashlee said.  Before long, Bryson came along. He was 7 months old when the Auroras first fostered him. He was in and out with his birth family, but when he landed back in the system, they knew he was meant to be with them.  Bryson, now 10, entered their lives after Ashlee took foster care training.  ""At the end of the class, they tell you how many kids are in foster care, and it broke my heart,"" Ashlee said. ""So we agreed to do foster care. And we ended up with ... a houseful ever since,"" Justin said.  How do they do it?  ""We're broke,"" Justin joked.  He works at Kaiser Aluminum; she works at Children's Village. They have their four children, plus a friend's daughter, Lily, who stays with them throughout the school year, and they provide respite for foster parents. Their doors are always open when a child is in need.  ""We have a lot of support. Our families help us a lot,"" Ashlee said. ""Justyce drives now, so that is really helpful.""  Through years of being adoptive parents to children they adore, the Cataldo couple expected to be empty-nesters by their early 40s.  But, as the saying goes, expect the unexpected.  ""In August, I had the day off and I woke up and I just had this weird feeling I should take a pregnancy test,” Ashlee said.  She convinced herself it was impossible, but when she jumped on social media, the first video she saw had a baby in it. Then the next one.  “I was like, ‘OK God, if there’s four more videos of babies, I’ll take a pregnancy test.’ And the next six videos were all of babies. So I took a pregnancy test,"" she said. ""At that time, I would have only been like three-and-a-half weeks. They all showed up super positive.”  In disbelief, she sent a picture of the pregnancy test to her cousin, with whom she is incredibly close.  “I was like, ‘Is this what I think it is? I think I’m crazy, I don’t know,’ and she was like, ‘Oh my gosh, Ashlee, that’s positive,'"" Ashlee said. ""It took a good two months before I really fully believed it.""  “And how many pregnancy tests?” Justin chimed in with a grin.  ""I took a lot of pregnancy tests,"" she said, smiling back.  Justin admitted he was excited after the initial shock wore off.  ""Mostly because I thought I had it figured out, how the future was going,"" he said.  That first day was rough for both of them. Was this real? Would they miscarry?  ""I've always prayed that I'm thankful I can't conceive if I'm not going to carry,"" Ashlee said. ""Emotionally, I don't know how I would handle that. I've always been stressed about that.""  Ashlee was most excited to tell the big kids, although Justyce knew before her parents knew she knew.  ""She cheated and saw my prenatals (vitamins) in my purse,"" Ashlee said, beaming a smile at Justyce. ""She was a sneaker.""  ""Before that, I saw your pregnancy test,"" Justyce responded, also smiling.  Jacob said he was excited to welcome home a baby brother.  ""I’m a lot older than he is, so it will just be cool,” he said. “It didn’t feel real at first.”  ""At first I was like, that’s so weird,'"" Justyce said. “Then I thought it was really cool. I’m really happy.”  “For now, I’m fine with him,” Bryson said. “He’s going to start crawling and get in my room. The No. 1 thing off limits — my books.”  For Ashlee, foster care is near to her heart. She said she always knew at some point she wanted to adopt through foster care, because she wasn't supposed to be able to have kids.  ""Justin's just really good at going with the flow, and letting me bring lots of kids home,"" she said with a laugh.  Although they have a miraculous new addition, they have been loving parents for a long time. That love will only continue to grow.  ""Our kids are all our kids,"" Ashlee said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYm9ubmVyY291bnR5ZGFpbHliZWUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTYvbGl0dGxlLW1pcmFjbGUtYm9ubmVyLWNvdW50eS1kYWlseS1iZWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-12-06","Not Discerned","{""Westwood"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:25:37","Newborn Carol Zaslow’s chances were slim-to-none. Born at Cedars-Sinai three months premature on Dec. 6, 1945, the infant weighed just 14 ounces. The odds of her survival were 1 in 50,000.  Carol’s doctors provided her with breastmilk via an eyedropper. After a few weeks, the eyedropper was replaced with a feeding tube. The liquid nutrition, coupled with the Jewish hospital’s incubators for preterm infants as well as skilled obstetricians trained in the latest scientific advances, allowed the fragile baby to beat the odds.  Carol not only survived—she thrived. The “miracle baby” grew up in Westwood, graduated from USC with a triple major in English, social services and education and went on to start a family with her husband, David Zaslow. They had two daughters, Tracy and Carrie, both of whom became doctors, crediting their mom for inspiring their respective career paths. Tracy is a primary care sports medicine physician in Los Angeles, and Carrie is an ophthalmologist in New York.  Coinciding with Mother’s Day, Cedars-Sinai recently published an article about their former patient. The medical center said Carol’s long life was centered on family and service. She spent several years as a kindergarten and first grade teacher in the Inglewood Unified School District before becoming a stay-at-home mom. Believing helping others was fundamental to a fulfilling life, she started a D.A.R.E. program at her daughters’ elementary school, served as a Brownie troop leader and was elected to the board of a nonprofit literary arts organization.  In her third act, Carol, an empty nester, became a published children’s author, co-writing an award-winning series of books called “Little Kids do BIG Things.”  Last year, Carol was admitted to Cedars-Sinai for mitral valve regurgitation, a progressive heart-valve disease. She was readmitted several weeks later due to surgical complications. On June 10, 2022, she passed away.  Carol believed happy, healthy kids become compassionate and engaged adults—an outlook that informed her life’s choices. To honor that legacy, while showing appreciation to the hospital that always felt like family, the Zaslows, who are Jewish, recently launched the Carol Zaslow Memorial Fund, which supports pediatric research at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children’s.  As of press time, the campaign had raised more than $170,000 of its $200,000 goal.  “Driven by the idea that investing in children’s health is so critical because they are tomorrow’s adults, and understanding pediatric research has always been underfunded, our family has decided that the Carol Zaslow Memorial Fund will be dedicated to furthering pediatric research to be able to maximally impact lives for generations to come,” the family wrote on Carol’s memorial page.  This past weekend marked Carol’s daughters’ first Mother’s Day without their dearest mom, the woman who at birth defied all medical expectations and went on to live a long and meaningful life. In interviews with Cedars-Sinai, the Zaslows discussed the various ways they remembered Carol, a wife, mother and grandmother.  “Maybe I’ll make her famous lemon Bundt cake, and I definitely will set aside some time to read a book,” Carrie said. “My mom loved to read.”  Tracy’s Mother’s Day plans included being “together with family and sharing our favorite memories of her.” One of those memories involved when Carol was in the hospital last year. “I’ll never forget her radiant smile when her two granddaughters made a surprise visit and showered their grammie with big hugs,” Tracy told Cedars-Sinai.  For Carol’s husband, David, Mother’s Day was an opportunity to reflect on how “blessed [he was] to find such a wonderful, caring, kind woman to be my wife,” he said. “Carol truly was a miracle baby, and that blessing led to our wonderful, very accomplished daughters who were blessed with their own children—our five happy, healthy, bright grandchildren who bring so much joy. The odds were stacked against Carol, but look at the legacy she left.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vamV3aXNoam91cm5hbC5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5LzM1ODg0OC9qZXdpc2gtZmFtaWx5LXN0YXJ0cy1wZWRpYXRyaWMtZnVuZC1pbi1taXJhY2xlLWJhYnktbW90aGVycy1tZW1vcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A Houston resident’s recovery after a severe stroke is being described as “a miracle” by his wife and his surgeon.  A Sunday in January that began with lunch out with friends took a turn for the worse later that night when 42-year-old Jeremy Simmons collapsed and fell unconscious in his home.  His wife Laura Simmons called 911 and Jeremy was rushed to HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress hospital. A CT scan showed he had a stroke, four brain aneurysms and excessive bleeding to the brain.  INSIDER NEWSLETTER: Must-read stories and news to know from the Cy-Fair area  Laura said the only signs before his collapse were a headache and nausea, but they just thought it could be food poisoning.  Jeremy was transported to the hospital’s sister facility, HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest, which has a Level 2 Trauma Center.  Laura said the night was a blur. She worried about the effect an event like this might have on their five-year-old daughter.  “Our entire world just turned upside down in a split second. So, I just really wanted some normalcy for her,” Laura said.  The family tried to keep her routine as normal as possible.  SURPRISE CELEBRATION: Spring-area hospital throws surprise birthday party for 62-year-old recovering from tear in heart artery  “My in-laws obviously came into town and we kept her at school. …She's a very smart and intuitive five-year-old and I didn't want to tell her too much because I don't want to scare her,” Laura said. “She wasn't able to see him for 28 days which was probably the hardest part.”  According to National Institutes of Health, a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a ruptured blood vessel bleeding into the brain.  Neuroendovascular surgeon Dr. Shamaelah Javed, who was on call that day, said what made Jeremy’s case unique from others she’s seen was his relatively young age and the major bleeding.  She said Jeremy had a rare malformation affecting only 1 in 600,000 people, and 70 percent of patients in these cases don’t even make it to the hospital.  “Honestly, I wasn't expecting that he would have such a remarkable recovery,” Javed said. “And all this is basically attributed to the kind of care that he got in the in the hospital along with the treatment we offered.”  Javed said the use of new devices and technology helped throughout the process.  “This is like a miracle because his chances of walking out of the hospital were very long,” she said. “Him surviving was one thing but being disabled—severely disabled—was another fear that I had.  “But he just came back to see me a couple of weeks ago and he's doing very well. He's recovered a lot. So, I think the new treatment modalities that we have has made a huge difference in his recovery.”  After surgery, Javed said most of his aneurysms had healed and bleeding stopped.  “Dr. Javed came to the waiting room and when she said that I just fell the ground, thanking God that he's here and he's going to be ok and we're going to get through this,” Laura said. “We’ve still got a long road ahead of us (but) he has beat all odds and progressing every single day.”  During Jeremy’s time in the ICU, Laura said that she visited 40 days straight, not missing a day to check on her husband. Now, he is undergoing rehabilitation and looks forward to recovering from the traumatic experience.  The Simmons family returned to the hospital Monday for an event honoring stroke patients during Survive Stroke Week. Observed from May 15 through 21, the week is an opportunity to spread awareness of signs and symptoms, and the importance of calling 911 immediately if someone has a stroke.  Javed said that people of all ages should watch out for strokes. She suggested people live a healthy lifestyle and get medical checkups regularly.  Laura urges people to seek treatment immediately if they’re experiencing symptoms.  “If there's something unusual like migraines or numbness to your arms or blurred vision, just don't waste any time. Get to the doctor immediately,” she said. “And obviously, as anybody knows, you're your biggest advocate for yourself and your health. Talk as a family. I had no idea that strokes ran in both sides of this family very strongly and I didn't realize this until he was in the hospital.”  As Jeremy continues to make progress during his recovery process, he looks forward to playing with his daughter, returning to work and golfing in his free time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi10ZXhhcy9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS9oY2EtaG91c3Rvbi1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXN0cm9rZS1zdXJ2aXZvci1taXJhY2xlLTE4MTAwMzU1LnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"miracle","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Brookfield"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:27:00","Onni Group is in trouble over its $408 million loan connected to the Wilshire Courtyard office complex on the Miracle Mile, The Real Deal has learned.  The commercial mortgage-backed securities loan from Natixis has been sent to special servicing, ahead of its expected expiration in July, according to data from Trepp and Morningstar Credit Information and Analytics. Onni Group did not respond to a request for comment.  Onni has an option to extend the loan by another year, according to the Morningstar data. However, this option requires the building’s income to be 1.1 times the monthly debt service — a requirement Onni is not currently achieving, therefore triggering the special servicing.  Onni bought the 1 million-square-foot office complex at 5750 Wilshire Boulevard for $630 million in 2019, taking it from the hands of Tishman Speyer. Months later, it scored WeWork as an anchor tenant, occupying about 32 percent of the space — a deal hailed as a win for Onni, given WeWork’s $47 billion valuation at the time.  The same year, Onni negotiated the CMBS loan and a $69.4 million mezzanine loan from Brookfield, according to a report from DBRS Morningstar.  But the timing was inopportune. WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann was ousted as CEO a few months later after a failed attempt to take the company public. By 2022, WeWork had vacated its entire 335,000-square-foot lease.

At the end of 2022, the campus was about 46 percent vacant and the firm reported net cash flow of $20 million — down from $30.2 million when the CMBS loan was issued, according to Morningstar data.  Tenancy at the property, and therefore income, has been a rollercoaster since then.  In January, Sony Pictures signed a deal to lease 225,000 square feet at the building — a major boost for the property.  But three months later, the loan’s special servicer said two major tenants — Media Brands Worldwide and Sky Dance Media — were expected to vacate the property once their respective leases expire later this year. Together, the two had occupied 165,000 square feet of space. Neither company responded to requests for comment.  However, unlike many office owners with floating rate debt, Onni has been feeling less of the pain that has come with rising interest rates, given it purchased a rate cap when it secured the loan in 2019.  Onni has been paying an interest rate of 3.75 percent on the loan since July of last year, loan data shows, coming out to about $1.3 million a month interest or $15.6 million a year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvdHJvdWJsZS1sb29tcy1mb3Itb25uaS1ncm91cHMtNDA4bS1sb2FuLW9uLW1pcmFjbGUtbWlsZS1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There have been more than 20 drownings in these Lake Michigan waters since 2010.  In 2013, one drowning was hundreds of yards away from the lake. In fact, this threat to a 6-year-old boy didn’t involve a drop of water. And its unthinkable occurrence astounded the world.  It was a July day on a family outing to the popular beach at Mt. Baldy. a 126-foot dune an hour’s drive from Chicago. The Woessner family made that trip from their home in Sterling, Illinois.  That’s where we found Nathan’s parents, to take us back to that traumatic summer day a decade ago.  “It pretty much started out as a long weekend, camping with friends,” Greg recalled. “There was a trail going up to the top of the dunes.”  Nathan and his friend were following their dads. Suddenly, a panicked call to the dads from the friend who said Nathan disappeared in a hole. Through his initial confusion, there it was: “Plain as day, a round, black hole about 15-18 inches in diameter perfectly round hole right straight down,” Greg said.  Greg could hear Nathan, but couldn’t see him.  “(I) was actually talking with Nathan, he was still down there, you could tell he was worked up, scared. Just pretty much trying to clam him down. We’ll get to you, don’t worry,” Greg said.  But then, seconds later, as Greg and his friend were digging, the hole collapsed.  Nathan’s friend ran down to get help, other dad ran over the dune to the parking lot to a phone to call 911. By then the other boy made it to Nathan’s mom.  “Just by the tone of his voice and his expression, he was just so frightened, and it frightened me,” Faith remembered. “My mind couldn’t grasp or understand and I just remember, ‘no, no, no, no!'”  Together, on their knees, furiously clawing at the sand, the situation was dire.  “I was digging, Greg was digging, we were digging with all of our might, and the sand, it was so unforgiving,” Faith said. “I remember praying, immediately praying, asking God to give him air to breathe, to hold him and I kept repeating that over and over. ‘Hold him, give him air to breathe.'”  Emergency responders arrived. Strangers joined in. With shovels at first — then excavating equipment.  “If you ever dig in sand, you’re never getting anywhere, unless you try to get so big,” Greg said.  A backhoe was brought in — but still no sign of Nathan.  “I remember telling (God), ‘I need him back I need you to give him back to me. I know he’s special but I need him back,’ and it was that same prayer over and over and over,” Faith said.  Agonizingly. The effort stretched on. Greg: “At this point, it’s been so long they were on a recovery mission now, and not a rescue.”  Josh Zimmer was prepared for the worst. He was called upon to bring his bigger backhoe to pick up where the smaller one left off. Together they did the careful work of digging.  “It’s very slow and meticulous,” Zimmer said. “Ryan had a probe which is just a metal rod it’s about 4 foot down probing the ground to see if he could feel something. And then we would do a grid and I would nice and gentle two inches at a time.”  Then, the news finally came. More than three hours later. Nearly 12 feet underground. They reached Nathan after unearthing 400 tons of sand. But as many feared, the outcome was grim. His body was limp and cold. He had no pulse.  “I don’t know if you want to call it a mood but it was quiet and sad and still because nobody knew, he had no vital signs,” Zimmer recalled.  And in that moment of darkness, as Greg and Faith were on their way to the hospital to identify the body, is where the Miracle on Mt. Baldy was revealed; a paramedic noticed a wound on Nathan’s face was bleeding, telling him his heart was still pumping.  “They went into a frenzy suddenly he was back and they were doing everything they could to stabilize him,” Faith said.  “They rushed us over to the hospital,” Greg struggles to find the words, and motions toward his wife. “That’s the point right there in the waiting room, but he came in, right to her, he’s alive.”  Faith replies: “Best words I ever heard.”  Today, Nathan is a student at Unity Christian School in Fulton, where he’s a 16-year-old sophomore.  “Well, I don’t remember much about it,” Nathan offered. “I do remember walking up the hill beside my friend. Next thing I remember is waking up with a bunch of nurses and everyone around me.”  After a week of treatment at Comer Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Nathan bears no sign of his childhood trauma, physically, or emotionally. He’s a stand out athlete on the school’s basketball team. He plays soccer and is a member of the brand new school volleyball team.  What he does have is gratitude.  “God was there and God is the reason I’m still here today,” Nathan said. “I’ll just be casually thinking about something and it’ll come to mind. And it reminds me and gives me hope that there’s a plan and that I’m meant for something.”  “He doesn’t live in a way that’s timid or shy,” said Jackie Hass, one of Nathan’s teachers at Unity Christian School. “He’s very vivacious. He takes what happened to him to really understand that life is an opportunity and a gift and you have to enjoy it every day, because he does!”  “Every experience, every new memory watching him grow, every birthday new sports, new friends,” Nathan’s mom said. “I have really thoroughly enjoyed watching him experience that, it’s not lost on me that we could have just as easily not had that.”  Someone else was changed by that day: Josh Zimmer, who also knew he was part of something bigger than any of them could understand.  ” I just couldn’t go to sleep that night, and I knew God was real,” Zimmer said. “Because He did something I know was impossible.”  That night, he called his family’s pastor and was baptized in the church.  “My in-laws came, they got out of bed, and my wife and the preacher’s wife, yeah it was a life-changing moment.  How did Nathan survive his time buried in the sand?  “There are stories about a dead tree trunk and an air pocket down in the ground, but I think the Lord was with me the whole time. He has a purpose for me and I don’t think my time was then,” Nathan said.  How the void developed in the shifting sands is still being studied, but for everyone involved, there is little doubt about what they witnessed.  “God spoke to me,” Faith said. “He spoke to my heart, ‘I’m giving him back to you he’s a gift to you, I love you,’ it was such an overwhelming feeling of gratitude and awe.”  Greg offered his hard-earned insight: “Slow down and capture and love every moment that you can with your kids, your loved ones.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2dudHYuY29tL25ld3MvY292ZXItc3RvcnkvZmFtaWx5LXJlbWVtYmVycy1taXJhY2xlLWF0LWluZGlhbmEtZHVuZXMtbW91bnQtYmFsZHkv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93Z250di5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3Zlci1zdG9yeS9mYW1pbHktcmVtZW1iZXJzLW1pcmFjbGUtYXQtaW5kaWFuYS1kdW5lcy1tb3VudC1iYWxkeS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana have seen a promising turnaround in their student reading scores after passing a series of similar literacy reforms. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)  NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It’s a cliché that Kymyona Burk heard a little too often: “Thank God for Mississippi.”  As the state’s literacy director, she knew politicians in other states would say it when their reading test scores were down — because at least they weren’t ranked as low as Mississippi. Or Louisiana. Or Alabama.  Lately, the way people talk about those states has started to change. Instead of looking down on the Gulf South, they’re seeing it as a model.  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  “In this region, we have decided to go big,” said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country’s highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia , Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  “We know how to teach reading,” she said. “We just have to do it everywhere.”  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten , informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read , but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading. It’s well worth the time, according to Assistant Principal Erika Brown, who said that in college she didn’t learn a thing about teaching kids to read.  “I was winging it,” she said of her early years in teaching.  During a recent session with four second-grade girls, Brown had the girls spell “crib,” asking, “What are the sounds you hear?”  Like a choir, they chanted back four individual sounds, counting them with their fingers: “c-rrr-i-buh.” This was one of the techniques Brown had learned in the training; counting four sounds, or phonemes, gave students a clue that the word had four letters. Increased screening also helped the school identify these girls as needing extra help.  “Are y’all ready for a challenge word?” Brown asked, and the girls shouted, “Yeah!” Their faces fell when Brown revealed the word: bedbug. They had no idea what the word even meant. But with Brown’s gentle guidance, the girls broke down the word into six phonemes. They were even ready for another challenge.  “Can we spell cock-a-roach?” one of the girls asked.  A second-grader in the school, Joshua Lastie, said he likes how his teacher helps him if he trips over a hard word, like “happened” or “suddenly.”  “The school is trying to make the words way easier for kids,” said Joshua, 7.  One challenge that comes with the emphasis on small-group intervention is the strain on scheduling and staffing. Literacy coaches from the state are helping the charter network strategize on how to reach all students. One resource the state can’t provide, says Lisa Giarratano, the chief academic officer at ReNEW, is time.  In a national climate where education debates are often polarizing, the three Gulf states passed their sweeping education reforms with bipartisan support, starting with Mississippi’s in 2013. Louisiana state Rep. Richard Nelson, a Republican who has championed literacy reform, said pointing to laws passed in other Deep South states made it easier for him to introduce legislation and “sell across party lines.”  “Every time I present a bill, I say, ‘Look, Mississippi has very similar challenges to what we have in Louisiana, and they’ve been able to make this work,’” Nelson said.  There is still far to go for children in the Gulf South, especially considering the disruptions to schooling from the pandemic and several major hurricanes and tornadoes. Mississippi, after stellar gains in the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress , saw reading scores drop in 2022, although they are still at the national average. Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group , could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular. In 2019, Alabama ranked 49th in NAEP reading scores for low-income fourth-graders; in 2022, it ranked 27th. Amid the pandemic that saw most states lose ground, Louisiana soared from 42nd to 11th. Mississippi ranks second-highest in the country, after Florida.  Alabama’s state superintendent of education, Eric Mackey, says he has confidence in the reforms — in part because they’ve worked before. Alabama invested heavily in training on the science of reading, then known as phonics, in the early 2000s, and scores rose. Then the Great Recession hit, teachers and literacy coaches got laid off, and the state lost its gains.  Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  “We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,” Mackey said. “This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.”  ___  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

"miracle","2019-03-18","Not Discerned","{""Hartford"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:15:03","THOMASTON, Conn. (NewsNation) — The Vatican is now investigating an extraordinary event that allegedly took place during a mass at a Roman Catholic Church in Thomaston back in March, leaving the faithful in awe.  Rev. Joseph Crowley, the head of the St. Maximilian Kolbe Parish, was leading Mass at St. Thomas Church in Thomaston when he reported the wafers distributed during Communion multiplied inside the ciborium, which is the container used to hold the wafers, also referred to as Communion host.  “God duplicated himself in this moment. Very powerful, very awesome, very real, very shocking. But also, it happens,” Crowley said.  A parishioner who was assisting with distributing the Communion wafers allegedly reported that there was a shortage of hosts. However, they then found there were plenty of wafers remaining.  Now, the alleged event is being investigated as a possible “miracle” by the Vatican.  Although the multiplication of communion wafers may seem relatively inconsequential, it holds great significance for Catholics.  In the 21st century, only four eucharistic miracles have been recognized throughout the world, according to Magis Center.  The Eucharist, or Communion, is considered the holiest sacrament in the Catholic faith. Catholics believe the bread and wine become the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ during the blessing, rather than mere symbols of his presence.  The news quickly reached the Archdiocese of Hartford, prompting an investigation to determine whether a genuine miracle had occurred within the church.  Now, the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of Faith, the entity responsible for safeguarding the Catholic faith worldwide, has been alerted and has initiated its own investigation into the matter.  The alleged miracle at St. Thomas Church has a special connection to the late Father Michael McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. He spent the final years of his clerical career at St. Thomas Church and is just one more verified miracle away from final consideration for sainthood.  If McGivney were to be canonized, he would become the first man born in the United States ever to be elevated to sainthood.  The Catholic Church has a meticulous process for verifying miracles. The Vatican’s investigation is expected to take approximately two weeks.  Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, the reported miracle has reignited debates about faith, miracles and the supernatural.  Devan Markham contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3JlbGlnaW9uL3ZhdGljYW4tYWxsZWdlZC1taXJhY2xlLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LWNodXJjaC_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzbmF0aW9ubm93LmNvbS9yZWxpZ2lvbi92YXRpY2FuLWFsbGVnZWQtbWlyYWNsZS1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1jaHVyY2gvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The possible miracle happened during a March 5 Mass at Saint Thomas Church.  “We had something happen,” Rev. Joseph Crowley said, growing emotional in a video addressing the congregation after communion. “God provides, and it’s funny how God provides, and sometimes it comes in a weird way, in a mystical way.”  Crowley said that a minister ran out of hosts during communion. Then, when he looked in the ciborium, there were more.  “God duplicated himself in the ciborium,” Crowley said in the video, noting that the potential religious miracle was caught on tape.

(WBTV/Gray News) - Three people are dead after a truck fleeing law enforcement crashed into a home in Shelby, North Carolina, on Sunday, WBTV reports.  The incident started in Blacksburg, South Carolina, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office.  According to deputies, dispatch received a call Sunday around 12:55 a.m. that a white pickup was following and shooting into the caller’s Dodge Charger.  After the chase reached North Carolina, the 911 call was transferred around 1:07 a.m. to the Cleveland County dispatch center.  Deputies from Cleveland County say they tried to stop the suspects, but the truck fled by running a red light and headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and turned off the headlights.  According to deputies, they lost sight of the truck momentarily but found it crashed into the home.  The pickup driver allegedly fled from deputies by running a red light. The truck headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and the headlights were turned off before crashing into a house.  The homeowner said that after nearly 50 years of living in the home on Suttle Street, he’s glad to still have his life. Others in the neighborhood said the incident was unlike anything they’ve ever seen.  “What I see is a lot of destruction and a lot of craziness,” neighbor Franklin Batten said. “I never seen bodies before or people die in an accident like this before. I never witnessed it in my life.”  Officials with the Shelby Police Department said six men were in the car at the time, five between the ages of 15 and 20.  Officers say three of the men have died, three were taken to the hospital and one was released.  No one in the car that was being chased was hurt.  “Given the relentlessness with which these suspects pursued and shot at the victims, it is a miracle that no one in the victims’ car was injured.

The UKLASH Eyelash Serum, £37.99 here , has been praised for giving users longer, fuller eyelashes, and Molly-Mae was keen to try out the product for herself. In a YouTube video posted on Thursday, the influencer talked through some of her upcoming beauty journeys, including whitening her teeth and trying out the UKLASH serum.  Molly-Mae said: ""Another thing that I've also been trying, I've seen so many girls on TikTok and YouTube and all over the place talking about their lash growth journey"". Molly-Mae revealed that her eyelashes were affected during her pregnancy, admitting a combination of the postpartum hair loss and rubbing her eyes caused them to thin and shorten.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube) (Image: UKLASH)  Molly-Mae told her viewers: ""My lashes were definitely one thing that took a hit through my pregnancy. I also have a really bad habit of rubbing my eyes a lot.  ""My lashes over the last few months and over my pregnancy have really thinned out, so I bought UKLASH. Which I've heard literally works miracles for growing your lashes.""  The lash serum has been lauded as a miracle worker for helping revive short, thin, or sparse eyelashes, and helping them become thicker and fuller, with users typically seeing results in 8-12 weeks. Consistency is the key to seeing results, with UKLASH recommending you apply the serum every night to get the results you want.  During her YouTube video, Molly-Mae confessed that she struggles to remember to do something every day. The former Love Island star said: “I’ve only just started using this, I’ve only done like three nights of applying it, then I actually missed a night. If there’s something that needs to be done every day, don’t count on me to do it…I guarantee even if I put it beside my bed I’ll forget, but I’m going to try not to because I really want to see an improvement with my lashes.”  The UKLASH Serum contains biotin peptides which are vital for healthy hair growth and Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 which stimulates keratin growth. It also contains green tea extract, which helps to grow long fluttery lashes, and vitamin B5 which smooths, conditions and supports your lashes to make them look thicker and healthier.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube)  To use the serum, first make sure you’ve removed all your makeup using an oil-free cleanser, then apply a single swipe of the serum along your lashline, just like you would when applying eyeliner. The UKLASH website suggests that a single dip of the product should be enough to cover both eyelashes, then leave the product to work overnight.  There’s even a money back guarantee if you don’t see results within 12 weeks of proper use, so if you’re sceptical about it working, you know you won’t be out of pocket if you don’t see any results.

Kiwior has impressed having come into the starting lineup to replace Rob Holding in recent weeks, as William Saliba remains on the sidelines through injury.  The £21m centre-back went down holding his foot after his boot came off under the challenge of Brighton’s Evan Ferguson, before a cross was delivered right over Kiwior’s head to allow Enciso to easily nod past Aaron Ramsdale.  Deniz Undav and Pervis Estupinan added to the Seagull’s lead to give them a convincing and deserved 3-0 win and leave the Gunners needing a miracle to claim the title over Manchester City, who are now four points clear with a game in hand.  After the defeat, Micah Richards attempted to defend Kiwior before Keane dismissed his fellow pundit’s thoughts in typically brutal style: “You talk about putting your body on the line, last-ditch defending and stuff, you don’t stay down like that. Micah, his boot came off, his foot didn’t come off.”  The Poland international explained after the game: “I felt contact and lost my boot and didn’t even see the goal. I hoped VAR would intervene and chalk off the goal, but unfortunately, the ref saw it differently.  “After we conceded the second our heads dropped and we couldn’t come back,” he added.

He said: “Kiwior is injured but the fact that he was injured, I mean… He goes down holding his ankle and left Arsenal short in the middle of the box.  “He goes down. Can he not just – I’m scared of saying it… And I’m sure the lads in the studio, Roy [Keane] and Patrick [Viera], might be thinking it and have a bit more to say.  Story continues  “If you’re injured you’re injured. But as a centre half, surely you just have to stand up and let the attack finish?”  Jamie Carragher took to Twitter to label the moment embarraassing.  He wrote: ‘It was a embarrassing Kiwior stayed down whether it was a foul or not (it wasn’t) there was very little wrong with him. Get up & defend like your life depends on it.’  The article Kiwior explains ’embarrassing’ Arsenal gaffe after stinging Keane criticism – ‘His foot didn’t come off’ appeared first on Football365.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2tpd2lvci1leHBsYWlucy1lbWJhcnJhc3NpbmctYXJzZW5hbC1nYWZmZS0wNjIxMDY1MjAuaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwva2l3aW9yLWV4cGxhaW5zLWVtYmFycmFzc2luZy1hcnNlbmFsLWdhZmZlLTA2MjEwNjUyMC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photograph: BCCI  IPL 2023 has been a roller coaster ride with nail-biting finishes and heart-stopping moments, but Sunday's doubleheaders were a snooze-fest.  CSK fans must have clung to their seats hoping for a miracle from their beloved Thala to pull off a master-stroke, but alas, it was not meant to be.  Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh continued their brilliant run of form as they pulled off one of the surprise results of the season to breach fortress Chepauk, with the Kolkata Knight Riders defeating Chennai Super Kings by six wickets.  Chasing 145, KKR lost three quick wickets in the Powerplay with Deepak Chahar taking three wickets, dismissing Rahmunllah Gurbaz, Jason Roy and Venkatesh Iyer, before the CSK spin attack even came into the game.  Kolkata looked in trouble at 33-3, but the left-handed pair Rinku and Rana put on a hall of fame display on how to play spin at Chepauk with a 99-run partnership to take their side home with nine balls to spare.  IMAGE: Rinku Singh celebrates his half century. Photograph: BCCI  Rana remained unbeaten with 57 off 44 balls while Rinku scored a 43-ball 54. This was the highest fourth wicket partnership in the IPL at the M A Chidambaram stadium.  The match will be remembered for RR's outstanding performance, which showcased how to play spin in challenging conditions and keep the pressure on a formidable opponent.  IMAGE: Nitish Rana slammed the winning runs. Photograph: BCCI  Initially, Rinku was the aggressor, but Rana picked up pace and extinguished any hope of CSK defending the total. Rana made the most of a dropped catch on 18 by Matheesha Pathirana in the deep to reach his fifty and stood firm to hit the winning runs.  Rinku, who became an IPL sensation with his five sixes off the last five balls against the Gujarat Titans to conjure up a miracle win for Kolkata last month, struck another fifty of the season before being run out. He was eventually awarded the player of the match.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5yZWRpZmYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvcmVwb3J0L2lwbC0yMDIzLWNzay1ra3ItdHVybmluZy1wb2ludC1yYW5hLXJpbmt1LXNob3ctY3NrLXdob3MtdGhlLWJvc3MtYXQtY2hlcGF1ay8yMDIzMDUxNS5odG3SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLnJlZGlmZi5jb20vYW1wL2NyaWNrZXQvcmVwb3J0L2lwbC0yMDIzLWNzay1ra3ItdHVybmluZy1wb2ludC1yYW5hLXJpbmt1LXNob3ctY3NrLXdob3MtdGhlLWJvc3MtYXQtY2hlcGF1ay8yMDIzMDUxNS5odG0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
