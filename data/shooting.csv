(KTVE/KARD) –The Bastrop Police Department is investigating a recent shooting involving two juveniles.  The shooting happened in broad daylight, and one teen was taken to a local hospital for gunshot wounds. KTVE spoke to several residents in the area, and they say they fear for their life.  I don’t feel safe, and what if one of these kids that I keep is killed. What’s going to happen to me? Because I keep the kids. Wanda, Bastrop Resident  The shooting that happened Tuesday, May 16, involving two 15-year-olds, is agonizing a neighborhood in Bastrop.  It’s sad. And they are putting a curfew at night. There is nothing too much going on at night. It’s in broad daylight. Wanda, Bastrop Resident  Deputies say they responded to the shooting on George Ave. around 3:45 p.m. According to authorities, one of the juveniles was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The juvenile has since been released. Residents say these shootings are getting out of hand.  I’m very concerned because it’s happening too much, too regularly. Parents have to be more accountable where their kids are at all times. This street is dangerous. David Morris, Bastrop Resident  It’s like no one cares for one another. One murder, then another murder, and after this and that. You know, it’s every week. Everyday thing. Derrick Richardson, Bastrop Resident  Meanwhile, Wanda says she’s building a fence around her house after two juveniles trespassed her property during an altercation a couple of weeks ago. She says the curfew needs to be increased.  I’m going to put wires up there so they can’t get over that fence and can’t even get in. Wanda, Bastrop Resident  Larry Henderson says he wants more police patrol.  It’s very concerning for me because, like I said, if they patrol like they are supposed to, they can be in some of these places when stuff happens. They can be close by, or whatever is happening. They can be right there and stop some of this. Larry Henderson, Bastrop Resident  The incident is still an ongoing investigation. Bastrop police confirmed that a suspect has not been identified at this time.  BASTROP, La. (KTVE/KARD)– On May 16, 2023, officials of the Bastrop Police Department began investigating a shooting that took place around 3:45 PM on Georgia Street near Clara Street.

Dan Taylor said on Monday, he discovered a bullet just feet from one of his windows.  ""It's 125 inches from the house on my driveway, when the night before I had family members for Mother's Day parked right here,"" Taylor told KSL-TV.  Taylor said it was only the latest concerning event on his property. Over the past three years, he said he has discovered as many as 10 bullet holes through sheds and elsewhere on his farm.  ""It's frustrating,"" he said.  Taylor said he believed the bullets and bullet holes were coming from target shooting just over the hill to the east of his property.  Neighbors acknowledged the area above the Payson dump is a popular spot for shooters.  ""It's got to be pretty much in a straight line, and they're just coming over that saddle and right to where we're at,"" Taylor said as he pointed at the saddle-shaped ridgeline.  Taylor reported the most recent case to police.  A spokesman for the Santaquin Police Department, which is tasked with patrolling the Genola area, said officers had been investigating issues related to errant target shooting over the past three years.  According to the spokesman, the department was also concerned about the potential safety issue posed by the errant shots and had urged the Bureau of Land Management to shut down target shooting in that specific area.  Efforts to reach BLM officials Tuesday evening did not immediately result in a response.  Numerous signs are visible in a target shooting area in Genola, warning prospective shooters that homes are on the other side of the ridge. (Photo: Jackson Grimm, KSL-TV)  Numerous signs were visible in the target shooting area, warning prospective shooters that homes are on the other side of the ridge.  Taylor wasn't the only neighbor to voice worries. Mike Olsen said he also had found several bullet holes on his property in recent years and displayed a bullet he found behind his wife's car next to his house.  ""It just seems like if you're standing out there, you're just a target,"" Olsen said. ""There's so many little kids around this town riding four-wheelers and their horses, and I'm just afraid one day, somebody's going to get killed by a stray bullet.""  While a KSL-TV crew was present, Taylor spoke to another neighbor who had a scary experience.  ""Ours came through the barn about 5 feet above my head when I was standing there,"" the woman told Taylor while on speakerphone.  Residents in Genola are concerned about nearby target shooting after a series of close calls, including bullet holes found on sheds and houses and rounds found near homes. (Photo: Jackson Grimm, KSL-TV)  Taylor said he has no problem with guns or shooting in general.  ""I was born with a gun in my hand,"" the former law enforcement officer-turned-farmer laughed.  He urged people to be careful, but he and Olsen both agreed the problem likely wouldn't go away until the area was shut down to target shooting.  ""It's scary,"" Taylor said. ""It's only a matter of time until a person gets hit, something of value gets hit. I've got a lot of equipment here. I've got a lot of livestock here, and it's only a matter of time until a person or something valuable is going to get hit. And who is going to be liable? There's no way of knowing who pulled the trigger over there a mile-and-a-half away, so they walk away and say it was an accident, so the only way to stop that from happening is to close it down for shooting completely.""  ×  Photos  Most recent Utah stories  Related topics Utah Utah County"

El Reno Police got the call around 3:30pm on Tuesday from Foreman near Shepard Avenue.  “He’s laying on the ground I do not think he’s breathing,” said the 911 caller.  “I thought, ‘Is that a gun going off?'” said Evelyn Ferguson, who lives nearby.

A Johnson County judge on Monday sentenced Anthony Duane Smith, 46, to four years and three months in prison for one felony count of involuntary manslaughter.  Smith pleaded guilty to the involuntary manslaughter charge earlier this year. He was also originally charged with second degree murder, but that was dismissed by prosecutors.  In March 2022, Sharell Holoman of Wichita was shot during a party at a home in the 9700 block of W. 145th Terr., which was being used as a short-term vacation rental at the time. She later died after being taken to a hospital.  The shooting prompted Overland Park to conduct a citywide survey of short-term rentals, which found the properties generated less than one half of one percent of all police calls in the city.

Nerilis Suarez has been teaching at Wythe for the past six years. She said this school year has been particularly challenging as it relates to safety.  “A lot of people do not feel safe at George Wythe, and my concern is how can students learn when they do not feel safe? How do staff members feel when they show up every day and they do not feel safe?"" Suarez said.  A survey completed in fall 2022 revealed that only 14% of teachers at Wythe felt safe at the school.  So, when two students were shot by another student in the school's parking lot on April 27, Suarez was unfortunately not shocked.  “Not surprised, no. Heartbroken to see it anyway? Yes,"" Suarez said.  According to an email that Richmond Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras sent to the school board, the student who was most seriously injured, Victor Sandoval, went to school the day of the shooting and walked out a door around 11 a.m.  That was an hour before he was shot in the parking lot.  Suarez said unmonitored doors with nonworking alarms and students who congregate in the parking lot unsupervised during school hours are not new issues and should have been corrected and enforced long ago.  “Could this have been avoided? I don't know. I can't go back in time, but something could have been in place to address the issues that we're having with the doors and the alarms on the doors. We cannot monitor 100 plus doors, even if they have alarms,"" Suarez said.  Back in October, a loaded gun was found on a Wythe student who police said had recently shot someone.  Suarez said that gun was recovered in her classroom.  An RPS spokesperson said they never confirmed how the gun got into the building, since Wythe has metal detectors. Students speculated it might've gotten in through a side door.  Then shortly after that incident, a photo started circulating that appeared to show a student holding a gun inside Wythe with a message that read in part: ""You better watch out for your friends.""  Richmond Police later said their investigation did not find a threat inside the school.  Those incidents marked just two of the other safety incidents taking place at Wythe this school year before the shooting occurred, yet Suarez believes the district did not follow up with an adequate security response.  ""From a loaded gun that was found, to the picture that was rolling around on social media with two students with guns, this is not an isolated incident. We have seen this escalating for a while now,"" Suarez said.  Suarez said over the past year, she has spoken publicly at school board meetings and written emails to RPS leaders to sound the alarm on security concerns.  For example, in September 2022, Suarez wrote an email to school leaders requesting more care and safety associates for Wythe, noting that metal detectors were not being used properly, and that the building was being left vulnerable due to a lack of staffing.  She also mentioned that students were roaming the halls unsupervised.  More recently and following the shooting, Suarez wrote another email to school board members and Kamras saying her attempts to bring attention to safety concerns at Wythe have ""fallen on deaf ears.""  ""We need solutions now! My opinion is that RPS doesn't know what to do with GWHS and our students are the innocent bystanders to this mismanagement,"" Suarez wrote in her email, which was dated May 10.  While Suarez said she's grateful that Wythe will be rebuilt in the coming years, if nothing changes, the new school will ""house the same issues.""  “I, for one, am tired of being ignored and the excuses, because these are serious, serious matters,"" Suarez told CBS 6.  CBS 6 requested an interview with Superintendent Jason Kamras Tuesday and Wednesday, but an RPS spokesperson said he was unavailable.  CBS 6 also asked the administration and School Board Chair Stephanie Rizzi for a response to Suarez's concerns and has not yet heard back.  School Board Representative Shonda Harris-Muhammed (6th District) told CBS 6 in a statement she was ""truly concerned"" to read Suarez's email.  ""It saddens me that one of our dedicated teachers out of many, is feeling this way,"" Harris-Muhammed wrote. ""I am just one of nine school board representatives who are deeply concerned with the safety and security of our students and their mental well-being... I have spoken to the culture and climate of our schools since January 2021. I will continue to bring the concerns to the forefront of the division's administration.""  Meanwhile, Suarez said she and other teachers are pushing for long-term solutions to security issues at Wythe, noting that she feels some of the immediate responses from RPS in the aftermath of the shooting are not sustainable.  For example, she said teachers are being asked to spend 45-minute planning shifts next to side doors so that they can monitor the exits.  ""We definitely need more staff. We need more care and safety associates, and we need a plan. We need a real plan in place to not just control the daily operation of safety, but also to address emergency situations,"" Suarez said. ""We want to see solutions now.""  When asked which safety measures RPS implemented back in October when the loaded gun was found and which measures were implemented following the shooting, spokesperson Matthew Stanely said:  ""New door alarms were installed and/or existing alarms are being checked regularly for proper functionality; Three additional Security officers have been added to the building; security continues to utilize metal detectors and bag checks at the main entry door; and assists with hall sweeps and door monitoring. Staff has been provided additional building radios for communication; the school also utilizes additional staff to monitor doors.""

She died just days before her birthday. The US has seen at least 191 mass shootings in the first 127 days of the year, bringing to the fore the issue of gun control — or a lack of — in the United States.  The rising mass shootings show a troubling trend in the United States where federal and state governments are struggling with gun violence. As shootings take place even in states with stricter gun laws, the lawmakers also wonder about the roots of such incidents.  Just two days ago, President Joe Biden pleaded for Congress to do more to curb gun violence as a wave of mass shootings across the US shows no sign of abating. “For God’s sake, do something,"" the president wrote in a column published Sunday in USA Today. “America doesn’t have to be a place where our children learn how to duck and cover from a shooter, or scan a movie theater or restaurant for their exit options.""  Here is a look look at some recent incidents:  On April 30, an Oklahoma sex offender shot his wife, her three children and their two friends in the head before he killed himself. The shooter had moved the victims’ bodies, which were found in a heavily wooded area on a rural Oklahoma property.  On April 28, a man shot and killed five of his neighbors, including a 9-year-old boy after they asked him to stop firing rounds in his yard because a baby was trying to sleep in Cleveland, Texas. The shooter was arrested after a multi-day manhunt.  On April 18, four people were killed in a home and three others were wounded by gunfire on a busy highway in a neighboring community in Bowdoin, Maine. A man who was released from prison a few days earlier is charged in the killings.  On April 15, four young people were killed and 32 others were wounded by gunfire at a girl’s 16th birthday party in Dadeville. Police arrested two teenagers and a 20-year-old man on murder charges.    On April 10, an employee shot and killed five people and wounded eight others inside the Old National Bank in Louisville. He was also livestreaming the attack. Police later shot and killed the gunman.    On March 27, three students and three adults were killed inside The Covenant School in Nashville. The suspect, a former student, was killed by police. There have been 15 mass shootings in US schools since 1999, killing 175 people, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. The actual number could be higher, as ‘mass shootings’ in this database are defined as more than four people dying, not including the perpetrator.    On January 23, a farmworker killed seven people in back-to-back shootings at two Northern California mushroom farms, authorities said.    On January 21, a 72-year-old man killed 11 people and wounded nine others in a shooting at a Lunar New Year dance in Monterey Park. The suspect later died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.  On January 16, six persons were killed in Goshen in California. The police said it was an assassination-style shooting and appeared gang-related.  On January 13, a man killed four people in Cleveland in Ohio state. He is under arrest.  (With inputs from AP)"

The National Police Association (NPA) and Tennessee-based private investigator Clata Brewer are suing city and county officials, demanding copies of Audrey Hale's writings, which were recovered from the killer's vehicle and home after the shooting.  A judge is expected to make a decision in June, according to the NPA. In addition to the manifesto, the NPA is also seeking copies of police communications related to the document.  The police group said The Covenant School is asking to protect floor plans of its facility and personnel information and that the NPA does not object. A judge has scheduled the next hearing for Thursday afternoon.  AUDREY HALE POLICE BODYCAMS RELEASED  The killer wrote a manifesto, kept journals and made hand-drawn maps and diagrams of the school, with possible entry points and illustrations that depicted a shooter wearing the same outfit that Hale wore on the day of the shooting, police said after responding officers killed the attacker.  Police previously released surveillance video that showed the heroics of responding police officers as they stormed the building and killed Hale in front of a second-story window, which is where the killer was shooting at police outside.  NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTER AUDREY HALE: WHO IS 28-YEAR-OLD TRANSGENDER FORMER STUDENT WHO OPENED FIRE AT SCHOOL  According to its website, The Covenant School opened in 2001 as part of the Covenant Presbyterian Church and served children from pre-K through sixth grade.  The child victims included the pastor's daughter, Hallie Scruggs, as well as Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney. Police identified the adults as 60-year-old Head of School Katherine Koonce; Cynthia Peak, 61; and Mike Hill, 61.  NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTING: OFFICERS WHO TOOK OUT COVENANT SHOOTER IDENTIFIED  Court records suggested Hale had no criminal history in Metro Nashville or Davidson County.  Investigators served a search warrant at Hale's home about three miles away from the church and school.  Hale was an artist who attended the Nossi College of Art and Design.  The killer was also recently seeing a doctor due to an emotional disorder and had legally purchased the seven guns from five stores leading up to the attack, police said.  Hale slept with journals on other school shootings under her bed in her parents' house. Police seized the journals and a trove of documents and electronic devices, court filings reveal. Hale also left behind a suicide note on a desk under one of several laptops police recovered near a list of passwords in the bedroom.  Hale's parents were unaware that the school shooter owned any guns after purportedly selling the single one they knew about, Chief John Drake said in March.  ""They were under the impression that when she sold the weapon, she did not own any more,"" he said. ""As it turned out, she was hiding several weapons inside the house.""  Armed with three guns, Hale arrived at the school around 10:15 a.m. on March 27, blasted out a side door and went on a rampage inside.  When Hale burst in, the first victim, Hill, sustained fatal gunshot wounds in the process. According to city officials, Koonce heard the first shots while on a Zoom call, hung up and confronted Hale. Police found her dead in the hallway outside her office.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Drake said investigators had not immediately determined a motive but believed that Hale, a former student, had targeted the school and its affiliated church.  By 10:30 a.m., responding officers fatally shot the killer on the second floor."

The officer — who is now retired — said he shot the man out of fear of being run over by the stolen car. However, the family claims officer-worn body camera footage shows a different story.  Yasir Fardan Jr., 26, of Springfield, has been charged with stealing a motor vehicle, failing to stop for police, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, driving with a suspended license and three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, according to court records.  The charges stem from an incident in which prosecutors accused Fardan of stealing a gray sedan and attempting to run down Springfield police on the morning of Nov. 16, 2022.  Fardan’s family has released the officer-involved body camera footage from the November shooting.  Part of the video can be viewed below:  According to a police report, Fardan was engaged in a city-wide high-speed chase with Springfield police officers responding to a call of a stolen vehicle.  Officers followed the reportedly stolen car to a driveway on Woodside Terrace. According to a Springfield police report, three officers then left their vehicles in an attempt to arrest Fardan.  As officers approached the vehicle, Fardan put the car in reverse in an effort to hit police, the report stated, adding that one of the officers had to quickly move out of the way to avoid being hit. The vehicle wound up striking a Springfield police cruiser, according to the police report.  After repeated attempts to arrest Fardan, and to prevent injury to officers or any bystanders, Springfield police officer Richard Ward fired multiple shots into the vehicle, with one hitting Fardan in his elbow, the report read.  The video shows Ward and another Springfield police officer firing several shots at Fardan in the gray sedan. Police can be seen pulling Fardan out of the car and placing him under arrest seconds after the shooting took place, seconds after Fardan kicked some of the windows out of the sedan while writhing in pain.  Authorities immediately gave Fardan first aid following the shooting.  Responding officers had their body-warn cameras off before the shooting occurred. Fardan’s attorney previously called the absent footage suspicious during a December dangerousness hearing in which a judge deemed Fardan not dangerous.  Community activist and spokesperson for the Fardan family, Charles Stokes, said they believe the footage shows the shooting was “unwarranted” and the officers were in no apparent danger.  “The shooting was a blatant disregard for public safety and therefore we call for [Ward’s] arrest for attempted murder,” the Fardan family wrote in a statement.  Ward retired from the Springfield Police Department in February after more than 20 years on the force.  The Hampden County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the use of deadly force, according to district attorney spokesperson James Leydon.  “The open criminal felony case involving Mr. Fardan and the theft of a motor vehicle is progressing in court. The use of force review remains under investigation and any public findings will occur once his criminal case has been resolved in order to protect the defendant’s rights during the court process,” Leydon wrote in a statement.  Hampden County prosecutors have waited nearly six months to bring Fardan’s charges to the superior court as officials review the incident.  During a May 11 court hearing, a district judge told state prosecutors that a six-month delay for an indictment is “excessive” and motioned to reduce Fardan’s bail to $2,500.  If he posts bail, he’ll also be confined to his mother’s residence, must stay away from drugs and be mandated to report to probation twice a week.  Fardan is due back in court on June 12 for a status hearing."

(WFIE) - Evansville Police say an officer-involved shooting occurred at Louisiana Street and Heidelbach Avenue on Wednesday.  It happened around 1:30 p.m.  Police say officers saw a felony suspect, later identified as 36-year-old Samuel Curry, driving around in the area. Officers say they waited for him to pull over at a Sunoco gas station before blocking him in.  According to an affidavit, police obtained a warrant for Curry after he made a series of violent threats to his parole supervisor, his estranged wife, police and others.  Police documents state Curry told the Evansville District Parole Supervisor, “I’m not playing, I’m [gonna] die today and shoot it out with them.”  Police say he also threatened to burn his apartment down if anyone approached him there, killing himself and others.  EPD officials say once officers arrived at the gas station, they began to give loud verbal commands to Curry to raise his hands and not move. Police say Curry yelled back at the officers that he was going to kill himself, which is when officers yelled again for Curry to show his hands and get out of the vehicle.  According to police, Curry leaned out the driver’s side window with a handgun. When officers noticed him pull the gun out, police say they fired shots at him but missed. The suspect then threw the handgun back at officers and quickly surrendered.  Evansville Police mental health officer Mario Reed says Curry was struggling with his mental health.  Typically, Reed says he works with local organizations when dealing with convicted felons who have mental health issues.  “We do a threat assessment,” Reed said. “If it meets this, we take that next step. If it stays at a certain level, then we work on making contact with that person, building a rapport and giving them the treatment that they need.”  Reed says the series of threats eliminated the possibility of starting a dialogue, as it became an issue of public safety.  “They asked him to just come to the parole office repeatedly, they’ve asked him to turn himself in, they’ve asked him to do all these things. The ball was in his court the whole time, and even until that point, he presented a firearm,” Reed said.  Reed says Curry had mental health resources offered to him through his parole, but he was not attending.  Curry was taken to the Vanderburgh County Jail. Reed says there will be mental health resources made available to him as he awaits court proceedings, including a medical evaluation.  Police say no officers or the suspect were hurt in the shooting.

The man was taken to the hospital, deputies said in a Tweet posted around 9:30 p.m.  It was a drive-by shooting, deputies believe at this time.  Several cars filed into Campus Drive and began honking their horns outside a home there, deputies say. That was when a 23-year-old man walked out of the house and was shot by occupants inside the vehicles, according to KCSO. The victim was subsequently taken to a hospital where he was listed in stable condition.  There were other people inside the house at the time but were not harmed. Authorities tell us a home next door was damaged in the shooting.  We're told reports were filed of cars driving recklessly nearby shortly before the shooting took place.  KCSO says two of the vehicles involved of the shooting were stolen and have since been located in the Grand Rapids area.  The shooting is not believed to be a random act of violence.

The victim, whose name was not released, was pronounced dead at UPMC Hamot on Tuesday at 8:24 p.m. following the shooting, which was reported at 7:50 p.m. inside the Quick Stop at 408 W. 18th St., according to Erie police and Erie County Coroner Lyell Cook. Investigators said the man appeared to have been shot in the chest and was found on the floor near the drink coolers when officers arrived at the store.  Officers administered life-saving efforts on the man until EmergyCare arrived and the man was transported to UPMC Hamot, Erie police Deputy Chief Rick Lorah said Wednesday.  Police cordoned off the store after the shooting and major crimes detectives began interviewing the large number of witnesses at the scene, Lorah said. Detectives also obtained surveillance video from inside the Quick Stop and from areas outside of the store, he said.  Police believe the victim was shot by a lone suspect. According to one witness, a male walked into the store, and the witness heard two pops, Lorah said.  The suspect was described as a male in his 20s, Lorah said.  An autopsy on the man is scheduled for Thursday at noon, according to the Erie County Coroner's Office.  If the man's death is ruled a homicide following the autopsy, it will be at least the fourth homicide in Erie so far this year.  The other homicides occurred:  On Jan. 15, when Noah King, 21, was fatally shot during a planned fight at Rodger Young Park. Charged in the shooting is Michael N. Ochrang, 25, who is awaiting trial on homicide and other charges.  On Jan. 23, when a 37-year-old woman was fatally shot at a residence in the 900 block of East 28th Street in what authorities said was a homicide-suicide.  On March 18, when Naim Jahace Bayete, 21, was fatally shot in the 800 block of East 21st Street. Charged in the shooting is Torrance A. Norris, 29, who is awaiting his preliminary hearing.  Another fatal shooting happened on Saturday night at a residence in the 1100 block of East 26th Street. Authorities said William Rickert, 24, was shot in the head when a gun one person was holding as a group was recording music fired. Erie police charged Graham C. Kelly II, 31, with involuntary manslaughter and other offenses in the incident.  Cook said Rickert died of a gunshot wound to the head, but he has not yet ruled on the manner of death.  More:Victim, suspect identified in fatal shooting during music recording session at Erie home  Earlier fatal shooting at Quick Stop  The Quick Stop was the scene of a fatal shooting about 2½ years ago. Erie resident Kyontia L. Blanks was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for killing Frederick Perry, 40, outside the store on Oct. 21, 2020.  Blanks, 26, was convicted at trial in January and sentenced to nine to 18 years in state prison in February.  Blanks shot Perry as the victim was getting out of his car in the front of the store at 5:35 p.m. Perry was unarmed.  The Erie County District Attorney's Office argued for first-degree murder or third-degree murder. The defense argued self-defense, claiming that Blanks was scared of Perry because Perry had threatened his life twice in the weeks leading up to the shooting in a dispute over a woman.  Killing from 2020:Judge emphasizes intent as shooter sentenced for slaying outside Erie convenience store  The prosecution relied heavily on surveillance video as evidence at trial. The video, taken from a camera outside the store, showed the slaying from start to finish.  Anyone with information that could assist Erie police in their investigation into Tuesday night's shooting, including anyone in the area of the store who might have surveillance video, is asked to call Erie police Detective Sgt. Patrick Ginkel at 814-870-1161 or Detective Jason Russell at 814-870-1112.  Photographer Greg Wohlford contributed to this story.  Contact Ed Palattella at epalattella@timesnews.com.

The accused gunman remains in a North Texas hospital declared incompetent to stand trial.  KHOU 11 News sat down with a group of survivors and family members who lost loved ones to hear how their lives have changed.  “My son is Aaron Kyle Mccleod – we lost him on May 18,” said Gayle McLeod, his mother.  “My daughter Kimberly was shot and killed in the school shooting,"" said Rhonda Hart, her mother.  ""My mother Cynthia was murdered that day,"" said Joe Tisdale, her son.  “I was the officer that was working at Santa Fe when the shooting happened and obviously was shot in my arm,"" said John Barnes, who survived the shooting.  “I was shot in the Santa Fe shooting,” said Flo Rice, who was a substitute teacher at Santa Fe High School. She was teaching basketball in the gym, when she heard the fire alarm.  Rice walked towards the exit with her students, not knowing she would be in the shooter’s path. Realizing she had been shot, Rice called her husband from the parking lot.  “Flo has a lot of PTSD, I've just a little bit,"" said Scot Rice, her husband. ""If you go back to the school for an event, or for anything, you know, it's like you relive it that moment.""  Watch the extended interview with family members of those who died and survivors of the shooting.  Since the shooting, the Rices have become advocates for school safety. They supported a bill Gov. Abbott signed to harden schools and better equip substitute teachers.  However, after Uvalde, the Texas House of Representatives Investigative Committee on the Robb Elementary School put out a report saying it hadn’t been enforced there.  “They stated the school said they would leave doors unlocked for the convenience of substitute teachers that did not have keys,"" said Flo.  It’s not just broken promises these Santa Fe families have dealt with, but also a fight to get information. There was no third-party report done on the shooting. Leaving many families in the dark about what actually happened to their loved ones inside the school.  “We saw them take their first breaths, and we knew their Apgar score and their weights and their measurements, but we're not allowed to know how they died,"" said Hart.  On May 18 she was a bus driver. Hart happened to see her daughter walking into school that morning, they waved “I love you” in sign language, their tradition. It was the last time she saw her daughter alive.  Hart and others pushed for a bill that would allow victims families to see certain evidence from the crime scene. It’s now headed to the Governor’s desk, but the years of fighting has weighed on them.  “It creates this animosity between victims and the system, whatever the system is, because it looks like they're trying to hide something,” said Barnes.  They all have little hope there will ever be a trial.  “It doesn’t feel like it,"" said McLeod.  ""I don't think so,"" said Tisdale.  For more than three years, the accused shooter been undergoing treatment at a North Texas hospital to restore his competency."

CBS2 got reaction Wednesday from the brother of the man who died.  ""It was a sigh of relief because we know how rare substantiated charges against officers are,"" Sammy Feliz said.  He said it was a measure of accountability, following the death of his brother.  In October 2019 during a tense traffic stop, driver Allan Feliz was Tased, and then shot as his vehicle jerked back and forth.  Then-Sgt. Jonathan Rivera, since promoted to lieutenant, fired one shot point blank into Allan Feliz's chest. Rivera claimed he was acting to protect two other officers from injury by the moving car.  Investigators later found Allan Feliz was on parole, with drugs in his pocket and traces of meth in his system.  A review by the attorney general cleared Rivera of possible criminal charges, but was critical of some of his actions.  On Wednesday, the Feliz family learned the Civilian Complaint Review Board is moving to terminate Rivera, ruling his use of force was improper, as was his threat of force early in the encounter, possibly escalating the tense situation.  ""As long as Rivera is NYPD, he is a threat to public safety,"" Sammy Feliz said.  ""We're not gonna start making the changes we really need unless there are real consequences, particularly when someone dies, when someone is killed,"" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.  The family was hoping for CCRB charges against the other cops involved in the traffic stop, but the agency did not file any.  The NYPD said Lt. Rivera remains on active duty, assigned to a Bronx auto-theft task force. His case will now go to the Administrative Prosecution Unit. Any decision on the CCRB move to fire him is likely years away.  CBS2 asked the NYPD for comment. It referred us back to the CCRB, which does not comment on pending disciplinary cases.  However, Lou Turco, president of the Lieutenants Benevolent Association, said in a statement his organization is ""outraged by CCRB's untimely and completely unjustified actions in this matter,"" adding, ""The New York State Attorney General's Office conducted a comprehensive investigation into this incident and determined that the firearms discharge was lawful and warranted no further action.  ""After an exhaustive investigation, the NYPD Force Investigation Division and thereafter the NYPD Firearms Discharge Review Board determined that the discharge was proper and within Department guidelines. The Police Commissioner approved those findings on August 9, 2021, and the matter was closed,"" Turco added. ""CCRB's motivation in bringing these administrative charges against Lt. Rivera is nothing more than shameless self-promotion and to make a media splash. The fact that CCRB has yet to even notify Lt. Rivera of their ostensible findings and that the media is the first to know about this, speaks volumes of their intent. The LBA will vigorously defend Lt. Rivera and we are confident Lt. Rivera will be cleared, just as every other investigation into this matter has concluded."""

Example video title will go here for this video  LOUISVILLE, Ky. — New court documents reveal the Louisville gunman who committed the mass shooting at Old National Bank on April 10 planned the attack in advance.  Connor Sturgeon, 25, opened fire on a conference room of employees at the bank on April 10. He was killed by Louisville Metro Police Officer Cory Galloway following a brief shootout with police.  Five people were killed and several others were injured, including an LMPD officer who continues to recover after being shot in the head during the shootout.  According to newly released search warrants, once Sturgeon was killed, Officer Galloway found a phone sticking out of the gunman's front shirt pocket.  Officers noticed the shooter had live-streamed the mass shooting on Instagram Live.  LMPD took the phone and issued search warrants to Apple, AT&T, Google and Snapchat for any data that would help determine a motive.  The documents also revealed he had a ""note or manifesto"" inside his home, which suggested his mental health issues may have played a part in his decision to commit the mass shooting.  ""What jumps out at me is that this investigation is a little bit more expansive,"" attorney Karl Price said. ""[The manifesto] is a key finding but the manifesto may not be released, as rapidly as some of this other information that's released.""  Price has been practicing law for more than 30 years and is a former prosecutor in Louisville. He is not involved in this case.  ""What stuck out to me, in this case, was the word 'targets.' To law enforcement, that means that we've got our eye, potentially, on someone else,"" Price said. ""It raises an eyebrow that something or somebody's got to them and influence.""  Price said this is typical of investigations into mass shooters.  ""Now, that doesn't mean that law enforcement knows who that someone else is,"" Price said. ""What it could mean is that it is entirely possible since they're pursuing all of his social media accounts.""  The documents reveal detectives found ""messages and notes"" detailing plans to commit the mass shooting on the gunman's phone.  The warrants also reference an interview with Sturgeon's family where they said he had attempted to commit suicide around the same time last year.  Sturgeon's family believes his mental health may have played a role in the shooting, and the family has asked the state medical examiner to look into whether or not past concussions contributed to it as well.  The impact of his mental health issues was mentioned in the ""note or manifesto"" at his Camp Taylor home, which police searched hours after the shooting. The manifesto was not included in the search warrants, or elaborated on further, other than confirming it exists.

The shooting happened on the evening of Saturday, March 25, 2023, at Melody Market on Foster Rd.  Manuel Reyes Rios, 19, died at the scene.  Surveillance video from the market, released by the sheriff's office on Wednesday, shows the moments before and after the shooting.  It shows a few people going in and out of the market before a gray car pulls up. Three people exit and go into the market. One of them was Rios.  A dark-colored pickup truck then pulls in and a man, identified as Santa Maria Police Officer Antonio Peña, enters the market, followed by a woman who had just pulled up in a white SUV. Peña was off-duty at the time.  Then, Rios, who is wearing a red hoodie, walks out of the market and is approached by two other men in the parking lot. He is followed out of the market by another man in a yellow shirt, who confronts the two men, who are wearing gray hoodies.  The driver of the gray car backs up, and as one of the two men starts to throw a punch at the man in yellow, the driver lunges forward, hitting the two men in gray.  That's when Rios can be seen pulling out a gun and apparently firing shots toward the two men. Sheriff's officials say one of them was struck by the gunfire.  In the meantime, Officer Peña has returned to his vehicle.  At this point, it's difficult to see what happens because Rios runs behind Peña's truck.  According to the sheriff's office, Peña drew his gun and police badge, identified himself as an officer, and ordered Rios to stop shooting and surrender.  Officials say Rios again shot toward the other two men, and Peña fired his weapon at Rios.  The video then shows Officer Peña calling for emergency services on his cell phone and ushering uninvolved bystanders into the market.  Deputies arrived in about three minutes.  Rios was pronounced dead at the scene and the coroner's investigation reportedly determined that he died of multiple gunshot wounds.  Sheriff's officials say the other people involved in the altercation fled the scene.

Officers responded to an affordable living facility for Seniors where 65-year-old Yia Xiong was allegedly threatening people with a knife. Those officers ultimately shot and killed Xiong.  Community members are calling for justice and said the response could have ended differently.  “In a case like that, if a crisis worker were to respond to that situation, they would have a conversation with the individual if he was not making an immediate threat to harm himself,” said Pa Der Vang, a former Ramsey County crisis worker.  Vang believes having a crisis worker who speaks Hmong would have made a difference. Community members argue a lack of de-escalation training and language barriers caused Xiong’s death.  “I found out later that in addition to that, one of his ears was hard of hearing,” said Snowdon Herr, the founder of the Justice for Yia Xiong movement.  “He looked like he was retreating into his apartment, trying to close his door, and the police officers did not let him close his door. I don’t understand that. Why would they not let him leave the situation?” Vang questioned.  St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry said in a press conference in February that it appears the tactics are consistent with what they do.  On Tuesday, the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office announced that the Attorney General will join them in reviewing the findings from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) investigation findings into the St. Paul shooting death of Yia Xiong.  Herr said it’s welcome news and that there have been petitions seeking help from the Attorney General to look into the case.  In addition to the attorney general, the Ramsey County Attorney’s office says a use of force expert will be helping with the review.  There’s no timeframe for when the review will be completed.

The Rush County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest Wednesday after the false allegation that a student had brought a gun to school was spread on social media.  “The allegation, which had no foundation in reality, caused great concern for parents, students and our community,” the sheriff’s office said.  The threat was immediately investigated by both school personnel and law enforcement, RCSO said.  “Through this intensive process, it was clearly determined that this rumor was just plain false,” RCSO said.  As the rumor spread on social media, the sheriff’s office said that there was widespread concern throughout the community resulting in mass absences at local schools. Rushville Consolidated High School had nearly 50% of students absent on Tuesday while Benjamin Rush Middle School had 54% of its student body not present.  Additionally, RCSO said that the student whose name was used in the rumor and their family were “subjected to harassment in various forms” and that police were forced to search their property. Yet, the sheriff’s office said they remained cooperative throughout the investigation.  RCSO said that the Rush County School Corporation also cooperated entirely and that there are very specific policies to ensure the safety of both the victim of the allegation and the student body as a whole.  “The safety of our community and our schools is of the utmost importance,” Sheriff Alan Rice said. “False rumors of a school shooting are not only irresponsible, but they are also illegal. We will not tolerate this kind of behavior.”  In a release sent Wednesday, RCSO said that they will not be identifying the student who was arrested due to them being a minor. However, Sheriff Rice confirmed that the student has been criminally charged for their actions."

(WOWT) - The Council Bluffs man who turned himself in following a four-day manhunt exchanged gunfire with the man killed in the shooting, according to details shared in Washington County Court on Wednesday.  New details revealed in the court hearing detailed the events leading up to the shooting death of 34-year-old Jordan Ely on Friday.  Washington County Attorney M. Scott Vander Schaaf said Wednesday that 22-year-old Elijah Logan entered the home near Blair High School by force and confronted the mother of his child. Her brother, Ely, then appeared at the stairs and was shot numerous times in his body and head, resulting in his death.  He said Logan also shot the woman at least twice in her legs. Authorities said she was holding the infant at the time, but the child was not harmed.  Elijah Logan (Douglas County Sheriff's Office)  Logan then fled the scene and was on the run for four days as authorities shared information with the public to aid in his capture. He turned himself in Monday.  Vander Schaaf said after Wednesday’s hearing that he couldn’t share further circumstances or details of the crime — including a possible motive — since he did not want to have any issues as they proceed with the case.  “It is unfortunate that we get reminders that senseless violence can happen at any point and time and in any community as it did ours,” Vander Schaaf said.  He also offered his condolences to the victims, whom he said were trying to stay clear of reports on the crime in order to “take this time to heal and try to understand if there is any understanding why these things happen.”  School officials deemed classes optional on the day of the shooting as the investigation continued at a nearby residence.  Police Chief Joseph Lager said Blair has always been a safe community, but “domestic violence knows no boundaries. Anything can happen anywhere, but it has been taken care of. The process will work itself out — however it works out. Blair will continue to be a safe community. ""  Lager and Vander Schaaf credited law enforcement agencies from multiple agencies for the investigation and arrest.  In addition to first-degree murder, Logan is facing assault, firearms, burglary, and child-abuse charges. He was also in Pottawattamie County court last week for a domestic violence strangulation charge.  Logan was denied bond Wednesday and was advised he could incur the death penalty. Vander Schaaf has not yet made a determination on whether the seek the death penalty in this case.  Copyright 2023 WOWT. All rights reserved."

The shooting, which happened in September, happened amid an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the Phoenix Police Department over claims that there is a pattern of officers violating residents' constitutional rights, including engaging in discriminatory policing and using excessive force.  Here's what you should know about the case.  What happened?  The shooting happened in the area of 19th and Glendale Avenues on September 24, 2022.  According to Phoenix Police statements at the time, officers were leaving the scene of an unrelated incident when their cars were allegedly struck by ‘unknown items causing damage.’  The officers later returned to the intersection, where they found the suspect, since identified as Ali Osman.  Body-camera footage showed Osman throwing rocks at the officers, who told him to stop before they opened fire.  ""Turned in the parking lot, heard four shots - pow pow pow pow,"" said Ron Dawlatzai, who was in the area when the shooting happened.  Osman later died from his injuries at the hospital. No officers were hurt.  Did police release body camera video of the shooting?  Yes.  Police released body camera video of the incident in October 2022.  (Click here to watch. The video may be disturbing for some due to use of foul language and graphic imagery. Viewer discretion is advised)  In one portion of the video, officers were seen telling Osman to drop the rock before Osman apparently made a throwing motion, and that was when an officer fired on Osman.  After the shooting, Osman was seen moving on the ground, and officers were heard telling Osman to stay down on the ground. Officers were later seen providing medical aid to Osman, and requested additional help from the fire department.  Who were the officers involved?  The officers were identified by Phoenix Police as a two-year veteran and a two-and-a-half-year veteran of the department.  The officers are still on the Phoenix Police force.  Why is MCAO not charging the officers?  During a news conference on May 17, Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said her officer will not press criminal charges against the two officers listed above.  ""The question in this case was whether the officers were justified to shoot under Arizona law,"" said County Attorney Mitchell. ""These laws say that a person is legally justified in using deadly force when that person believes that it is necessary to defend themselves or a third person from the use of deadly physical force.""  County Attorney Mitchell said the rocks Osman threw posed a serious threat to other people and the responding officers, and her office does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for conviction.  ""These rocks could easily have caused a crash, gone through the window of a vehicle, or caused serious physical injury or even death, if they struck an officer or bystander,"" said County Attorney Mitchell. ""The officers took swift action to deal with the danger that his actions posed to the safety of the community.""  In response, the attorney for Osman's family, Quacy Smith, said he is disappointed in County Attorney Mitchell's decision.  ""She, single-handedly, is the judge, jury and executioner,"" said Smith. ""There have been four people that made a decision that the taking of Ali Osman's life did not warrant criminal charges. Four people: the two officers that shot, the chief that has done nothing, and the county attorney that has done nothing.""  Have Osman's family members talked about the shooting?  Yes.  Osman, according to family members, was from Tucson, and was visiting family in Phoenix on the night of the incident.  ""We need justice for Ali,"" said Osman's sister, Halima Osman, after the shooting. ""What the officer tells me and what I see on the news is not much. When the officer called me, he told me Ali was shot in the chest.""  ""It's taken a lot from me,"" said close friend Loay Alyousfi. ""You're taking a brother from me, which hurts a lot, so I just hope he gets justice.""  Family members said Osman had no criminal history, and suffered from bipolar disorder, for which he was being treated.  ""It's just wrong what they did. They keep telling us different stories. It just doesn’t add up,"" said Osman's niece, Ikram Aden. ""We didn’t even receive an apology from them. They try to make it seem like he was in the wrong, but I know that my uncle isn’t that type of person.""  Is Osman's family suing?  On October 14, 2022, we obtained documents that show an $85 million Notice of Claim being filed by the family.  According to the Notice of Claim, members of Osman's family are accusing Phoenix Police of Excessive Force in violation of the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Violation of Equal Protection fo the law under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Wrongful Death, Excessive Force, Battery, and negligence.  ""If this offer is ignored or rejected, Claimants have authorized us to pursue legal action and seek the maximum recovery permitted by law, including an award for punitive damages,"" read a portion of the Notice of Claim.

(Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News)  Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes  OGDEN — An Ogden man has been sentenced to four years of probation after pleading guilty and mentally ill in a 2022 accidental shooting that led to the death of a 14-year-old boy.  Zedekiah Mendel Pool, 19, pleaded guilty and mentally ill to manslaughter, a second-degree felony, in January as part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to a term of one to 15 years in the Utah State Prison, but that term was suspended if his probation is successfully completed.  Pool is also required to finish serving 363 days in jail, 354 of which were already completed as of April 25.  On May 5, 2022, police were called to 468 River Drive in Ogden following the report of a gunshot wound. They discovered that 14-year-old Richard Michael ""Mikey"" Mendenhall Jr. had been accidentally shot in the neck.  A GoFundMe account* says Mikey died before paramedics could reach him. ""They brought him back using CPR, but at the time Mikey had already had lack of oxygen for 20 minutes. Mikey was brain dead,"" it states. He died three days later at a hospital.  ""Mikey ended up donating his liver, heart, and kidneys to other children in need,"" the account says.  The post also explains that Mikey was at a friend's house when Pool, ""a newly moved-in roommate,"" brought out the gun.  Police believe Pool was moving the slide on a handgun when the weapon fired in the living room, with the bullet hitting the boy. They do not believe Pool meant to aim at the teen.  ""Follow-up investigation has determined that defendant had consumed marijuana less than five hours prior to the shooting and used and possessed his firearm while he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance,"" court documents state.  In exchange for Pool's plea, charges of possessing equipment for a clandestine laboratory, a second-degree felony, and possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person, a third-degree felony, were dismissed.  *KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

And now the receptionist who attempted to check the shooter in is sharing her story through social media.  [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]  23-year-old Lutha Matundu said she hasn’t been back to work since the shooting on May 3 and explained what happened that day.  “He was super late for his appointment, but his mom was with him advocating that they really need to be seen. I was trying to see what I could do to get them seen. But ultimately the doctor said that’s when they couldn’t see him,” said Matundu.  Matundu said that’s when he snapped.  “That’s when he snapped. I don’t know if he heard me tell his mom that they couldn’t be seen or if he was planning this already but he started spraying us at the front desk with bullets,” said Matundu on her tiktok account. “I hit the floor, hid for my life. I heard him fire off about eight to nine rounds of bullets.”  Now, we are getting more details on how Deion Patterson was captured. Cobb County Police said a license plate reader alerted them to the fact that the car the suspect was driving was in their jurisdiction.  “I can guarantee you this, time was not our friend. It was getting dark and the sun was going down when we located this individual,” said Cobb County Police Chief Stuart VanHoozer.  Cobb County Police then relied on their Connect Cobb system, where they’re able to live stream video from private and government cameras into their Real Time Crime Center.  TRENDING STORIES:  It’s where they spotted the suspect and received a key 911 call.  “One of the civilians in this room recognized a 911 call that looked significantly different as far as location and description and she thought this was the person and we prioritized that call,” said VanHoozer.  Moments later Patterson was in custody.  For Lutha, what happened that day changed her life.  “I saw things that I will never forget for the rest of my life and I definitely have trauma from it,” she said.  Lutha is now advocating for the victims, asking for support while they recover. GoFundMe accounts have been created for Jazzmin Daniel and Alesha Hollinger.  Cobb County is now encouraging anyone with a camera at their house or business to join Connect Cobb and integrate their cameras, helping them catch violent criminals.

Siler did it early in the morning in the school cafeteria, where students gathered before class. He did it in front of dozens of horrified students and teachers and school security officers. That act of violence lives on in the memories of the Central High School community.  It was probably one of the first things state Rep. Gloria Johnson thought about this spring when she heard there’d been a mass shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School just a few miles down the road from the Capitol. Johnson was a special education teacher at Central before she ran for office, and she knew Ryan McDonald, a funny, friendly, troubled adolescent who’d already experienced way too many hard times. In addition to a constellation of other problems, Ryan suffered from alopecia, a condition that left him bald and made him a target of abuse. Neither he nor Siler was being raised by their parents.  Johnson’s classroom was in a flat-top down the hill from the main building, and she was preparing for the day ahead when a wave of hysterical, horrified students came pelting down the hill looking for safety. She has shared her memories of that terrible morning many times over the years, and although I’ve never heard her say it in so many words, I strongly suspect that losing a student to gun violence was one of the factors that nudged her to run for office.  Rising country music star Kelsea Ballerini was there, too. She was Ryan’s classmate, although they didn’t know each other, which is not unusual in a big school like Central. They were both sophomores, and she was there in the cafeteria when he died. She has included a poem about it in her new book of poetry Feel Your Way Through.  It’s titled, “His Name Was Ryan,” and here’s an excerpt:  “His name was Ryan, and he died on the cafeteria floor  From a gunshot wound to the chest  I can’t be too sure, but I think I saw him  Take his last breath  We were both 15  That day, we went from strangers to lifelong friends  I think about him often, who he could have been …”  I’ve thought about him often, too, and have written a lot about this shooting, including some angry reporting on the boorish behavior of certain elected officials like the one who blurted out Ryan’s name on the radio before his family had been informed that he had died. I’m not kidding. That’s how some of his family members were informed of his death – by a stranger on the car radio while they were racing to the UT Medical Center to find out what was happening. Over the next few days I had several conversations with Ryan’s uncle, Roger McDonald, a thoughtful, well-spoken man who worked for UT and was active in the campus workers’ union. His grace left a lasting impression on me.  Another lasting impression came a few weeks later when I covered a transfer hearing in juvenile court, where Judge Tim Irwin ruled that the shooter, Jamar Siler, would be tried as an adult. I heard quite a lot about Jamar’s horrific childhood in that courtroom and remember Irwin saying that our system had failed this boy at every turn. Jamar was still an infant when he was removed from his birth family, placed in foster care and eventually adopted. He had no choice in the matter, and he showed no emotion in the courtroom.  Later, I would read that his adopted sister was also facing a murder charge and was on the lam when Jamar fired that gun.  His court-appointed lawyer had attempted to mount a defense based on a presumption that Jamar suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome but couldn’t persuade the state to foot the bill to fly the one recognized expert in fetal alcohol syndrome-related crime to Knoxville from the west coast to testify. Running out of options and facing the prospect of a first-degree murder conviction carrying a mandatory life sentence if Jamar were found guilty (there were dozens of eyewitnesses), his lawyer recommended that he take the plea deal that the state had offered – plead guilty to second degree murder and get a 30-year sentence. Siler later appealed the verdict, claiming ineffective counsel.  I looked up Jamar Siler in the Tennessee Department of Corrections felony offender register. He turned 30 last month at Trousdale Turner Detention Center, which means that he has now spent half his life behind bars. He has 11 more to go before his September 20, 2034, release date. He is apparently not eligible for parole.  Something I saw at Jamar’s transfer hearing has haunted me all these years since. Two older teenagers, both of mixed-race and both astonishingly beautiful, sat in the courtroom a couple of rows behind me. They were clearly siblings, and the young woman was struggling to keep her composure while her brother attempted to console her. He put his arm around her shoulders and sat stony-faced while the judge indicted the foster care system. I looked at Jamar, sitting impassively next to his lawyer. I looked back at the young couple.  After it was over, the young woman ducked into the restroom to compose herself. The young man waited for her out in the hall. I took a deep breath and approached him.  “Jamar’s your little brother, right?”  He nodded.  I told him how sorry I was, and repeated Judge Irwin’s observation:  “He never had a chance.”  He nodded in agreement. It felt wrong to intrude, so I wished them well and left them alone.  Later, though, I did some checking and discovered that the two of them had been adopted by a family who loved them and raised them both. I checked out the family Facebook page and found happy milestones memorialized. Normal stuff – little kid accomplishments, high school athletics and proms, college. Pride. Love. Family.  Jamar had no such luck.  In the end, Ryan McDonald paid the ultimate price and Jamar Siler forfeited his freedom, such as it was. It took Central High School years to recover.  And although Tennessee’s foster care system may have reached the crisis point over the past year, with no legislative fixes on the horizon (guess they’re too busy pursuing drag queens and pronouns and whoring for gun lobby money in Nashville to bother with trivial matters like how to recruit good foster parents for children in state custody), it’s been broken for a long, long time.  And it’s kids who pay the price.  Betty Bean writes a Thursday opinion column for KnoxTNToday.com."

A “professional, calm, safe arrest,” Cobb County police said Tuesday.  Technology helped officers find Deion Patterson, 24, who was charged with murder and aggravated assault. He remained Tuesday in the Fulton County jail, held without bond.  “The integration of cameras allowed us to send officers to a very particular place,” Capt. Darin Hull said Tuesday.  In a video released Tuesday afternoon, Patterson was shown in a grassy area with several officers shouting commands.  “Keep your hands up!” one officer said.  “Put your hands on the ground in front of you!” another said.  Moments later, Patterson was in custody, ending a day-long search that spanned two counties.  “This is the best example of community policing,” Cobb police Chief Stuart VanHoozer said.  Investigators have said cameras were crucial in locating and arresting the man accused of shooting to death Amy St. Pierre, 38, and injuring four others on May 3 in Midtown. On Tuesday, Cobb police reiterated the importance of citizens and businesses registering their cameras. At the same time, VanHoozer said his agency strives to be transparent and values the privacy of citizens.  “It is very tough to watch things happen and not be able to find the perp or stop the perpetrator. It’s a burden that we carry,” he said. “And we are looking into the technology and we do it out of concern for innocent people who are victimized. And that will never change because when the police forget that the safety of our citizens is our primary job, we are not community policing. And we are not loving our community like we really do.”  VanHoozer said the technology helps with “precision policing” so that officers know they have the right suspect in a case.  Police have said a combination of security cameras and license plate readers helped track the movements of Patterson after he allegedly “commandeered” a pickup truck and left the city. In Cobb, the Connect Cobb program allows citizens and businesses to register their cameras so that if a crime occurs in the area, those cameras may have valuable evidence.  The search for Patterson shifted to Cobb around 2 p.m. the day of the shootings, and the truck he is accused of stealing was found in a parking garage along Heritage Court near The Battery Atlanta. Tracking the suspect’s movements and having a general idea of where Patterson was greatly aided in that process, the chief said.  The shooting, at the Northside Medical Midtown building, happened inside the Laureate Medical Group shortly after noon.  Investigators believe a patient, later identified as Patterson, shot the women before leading officers on a massive manhunt. Patterson was arrested eight hours later in Cobb County  The shooting injured Lisa Glynn, Georgette Whitlow, Jazzmin Daniel and Alesha Hollinger, who range in age from 25 to 71. According to police, Glynn was shot in the abdomen, Whitlow was shot in the arm, Daniel was hit multiple times in the abdomen area and Hollinger was shot in the face. The four have since been released from Grady Memorial Hospital.  A veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, Patterson was discharged in January. His mother, who has declined to speak with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has said Patterson was having a “mental break” and wanted to be prescribed the anxiety medication Ativan. But his Veterans Affairs medical team declined to give it to him, fearing he could become addicted, according to reporting from The Associated Press.  But even with the technological advances, it still takes trained officers to make the arrests, VanHoozer said Tuesday.  “Technology is nothing without people,” he said. “In the end, it takes police officers with a gun and a badge and a bullet-proof vest to go take these individuals into custody.”  ———  ©2023 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

San Diego police have arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of murder in connection with a fatal shooting at the Campland on the Bay RV Resort in Pacific Beach late Tuesday.  Police were called to the park on Pacific Beach Drive near Olney Street shortly after 10 p.m. after several people called 911 to report a shooting. When officers arrived they found a 49-year-old man in the pool area suffering from a gunshot wound to his chest, said police Lt. Steve Shebloski.  Officers performed life-saving measures until paramedics arrived. The man was taken to a local hospital, where he died a short time later.  Advertisement  Shebloski said the victim was at the pool with a small group of friends when an argument broke out between the victim and another man, who left briefly and then returned to the pool area with a handgun.  The man “ultimately confronted the victim and shot him at least one time in the chest,” the lieutenant said in a written statement. The gunman left the pool area, but police located a suspect a short time later in a motorhome at the park.  Michael Callahan of San Diego was arrested, and a handgun believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered in a Campland laundry room. Shebloski said the gun was hidden in a dryer after someone placed it there for safekeeping until police arrived.  Callahan was being held without bail in county jail, according to online records.  The name of the man who was killed was not released pending notification of family members.  Shebloski said it does not appear that the suspect and the victim knew each other before meeting by chance at the pool shortly before the shooting.  San Diego police asked anyone with information about the shooting to call homicide detectives at (619) 531-2293 or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477."

Dustin Passarelli  A jury in Marion County Superior Court returned a guilty verdict Wednesday for the murder charge filed against 37-year-old Dustin E. Passarelli of Plainfield. Passarelli’s sentencing hearing is now scheduled for 2 p.m. on June 21.  The charge against Passarelli stems from the February 2019 shooting death of 32-year-old Mustafa Ayoubi at an apartment complex on the northwest side of Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the shooting stemmed from a road rage incident.  The road rage incident  IMPD said the initial road rage incident started around 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 16, 2019, on Interstate 465 near 38th Street.  IMPD said Passarelli told homicide detectives that Ayoubi threw something at or hit his car, so Passarelli followed him home.  Passarelli said he then followed Ayoubi’s car onto W. 38th Street; they circled McDonald’s twice before stopping at Wind Drift Drive East. He told investigators he “wanted to get the [insurance] info from the driver in case there was damage” to his car.  Friends of Ayoubi told police they were waiting for him to come home so they could play some pool. When he arrived, they heard arguing and saw Ayoubi standing by the side of a vehicle.  Multiple witnesses said the driver, identified as Passarelli, was “cussing at Mr. Ayoubi and using religious and ethnic insults like,’ Go back to your country’,” and “Muhammed was a pedophile,” according to court documents.  However, Passarelli offered a different account. He said Ayoubi made an anti-Semitic remark, prompting him to hurl back insults in return.  Ayoubi’s friends said that they tried to diffuse the situation but Passarelli was undeterred. They also said Passarelli told them they’d “better take [Ayoubi] inside or something’s gonna happen.”  “At some point during the argument, Passarelli threatened to shoot Ayoubi,” court docs read.  The shooting  Passarelli told IMPD that Ayoubi then came over to his car and made a fist “as if he was about to punch Passarelli’s driver’s side window.” Around this time, Passarelli fired his gun.  “In response, Passarelli drew his Glock 19 9mm semiautomatic handgun and shot multiple times through his vehicle’s window glass, striking Ayoubi in the shoulder and then several times in the back as he was running away.” Court documents filed against Dustin E. Passarelli  As three of Ayoubi’s friends ran back inside the apartment to call 911, court docs show Passarelli moved his car, called 911 and began to give Ayoubi CPR.  IMPD officers were called to the 3900 block of Wind Drift Drive E. just after 8 p.m. for a person shot and found Ayoubi lying in the parking lot; he was pronounced dead just before 8:40 p.m.  “An autopsy revealed that Ayoubi had been shot once in the shoulder from the front and seven times in the back,” court docs show.  Witnesses said Passarelli shined a laser light in Ayoubi’s face before shooting at him, court documents show. Ayoubi was found to be unarmed at the time of the shooting.  While investigating, IMPD found “no damage whatsoever” to Passarelli’s car despite his claiming that Ayoubi had tried to damage it multiple times. Officers did, however, find that one of his car windows had been shattered by gunfire.  Additionally, Passarelli’s handgun was found to have nine live rounds in the cartridge and IMPD said officers found seven spent cartridge shells inside his car.  Aftermath  Passarelli was arrested by IMPD and charged with murder on Feb. 21, five days after the shooting and the same day of Ayoubi’s funeral.  A jury trial was initially scheduled for May 2020 but was met with multiple delays, some caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and appeals.  One such appeal, filed in 2022, claimed that PTSD that Passarelli developed during his time in the Army, was a contributing factor in his response to the road rage incident and was partially to blame for the shooting.  However, in 2023, Passarelli’s mental evaluation and PTSD claims were deemed to be inadmissible in court.  The jury trial against Passarelli eventually began on Monday, May 15. The trial jury began deliberations around 2 p.m. Wednesday and returned a guilty verdict that same day.  Passarelli was ordered to remain in custody until his sentencing hearing on June 21. He was also convicted of the Felony Firearm Enhancement, which according to Marion Co. Prosecutor Ryan Mears can enhance a sentence by 5-20 years.  “We are pleased to finally bring justice to Mustafa Ayoubi, his family, and the Hoosier Muslim community who have been impacted by this tragedy,” Mears said Thursday. “The prosecutor’s office will continue to advocate on behalf of victims and combat hate in our community.”  Community response  Mustafa Ayoubi  The murder of Ayoubi sparked renewed debate over hate crime legislation in Indiana due to the ethnic undertones and racially charged nature of the shooting.  At the time, the Council on American Islamic Relations asked police to investigate Ayoubi’s death as a hate crime. Additionally, the FBI said it was looking into whether this is a federal civil rights violation case, although no federal charges were ever filed.  “We are asking Indiana, our home, to provide us the protection we deserve,” Mustafa’s sister Zahra Ayoubi said in 2019.  Ayoubi’s death came at a time when Indiana legislators were debating a new hate crime law that was never passed. However, lawmakers passed a bias crimes bill in 2019 that allows judges to impose longer sentences for crimes motivated by bias.  Across the city, vigils were held for Ayoubi with both the Indianapolis Muslim community and the city at large showing support for his family.  “We want Mustafa’s story to serve as a warning to all the bigots, all the people filled with hate, that we will not be brushed to the side,” Mustafa’s brother Mohammad Khalid Ayoubi said at one such vigil."

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]  The shooter has not been identified or caught.  Newell learned there could be multiple suspects.  TRENDING STORIES:  “We don’t know where the shooter is at. They left. There’s possibly more than one suspect, but they’ve left and we don’t know where they’ve gone since then,” Eric Mistretta with Acworth Police said. “There was a report of another disturbance prior, before this one. We’re unsure if it’s connected or not. That’s one thing that detectives are following up, trying to determine if those two incidents are linked together.”  Police are reviewing surveillance video from security cameras hoping to get something on the suspects. Detectives removed the front door, which was littered with bullet holes, and other evidence from the home. They also towed Shaw’s car away.  Newell spoke to Shaw’s neighbor, John Pena, who said police had just moved into the apartment above him a few months ago.  “He’s a young kid,” Pena said. “Very respectful.”  George Campbell said he heard four or five gunshots and knew something was wrong, but had no idea it was his neighbor.  “He’s dead. Oh my God, I’m really upset about that,” Campbell said. “Really thinking about moving. Can’t take this kind of stuff at my age.”  Shaw’s mother, Ashley Senger, posted about the death of her oldest child on Facebook, writing:  “I’d give anything to have traded places with him last night when he was shot to death. He was 19. He will never have married. Had children. Bought his first home... I love you and will never stop loving you, until I take my last breath.”  Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Acworth Police Department at 770-974-1232.

Demonstrators demand SF DA to reconsider decision not to charge Walgreens guard in shooting  SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Demonstrations continued to rally Wednesday against the San Francisco district attorney's decision not to file criminal charges against the Walgreens security guard involved in the deadly shooting of a suspected shoplifter.  Demonstrators want the DA to reconsider her decision, and want the state attorney general and United States Department of Justice to independently review the case.  Some demonstrators say the system failed Banko Brown and they say the 24-year-old, a Black trans youth, didn't deserve to die because of suspected shoplifting.

Just over an hour later that night, the shootout caught on video at 21st and Union broke out. It is not known if the incidents were related.  The Central District shootings were part of a deadly weekend of gun violence around the city including a homicide at Alki Beach and another Friday night downtown.

A 14-year-old from Suitland and a 15-year-old from Temple Hills are charged as adults with attempted first- and second-degree murder, assault and related counts, according to police. Police said they are still seeking a third person, who is also believed to be a juvenile.  The incident occurred on May 1 just before 5 p.m., when officers responded to a reported assault on a school bus that had stopped to drop off students at Iverson Street and Sutler Drive in the Oxon Hill area, police said.  While the bus was stopped, three people boarded and attacked a boy who remained on the bus, police said. One of the attackers had a handgun and attempted to shoot the boy multiple times, but the weapon malfunctioned, according to police. Police found ammunition from the bus.  Advertisement  The victim suffered minor injuries, and a bus driver and a bus aide were uninjured, police said.  At the time of the incident, a Prince George’s County Public Schools spokesperson said in an email that “our highest priority is keeping students, staff and families safe” and that the school district was working with law enforcement.  The union that represents Prince George’s school bus drivers are calling for more security on buses and at depots, with fights and incidents with weapons leaving drivers concerned, according to the union president.

A can of beer, a semi-automatic pistol and a dune buggy were factors in a deadly confrontation in Florida on Friday.  A Florida man allegedly threw a beer can as a dune buggy passed him, then fatally shot the driver after a confrontation, according to court records.  The alleged shooter, Wallace Mannin Kirkland, 59, of Sorrento, Florida, was standing on the side of a road with his wife and their neighbor when another man drove by in a dune buggy, according to an arrest affidavit. Kirkland “either attempted to or did throw a beer can” over the vehicle as it passed, leading to a confrontation between the driver and Kirkland.  Wallace Mannin Kirkland was released on a $40,000 bond. Lake County Sheriff's Office  “I’m going to kill you,” the driver allegedly told Kirkland after exiting his vehicle, according to the affidavit.  When the two men were within four feet of each other, Kirkland allegedly shot the man in the chest with a Ruger semi-automatic pistol, prompting the victim to say “he couldn't believe” Wallace Kirkland shot him, according to the affidavit.  Witnesses to the incident told authorities they could not see any weapons in the victim's hand, and the affidavit noted that the victim was both “outnumbered and physically smaller” than Kirkland and his neighbor.  According to court records, the victim attempted to return to his vehicle and drive away, but he lost consciousness. He later died at a nearby hospital in Eustis, Florida.  “Based on multiple interviews with witnesses, it appeared that Mr. Kirkland and [the victim] had several verbal altercations in the past,” according to the arrest affidavit.  Kirkland was arrested around midnight on May 13 and charged with manslaughter and aggravated battery. He briefly held on a $40,000 bail.  A Lake County Sheriff’s Office representative confirmed that Kirkland was released on bond and was still permitted to carry a firearm until he is convicted.  Kirkland is scheduled to be arraigned on June 5."

First term board member Gabrielle Hanson was the subject of 64 citizen complaints about her remarks on the March 27 Covenant School shooting, the potential placing of markers to lynching victims in Franklin, the upcoming Franklin Pride event, a Franklin church and allegedly disparaging comments about Franklin Mayor Ken Moore.  “Virtually all of the complaints are related to comments regarding the Covenant School shooting. That’s a thread that runs through all of them,” said Jim Martin, commission chair. “The overriding question is when you look at the provisions of the Franklin Municipal Code, which we started with, assuming all the complaints are accurate and factual, do they state a colorable claim that the conduct of Ms. Hanson violates any provision of the code?”  “You may be offended by what she said or you may agree with what she said, but the issue is has what she has said or done a violation of the code?” said Martin.  In April, Hanson appeared on the conservative podcast, “Mill Creek View,” to discuss the March 27 Covenant School shooting in which three children and three adults were killed. Hanson claimed the shooter’s motive was due to a romantic relationship involving shooter Audrey Hale that went awry.  “I felt an active shooter coming,” Hanson claimed on the podcast. “Within 30 minutes of that shooting, I had the whole story. It was a love triangle going on.”  Days after the podcast Hanson was a guest on a 99.7 WTN podcast hosted by Matt Murphy and defended her claims. Murphy called Hanson’s words inaccurate and “devoid of reality.”  Jason Rowlett, a father of a Covenant School student, demanded Hanson’s resignation during the May 9 Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting.  “I’m joined here tonight by other Covenant parents to ask for the resignation of Alderman Gabrielle Hanson,” Rowlett said. “If she will not resign, we ask for her removal. Hanson publicly slandered the victims. She has caused further pain and anguish to surviving staff and families.”  During Wedmesday’s hearing, commission member and former Franklin Mayor Jerry Sharber referred to the First Amendment’s freedom of speech clause.  “I’m troubled by the fact that Alderman Hanson has the right to speak what she wants to say, these complainants have the same right to disagree,” said Sharber. “I don’t see anything that violates the rules, the ordinance of the city of Franklin.”  The commission voted unanimously to dismiss the complaints against Hanson.

Her cellphone had been stolen, she wrote, but she promised to see him in the next few days with a gift in time for his birthday.  About a week later, Faith Leighanne Rose Asbury was the only victim still breathing when paramedics entered an RV on a dirt lot in Mojave where four people had been shot. The 20-year-old was rushed to Antelope Valley Hospital, where she died the next day.  Asbury and the others — Martina Barraza Jr., 33; Darius Travon Canada, 31; and Anna Marie Hester, 34 — had eked out an existence for years on the fringes of society in the Mojave Desert. Their killings have gone relatively unremarked, lost in the noise of a deadly wave of American gun violence.  “We’re going to keep demanding justice for her,” said a sister of Martina Barraza Jr., 33. (Courtesy of Barraza’s family)  The Kern County Sheriff’s Office has released few details about the April 30 quadruple homicide; no arrests have been made, and there is no description of a suspect or suspects. The victims’ relatives said they’ve been given no updates on the status of the case, and they believe it’s because those killed were homeless and had a history of drug abuse.  “They were still people. No matter how they lived their lives, what they did, they’re still people,” said Canada’s mother, Jeanette Benson.  Days after the shooting, a neighbor showed Denardo text messages Asbury had sent to a friend the night she was killed. Asbury was scared and locked herself in the RV bathroom because someone had burst in with a gun, she wrote. Two other people were in the RV with the four victims, according to the message thread, but they left after the gunman arrived.  In the texts, Asbury pleaded for help and then said her goodbyes to the friend before she stopped responding, Denardo said.  Advertisement  He was upset that his daughter didn’t call the police and that the friend didn’t show him the messages sooner. He believes the gunman accused the victims of stealing a cellphone.  “Four people killed over a damn phone,” Denardo said.  California 4 victims identified, but mystery still surrounds Mojave Desert mass shooting days later After more than two days, Kern County investigators have released very little information about the killing of four people in an RV in Mojave, the nation’s 185th mass shooting of 2023.  When asked about the text messages or whether a stolen phone was connected to the killings, the Sheriff’s Office said that a motive had not been determined and that it would not comment about evidence in an ongoing investigation. Authorities encouraged anyone with information to contact homicide investigators and would not say whether investigators had seen Asbury’s text messages when The Times inquired about them.  “Kern County Sheriff’s Office understands that families have lost loved ones,” the agency said in a statement. “Drug use, homelessness, or any other factor does not play a role in the duty and service” the Sheriff’s Office has to investigate the homicides.  The Sheriff’s Office said it is still pursuing leads and processing evidence.  “This investigation involves 4 separate homicides that each require extensive investigation. Providing information that is factual is priority for us,” the statement said.  Advertisement  During a Wednesday news briefing, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood reassured the Mojave community that the victims shot in the RV were killed in an isolated incident and that there was no threat to the greater public.  “Obviously, from the lifestyle of the residence — we found some drug paraphernalia — this has the implications of a drug house, and bad things happen at places like this,” he said.  A father’s loss hits in waves  The RV where four people were shot to death last month in Mojave sat on a dirt lot on H Street. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)  Faith Leighanne Rose Asbury lived with her father in California City, about 14 miles from the RV where she was shot.  There was a time when all they had was each other, Denardo said about his daughter.  Her mother used drugs while she was pregnant, he said, and he was granted custody of his daughter when she was a baby.  He raised her the best a single father could, Denardo said, but she had a difficult life. Asbury was sentenced to several months in juvenile hall for stealing a car, and she was the victim of sex trafficking when she was a teenager, Denardo said. She spent time in a rehabilitation facility in Kern County and wanted to be an advocate for other trafficking survivors.  “She was a jerk sometimes, but she didn’t have a mean spirit,” Denardo said.  Advertisement  Denardo said he was not allowed to see his daughter when she was in the hospital, though he doesn’t know if it would have made a difference.  “They didn’t let me see her while she was still breathing. I still haven’t seen her,” Denardo said more than a week after the shooting. “They said that they all got shot in the head. I can’t even give my kid an open casket.”  Rudy Arroyo, president of True Memories Car Club, washes a car at a fundraiser for the Mojave shooting victims in Lancaster. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)  Authorities said only that the victims were shot in the upper part of their bodies. It would have been the hospital’s decision to bar Denardo from the room where his daughter was being treated, said Kern County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Lori Meza.  The Sheriff’s Office “only assumes the responsibility to seal off the room once the victim is deceased. Without being too graphic, the body becomes evidence of her own homicide,” Meza said.  To Denardo, the harsh reality of his daughter’s death sometimes hits all at once, turning on and off like the flip of a switch.  He can’t bring himself to stay at home. One night he woke in a panic and started to knock on her bedroom door. He called her name and tried to get her to come to the door just one more time.  Grieving a couple gunned down together  When Anna Marie Hester met Darius Canada in Apple Valley over 15 years ago, she didn’t immediately like him, according to his family, but his charms won her over.  She had a young son from a previous relationship whom Canada raised as his own child, and the couple went on to have two more sons.  Advertisement  Family members console Rhonda Canada as she speaks about her brother, Darius Canada, who was killed in Mojave on April 30. (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)  Two weeks after the shooting, their 12-year-old and 6-year-old sons clung to their grandmother Jeanette Benson in her South Los Angeles apartment. Her worries about her grandsons, about her son, have piled up, making it difficult to sleep. Lately, she agonizes over what she doesn’t know.  On the night of the shooting, she saw a familiar RV on her television as she watched news reports about four people killed in Mojave. It looked like the place where her son lived, but she couldn’t be sure.  “Everyone who came into contact with them loved them,” Benson said as her voice broke.  Hester wasn’t close to her own family, but Benson treated her like a daughter. Hester would often call on a video chat, holding the phone up to whoever was in the room.  Darius Canada was killed along with his partner, Anna Marie Hester. (Canada family)  “She was my baby,” Benson said with a laugh. “My Anna banana Hannah Montana.”  Canada and Hester were together for about 15 years and well-known by locals in the tiny desert community of Mojave. Rhonda Canada remembers people greeting her brother by name as she took him to the store to buy him some food.  Canada and Hester would find work through odd jobs in the community, Chris Canada said about his brother and his partner.  “They didn’t just sit around. They didn’t hurt anyone,” Chris Canada said.  “None of us know why people do what they do, why they’re homeless or why they’re on drugs,” Rhonda Canada said.  Jeanette Benson, second left, is surrounded by family at her apartment in South Los Angeles. (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)  Advertisement  As the immense grief of losing their loved ones weighs on the Canada family, the lack of response from Kern County authorities feels especially painful, they said.  The family said they received only one phone call from officials, when an employee with the coroner’s office confirmed Canada’s and Hester’s deaths.  Sheriff’s officials said investigators have contacted relatives of each victim or taken statements.  Rhonda Canada said she doesn’t know how to talk about her brother’s death with his children because the family has received so little information.  “They’re going to have questions that we can’t even answer,” she said. “We don’t know what to do, what to say.”  A family searching for help  For the second time since Martina Barraza Jr.’s death, her eight sisters held a car wash to raise funds for her funeral.  Advertisement  One of Barraza’s five children, Annya Morelli, 16, held a sign with her mother’s picture above her head on Sierra Highway in Lancaster. She stood next to her 11-year-old sister, Natalie, among the crowd, their T-shirts emblazoned with Barraza’s face.  Annya Morelli, in the white top, stands with relatives at a fundraiser car wash in Lancaster for her mother, Martina Barraza Jr., one of the four Mojave shooting victims. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)  Many relatives of the four shooting victims said they tried for years to help their loved ones break out of the cycle of drug abuse. Annya understood that she needed to leave California for a better life away from her mother, but she always thought about her.  “My plan was always to come back when I was older to get my mom and my siblings,” Annya said. “To give them something more. Something better.”  Annya spoke to her mother in a video call the day she was killed. Barraza was visiting her mother, Cecilia Gomez, who was taking care of Barraza’s 4-year-old daughter.  Annya didn’t speak to her mother regularly, and she didn’t know when she would see her again. She wished her a happy Mother’s Day even though it was more than a week away.  Advertisement  “She told me she loved me,” Annya said. “She was a very strong girl, and she held it all on her 10 toes.”  Annya Morelli, 16, has her mother’s name tattooed on her forearm. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)  Barraza was loud, the life of the party. Annya said her mother told bad jokes and refused to not laugh at her own puns.  After Barraza’s death, her sisters are wondering whether their family will be eligible for victim assistance services through the county or the state.  That is still unclear because the investigation is ongoing, Kern County Assistant Dist. Atty. Joseph Kinzel said.  The district attorney’s office will offer help to the families, but Kinzel could not say whether his office had reached out to a list of relatives provided by The Times.  During the reporting of this story, a representative from the California Victim Compensation Board contacted Canada’s and Barraza’s relatives to determine whether they are eligible to receive funds from the state, which will hinge on the findings of the homicide investigation and whether they meet the state’s standards for victims. Benson said her family would try to relay information to Hester’s family, and Denardo did not reply to questions about whether he had received a follow-up call.  Kern County Supervisor Zack Scrivner, who represents Mojave, did not respond to requests for comment about the killings.  Advertisement  California Man killed in Marina del Rey road rage shooting came to California with a dream A 25-year-old Jordanian man was fatally shot Monday in Marina del Rey in what police have described as a road rage killing. A suspect in the case has not been identified or arrested.  “We’re going to keep demanding justice for her,” Barraza’s sister Vanesa Sandoval said. “We have to constantly speak about what happened so they’re not forgotten.”  Another sister, Glenda Gaxiola, said the county coroner’s office called her several days after the killing. By then, the family already knew Barraza was one of the victims, but the official wanted to know if Gaxiola could describe any of Barraza’s tattoos.  Barraza had all eight of her sisters’ names on her arm. She also had her mother’s name tattooed.  The coroner’s official described a tattoo at the back of Barraza’s neck: the name Cecilia.  “That’s my mom’s name,” Gaxiola said. “That broke us right down, because it was our names. I said, ‘That’s us.’”  After the shootings, Annya also got a name tattooed on her forearm: her mother’s name, Martina, surrounded by a flock of doves."

At a quiet and brief sentencing Wednesday morning in Hennepin County District Court, Daniel Lamar Johnny Adams of Minneapolis was sentenced to 15 years for the 2018 shooting of Jordan Deangelo Washington. Adams wasn't arrested until last year and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last week. A co-defendant received the same punishment in 2021 while another suspect remains at-large.  Adams, 24, and two friends accused Washington, 19, of shortchanging them marijuana. They went to a Richfield apartment complex where they planned to rob Washington, and court records accuse Adams of shooting Washington inside a vehicle May 17.  Washington's mother, Christina Day, said at Adams' sentencing that her son died a few days later when the family took him off life support. The last time she saw her son alive was Mother's Day, just a few days before the shooting.  ""It should be a joyful occasion, but it's not,"" she said of the holiday.  She moved to Oregon because it was too painful passing by the apartment. Some relatives still live in the area, including Washington's sister Joël Washington, who appeared hesitant at first to give a victim impact statement.  But Day leaned over and whispered to her, ""That's your baby,"" so his sister stood up and approached the judge.  ""A lot of people have done wrong and let me start off by saying this: That was my baby. And just from his one mistake, a lot of lives were ruined,"" she said. ""I'm gonna pray for everybody involved because I know they need it, even the accused.""  She said that she doesn't think Adams ""ever had the support he needed,"" and she turned to look directly at him after saying she hopes everyone learns from this.  When District Judge Michael Burns gave Adams the chance to speak, he said ""No, I'm fine.""  Burns said that Joël Washington summarized his feelings best about this case.  ""Not only did Jordan lose his life, there are also other individuals whose lives, the family, that are all going to be affected by this forever,"" Burns said.  The judge noted there has been a lot of news coverage about juvenile crime. At the same time, he noted, there are ongoing discussions at the State Capitol about guns and marijuana.  ""I'm not making any political statement, but we have in this case guns, the marijuana and the teenagers all coming together, and you end up with this particular tragic incident,"" Burns said.  Silas McDougal and Tyjahreek Brown, both now 24 but 19 at the time of the shooting, are charged with aiding the murder. McDougal pleaded guilty in 2019 and received a 15-year sentence in April 2021. Law enforcement has not yet found Brown.  Adams will be required to serve 10 years in prison before going on five years of supervised release, provided he abides by conditions that include not possessing any guns or ammunition.  Burns said the anniversary of the crime falling on Adam's sentencing date is not lost on him.  ""I can't imagine what it's like for the family to, on every May 17, be thinking of something like this,"" he said.  Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement that she hopes the sentencing brings some degree of closure to the family.  ""The message today is clear: If you commit acts of gun violence in Hennepin County and inflict deep pain on our communities, we will hold you accountable, no matter how long it takes."""

According to the Mansfield Police Department, officers were dispatched to 3 Arabian Court shortly before 11 p.m.  Police said when officers arrived, they determined that the incident began as a domestic dispute during which the husband argued with his wife and proceeded to assault her.  The husband then went and grabbed his gun and went into his 13-year-old son’s bedroom and shot him while he was sleeping, police said. He then went into his 21-year-old stepdaughter’s bedroom and shot her.  Police said the man's wife was able to escape the home and his stepdaughter called 911.  According to police, both victims were transported to Medical City Arlington by Mansfield paramedics. Both victims have undergone surgery and are currently listed in serious but stable condition, police said.  NBC 5 News, Mansfield Police Thomas Boykin, pictured, was arrested on May 17, 2023, and accused of three charges of aggravated assault against a family member.

He was charged with three counts of aggravated assault/family violence involving serious bodily injury. It's not clear if Boykin has obtained an attorney to speak on his behalf.  Boykin is an eighth-grade science teacher at Linda Jobe Middle School in the Mansfield Independent School District, administrators confirmed in a statement to NBC 5. Boykin is currently on leave and the superintendent is moving forward with his termination, pending the school board's approval.  ""Mansfield ISD does not condone this type of behavior in our schools or community. Our thoughts and support are with the victims,"" the district said.

She left the party immediately and sprung into action as Dr. Kim, the trauma director at Medical City McKinney.  In the 20 minutes it took to arrive at the hospital, she called together a team of trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists and other medical professionals to take care of seven injured victims.  ""Once I arrived, you know, I could really see that the training and the drills that we had done in our trauma center to provide good care for our patients was very apparent,"" Kim said.  Amid the chaos of the afternoon, she said, was a bright spot, a moment of calm to bring her back to Earth — a smile from one of her patients, Irvin Walker. The 46-year-old had bullet fragments lodged throughout his upper body.  Kim, Walker and the other medical professionals who have been caring for the Allen shooting victims spoke out for the first time Tuesday about patient recovery in the wake of the tragedy that also left eight victims and the shooter dead.  Walker said he was trying to find a parking spot at the mall when gunman Mauricio Garcia began shooting through his car window. Walker was shot three times — twice in his chest and once in his shoulder.  Garcia was later killed on the scene by police.  Walker remains recovering at Medical City McKinney more than a week after the May 6 shooting.  ""The power of God just showed brightly and gave me an opportunity to fight through this process, and evil is not going to win,"" Walker said Tuesday.  Walker remembers getting out of his car after being shot and running to get help as he bled profusely. Medical City McKinney staff said Walker was the first victim of the shooting to arrive at the emergency room.  ""The extent of soft tissue damage that he had was pretty extreme. We had to clean those out, eventually we were able to close those wounds back up,"" Kim said. ""He's doing much better than when he first arrived, but he still has a long road to go for a recovery.""  If the bullets in Walker's chest were any closer to his heart, she said, he could have died.  Despite his injuries, Walker was able to address reporters, thanking hospital staff for guiding his recovery.  “I'm just grateful,” Walker said. “Grateful to be here, grateful to see my daughter again and to see my supportive team.""  Cassidi Summers, chief nursing officer for the hospital, said she was at the mall less than an hour before the shooting took place. She even walked on the same path the shooter had taken.  Summers and her family had just arrived at home when she got the notification the shooting had taken place.  Like Kim, she immediately got to work, treating victims alongside more than 100 other health care workers.  ""I am incredibly proud of this team that demonstrated under stress an emotional situation,"" Summers said. ""And, more importantly, I am honored to be sitting here with Mr. Walker today under much, much happier circumstances.""  Got a tip? Email Toluwani Osibamowo at tosibamowo@kera.org.

City of Miami Police officers responded to reports of shots fired in the area of Southwest 28th Street and 13th Street, at around 9 p.m., Tuesday.  When units arrived, they found two men suffering from apparent gunshot wounds.  Speaking through a translator, area resident Tania Pineda said she heard about six to seven gunshots. Her Ring camera didn’t capture the shooting, but pleas for help could be heard.  “I’ve been shot! Come help me!” the victim was heard saying.  Pineda said the people who were shot were not her neighbors but people who were visiting them.  When she stepped outside, Pineda said, first responders were performing CPR on the victims in an attempt to keep them alive.  Pineda said her neighbors never cause issues, so this came as a shock to her and her children.  On Wednesday morning, the neighborhood remained an active scene as K-9 units searched for evidence such as bullet casings, and crime scene investigation vans were also in the vicinity.  Technicians focused their attention on a red Nissan Altima that had bullet holes on the side door and back window. After the sun rose, a black vehicle was also seen with bullet holes.  The fire department was seen washing away the bloody sidewalk.  Another area resident who identified himself as Alberto said he was scared because he has never heard a shooting so close to home.  According to investigators, paramedics transported the victims were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where one of them was pronounced dead and the other remains in critical condition.  Police identified the deceased victim as 18-year-old Vincent Celani and said the surviving victim is 23 years old.  “At this time, our detectives are still working to determine the motive. It’s unclear if the victims that were shot at were intended targets or if it was a random shooting. We do hope that the surviving victim recovers very soon so our detectives can get an interview statement from him to verify exactly what happened,” said Miami Police Officer Kiara Delva.  Police have not provided a description of the shooter. More information will be available as detectives continue to gather more details of the incident.

Sources told Winne that Deion Patterson, 24, had a ghost gun without a serial number which makes it virtually untraceable.  Channel 2 Action News has spent the past year looking into ghost guns and the problems they can pose for police.  [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]  Without a serial number, ghost guns can be difficult for police to trace where it came from and if it has been used in other crimes.  One source told Winne that the gun Patterson had with him when he was arrested in Cobb County appeared to have been made of parts that could be purchased online, including a polymer frame that requires more parts and assembly to be a functional gun.  Channel 2 Action News has not been able to confirm if this gun was the one used to shoot five people in Midtown Atlanta earlier this month.  A spokesman for the Georgia Public Defender Council sent a statement that read, “Mr. Patterson’s attorney Shawn Hoover said Patterson legally possessed every gun found at the time of his arrest.”  Winne asked defense attorney and former prosecutor Manny Arora, who is not involved in the Patterson case, if it is legal to own a ghost gun.  RELATED STORIES:  “The law is very unclear on it. But for the most part, no, it is not illegal to have it,” Arora explained. “The rules for ghost guns, which are generally untraceable, were changed back in April of last year, in 2022, and it primarily applies just to sellers and retailers. They have to now start putting serial numbers on these things because the number of ghost guns used in violent crimes is going up.”  Police say Patterson opened fire in the waiting room of a Northside Hospital medical office.  He is being charged with the murder of 38-year-old Amy St. Pierre and shooting four other women, Lisa Glynn, Georgette Whitlow, Jazzmin Daniel and Alesha Hollinger, who range in age from 25 to 71. All four women have been released from the hospital.  “Mr. Patterson is a veteran who appears to suffer from mental health issues. He is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and Mr. Hoover and his team continue to investigate the details of the charges while preparing a zealous and effective defense,” the Public Defender Council spokesperson said in an email.

Illinois State Police are investigating a deadly shooting that happened on Tuesday, and a shooting with injuries Wednesday morning.  In light of those incidents, CBS 2 wanted to know how the multimillion-dollar camera and license plate reader network is helping with those investigations. CBS 2's Tara Molina brought those questions to state police Wednesday.  We have had 42 shootings on Cook County expressways so far this year. How many of those investigations do state police have led to an arrest?  Only five.  A crime scene blocked off the Eisenhower at Cicero early Tuesday. One person was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries following a shooting.  That latest shooting happened around 5:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police had the road back open by 7 a.m.  This was the second shooting at virtually the same site in less than 24 hours. Just feet away, investigators had the same stretch of road blocked off after a shooting just after 11:45 a.m. Tuesday.  In that incident, a man was killed and a woman got herself to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries in a shooting.  ""It's very scary,"" said AJ Johnson, whose mother lives nearby.  As to any leads on a shooter, whether the two shootings were connected, or whether the shooter was believed to be on the expressway or a residential road nearby, state police would not answer those questions. They said there is an ongoing investigation.  But state police did address a few other questions – including some about how hundreds of license plate readers - unblinking eyes on our expressways - are helping them respond to, investigate, and solve crimes like the two we've seen in 24 hours on the Ike:  ""At this time, 319 ALPRs have been installed in the Chicago area. Approximately $20 million is also appropriated for additional ALPRs in 22 counties, which includes Cook and surrounding counties. The ALPRs are part of a multifaceted approach to combating expressway violence. ISP uses a combination of technology, air assets, forensic science, and an increased uniformed presence to combat expressway violence. Since ALPRs have been installed, we've seen a decrease in the number of overall shooting, including the number of injury shootings and homicides, along with an increase in traffic stops, arrests, guns recovered, and recovered vehicles.""  Meanwhile, state police also provided a breakdown of expressway shooting statistics and clearance rates.  State police said the number of expressway shootings so far this year are down 43 percent compared with the same timeframe last year, and 49 percent compared with 2021. Shootings with injuries are also down, state police said.  In 2022, state police said, there were 140 shootings reported on Chicago area expressways. As of Wednesday, charges had been brought in 24 cases, and 52 have been closed.  State police emphasized that investigations span months and even years depending on the complexities of each case. To that point, charges were filed in 11 cases from past years in 2022, state police said.  In 2023, as of Wednesday, charges had been brought in five cases, and three had been closed. One homicide and one attempted homicide had been charged.  State police pointed out that this figure includes shootings that happened just a few days ago – and again emphasized that investigations can span months and years. Charges have been filed this year in six shootings that happened in previous years – including one homicide, state police said.  One arrest in an expressway shooting was made on Wednesday. Alton Mills, 54, of Evergreen Park was charged with three counts of attempted murder in a shooting on the northbound entrance ramp to Interstate 57 from 147th Street in south suburban Posen.  Multiple shots were fired from one vehicle toward another in that incident – leaving a back-seat passenger in the second car with life-threatening injuries, state police said.  State police added that they have worked to reduce violence by increasing firearm enforcement efforts – which includes grants to local police agencies.  State Police are still investigating the deadly shooting on the Eisenhower on Tuesday, and the shooting there on Wednesday morning."

Detectives served a search warrant at a home Monday evening, and additional evidence uncovered in the investigation led to the arrest of 18-year-old Jose Lopez and 19-year-old Aden Arviso, police said.  Lopez is facing two counts of first-degree murder and one count of disorderly conduct with a weapon, while Arviso is facing charges of false reporting and disorderly conduct with a weapon, according to police.  It’s not yet clear whether Lopez and Arviso have attorneys.  The two victims were identified by police as Ande Blackthunder, 20, and Danny Garcia, 19. They were both transported to the Yuma Regional Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead, police said.  A 16-year-old who was first transported to the Yuma hospital was later flown to a Phoenix-area hospital with life-threatening injuries, police said. The injuries of the remaining gunshot victims – aged 15, 16, 18 and 19 – were not life-threatening, authorities said.  Several off-duty officers who happened to be in the area also responded to the shooting, police said.  The shooting marked the 33rd mass shooting of May 2023, and is one of 226 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. CNN and the GVA define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people were either injured or killed, excluding the shooter.  “Our detectives have been working tirelessly since the shooting,” Yuma police said in the statement. “At this time, the investigators are trying to determine a motive. However, this does not appear to be a random act. We have investigative leads that our detectives are looking into.”  The party was held at a private residence and the attendees knew each other, but the homeowners were not present at the time, police said, adding the owners had cooperated with the investigation.  “Several weapons were recovered at the scene and are awaiting forensics testing,” Yuma Police Sgt. Lori Franklin said in the statement.  CNN has reached out to the Yuma Police Department for additional information."

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  San Francisco's district attorney is facing a fierce backlash after declining to press charges this week against the Walgreens drug store security guard who shot and killed a man who was shoplifting from the store. From KQED in San Francisco, Marisa Lagos has our story.  MARISA LAGOS, BYLINE: The April 27 killing of Banko Brown by security guard Michael Anthony immediately sparked outrage in San Francisco, a city where brazen shoplifting has become a political flashpoint amid a fentanyl crisis and a widening chasm between the wealthy and impoverished. Video released Monday by prosecutors shows Brown, a Black transgender man who was homeless, being confronted by Anthony as Brown tries to leave the store with stolen goods. Security video footage shows a nearly minute-long struggle during which Anthony, who's also Black, has Brown in a headlock and lays on top of him. Anthony eventually lets him go. But as Brown is leaving, he turns around on the threshold of the doorway and gestures toward Anthony. At that point, Anthony shoots Brown once. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital.  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  JOHN BURRIS: Outrageous, unconscionable act of violence on the part of the security officer. The facts from the video do not support the use of deadly force.  LAGOS: That's attorney John Burris, a civil rights lawyer representing Brown's family. He and other critics say Banko was not a threat and that the video shows Anthony, the security guard, as the aggressor. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, though, says the video, which has no audio, isn't the only relevant evidence.  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  BROOKE JENKINS: And that is why we must listen to the security guard's statement, the witness statements and everything else in order to look at the full picture of the incident.  LAGOS: Jenkins says she didn't believe prosecutors could prove a case against the security guard in court. Anthony told investigators that during the altercation, Brown said he had a knife and threatened to stab Anthony, though no weapon was found. And witnesses reported Brown spitting at Anthony and lunging back toward him as the shot was fired. Here's DA Jenkins.  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  JENKINS: And at this time, there is nothing to rebut his statements regarding the fact that he acted in self-defense.  LAGOS: Jenkins has been under pressure to release the video and other evidence in the case for weeks ever since announcing on May 1 that her office wouldn't charge Anthony. Following outcry, she reversed course and said charges were still under consideration. On Monday, she released a slew of evidence, including the security video, as she declined to file charges again. Instead of quelling criticism, though, that evidence seems to have raised more questions. County Supervisor Aaron Peskin is asking state and federal officials to investigate Brown's shooting.  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  AARON PESKIN: This is not who we are. Stealing a bag of candy does not warrant what is, in essence, the death penalty. I don't think that the district attorney's behavior in this case is making San Francisco safer.  LAGOS: Jenkins was already a divisive figure in San Francisco. She was appointed DA by San Francisco's mayor after helping lead a heated recall campaign to oust her progressive predecessor. That campaign helped shaped a national narrative of San Francisco as a city where crime and open-air drug use are out of control. And Jenkins has received criticism in recent months for dismissing charges against police officers involved in on-duty shootings. But as San Francisco struggles to figure out how to rein in shoplifting, the repercussions of Brown's death could reach far beyond this case. Members of the transgender community here continue to express anger. Honey Mahogany, chair of the local Democratic Party, notes trans people are far more likely to be impoverished and homeless.  HONEY MAHOGANY: The reality is that this could have been any number of people. Every one of us has had a low point. And to think that, you know, in that moment of vulnerability and in that moment of trying to survive, that you could be shot dead.  LAGOS: For now, protests continue. And Burris, the Brown family attorney, plans to file suit against the security firm that employed Anthony and Walgreens. For NPR News, I'm Marisa Lagos in San Francisco.

Hayward police said the suspect -- Vaughn Boatner -- should be considered armed and dangerous.  vaughn-boatner hayward-police  According to investigators, officers responded at about 2:00 p.m. on May 11th to the 100 block of Cassia Dr after receiving multiple 911 calls about gunshots in the area.  Upon arrival, they located two adult victims inside a residence, suffering from gunshot wounds. Medical personnel responded, and both victims were transported to a local medical facility for treatment. A five-year-old child was also inside the residence and was found unharmed.  The first victim, 30-year-old Monique Aldridge of Hayward, was pronounced deceased at the hospital. The second victim, a 28-year-old-male of Oakland, is still hospitalized and is in critical but stable condition. His name is not being released at this time.  Investigators said they believe Aldridge and the second victim were in a dating relationship and lived together at the time of the shooting.  During the initial hours of the investigation, information was received that led police to identify Boatner as the prime suspect in the case. It was also learned that the five-year-old boy at the scene was Aldridge's and Boatner's child.  An arrest warrant for Boatner and search warrant for his residence were authored and approved. Boatner was not located inside the residence and is considered at-large. It is believed Boatner has access to various vehicles, and it is still being determined what mode of transportation he currently utilizes.

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday said officials must ""act urgently"" to combat crime in the nation's capital after a 17-year-old was fatally shot in a high school parking lot while class was still in session, according to police -- the third shooting involving a child in the District since Sunday.  The teenager, who has not been publicly identified, died following a confrontation at Roosevelt High School that resulted in gunshots, D.C. Metropolitan Police said. He was found with one gunshot wound and was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Law enforcement has begun a preliminary investigation and is asking for the public's help in finding the shooter. They said the teen had been in school at Roosevelt earlier Wednesday and authorities are investigating what time he left.  Assistant Chief of Police Morgan Kane told reporters later Wednesday that police do not believe students inside the school faced any danger.  A source familiar with the situation told ABC News that that D.C. Public Schools planned to deploy immediate mental health and social workers to assist with crisis support for students and staff at Roosevelt.  ""I can't overstate how heartbreaking it is, how heartbroken I am right now, for our kids with what we see happening as a police agency in the city,"" Kane said. ""But what I will tell you is that it just makes us more deliberate and intentional in our resolve to put our hands around what is happening with our kids.""  On Sunday, 10-year-old Arianna Davis was shot in the upper body while driving home with family following Mother's Day celebrations, police have said. Metropolitan Police said she was ""accidentally hit in a barrage of gunfire.""  On Wednesday, authorities said Davis had died.

She was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.  Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mayor Bowser said: ""We don't want to see any gun violence in our city, certainly not among our children. We regard our schools as the safest place for our children.""  Bowser told reporters that she felt there ""needs to be a fundamental shift"" with ""how we talk about consequences and how we're working with young people that we know are in trouble.""  Asked to elaborate, Bowser said: ""I think it needs to be on how to get young people who are using guns and make sure that they can't hurt other people.""  She pointed to new legislative efforts aimed at increasing public safety, unveiled on Monday, which she said she hopes the city council ""urgently"" takes up before the end of the summer. The proposal would increase penalties for some violent crime and illegal gun possession.  ""We can't think of our juvenile rehabilitation system as punishment that courts and judges don't regard as a way to help keep young people out of trouble,"" she said, adding that her administration is supporting the ""idea of respite or shelter care before a young person gets himself in trouble or hurt somebody or ends up being a victim of crime.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office said in a release the state Department of Justice will look into the incident under provisions of Assembly Bill 1506. The law requires the department to investigate all fatal shootings of unarmed California civilians by law enforcement officers.  The shooting — the Oxnard Police Department's third fatal use of force this year — wasn't initially believed to meet AB 1506 criteria, Bonta's office said. But closer analysis of body-worn camera and security video showed the law does apply.  Oxnard police released video of the incident last week. It shows Officer Manuel Garcia responding to a two-story apartment building at 235 E. Seventh St. Firefighters at the scene had sought help with an ""uncooperative subject"" who had reportedly been getting aggressive and had been cutting himself on his left wrist with a knife.  The subject, 24-year-old Michael Owens, had reportedly barricaded himself in a communal bathroom on the upper level, the police officer was told as he arrived.  During the encounter, Owens can be seen in the video exiting the bathroom with a knife and approaching Garcia. As Owens appeared to ignore Garcia's commands, the officer fired his handgun. Owens can be seen falling, then getting up after initially getting shot, leaving the knife on the ground.  After getting to his feet, Owens can be seen attempting to grab the officer's gun as he shouts: ""Give me the gun! You little b---!"". Garcia again shot Owens during the ensuing physical struggle, during which the knife was on the ground nearby, the department's video shows.  The Oxnard department issued its own release Wednesday evening minutes after Bonta's announcement.  The local department had been notified by state officials Monday that the state DOJ would ""assume control"" of the police investigation, Oxnard's release said.  The law defines an unarmed civilian as ""anyone who is not in possession of a deadly weapon,"" Oxnard officials said.  Oxnard police Chief Jason Benites said in a statement his department promptly notified the state DOJ after each of the recent officer-involved shootings, including the April 28 incident, ""which concerned an officer shooting a man that was armed with a knife.""  Benites said after state authorities reviewed the video, they advised the department they would assume control of the probe.  ""In our continued pursuit of transparency, we welcome this,"" Benites said. ""Our department will work with DOJ to ensure they have all the information and materials they need to conduct a thorough and independent review of this incident.""  The process helps maintain the public's trust, Benites said, ""which we value.""  Bonta's office said the completed investigation will be turned over to the DOJ's special prosecutions section in the criminal law division for independent review. More information on AB 1506, as well as a list of cases currently under review, is available at the attorney general's website at oag.ca.gov/ois-incidents.  Two other fatal shootings by Oxnard police preceded the April 28 incident. The state is only reviewing the April 28 encounter.  On March 12, an Oxnard officer shot and killed Adam Barcenas, 60, as he advanced toward police with a large metal pole during an unrelated DUI investigation in the downtown area.  On April 7, police fatally shot 18-year-old Christian Baltazar Torrez as he approached officers while holding a knife near Oxnard College.  DA review also supplanted  Any fatal use of force by a local law enforcement agency routinely launches several investigations, including a review by the Ventura County District Attorney's Office to determine whether an officer's actions were legally justified.  Since state authorities have taken over the investigation under AB 1506, the legal review of the April 28 shooting will also fall to the attorney general's office rather than local prosecutors, said Joey Buttitta, spokesman for the county DA's office.  Oxnard police Cmdr. Alex Arnett said Thursday that even though the state will investigate the shooting, the department can still carry out its own internal administrative review and discussion of any potential ""learning points"" that arise after a critical incident.  The department is aware some community groups have expressed concern after the recent string of fatal shootings by officers, he said, adding that the chief has recently met with some groups. In addition, the matter is likely headed to a future City Council meeting for public discussion.  Arnett confirmed that at least one and possibly two rounds fired by Garcia went through the apartment wall and entered an occupied room on the second floor. The person inside wasn't hurt, Arnett said, adding he was ""tremendously grateful"" no one else was injured.  Officials with the attorney general's press office hadn't responded to questions as of 2 p.m. Thursday.  This story may be updated."

Not in 2023 when we are in the throes of the Golden Age of Fear.  A 58-year-old Louisiana man is in jail today after shooting onto his neighbor’s property.  His target?  Shadows he saw Sunday night prompted him to grab his gun.  And then when he saw the shadows running away, he did what paranoid people are doing these days if they are armed with a weapon — he opened fire.  The Calcasieu Parrish’s Sheriff’s Office released a statement indicating that David Doyle claimed he did not realize he had actually struck somebody.  That somebody was a 14-year-old girl who was hit in the back of the head playing what most people Doyle’s age would view as a wholesome game compared to edgy and much more dangerous pastimes inspired by social media platforms.  Fortunately, the girl — who is in a hospital — does not have life-threatening injuries.  It Is the latest in a long and growing list of paranoia fanned attacks on kids.  Three weeks prior, 6-year-old Kinsley White was shot by a 24-year-old when she entered his yard to retrieve a basketball that had rolled into it. For added measure, police in Florida’s sad Robert Louis Singletary shot her parents as well.  To be clear, one doesn’t have to possess a gun to strike out at kids.  All it can take is consuming 12 cans of beers, seeing a teen moon you, and becoming angry with rage.  Such is the case of 45-year-old Anurag Chandra in Riverside County in Southern California back on Jan. 19, 2020.  Chandra was convicted a week ago of murder in the death of three 16 year-old boys.  They were among six teens in a Toyota Prius when one was dared to either jump into a pool at night or play “ding dong ditch.”  The teen opted for the doorbell prank.  He ran up to Chandra’s door — a complete stranger — and rang the bell.  After Chandra opened the door, the teen turned around, dropped his pants and mooned Chandra.  Chandra’s defense?  He had feared for his family’s safety and “wanted to express his anger” telling the jury he was “extremely, extremely mad” about the prank.  It didn’t help that he had consumed 12 beers in the hours leading up to the doorbell ringing.  So. Chandra jumped into his vehicle and went after the six boys.  He eventually caught up with them, ramming the Prius at 99 mph and sending it into a tree.  Chandra, by the way, was awaiting prosecution on domestic violence charges at the time of the incident.  April also saw 16 year-old Ralph Yarl who was shot and wounded by an 84-year-old man who opened fire through a glass door after he went to the wrong house to pick up two siblings and rang the doorbell.  The suspect told authorities he was “scared to death”.  Andrew Lester told police he was in bed when the doorbell rang, grabbed his gun and then — because after opening the main door and seeing the teen — became fearful of the teen’s size and whether he could defend himself before opening fire through a screen door.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. People have been shot while backing up after realizing they turned into the wrong driveway, shot while making Door Dash deliveries, and shot after they got into the wrong car, realized it, and got out.  These incidents did not occur in New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland, or whatever big city has a reputation of being a shooting gallery and a Mecca for violence.  The shooters aren’t all angry old men, nor are they all white.  The victims aren’t all minorities.  These incidents are taking place across the country in suburbia, small towns, and quiet neighborhoods.  The common thread is paranoia fueled by fear.  It is not a modern malady.  But the deep prevalence of fear in our everyday lives is.  The more we hear something, the more we tend to be consumed by it.  The Missing Children Milk Carton Program launched in the mid-1980s to find abducted children illustrates what happens.  The FBI reports, on average, fewer than 350 people under the age of 21 are abducted by strangers. Of those, less than 120 are under 18 years of age.  Non-custodial parent kidnappings are a 1,000 times higher.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children indicates 800,000 children a year are reported missing. Of those, 99 percent return home.  That includes 200,000 taken by family members — sometimes during custody battles — those who are lost, injured, or are runaways.  To be clear, one missing child is one too many. Stanger danger lessons are critical.  That said, there are those who are convinced from the constant bombardment of numbers — even though stranger abductions extremity rare — that their child is in eminent danger of being kidnapped.  Vigilance is good. Losing perspective and having it boil over into paranoia isn’t.  A local example was the 2008 case when a terrified malnourished 16-year-old boy wearing only boxer shorts with a heavy chain around his ankle escaped a nearby home where a guardian had held him captive and tortured for a year had made his way to the Tracy In Shape on Tracy Boulevard.  Cable news was saturated 24/7 every 15 minutes with “updates” for two days.  More than a few people started seeing that as the norm.  It is little wonder in 2023 with such cable programming on steroids, the instantaneous spread of exaggerated information and rumors via social media that are repeated over and over again until your senses become numb that many have become paranoid and/or in a constant state of rage.  A teen mooning you playing a stupid game of ding dong ditch? Run them down.  A 6-year-old disrespecting your property by retrieving their errant ball? Shoot them and their parents.  Mysterious shadows in the neighbor’s yard at night? The hordes are combining to kill young and not possibly something as innocent as kids playing hide and seek or even your neighbor chasing off a cat in his own yard.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt had it right.  We have nothing to fear but fear itself.  That’s because fear drives us to make rash decisions.  And nothing fans fear and rash decision more than a 24/7 diet of social media and cable TV news programs."

The students decided to wear orange cords. The color is a nod to the national Wear Orange campaign supported by Everytown For Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action as a way of honoring survivors of gun violence while pushing for gun reform.  Sources said some viewed the cords as being too political.  ""From my understanding, 175 seniors ordered the cords on their own online to be delivered to their homes, and then when they asked towards the end of the year they were told by administration that they wouldn’t be permitted,"" parent Marisa Prince said.  Related: Oxford shooting families get key win in lawsuit against district  When she heard this wasn't allowed, she ordered her own boxes of orange cords for seniors to wear with their caps and gowns.  ""I think the orange cord is a subtle way for students to show what they’ve been through on their graduation day in front of their loved ones,"" Prince said. ""The student that was killed from this graduating class just touched a lot of lives and so had friends all over his grade, and I think a lot of people are just even treating the cord as a way to remember him.""  Tate Myre, one of the four students killed in the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting would have graduated this year.  The superintendent sent a letter out to parents saying in part:  ""The reason I am not approving or endorsing the orange cord that is being distributed by an outside organization is because the tradition of Oxford High School’s graduation has been to keep the focus solely on students and their accomplishments. My endorsement of other symbolic graduation wear would set a precedent that could erode that tradition and more importantly the focus on students and their accomplishments. I personally endorse many worthwhile public and charitable agendas, but I do not do that within the scope of my duties as Oxford Community Schools superintendent.""  The district came up with an alternative way of showing support. It approved a navy and gold Wildcat honor cord as part of the graduation wear, a tribute to the ""resilience and strength these students have had to find within themselves"" according to another statement sent out to the community.  ""I was surprised that the district took such a hard line on this,"" Prince said.  She said she is expecting even more students to go their own way on this one.  ""I was just shocked that we can’t show some compassion and show some understanding and try to listen to the students. Try to allow them to express what they need and try to come together with some compromise,"" she said."

Ishman Jaren Archie was convicted of discharging a weapon into occupied property and fleeing to elude arrest.  A trial had begun in Guilford County Superior Court in High Point before a jury, but on the third day of the trial Archie agreed to the terms of a plea deal, District Attorney Avery Crump said.  Archie also had been charged with attempted first-degree murder, possession of a stolen firearm, possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana, possession of marijuana paraphernalia and driving while license revoked, but those charges were dismissed, Crump said.  Superior Court Judge Aaron Berlin sentenced Archie to 17 to 33 months in prison, but Crump said that the sentence was suspended pending Archie's successful completion of two years of supervised probation.  Archie was arrested Nov. 11, 2019, after the burgundy Nissan he was driving was chased by police in connection with a drive-by shooting in the southeast part of High Point. Another person in the car was livestreaming the chase through a cellphone, police said at the time.  High Point Police Department officers punctured two of the Nissan's tires to try to end the chase, which caused the car to wreck. Police said that Archie ran away but was caught a short time later.  Archie was accused of shooting at least five rounds into a sedan and wounding a man, who then was treated at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist High Point Medical Center for injuries that police described at the time only as not life-threatening.  One codefendant of Archie, Jiquan V. Quick of Lexington, previously pleaded guilty to discharging a weapon into occupied property, Guilford County Assistant District Attorney Cyrus Brown told The Enterprise. Quick was 17 at the time of his arrest in the case.  The case of another codefendant, Niala D. Leach of Thomasville, is pending, Brown said.

A 58-year-old Sarasota man was shot by another man after what appears to have been a road rage incident on Fruitville. The Sheriff's Office isn't releasing the names of the two men – or that of a female witness – because they are covered by Marsy's Law. The law prevents police agencies from releasing the identities of crime victims who choose to remain anonymous.  Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Dana Judge said no one has been arrested in this case.  Deputies responded to the area at approximately 8:08 p.m. on Saturday. They found that the 58-year-old was deceased in a pick-up truck on Fruitville, according to a Sheriff's Office news release. The deputies also saw an 18-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man – who are both Sarasota residents – in a nearby sedan. The man was the sedan's passenger, and the woman was the driver.  Judge said there had been a back-and-forth exchange between the people in the two vehicles about a traffic issue. Traffic was stopped on Fruitville at the time. The sedan's passenger told the Sheriff's Office that there was a verbal altercation, and then the driver of the pick-up truck pointed a gun at him and the driver of the sedan, according to the news release. The passenger then exited the sedan and fired multiple rounds into the driver’s side of the pick-up truck, striking the driver.

""Outraged"", YCSO said in the statement, Engdahl followed the victim, catching up to him near mile marker 3, and proceeded to fire a shot at the victim's vehicle with a black handgun.  The victim provided law enforcement with a description of both Engdahl and his vehicle, which YCSO was able to confirm through an investigation.  In a last-ditch effort, Engdahl went on the run, changing his physical appearance by shaving off his ""long-standing and distinct"" mustache. Additionally, Engdahl removed the roof rack and bumper sticker from his vehicle, drove to Las Vegas and dumped it at a buddy's house.  Engdahl then enlisted that same friend to lie to local law enforcement, saying the vehicle in question had resided at the residence for the past month.  However, when confronted with conflicting evidence, Engdahl's friend later backpedaled on how long the vehicle had been there, according to the Sheriff's Office.  On April 29, 2021, YCSO detectives arrested Engdahl after receiving tips from the public alongside evidence obtained through the investigation.  Engdahl was booked into jail on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, endangerment and criminal damage.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said in February that Yia Xiong was holding a 16-inch knife when St. Paul officer Abdirahman Dahir shot him.  Xiong’s family has said the Hmong-American veteran was deaf in one ear as a result of his involvement in the Vietnam War. They also said he wasn’t a threat, and raised questions about why he was killed.  The BCA led the investigation, and the Ramsey County attorney’s office said Tuesday that the agency formally presented its investigative file to its office. County Attorney John Choi asked Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison participate in the prosecution review, which he agreed to.  “Our first commitment is to a complete and transparent review of the evidence as presented by the BCA in this matter,” Choi said in a statement. “The addition of Attorney General Ellison to the review process adds a layer of trust and confidence to our process, and I am grateful for his office’s involvement.”  The county attorney’s office will also have “a nationally recognized officer use of force expert to assist in the review of the evidence,” according to a news release.  Snowdon Herr, chairman of the Justice for Yia Xiong group, said Tuesday that a thorough review is needed.  “We really believe that Yia Xiong deserves some answers,” he said.  On Feb. 11 at 4:55 p.m., police responded to the Winslow Commons building on the 100 block of South Western Avenue off West Seventh Street after receiving 911 calls. Officers told Xiong to drop the knife, but he didn’t respond and turned to unlock his apartment door, according to the BCA. Xiong went inside his apartment and the door began to close.  “The officers kicked the door to stop it from fully shutting and ordered him to come out,” the BCA said in a statement at the time. “They then backed away from the door and down the short hallway. Xiong opened the door and stepped into the hallway, knife still in-hand.”"

The accused is Justin Rogers.  According to the criminal complaint, Milwaukee police responded to the area near 92nd and Birch on Tuesday evening, May 9 to investigate a shooting. Officers found a 15-year-old boy, identified as Tyler Brooks, lying in the street. Officers saw ""a handgun near (Brooks') right hand and an extended magazine on the ground"" near his right light, the complaint says. Officers later noted the magazine had a capacity for 31 9mm cartridges, but there were only 22 cartridges in the magazine. Officers secured the firearm.  Officers provided medical aid to Brooks until firefighters arrived. Brooks was then taken to Children's Wisconsin -- and later pronounced deceased.

Detective Edward Davis, who was a patrol officer at the time of the shooting, described a chaotic scene that early morning at Lowell General Hospital’s Main Campus. Davis said “dozens” of medical personnel were treating Kimborowicz, who was in critical condition from the single bullet that pierced his torso.  Davis testified that Kimborowicz was in great discomfort, but answering questions, though he was reluctant to speak to police. To get Kimborowicz to open up about who shot him, Davis testified that he told the Lowell man he might die due to his injuries.  “I asked him ‘who did this to you’,” Davis said.  According to Davis, Kimborowicz eventually told him “he wasn’t a snitch,” before instructing Davis to check the doorbell camera at his grandmother’s house on Sutherland Street. Davis testified Kimborowicz also stated from his hospital bed that “C-Mello was in the vehicle.”  Shortly after the encounter with Davis, Kimborowicz was flown by medical helicopter to a Boston hospital for further treatment. He succumbed to his injuries approximately a month later.  As revealed during the trial, the camera referenced by Kimborowicz captured the moment Lemay, along with Braedyn Baraby and Ian Godbout, arrived outside his grandmother’s home on Sutherland Street shortly before the shooting.  Lemay, Baraby and Godbout drove to the home, where Kimborowicz lived with his grandmother, for what was supposed to be a one-on-one fistfight between Baraby and Kimborowicz’s close friend, Osvaldo Luna.  Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Chris Tarrant told jurors during his opening statement on May 9 that Baraby wanted revenge on Luna for stealing an eighth of an ounce of marijuana from him several months earlier.  The footage from the doorbell camera, which was shown during the trial, shows Kimborowicz instructing Lemay, Baraby and Godbout to drive to the end of the road where they would meet for the fight. Kimborowicz did not want to disturb his grandmother who was sleeping upstairs.  Kimborowicz is seen in the footage going inside the home, while the trio drive away in Lemay’s car toward Barker Avenue. Moments later, Kimborowicz and Luna then exit the home, and start walking in that direction.  Instead of a fair fistfight, however, prosecutors said Kimborowicz and Luna walked into an armed ambush. Shortly after 3:50 a.m., prosecutors allege Lemay and Baraby, both armed with guns, got out of the vehicle, parked on Barker Avenue near the intersection of Sutherland Street, and opened fire in the direction of Luna and Kimborowicz as they approached in the darkness.  Two spent casings, one from a 9mm round and another from a .380 round, were recovered by police at the scene. The guns prosecutors said were used have not been recovered.  Luna, who was uninjured during the shooting, has testified he saw Lemay fire a gun. A video taken by Godbout inside Lemay’s vehicle allegedly captured footage of Baraby with a gun at the time of the shooting.  Lemay, who was 18 years old at the time, and Baraby, who was 16, are both charged with first-degree murder, armed assault with intent to murder, attempted assault and battery by discharging a firearm, and possession of a firearm.  A separate trial for Baraby is scheduled to begin on Aug. 7.  Lemay’s attorneys, Ryan Sullivan and Steven Rappaport, have contended throughout the trial that one gun was fired that early morning, and Baraby pulled the trigger, not Lemay.  The defense has stressed the only witness who puts a gun in Lemay’s hands is Luna, who they have described as an unreliable witness.  While on the stand, Luna stated the gunman was light-skinned, tall, and skinny, and was wearing a gray hoodie. Sullivan and Rappaport have stressed the doorbell camera, as well as Godbout’s camera footage shows Baraby was wearing a gray hoodie. Though Lemay is not seen in Godbout’s video, he is seen in the doorbell camera footage, and is wearing black at that time.  The defense has also questioned Luna’s ability to clearly see who the gunman was. Throughout the trial, a common sentiment among witnesses is that the intersection of Sutherland Street and Barker Avenue is poorly lit, with a single streetlight casting a dull glow on the area.  The defense is set to call the trial’s final witness to the stand on Tuesday morning. Sullivan has stated the witness will be a firearms expert who will challenge the prosecution’s witness, Sgt. Kevin Callahan, of the State Police Ballistic Unit, who testified the two spent casings recovered by police came from different guns.  Judge Patrick Haggan informed jurors at the end of Monday’s proceedings that they should expect to begin deliberations on Tuesday.  Haggan explained during jury selection on May 8 that prosecutors are proceeding in the case against Lemay using a legal theory called “joint venture.”  Haggan explained to jurors under this theory prosecutors are not obligated to prove that Lemay fired the fatal bullet. Prosecutors are instead required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lemay knowingly participated in the murder with Baraby, had the knowledge that Baraby was armed with a firearm, and “shared the required criminal intent for murder,” Haggan said.  The judge added Lemay’s presence alone at the crime scene would not prove the prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Follow Aaron Curtis on Twitter @aselahcurtis"

Robinson and Brewton were each indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and Atkins was indicted on one count of first-degree murder. All three defendants will be charged as adults for the murders of Michael Hodo Jr., Layla Silvernail and Camile Quarles.  Their bodies were found between March 30 and April 1, 2023, in different locations in Ocklawaha, which is in Marion County. But investigators said the three victims were shot at the same time.  The defendants were also indicted on charges of robbery with a firearm and tampering with evidence.  According to investigators, Layla Silvernail, 16, was found lying near a dumpster on March 30 after being shot in the head. She later died at a hospital. Michael Hodo Jr., 17, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of the head on March 31, not far from the first scene. And Camille Quarles, 16, was found shot to death on April 1 in the trunk of a sedan partially submerged in a pond.  The car Quarles was found in was a Chevrolet Cruze that belonged to Silvernail, investigators said.

Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said the group had engaged in burglaries and robberies before the shootings.  “Although we had out there that it was gang-related, we have nothing specific to say that it was any rivalry,” Woods said. “However, each and every one of them in some shape or form is associated with a gang. Basically, simple terms, there is no honor among thieves, and at some point these three individuals turned on our three victims and murdered them.”  WATCH: Press play below to watch the news conference:  Detectives said they used phone records -- like text messages and pictures on the victims’ iPhones -- and tips from the community to link the suspected killers with the shooting.

A Burleson man appeared before a judge for the first time this week after he was charged with possessing a homemade bomb.  22-year-old Noah Calderon was charged last month with one count of possession of a destructive device.  According to court documents, Calderon allegedly posted a series of photos of homemade explosives on Snapchat, and the FBI was alerted by a tipster in October 2022.  The posts included an explosive marked ""SS,"" which investigators believed was a reference to the Nazi paramilitary group.  On social media, Calderon allegedly shared posts embracing white supremacy and said he had a fascination with mass shooting, especially the 1999 killing at Columbine High School, according to documents.  Investigators say that Calderon also posted several photos of himself posing with AR-15 rifles and handguns.  In March 2023, the FBI received a tip that Calderon detonated a homemade bomb in a residential neighborhood, with many people calling 911 about the loud sound.  A look into Calderon's Google searches found several searches for the Columbine killers, Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, and instructions on how to make various bombs. He also looked up the names of several local schools, according to investigators.  ""It’s indicative of somebody that wants to hurt people or property,"" said Richard Roper, a former U.S. attorney not involved in the case. ""And that combined with the provocative statements that he made and the conduct, it's very serious.""  Federal agents raided Calderon's home on April 17 and found items that could be used to detonate a bomb, metal BBs and lead and more than 600 grams of explosive powder.  In Calderon's room, police said they found a handwritten note labeled ‘Manifesto’ that talked about the Columbine shooters and white supremacy.  ""This defendant exhibited several indicators of potential violence: a fascination with mass shooters, an obsession with weapons, and hatred towards a protected class. What’s worse, he had allegedly progressed from ideation to planning and preparation,"" said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton in a statement. ""In apprehending Mr. Calderon, we may have averted mass tragedy. We are especially grateful to the tipster who alerted law enforcement to Mr. Calderon’s concerning social media posts.""  Featured article  ""The takeaway from this is that somebody reported suspicious behavior,"" Roper said. ""And maybe suspicious behavior turns out to be nothing, but the idea that you report something that you see suspicious is important.""  Calderon's trial is expected to begin on June 26 in federal court. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.  His arrest came weeks before the shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, in which investigators say the shooter expressed a ""neo-Nazi ideation."" Eight people were killed, and several others were injured."

Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding."

It’s a long and detailed essay that covers the meeting she and fellow singers Amy Grant, Sheryl Crow, Ruby Amanfu, Allison Russell and Will Hoge had with Gov. Bill Lee and the unexpected empathy she felt for him, the faith she has in Gen Z, and the change she believes women can create when working together.  “On that dreadful Monday, March 27th, when six souls lost their lives in the Covenant shooting,” she begins, “my father-in-law called me to break the news. “There’s been a shooting at a school in Green Hills,” he started, and I dropped to the ground. I couldn’t breathe, my head was spinning. I felt like I might have a nervous breakdown when he continued, “It’s not their school. It’s not their school.” Tears were rolling down my cheeks. My two children were at a different school in the area, and while I breathed a sigh of relief that my kids were safe, my heart was already breaking for Nashville.  “At the same time, I got a text message from my kids’ teachers saying they were in lockdown but not in danger. My hands trembled as I tried to reply. I thought about driving to go pick them up and bring them safely home, but the roads were closed. In the days that followed, I contemplated quitting my career and homeschooling them. How can we send our children into this evil world with broken people? How can we send them straight into danger? They were safe, and for that, I thanked God.  “My 12-year-old hugged me when I picked him up. They were placed on lockdown immediately when the sound of sirens began screaming through the neighborhood. “The sirens lasted all day,” he said. I kissed both their heads, buckled them in, and tried to hide the tears in my eyes as we drove home. It was a traumatic day for the city, and my mind was far away.

Records for the U.S. Northern Ohio District Court show that an arrest warrant was served on Deltonio L. Dorsey, 41, of Keri Drive SW.  Dorsey appeared in federal court May 10 on the complaint filed by U.S. Marshals accusing him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Carmen Henderson scheduled a detention hearing for Dorsey for 11:30 a.m. today at the Youngstown federal courthouse. Records show Dorsey was taken from Trumbull County jail that day to the custody of federal marshals as his case is being considered by a grand jury.  Dorsey is being accused of the federal crime because of previous felony convictions, including aggravated burglary and burglary charges in 2002 out of Trumbull County Common Pleas Court; another felon in possession of a firearm charge on Sept. 29, 2009, and an aggravated robbery in 2017 in Trumbull County court.  According to a federal affidavit, a Warren police officer answered the shots fired call on April 11 to find a man wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants standing in the parking lot of the South Street apartment complex. The man was identified as Dorsey, began to walk away from the officer with his hands up heading between two of the apartment buildings. As the man walked through a small gate, the officer saw him make a throwing motion after reaching to his waist, the report states.  After that, the man became compliant with the officer and was taken into custody.  The officer later went to the area of the gate where a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver was found on top of landscaping, next to a short brick wall that made up the entrance gate, the report states. The officer noted that one of the rounds of the revolver had been fired.  The affidavit states that prior to the shots fired at the apartment complex, two men standing in the parking lot saw a “flash and heard a pop” and then saw a person dressed in all black run from the lot.  A witness told authorities he went to the lot and confronted the man in the gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, telling him to leave the property immediately after he saw a revolver in the man’s hand. The witness told authorities he had seen the man, identified as Dorsey, coming and going from an apartment belonging to a woman tenant for several months prior."

It was tough for Alejandro Baez to talk about his son on Tuesday, who he said was his best friend. He described the pain his family now carries after deputies killed his oldest son, 20-year-old Jayden Baez, and why they are pushing for those responsible to be held accountable. “The pain, as a father having his oldest child killed like that. It's something I live every day,” he said.Alejandro Baez can’t believe his son’s life ended at such a young age. “What happened for Pokémon cards and pizza — that's not good,” he said. “The pain is every day. It doesn't get better.”Jayden Baez was with two teenagers when deputies came to Target responding to a call about a suspicious car and stolen Pokémon cards and pizza worth about $40. Since that day, more than a year ago last April, charges were dropped against the two teens. But the quest for justice is just beginning. “They go to jail or prison, losing jobs. This world needs to be kept better,” Alejandro Baez said. On Tuesday, attorney Mark NeJame, who is representing the Baez family, said he plans to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against Sheriff Marco Lopez and at least two other deputies from the sheriff’s office, claiming they used “excessive, unreasonable and unnecessary force and violence.” He’s also looking into questionable reports from the day of the shooting. “I've never in many decades of practicing seen four reports filed at the same minute in the same hour, signed by the same program, signed by or witnessed by the same person. So there's a lot of issues there,” NeJame said. “These families are grieving. These kids should not have been maimed and killed and shot over this. There is no excuse for this.”In response to the lawsuit, the Osceola County Sheriff's Office said: ""The members of the Osceola Sheriff’s Office, along with the public, are waiting for the State Attorney’s Office to decide if the two deputies were justified in firing their weapons at a local Target. It has been more than a year since the shooting took place. While on scene at the shooting, Sheriff Lopez requested the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to do an independent review into the actions of the deputies. FDLE completed that investigation more than 8 months ago. The Sheriff’s Office is looking forward to the completion of State Attorney’s review so all parties can gain some closure regarding this incident.""Watch the full news conference:"

Authorities say on Monday at around 8:15 a.m., the Forsyth County 911 center received a call from a driver who had been shot less than an hour before.  The driver told police he was on GA 400 behind a white Toyota that was driving slowly in the fast lane. The driver honked at the Toyota and eventually passed the vehicle. It was then the driver said he noticed the Toyota began following him.  While both vehicles were between exits 13 and 14 on the highway, police say the Toyota's driver opened fire, shattering the other driver's side window and hitting him in the arm.  The victim tried to follow the gunman but lost him on Pendley Road, after which he pulled over and called 911.  During the interview, deputies with the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office located and stopped the Toyota and talked with its driver, 31-year-old Joshua Kasparek.  Deputies say Kasparek's version of events were similar to the victims and they learned he had a family violence order stating that he was not allowed to possess or buy a firearm or ammo.  Kasparek is charged with aggravated assault, reckless conduct, and violation of a family court order.  He's currently in custody at the Forsyth County Jail without bond."

According to Trumann police, Earl Wayne Dorris II unlawfully entered the home with a firearm, intending to harm the residents. Dorris was shot by a resident and died at the scene.  It all happened on Whitlatch Avenue, where residents say the area has become much more unsafe in recent years.  “We are all in bed and you just don’t know, you could be next,” one woman said.  Trumann police understand the concern, but Captain Gary Henry said it was not random.  “It was not necessarily a home invasion, it was an isolated incident and the suspect had entered the house and got shot and killed,” Henry explained.  While the department says the incident is isolated, residents stress there is a bad feeling about their neighborhood.  “All around the road, you’ll find needles on the road,” one woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said. “People be walking up and down our street at 3 a.m.”  She has been trying to move for some time and said she doesn’t know how safe her family is.  Capt. Henry said whenever there is a shots fired call, it is out of the ordinary and he wants everyone to know that this was not random and that there is no reason to worry.  “These subjects all knew each other, so it wasn’t something random where someone came into town and picked this house out to burglarize or terrorize,” Henry said.

An 18-year-old man was arrested Monday in suburban Maywood and charged in the May 2022 attack of Dakotah Earley, police said. The man faces three felony counts, including attempted murder, armed robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle, as well as a misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a vehicle.  The man’s name has not been released.  Earley was walking in the 1300 block of West Webster Avenue when he was ambushed by a pair of robbers, one of whom shot him twice in his back and once in his head, prosecutors said. A neighbor who witnessed the attack rushed to Earley’s aid until paramedics arrived, likely saving his life.  Tyshon Brownlee, 19, was also charged with attempted murder in the shooting.  Earley was seriously wounded in the shooting, which left him on life support as he underwent more than a dozen surgeries, including having his left leg amputated below the knee, his family said.  Joy Dobbs, Earley’s mother, has shared updates on social media throughout his recovery. She said she had “mixed emotions” to hear the second man had been charged.  “We are happy that this individual has been removed from our streets and will be held accountable for his role in the shooting, but it is also very hard for us to relive that day again,” Dobbs said.  Credit: GoFundMe Dakotah Earley was a culinary arts student up until recently, when he decided to take a break to focus on other things.  Earley has sued former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, former police Supt. David Brown and two unnamed police officers, claiming they missed multiple chances to stop the men accused in the ambush.  Larry Disparti, one of Earley’s lawyers, reiterated in a statement Tuesday that the police department’s “no-pursuit” policy played a significant role in the attack on Earley.  “We will continue to fight on the family’s behalf until justice is served,” Disparti said.  Cass Casper, another of Earley’s attorneys, previously said the crime was preventable. Attorneys reviewed dispatches that show police spotted Brownlee in a stolen BMW near Soldier Field about an hour before the shooting.  Brownlee sped away, and officers did not chase him, Casper said.  “If police continued their pursuit earlier, it could have prevented this entire chain of events,” Casper said. “All they had to do was tail the perpetrator and make him stop. But they didn’t.”  There were “numerous incidents” where police could have previously caught Brownlee, who was known to law enforcement for a “violent rampage” and robbery spree in the days prior to Earley’s shooting, Casper said.  Casper blamed a police directive issued in August 2020 “ingrained in the minds of rank-and-file officers not to chase under any circumstances.”  The changes to the department’s chase policy came after the City Council approved a $15 million settlement to the family of a 37-year-old mother of six who was killed in 2020 when an officer chasing a carjacking suspect slammed into her car in Lakeview. That officer had been ordered to stop the chase before the fatal crash occurred.  Now, officers must “consider the need for immediate apprehension of an eluding suspect and the requirement to protect the public from the danger created by eluding offenders.” Marked police cars chasing someone must have their lights and sirens activated.  Credit: Twitter/Joy Dobbs Dakotah Earley is walking again by using a test prosthesis.  Earley spoke publicly for the first time in February. He said he plans to stay in Chicago and is talking to his mom about going back to school.  Good music got him through the days he battled for his life, he said.  “I try not to think about what happened too much. There are times I think maybe I should have done that, or done this, but this could happen to anyone,” Earley said. “Push forward.

Lisa Rocheleau died at Portsmouth Regional Hospital on Thursday, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office and Rochester police. The next day, charges against Haydee Rivera-Nadeau were upgraded.  After her arrest, two days after the shooting in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rivera-Nadeau faced a charge of attempted murder. She now faces a charge of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the Strafford County Department of Corrections, officials said Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak to her arrest.  Rocheleau's death was found to be a homicide caused by a gunshot wound, officials said.

The 50-year-old was a mother of three, and Rivera-Nadeau was her former domestic partner, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.  A woman was arrested in North Carolina after a shooting that left another woman critically injured in Rochester, New Hampshire.  Rocheleau's shooting, at the Professional Arts Building on Winter Street, was reported just before noon on May 1. She'd been shot in the head and rushed to the hospital, where she was in critical condition, officials have said.  Police said they were able to identify a female suspect early on in their investigation and issued an arrest warrant for Rivera-Nadeau, a 65-year-old from Somersworth, charging her with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and, at the time, attempted second-degree murder.  Rivera-Nadeau was arrested shortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday night by police in Charlotte after Rochester police contacted them to let them know they believed she was in the area, police said.

The suspect in a shooting death three years ago at a party in Edgewater was apprehended by U.S. marshals Thursday in El Salvador and extradited to Maryland, Anne Arundel Police announced.  Police say Wilber Oswaldo Nunez-Menendez, a Crownsville resident, shot two men at a party Nov. 14, 2020, on Brick Church Road. Ronal Alcidis Maldonado Quijada, a 53-year-old Annapolis resident, was killed while a 28-year-old was injured and treated at an area hospital. At the time of the double shooting, Nunez-Menendez was 25.  Advertisement  El Salvadorian authorities had detained Nunez-Menendez for an unrelated event before American officials were notified, police spokesperson Lt. Jacklyn Davis said Monday. The U.S. Marshals Service, the primary federal agency responsible for extraditing international fugitives, transported Nunez-Menendez back to Anne Arundel County.  “We’re thankful for our national and international partnerships that can hopefully bring closure to a victim’s family,” Davis said.  Advertisement  Nunez-Menendez has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and firearm offenses.  He is currently being held without bond in the Jennifer Road Detention Center and is scheduled to appear May 22 in District Court.  According to charging documents, Nunez-Menendez attended the party on Brick Church Road with his uncle. A witness who knew the uncle through work told police an argument broke out between the two victims and Nunez-Menendez, who drew a handgun and shot both men multiple times, police said.  After the shooting, Nunez-Menendez and his uncle fled the party in a pickup truck, the witness said.  Speaking to witnesses and friends of the family, investigators were able to gather information on Nunez-Menendez before witnesses positively identified him in a photo lineup.  Court filings had no explanation for what started the argument."

Bobby Solis is accused of fatally shooting John Eric Garcia at a West Side apartment complex.  An arrest affidavit says witnesses told police at the time of the shooting that they saw Solis in the complex’s parking lot in the 1100 block of Callaghan Road.  They said they also saw Garcia going out to meet with Solis and heard gunshots a few minutes later.  According to the affidavit, police spent months researching the case and eventually found surveillance video and cellphone records that placed Solis at the scene.  In court on Tuesday, Solis’ defense attorney said both men were in the Mexican Mafia and had an ongoing feud.  Solis is not denying that he was with Garcia but says another person with him was the one to shoot Garcia, and he had nothing to do with it.  The first evidence to be shown to the jury was two 911 calls that were made after Garcia was shot.  His girlfriend and aunt can be heard trying to render aid to Garcia, but he would later die at the scene from his wounds.  Testimony will continue Wednesday morning. If Solis is found guilty, he is facing up to life in prison.  Related:"

(Associated Press)  DES MOINES — The families of two teenagers shot to death in a Des Moines alternative education program have filed a lawsuit alleging the program and its founder were negligent in not keeping the premises safe.  The families of Rashad Carr, 16, and Gionni Dameron, 18, filed the lawsuit Monday against the program Starts Right Here and its founder Will Keeps.  Both teens were killed Jan. 23 in a shooting at the educational program designed to keep at-risk youth out of trouble. Keeps, an activist and rapper whose given name is Will Holmes, also was shot and seriously injured but survived.  Advertisement  Student Preston Walls, 18, has been accused of the shooting, and police allege Bravon Tukes, 19, drove a getaway car. Both Walls and Tukes face charges including two counts of first-degree murder.  Prosecutors have said in court filings that the shootings revolved around a dispute between rival gangs.  In the lawsuit, the families of Carr and Dameron argue that Keeps and the program knew of potential dangers but didn't take needed steps to protect the two teens. At the time, Starts Right Here did not have security guards, but after the shootings the program reopened with guards and metal detectors.  The program has a contract with Des Moines schools to work with students who have struggled in their traditional high schools. The program is housed at an office park on the edge of downtown Des Moines.  In a text message sent to Des Moines media outlets, Keeps said he was “surprised and deeply hurt” that the families would sue him.  “I am crushed that after being thanked for helping to save and change the lives of their sons that I am now their target,"" Keeps said.

Some may find them disturbing.  JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The State Attorney’s Office on Tuesday ruled the police-involved shooting on Jacksonville’s Northside that left two people dead — and seriously wounded a Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office K-9 — justifiable.  In a report released by the State Attorney’s Office, it was determined the shooting on Zoo Parkway in July was a valid use of force.  The officers involved will have to go before an internal board to see if the shooting was within departmental guidelines.  K-9 Huk was shot on Zoo Parkway on the Northside in July after police pursued three suspects from a shooting incident. The two men who died at the scene were identified as Lockett and Tyjarius Holton, 18. The report said a third person, Robert Motley, 32, who is in custody.  Related: ‘Get him out of here now!’ Bodycam shows moments officers save K-9 shot while going after suspects | Bodycam shows what led to JSO K-9 Huk, men being shot following pursuit & crash  According to a report, the shootout started when Lockett fired shots at police on West 45th Street and then sped off with two people in the car. The report says – Lockett was driving up to 97 miles per hour. During the chase, officers did not know Lockett had two passengers inside. One of the passengers, Motley, told police he asked Lockett multiple times to let him out of the car, but Lockett refused.  When Lockett got to Zoo Parkway he hit a car which caused him to lose control and crash into a fence at Jacksonville Zoo. Police were worried Lockett would get out of the car - and enter the zoo. That’s when they sent in K-9 Huk.  RELATED: Who is Huk? A loyal police K-9 who’s helped capture wanted men, including deputy’s suspected killer  JSO released body cam footage showing Huk going toward the suspect’s car. Moments after he goes in shots are fired by police. Huk was then hit in the rear leg.  More body cam footage shows Huk, his handler, and another officer in a helicopter taking the K9 to a veterinary office. His handler was discussing the shooting.  To be clear, JSO hasn’t finished its investigation into what happened, and whose bullets hit the dog. The body camera video previously released by JSO shows the moment Huk was hit. The service dog yelps in pain as officers fire into the suspects’ vehicle, killing two of the three men inside.  News4JAX Crime Analyst Lakesha Burton said situations like this are common in the police world.  “We call that friendly fire,” Burton said. “And that’s when an officer accidentally hit someone that’s on their side. So that is ultimately what the response to the resistance board is for. So they will examine all of the evidence and have the officer be able to articulate why he shot and you know, officers are accountable for every bullet that they fired from their firearm.”  Burton said if the officer is found responsible for shooting the K-9 he could receive training counseling or something along those lines.  JSO’s Response to Resistance Board will review the incident to see whether the use of deadly force was within departmental guidelines."

Officers were called to a bar in the 5000 block of Sharp Street off Irving Boulevard about 3 a.m. Nov. 27 and found Cortney Perkins, 36, shot to death, according to an arrest-warrant affidavit.  Detectives found four 9mm cartridge casings near a pool table about 30 feet from Perkins’ body, the affidavit says.  Several people told investigators that Travis Dallas was the shooter, police wrote in the affidavit, but it was months before video surveillance of the shooting helped identify him as the gunman and show what occurred.

Noe Mejia, 38, was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on March 14 in southwestern Arizona north of Sasabe. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck, according to Mejia’s autopsy report obtained by The Arizona Republic.  Defibrillator pads were on Mejia’s front torso when the autopsy exam was conducted the day after the shooting. Mejia’s time of death was 7:26 p.m.  Mejia was suspected of smuggling five undocumented migrants in a BMW before fleeing from Border Patrol agents.  The Pima County Sheriff's Department is conducting an external criminal investigation into the shooting. The department will make a recommendation to the Pima County Attorney's Office whether criminal charges should be filed.  Tucson Sector has highest number of use-of-force incidents  The shooting took place in the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector, which has the highest number of use-of-force incidents across the agency, with 142 incidents reported so far in fiscal year 2023, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.  In 2022, 196 incidents were reported. The Tucson Sector is followed by El Paso, where 120 incidents have been reported so far this fiscal year, per CBP data.  Body camera footage:CBP releases body camera video for fatal Border Patrol shooting in Arizona  CBP released the body camera footage of the shooting April 14, nearly a month after it happened. The release was the first time that CBP released a body camera video of an agent-involved shooting.  Mejia’s family was “horrified and re-traumatized” by the release of the body camera footage showing the shooting, according to Joy Bertrand, one of the attorneys representing various members of Mejia’s next of kin.  “They're devastated,” said José Saldivar, an attorney co-counseling with Bertrand on the case.  At least one of Mejia’s siblings was allowed to review the footage before it was made public, Saldivar said. Saldivar said more footage is available that would “paint a better picture” relating to the delay in rendering aid to Mejia after he had been shot.  Video shows fatal encounter  In the video, Mejia can be seen immediately slumping forward toward the steering wheel after being shot. Mejia had a sleeve of black tattoos on his left forearm and was wearing a San Francisco 49ers winter hat.  The agent had positioned his pickup truck behind the BMW before getting out and smashing the rear and front driver’s side windows with his baton. Mejia and the agent then began to struggle as the agent tried to hold onto Mejia’s left arm, which was coming out of the broken driver’s side window.  Initial reporting:Border Patrol agent shoots, kills man after vehicle pursuit near Sasabe  The agent continued to try to hold onto Mejia’s arm as he began to reverse the car.  Then, as Mejia began to sharply turn the wheel to turn the car left, the agent pulled out his handgun and fired once at Mejia inside the car.  Two agents rendered aid to Mejia by trying to resuscitate him and by using a defibrillator. Mejia was pronounced dead at the scene by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.  “I believe that this officer does need to be charged criminally,” Saldivar said.  BMW first spotted near Sasabe port of entry  The episode began at 6:18 p.m. when a Border Patrol remote camera operator saw several suspected undocumented migrants load into a BMW about one mile north of the Sasabe port of entry.  Two Border Patrol agents started following the BMW and noticed that the driver was driving in an “erratic manner.” The agents turned on their emergency equipment to perform a traffic stop, but the driver kept going and a chase ensued.  The agents chased the BMW as the driver turned west near mile marker 20 on State Route 286 onto Brown Bear Canyon Road. The BMW driver tried to turn around at 6:41 p.m. by turning the car south 3.8 miles west of SR 286.  The video footage and other evidence were given to the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department hours after the shooting, CBP said.

Jeremiah M. Grady, 20, of Minneapolis agreed on Monday in Hennepin County District Court to plead guilty to second-degree intentional murder and second-degree attempted murder in connection with the shooting of London Bean on Sept. 8, 2021, outside Grady's apartment building at N. 8th and Aldrich avenues.  The plea agreement between the prosecution and the defense calls for Grady to be sentenced to a term of more than 30½ years. With credit for time in jail since his arrest, Grady is expected to serve the first 18⅔ years in prison and the balance on supervised release. Grady remains jailed ahead of sentencing on Aug. 11.  According to the charges:  London was shot after getting into a fight with another boy, believed to be Grady's younger brother, while several adults looked on.  As the fight continued, witnesses told police that Grady — wearing a black ski mask and dressed in all black — came around from the back of the building and pointed a gun at everyone, yelling, ""Yeah! Wassup!""  As people ran, Grady fired off several shots, two of which struck London in the chest and abdomen. London was taken by emergency responders to a nearby hospital and was pronounced dead there.  As Grady fled, he fired at a blue SUV parked nearby, narrowly missing a teenage girl, police said. Grady, who was 18 years old at the time of the shooting, surrendered to police about three weeks later.  Also charged in connection with London's death is Grady's father. Letterance Grady, 41, of Minneapolis allegedly encouraged his son to retaliate against the Bean family for perceived bullying and drove him to the scene of the shooting.  Letterance Grady is charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, aiding and abetting attempted second-degree murder and harboring a fugitive. He was arrested four days after his son.  The father is in jail in Anoka County, where he's charged with first-degree robbery on allegations that he was one of two people who held up a T-Mobile store in Columbia Heights in August 2021."

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.  On a cold evening in March, at a school board meeting in Oxford, Michigan, Buck Myre approached members with a sheaf of papers. As they were passed down the line, he paced and fidgeted.  For three minutes, the room was quiet. One board member covered her eyes with both hands. Finally, Myre stepped to the lectern. He released a shaky exhale, crackling the microphone.  “I don’t even know where to start, and I don’t even know what to say,” he said. “But imagine — you can’t imagine. But imagine going to the coroner’s office and picking this up.”  The papers were copies of his 16-year-old son’s death certificate.  On Nov. 30, 2021, Tate Myre and three other students — Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17 — were shot and killed inside Oxford High School by a 15-year-old sophomore. Seven more were shot but lived.  The shooter, who pleaded guilty to murder, terrorism and other felonies, awaits a hearing to determine whether he’ll face a life sentence without parole. His parents, who bought a gun for the troubled teenager four days before the shooting, are charged with involuntary manslaughter and awaiting trial.  But for many families, that’s not enough. They want a full accounting of what happened and whether it could have been prevented — which they still haven’t received.  “I do believe that things went wrong that day,” Myre told the school board in March. “And I don’t understand why we’re running from it. I don’t get it.”  Oxford has ordered an external review of the shooting, and school officials say they too want answers. But many parents say those same officials have stonewalled them, delayed the review and not committed to full transparency or accountability.  Nationwide, there’s no protocol for such reviews. If they happen at all — “usually where we see higher body counts” — they vary widely in process and purpose, said James Densley, co-founder and president of the Violence Project, a nonprofit research center. Such a haphazard approach not only leads to mistrust inside communities, experts say, but wastes an opportunity to extract lessons that may prevent the next tragedy.  After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, a state commission delivered a preliminary report 322 days later, reaching the community before the first anniversary.  In Newtown, Connecticut, the local state’s attorney issued a report 346 days after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. After a 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, a state panel’s report arrived in 136 days.  In Oxford, it’s been more than 525 days, and counting.  Two weeks after the shooting, Oxford’s school board voted unanimously for a review to begin “immediately.” But the board declined multiple offers from Michigan’s attorney general to investigate. For six months after the shooting, following guidance from a lawyer retained by its insurance company, the board insisted a review must wait for criminal and civil cases to resolve.  Finally, in May 2022, after facing community pressure, Oxford decided to hire Guidepost Solutions, a company that has investigated abuse allegations at the Southern Baptist Convention.  But Guidepost struggled to get people to cooperate with its review, including those who work for the district. Unions and the lawyer brought in by the school’s insurance provider cautioned against talking. “In our experience, the extent of third-party interference of this investigation has been unusually extraordinary,” Guidepost has said in a statement.  During the tumult, two board members resigned, later saying that they felt the board was not well served by the lawyer’s involvement.  Guidepost declined to comment for this story. Oxford Community Schools and its insurance company didn’t respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment. The lawyer, Timothy Mullins, didn’t respond to ProPublica’s inquiries about his actions on behalf of the board.  “Obviously, this community wants answers,” the school board’s president, Dan D’Alessandro, told ProPublica. “That’s why we hired Guidepost — to get those answers.”  He added: “Once we have an opportunity to look at everything, then we’ll make any changes that are necessary.”  Guidepost delivered a report this month that assessed Oxford’s current strategies for security, suicide intervention and threat assessment. But it’s the second report, the one that will examine the events surrounding the shooting, that many parents feel is essential. It will draw from interviews as well as case files from investigators. However, it is unclear when it will be released.  Meanwhile, in lieu of a timely and comprehensive accounting, many Oxford families are left with unsettling questions.  “Every Tuesday marks another week without those four precious children that didn’t get to come home,” said a woman who works for the school at the March meeting, “and we still don’t get to have the answers for what happened, and people are still working at this school who were directly involved.”  I’m here, she added, to “demand the report be given to us.”  ‘I have access to the gun and ammo’  On the rural-urban fringe of southeast Michigan, where about 1,800 students attended Oxford High School, the final weeks of 2021 had everyone on edge.  In November, a student displayed a severed deer head in the courtyard with red paint looking like blood. He was disciplined, but less than a week later, in a boys’ restroom, students found a bird’s head in a jar.  Law enforcement and school personnel investigated but were unable to determine its origin, the district superintendent said in an email sent weeks later. As it happened, a sophomore named Ethan Crumbley was responsible for the bird’s head. He recorded the decapitation on his phone and wrote about it in his journal.  This is one of many disturbing details from the weeks before — and the day of — the shooting that were described in court documents and public testimony.  Ethan was spiraling, public records show. His Spanish teacher emailed school counselor Shawn Hopkins, saying he seemed sad. In a brief meeting outside a classroom, Hopkins told Ethan he was available if he wanted to talk.  On Nov. 26, Ethan’s father bought him a SIG Sauer 9 mm handgun. Three days later, an English teacher caught him searching online for bullets. She emailed Nicholas Ejak, dean of students, and Pamela Fine, another counselor.  At a five-minute meeting with Fine and Hopkins, Ethan told the counselors it was hobby research. Appearing calm, he said he’d gone to the range with his mom that weekend with his new gun. (She posted about it on Instagram: “Mom and son day testing out his new Xmas present.”)  Fine left a voicemail with Ethan’s mom, saying guns may be a hobby but searching for ammunition during class wasn’t good behavior.  His mom texted Ethan: “Seriously? Looking up bullets in school?? … Lol, I’m not mad you have to learn not to get caught.”  That evening, Ethan posted on Twitter: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. See you tomorrow Oxford.”  Early on a foggy Tuesday morning, Hopkins got an email sent by Ejak about an English teacher who’d caught Ethan watching a shooting video. Some 20 minutes later, a math teacher informed Ejak that on a test review, Ethan drew a picture of a handgun, a bullet, a laughing face with tears and a twice-shot figure with blood pouring from its mouth.  “Blood everywhere,” Ethan wrote.  “My life is useless.”  “The world is dead.”  “The thoughts won’t stop.”  “Help me.”  The video he watched was only a game, Ethan said in the counselor’s office.  Hopkins, Ejak and Fine are among the school staff that have faced civil suits from the case, including in federal court. Mullins, a lawyer representing them and the school district, said in an email that because of ongoing litigation, he wouldn’t comment on the facts of the case. In a motion to dismiss federal lawsuits, Mullins wrote that “nothing about what the individual defendants knew could have put them on notice” that Ethan “posed the specific risk of shooting multiple students.”  Hopkins asked about the drawing. By then, Ethan modified it, adding phrases like “Harmless act” and “I love my life so much!!!!”  Ethan said the drawing depicted a game he wanted to design. Asked about “my life is useless,” Ethan’s demeanor became sad, according to Hopkins’ testimony in a pretrial hearing in the criminal case against Ethan’s parents. He described difficulties, including a grandparent’s death and a family dog dying.  He said he wasn’t a danger to anyone, but Hopkins felt “there was enough suicidal ideation” to call Ethan’s mom, the counselor testified. Both parents arrived about 10:30.  The description of what happened next is based on court documents and public testimony, including from Hopkins. There is not yet a full public account from Ethan or his parents about the office meeting.  Ethan needs help, Hopkins remembered telling the parents, “today, if possible.” He provided a list of mental health resources.  But, the counselor testified, Ethan’s mom said they couldn’t take him that day because they needed to return to work. Hopkins was taken aback. It was the first time he’d had such a meeting where parents would not take their child home, Hopkins said. He told them he wanted Ethan to get support within 48 hours. “I’ll be following up,” he recalled saying.  Looking at his drawing, Ethan’s dad told his son he had people he could talk to and his journal to write in.  “Are we done?” Ethan’s mother asked.  Hopkins asked Ejak if any disciplinary issue prevented Ethan from returning to class. No, Ejak said.  “I guess so,” Hopkins said.  Less than 15 minutes after the meeting began, it was over. Ethan’s parents left without him.  Hopkins wrote Ethan a pass. At some point that morning, Ejak retrieved Ethan’s backpack from math class and returned it to him. No one asked about Ethan’s access to weapons or searched his backpack.  Back at work, his mom mentioned to her boss that she needed to find Ethan a counselor. She texted her son. “You ok? … You know you can talk to us and we won’t judge.”  At a pretrial hearing, a lawyer for Ethan’s mother noted that Hopkins was a mandatory reporter; if he truly felt Ethan was at risk of not getting proper medical attention, including psychological, he must report it to Children’s Protective Services. But no one called outside authorities. Nor did he insist that Ethan leave school.  He wasn’t forced to leave school, Hopkins testified, because “there was no discipline issue.” At the time, Hopkins was concerned that Ethan was a threat to himself and thought it best for him to not be alone. He intended to follow up the next morning about mental health services.  When a lawyer asked if Hopkins thought he should have done anything differently that day, Hopkins said: “I want that situation to be as different as possible. I acted off the information I had available.”  Ethan’s lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. A gag order prevents attorneys involved in his parents’ criminal cases from speaking to the media.  Less than two hours after the meeting with his parents, Hopkins and Ejak, Ethan emerged from a bathroom with the gun that had been in his backpack, along with ammunition and his hard-bound black journal. Every entry described shooting the school, including the last one: “The shooting is tomorrow. I have access to the gun and ammo.”  Ethan turned left and fired.  A patchwork system  When a plane crashes, a federal agency begins an automatic and immediate investigation. Olivia Upham, whose brother was close to where shots were first fired, thought something like that would happen after a school shooting.  “I assumed that an outside agency, whether it be the attorney general, or the FBI, or some sort of commission of education and rule of law experts, would come in and help us with that,” said Upham, who, along with her mother, taught at Oxford’s middle school at the time.  In fact, comprehensive, third-party reviews of school shootings aren’t particularly common.  They typically happen in high-profile cases, said Densley of the Violence Project. “Higher body counts mean more scrutiny, more media attention, more parents who are asking questions about their loved ones.”  Even then, it’s a patchwork process. Multiple government agencies may issue distinct, sometimes overlapping reports, each informed by different investigative tools. Private companies, which may boast of former law enforcement officers and risk management professionals on their staff, are more often brought in for security assessments than for accountability reviews. Victim privacy and preserving a defendant’s right to a fair criminal trial also can add complexity.  Stephen J. Sedensky III, the local state’s attorney who authored one of several reports on the Sandy Hook shooting, said in an email that such reviews by public agencies are “often necessary and helpful in answering questions the public may have, in assisting policy and law makers and in preventing speculation as to the unknown.”  However, he noted, even with numerous Sandy Hook reports, speculation and conspiracies still took root in a vocal minority. “Victims’ families suffered and continue to suffer.”  Parkland is unusual in how thoroughly it was investigated. The state appointed a commission with parents, educators, law enforcement, advocates, public officials and mental health professionals. Even with the alleged shooter facing trial, the commission issued the preliminary report before the first anniversary. Within 20 months, it delivered its full 389-page report.  It was a deep dive into the shooter’s life and exposed chaotic breaches of protocol by school officials and law enforcement. The report catalyzed a number of significant new policies. The commission, which is funded by Florida’s Legislature through 2026, continues to address school safety and threat assessment statewide.  Max Schachter, a commissioner whose 14-year-old son died in the Parkland shooting, said the work was difficult “because every time we met, I basically had to relive Alex’s murder all over again.”  But, he said, the commission is devoted to making sure “that something good comes from this tragedy.”  ‘We couldn’t be true to our community’  Both of Steve St. Juliana’s daughters were at Oxford High School the day of the shooting. Only one came home.  Hana — athletic, empathetic, “a really bright soul,” her dad said — was shot and killed. As early details emerged about the shooter’s interactions with school officials, St. Juliana said he tried “desperately to give them the benefit of doubt.”  School officials sent some signals that they wanted to get answers for families like his.  Within a week, Oxford’s superintendent and the school board president at the time called for a third-party review. The board subsequently voted 7-0 on an eight-part resolution for a review that “will look far beyond the criminal investigation and into all the systemic factors that were at play.”  But by then, Mullins had assumed a large role in shaping decisions, advising the board and speaking on behalf of the district. Scarcely three hours after the shooting stopped, the district’s insurance company, SET SEG, connected Mullins with Oxford.  The insurer retained Mullins, and it would come at no cost to the district, according to a Nov. 30 email from a SET SEG claim manager to two top school officials. Mullins can “provide any legal assistance you may need.”  Mullins’ speciality: school immunity. He has successfully defended districts when a school conducted strip searches of students and when a football player died at practice.  Tom Donnelly, then the school board president, told ProPublica that it seemed that Mullins never wanted a review. “He had no intention of it happening.”  Mullins later told a Detroit News reporter that a review was premature and a waste of money. “Any lawyer would say don’t talk to anybody but us,” he said.  In December, state Attorney General Dana Nessel made her first of three offers for an investigation. The district turned her down. Mullins replied to Nessel in an email saying the district was already cooperating with the local prosecutor and sheriff, according to The Detroit News.  “I’m disappointed, quite honestly,” Nessel said on CNN. She said she hoped the district “cares as much about the safety of their students as they do shielding themselves from civil liability.”  Weeks passed. Months. No investigation.  To St. Juliana, the stakes couldn’t have been higher. “If you can’t even talk about it, if you can’t even admit what you did wrong, how are you supposed to fix it?” he said. “And we’re just supposed to have faith that you’re going to fix this behind the scenes? … And, more and more, you find out just how badly they messed up.”  A small cohort of community members began to conduct their own investigation of sorts, exploring not only Oxford’s policies on paper but its practices. They questioned whether Oxford consistently trained staff in threat assessment — a process for determining if a student poses a threat of violence — and whether it had in place the threat assessment team described in its own policies. If there was such a team, they asked, why wasn’t it activated in November 2021?  “We were not prepared,” said Danielle Krozek, an Oxford mom. “And so as a parent with a kid in school now, are we prepared now?”  In an email to community members in January 2022, the superintendent at the time said that “we have always taken threats very seriously and will continue to listen to students and parents who report threats to the district. In reminding everyone to ‘say something if you see something’ we are in no way suggesting that our community has ever hesitated to do so in the past.”  The principal, administrators, teachers and support staff “followed their training and implemented our District’s detailed emergency plans and protocol” on Nov. 30, 2021, and “put the safety of our students above their own safety,” wrote then-Superintendent Tim Throne, who has since retired.  The board insisted that a formal review couldn’t proceed because it would interfere with the criminal cases against the shooter and his parents. Two former board members said they believed this because of what Mullins told them.  The prosecutor’s office contradicted that explanation. Following inquiries from parents, it sent a March 4 letter to Oxford families saying that a review wouldn’t interfere with criminal proceedings — and that it had communicated this to school attorneys, too.  “To be clear,” the letter said, “decisions about what, when and how to conduct any investigation or assessment are up to the School Board and the community, and our office is not asking anyone to delay those efforts.”  But board members continued to blame looming legal cases for the delay. Lawyers for the district never delivered the prosecutor’s message to them, according to Donnelly and former board member Korey Bailey. They felt they had few options. Their understanding, they said, was that if they didn’t heed the advice of the attorney retained for Oxford by SET SEG, the insurer could rescind its coverage.  “Insurance companies had us by the throats,” Donnelly said. “We couldn’t be honest, and we couldn’t do our jobs, and we couldn’t be true to our community.”  Parents forwarded the prosecutor’s message to school officials, spoke at meetings and held a press conference. Donnelly and Bailey acknowledge it took two more months for the board to realize that the parents were right. In May, after the prosecutor’s office issued a letter affirming its support for an independent investigation, the board changed course. It retained its own law firm and soon hired Guidepost.  “I did not feel the level of confidence and trust in the attorney from the insurance company to allow him to continue representing me as a board member,” Bailey said, “and I strongly supported the board finding our own legal representation that we could trust.”  As Guidepost began seeking interviews with school employees, Mullins played a role in urging union members to be careful about participating.  Doug Pratt, the Michigan Education Association’s director for public affairs, told ProPublica in an email that the union passed along Mullins’ advice, which he said was that “members who are or could be litigants shouldn’t participate in the third party review, which is voluntary.” Some members have participated, and some declined, Pratt said.  In an email to ProPublica, Mullins said that “critical witnesses have all been interviewed by law enforcement officials. They have also been deposed — under oath — by victims’ attorneys. Their sworn testimony has been set forth in voluminous transcripts, which are available to all parties and were provided to Guidepost by my firm.”  By fall, Donnelly and Bailey had seen enough. They resigned from the board and held a press conference alleging failures in Oxford’s threat assessment practices.  Bailey said he believes that in the aftermath of school shootings, there needs to be a high-level agency that automatically investigates what happened. Without one, “the school’s insurance company was allowed to come in and take charge.”  D’Alessandro, the current board president, said he’s aware of the community’s anxiety and mistrust as it waits for answers. “Sometimes the messaging that comes out from the legal system and the legal teams isn’t necessarily reflective of that of what the school district is trying to do,” he said.  In January, Guidepost reported that it didn’t have interviews with 20% to 30% of witnesses and 50% to 60% of critical witnesses. Noting the absence of criminal allegations against school personnel and immunity protections for government employees, Guidepost urged people to come forward.  Over nearly 18 months, Oxford has taken steps to invest in the physical security of the high school, as this month’s 179-page report documented. That includes installing a weapons screening system at several entrances, using a camera-based artificial intelligence technology intended to detect weapons and mandating that students only carry clear backpacks during the school day. It also made changes to its threat assessment protocol. The report described strengths in current policies and practices, as well as gaps and excesses.  That’s not enough, said Brian Cooper, the father of two high schoolers. He wants to see the report on what went wrong. “I feel like they’re delaying it intentionally to make people give up. And that’s damaging for families that lost children, and had their children shot.”  ‘You are running out of time’  Oxford will soon graduate the second class of students who escaped with their lives.  “You are running out of time to look these kids in the eye and tell them what was broken on Nov. 30,” 2021, said Renee Upham at an April board meeting. Along with her daughter Olivia, she used to teach at Oxford Middle School, and her son was inside the school during the shooting.  In March, a circuit court dismissed civil allegations against the district and its employees, including school counselors and the dean of students, affirming that the defendants are protected from the claims against them by governmental immunity. An appeal is expected. On Friday, a federal judge issued an opinion on 10 related lawsuits, granting them in part and dismissing them in part. The claims that Hopkins, Ejak and Oxford Community Schools presented a state-created danger can go forward.  “I don’t want to make a profit off of this. This is about forcing them to change,” said Andrea Jones, co-founder of the student-parent group Change4Oxford, which initiated a federal lawsuit. “And it’s really sad, if you think about it, that we have to bring a lawsuit to do that.”  The community remains shaken, and tensions roil. An Instagram account run by students shares their poetry, with titles like “Stuck,” “Why” and “Nothing will happen if we do nothing.” Parents report problems with bullying and kids struggling to attend class in the same building where they were shot at.  Some students, including Reina St. Juliana, Hana’s sister, created the group No Future Without Today to prevent future tragedies. She and her father advocated at the state Capitol for gun safety bills, which, after a February shooting at Michigan State University, were signed into law.  And a battle is brewing over the May 18 graduation ceremony. Many students want to wear orange cords sent to them by Students Demand Action, which is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group. But the superintendent said in a statement that no unapproved apparel is allowed.  Family members protested in emails to school officials. Despite the school’s “lack of procedures and protocols that allowed November 30 to happen, these students continue to show up and participate to earn enough credits to graduate,” wrote Chalmers Fitzpatrick, an Oxford mom. “They want to wear orange, and this should be a no-brainer.”  After hearing from family members and students, the district offered to let students wear navy and gold cords to acknowledge “the incomparable challenges they have had to face in their journey.”  “I get the impression they want people to graduate, move on, forget,” Olivia Upham said. “The less people in Oxford that were there that day, the less pressure they’re going to get.”"

Dan Taylor said on Monday, he discovered a bullet just feet from one of his windows.  “It’s 125 inches from my house on my driveway, when the night before I had family members for Mother’s Day parked right here,” Taylor told KSL TV.  Taylor said it was only the latest concerning event on his property.  Over the past three years, he said he had discovered as many as 10 bullet holes through sheds and elsewhere on his farm.  “It’s frustrating.”  Taylor said he believed the bullets and bullet holes were coming from target shooting just over the hill to the east of his property.  Neighbors acknowledged the area above the Payson dump was a popular spot for shooters.  “It’s got to be pretty much in a straight line, and they’re just coming over that saddle and right to where we’re at,” Taylor said as he pointed at the saddle-shaped ridgeline.  Taylor reported the most recent case to police.  A spokesman for the Santaquin Police Department, which is tasked with patrolling the Genola area, said officers had been investigating issues related to errant target shooting over the past three years.  According to the spokesman, the department was also concerned about the potential safety issue posed by the errant shots and had urged the Bureau of Land Management to shut down target shooting in that specific area.  Efforts to reach BLM officials Tuesday evening did not immediately result in a response.  Numerous signs were visible in the target shooting area, warning prospective shooters that homes are on the other side of the ridge.  Taylor wasn’t the only neighbor to voice worries. Mike Olsen said he also had found several bullet holes on his property in recent years, and displayed a bullet he found behind his wife’s car next to his house.  “It just seems like if you’re standing out there, you’re just a target,” Olsen said. “There’s so many little kids around this town riding 4-wheelers and their horses, and I’m just afraid one day, somebody’s going to get killed by a stray bullet.”  Taylor, while a KSL TV crew was present, spoke to another neighbor who had a scary experience.  “Ours came through the barn about five feet above my head when I was standing there,” the woman told Taylor while on speakerphone.  Taylor said he has no problem with guns or shooting in general.  “I was born with a gun in my hand,” the former law enforcement officer-turned-farmer laughed.  He urged people to be careful, but he and Olsen both agreed the problem likely wouldn’t go away until the area was shut down to target shooting.  “It’s scary,” Taylor said. “It’s only a matter of time until a person gets hit, something of value gets hit. I’ve got a lot of equipment here. I’ve got a lot of livestock here, and it’s only a matter of time until a person or something valuable is going to get hit. And who is going to be liable? There’s no way of knowing who pulled the trigger over there a mile-and-a-half away, so they walk away and say it was an accident, so the only way to stop that from happening is to close it down for shooting completely.”"

""The power of God just showed brightly and gave me an opportunity to fight through this process and evil is not going to win,"" said Walker, 46, as he sat next to the doctor who treated him and his attorney.  Eight people were killed, including three children. Seven others were injured when a gunman opened fire on innocent shoppers and employees at the busy outdoor shopping center on May 6.  Walker lives in Lewisville but is originally from Lafayette, Louisiana. He is the father of an adult daughter and works in the insurance industry. He said had just dropped off his girlfriend at a store at the mall because it was so busy. When he drove off to find parking, he encountered a barrage of gunfire.  ""I didn't see the shooter, I just felt the shots,"" explained Walker.  Dashcam video for another car showed the moment when the gunman parked his car in the middle of the parking lot and started walking toward the mall. Walker happened to be driving by when he was shot three times.  ""When you see the shots to the windshield you're going to wonder, 'how he's even sitting here today?'"" said Daryl K. Washington, Walker's attorney.  ""I knew I was bleeding profusely, so I got out of my vehicle and I saw what appeared to be a security officer approaching on a Segway and I ran towards that way,"" explained Walker who then encountered Christian LaCour, the Allied Universal security guard who was working at the time and died while helping others to safety.  He said he was running, which turned into jogging and walking and LaCour told him to sit down due to his injuries.  ""And he was behind me and, I don’t have much to say after that. The tragedy occurred,"" he shared.  Walker said he had never been shot before and spoke about how he relied on his faith to get him through the tragedy and the days after.  ""Anytime I am in trouble, I call on the Lord. So I began to praise him, be thankful and glorify him, and I asked him for his protection,"" said Walker.  He was taken to Medical City McKinney, which is about three miles from the Allen Premium Outlets. He was the first of eight patients from the shooting to arrive about 14 minutes after it began, according to the hospital.  He underwent a couple of surgeries to address his injuries. Last week, his daughter spoke about her father's condition and the long journey ahead.  On Tuesday during the news conference, Dr. Elizabeth Kim, MD., who is the trauma director for Medical City McKinney, said they were concerned not only for Walker's bullet wounds but the bullet fragments around his head, neck, chest and arm.  She said he didn't need surgery immediately on that Saturday, but was given a CT scan to see how deep the bullet wounds were. Kim said there were several bullet fragments they were extremely worried about.  ""The bullet was this close to his heart,"" said Kim as she used her index finger and thumb in a pinching motion to illustrate how close he was to death.  ""He had multiple wounds; too many to even count. On his head, shoulder, neck, chest. All those places and some of those bullet tracks were so extensive we actually had to open him up and clean everything out underneath,"" explained Kim.  Walker remains at the hospital and will now begin his rehabilitation process. Medical City McKinney said they're still taking care of three other patients from the shooting.  For Walker, he echoed how his attitude and belief system are helping him push forward.  ""I believe you give love, you get love, and that is why I am here today,"" he said.  Tuesday afternoon Irvin Walker, a survivor of the mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, talked about his recovery and experience.  Hospital staff also shared their experience in treating patients who were brought there from the Allen Premium Outlets.  ""On May 6, in a matter of minutes, our community was shaken and lives were changed forever. A matter of minutes could have altered the course of my life. My family and I had just gotten home from the Allen mall when I received the notification that there was a shooting there. And after the fact, I learned that we had walked the exact same path that the shooter had gone less than an hour before. I came directly to Medical City McKinney, where we immediately stood up the command center,"" said Cassidi Summers, a Registered Nurse who is the chief nursing officer at Medical City McKinney.  She said prior training for critically injured trauma patients prepared them for this moment.  More than 100 nurses, surgeons, physicians, leaders and support staff from Medical City McKinney and across the Medical City Health Care system were in place and ready to go.  Kim said she was at a wedding reception for a hospital colleague when the call came in. She said she left immediately and began coordinating care with surgeons, mobilizing anesthesiologists, blood and so forth within her 20-minute drive.  Once she arrived, Kim said she too could see that their drills and training prepared them for that day. She also commented on a moment that stood out.  ""You had a smile there that I saw when I came in that room, it really was one of the bright parts of that day, you were calm and an inspiration for me,"" said Kim to Walker who replied with a ""Thank You"" during the news conference.  Walker said he has a long journey ahead but credited not only his faith but his support system -- his family and his Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. brothers who have been there with him at the hospital and were there with him during the news conference.  ""I never imaged that I would have to experience this, but I also didn't imagine that, that many people love me,"" said Walker about the support from family, friends and strangers he's received over the past 10 days.  He also took time to thank his fraternity brothers, who he said have really stepped up.  ""There's a word that we use when a lot of us are going through the membership intake process and it's the word 'heavy,' you know, and heavy describes adversity, it describes a time that most people regret in their lives, and these guys make sure that I'm not heavy. They absorb the burden off of me to take care of my family or all of my worries and they make sure I'm not heavy, so I'm grateful to the brothers, all fraternities, all sororities, doesn't matter the ethnic background, I've been getting love from everywhere, but I am grateful to my brothers,"" said Walker.  As for those who were injured or killed during the shooting, he said, ""It's a horrible situation. It hurts to have to see people suffer. To see their family or kids pass away,"" said Walker who asked for continued prayers for the community.  With the outpouring of support for the victims of the mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, GoFundMe has launched a centralized hub for all verified fundraisers related to the shooting. The online fundraising platform said it was working around the clock to make sure that all funds donated go directly to survivors or the families of victims."

(Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News)  Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes  OGDEN — An Ogden man has been sentenced to four years of probation after pleading guilty and mentally ill in a 2022 accidental shooting that led to the death of a 14-year-old boy.  Zedekiah Mendel Pool, 19, pleaded guilty and mentally ill to manslaughter, a second-degree felony, in January as part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to a term of one to 15 years in the Utah State Prison, but that term was suspended if his probation is successfully completed.  Pool is also required to finish serving 363 days in jail, 354 of which were already completed as of April 25.  On May 5, 2022, police were called to 468 River Drive in Ogden following the report of a gunshot wound. They discovered that 14-year-old Richard Michael ""Mikey"" Mendenhall Jr. had been accidentally shot in the neck.  A GoFundMe account* says Mikey died before paramedics could reach him. ""They brought him back using CPR, but at the time Mikey had already had lack of oxygen for 20 minutes. Mikey was brain dead,"" it states. He died three days later at a hospital.  ""Mikey ended up donating his liver, heart, and kidneys to other children in need,"" the account says.  The post also explains that Mikey was at a friend's house when Pool, ""a newly moved-in roommate,"" brought out the gun.  Police believe Pool was moving the slide on a handgun when the weapon fired in the living room, with the bullet hitting the boy. They do not believe Pool meant to aim at the teen.  ""Follow-up investigation has determined that defendant had consumed marijuana less than five hours prior to the shooting and used and possessed his firearm while he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance,"" court documents state.  In exchange for Pool's plea, charges of possessing equipment for a clandestine laboratory, a second-degree felony, and possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person, a third-degree felony, were dismissed.  *KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

Brooke County Prosecutor Joseph Barki said, in a statement released Tuesday, “Upon a complete and thorough investigation, which included the review of hours of body cam footage and recordings, the State Police has determined that the involved officer exercised a proper and justified use of force, which unfortunately led to the death of Joseph Anthony Henderson, 43.”  Brooke County Sheriff Rich Beatty reported earlier that Follansbee Police and deputies were dispatched after the county’s emergency 911 call center received a call that Henderson was attempting to break into a home on Highland Street at about 12:30 a.m.  Beatty said Henderson was found soon after in his own home elsewhere on the street and had refused to come out for four hours.  The initial investigating officers had been joined by members of the West Virginia State Police and special response teams from Weirton Police and the Brooke and Hancock county sheriffs’ departments.  Barki said, “During multiple attempts to communicate with Mr. Henderson, he made multiple references regarding his possession and intent to use a .40 caliber handgun and potentially shoot law enforcement officers.”  “Thereafter, he exited the residence with what appeared to be a semiautomatic handgun in his hand and his actions thereafter required the use of force,” said Barki.  He said the weapon was found to be an air gun modeled in appearance after a Walther CP99 semiautomatic handgun.  Beatty said earlier that after tear gas was released into the house, Henderson emerged from the rear, brandishing the handgun, and was shot by one of his deputies.  Henderson was transported to a Pittsburgh hospital where he was later pronounced dead.  Barki said he “met with the lead investigator from the West Virginia State Police to review the investigative materials and collect evidence and determined that there does not appear to be any evidence to establish that the involved officer had committed a criminal act. Accordingly, no charges will be presented to the Brooke County grand jury for consideration.”  (Scott can be contacted at wscott@heraldstaronline.com.)"

The Covenant School and Covenant Presbyterian Church filed motions to intervene in lawsuits calling for the Metro Nashville Police Department to release several records relating to the mass shooting.  The school wrote that the requested records may include confidential information that could endanger its school's students and faculty if released.  ""The records sought ... may include and/or relate to sensitive information owned by The Covenant School, including, but not limited to the schematics of school facilities, and confidential information pertaining to The Covenant School employees and students,"" the school wrote in its expedited motion to intervene, filed Monday. ""The release of such information could cause security and safety issues.""  The requested documents include the shooter's writings as well as nearly all police communications about the writings, including ""emails, texts and other communications.""  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch earlier characterized the shooter's writings more as ""ramblings"" rather than pointing to any clear motive.  Covenant is hoping to argue its motion to intervene at a status conference set for Monday afternoon in one of the lawsuits.  The plaintiff in that case, Clata Brewer, acting on behalf of the National Police Association, didn't object to Covenant's request. Brewer wrote in a response on Monday that she does not oppose the motion to intervene ""for the limited purpose of allowing Covenant Church to claim the specific interest it alleges.""  Covenant filed a nearly identical motion in another lawsuit seeking the shooter's writings filed last week by the owner of the conservative radio station The Tennessee Star.  Meanwhile, calls for the release of records related to the shooting are growing in the statehouse. On Monday, the House GOP delivered a letter signed by 66 of the House's 74 Republican members to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake asking that the shooter's writings and ""all relevant medical records and toxicology reports"" be released. The letter doesn't specify what medical records the legislators consider relevant.  Republicans argued that the writings are needed to understand the shooter's motives ahead of a special legislative session on gun reform called by Gov. Bill Lee.  ""We are united in our shared common goal and duty to protect the safety and wellbeing of Tennesseans. The release of these records is critical to the General Assembly's ability to construct effective solutions that can prevent future acts of violence,"" they wrote.  House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, responded in a statement that Republicans have refused to reach across the aisle on gun safety legislation because they've been ""bizarrely focused on a diary.""  “Gun violence is an epidemic plaguing our communities and threatening the safety of every family on a daily basis. The people of Tennessee deserve courageous and sensible leadership on this issue. These GOP delay tactics only serve to leave our families exposed and vulnerable. Meanwhile, Democrats are researching and drafting potential legislation that an overwhelming majority of Tennesseans support,"" Clemmons said. ""I hope to see as many GOP signatures on our bipartisan gun safety legislation as they got on that letter.”  The legislature will reconvene for the special session on Aug. 21.

Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the carnage, which also left 17 wounded.  In the 12 months since one of the bloodiest school shootings in U.S. history transformed this quiet Texas community into another example of the nation’s complicated relationship with guns, the parents of the children killed last May 24 have not moved on.  Some have harnessed their anger into political action, wielding it like a shield to protect themselves from getting lost in their pain. Others have seen their worlds shrink under the weight of unrelenting grief, with only close friends and family allowed inside their increasingly insular worlds.  Of the six parents NBC interviewed in Uvalde, all said the shooting remains fresh in their minds. They said they still expect to hear their children’s voices when they wake up in the morning or when someone tells a joke that would have made their kids laugh. They have built makeshift memorials filled with toys, photos and other memories that have remained as vibrant as the day they were made.  “We take it day by day,” said Brett Cross, whose 10-year-old son, Uziyah Garcia, was among those killed last year. “There’s no good days anymore. There’s just all-right days.”  Uziyah's dad  On a breezy April afternoon, Brett Cross slowly shook his head as he gazed at his son’s memorial in the Uvalde town square. It’s just one of almost two dozen similar memorials surrounding a large fountain in a lush municipal park. Murals of the 21 victims light up public walls throughout the city, turning Uvalde into an outdoor gallery filled with colorful works by various Texas artists.  Adorned with flowers and handwritten notes, Uziyah’s memorial stands apart from the others with its oversize stuffed lion and red Spiderman basket.  “Time doesn’t heal,” Cross said, exhausted from a recent trip to Austin where he joined other families and advocates pushing for a gun bill that would raise the minimum age from 18 to 21 for buying an assault-style weapon.  Cross has become a full-time gun reform activist and one of the most vocal proponents of new gun laws in the year since his son was killed, driving three hours every week to the Texas capital to champion tougher laws that supporters say would prevent future tragedies. He now has more than 58,000 followers on Twitter, regularly speaks with elected leaders and trained himself to speak out after mass shootings."

A security guard had carried the boy inside the library and attempted to render aid to him and keep him alive until an ambulance arrived.  ""I heard shots go off, and I knew it was close by – so I came down,"" Christian said.  The 12-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital of Cook County in fair condition.

Officers found an adult male suspect, and a female suspect, nearby in the 3900 block of West Madison Street – and arrested both of them. Police radio traffic suggests the female suspect could be as young as 10 years old.

The attorney’s office says concerned citizens told the FBI in September about Smith’s disturbing behavior at a gun range. Over the next couple of months, court documents state that Smith started talking with an FBI confidential source through social media and said he is “pro-mass shooting” and sympathized and admired past school shooters.  RELATED: ‘Pro-mass shooting’ suspect arrested in Savage had machine gun, wanted to ‘fight the police’  Federal authorities also learned Smith had access to an AR-style rifle, handguns, body armor and a Kevlar helmet, and he studied his “enemy” by watching police bodycam videos of shootings.  According to federal prosecutors, Smith asked a different confidential FBI source for auto sears on Nov. 17, hoping to make his AR-15 rifle and handguns into fully automatic weapons.

Yuma Police Chief Thomas Garrity gives speaks at a news conference Monday on a shooting at a weekend house party that left two people dead and five injured. Credit Yuma Police Department  Garrity said several weapons were recovered from the scene and investigators continue to work to identify those responsible for the deadly gunfire. He asked anyone with information about the episode to contact the police.  ""We want to talk to everyone because we want to make sure that we get the people who are responsible for this and hold them responsible for this heinous event,"" Garrity said.  A $1,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible, police said.  The gunfire erupted about 10:54 p.m. Saturday when an altercation broke out at the party that had grown from just a few people in attendance to more than 100 after word of the party was posted on social media, Garrity said.  ""We can confirm that this was a house party that was going on and that all individuals involved in this are known to each other,"" Garrity said.  He said four off-duty law enforcement officers were in the area at the time of the shooting, heard the gunfire, responded to the scene and began providing first aid to those injured and assisting arriving on-duty officers.  He said one of the gravely wounded victims, Garcia, was taken to a hospital by private car prior to police arriving. The teenager was pronounced dead at Yuma Regional Medical Center a short time after being taken there, police said.  Officers found Blackthunder at the scene suffering from a gunshot wound and he was taken by the Yuma Fire Department to Yuma Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said.  Five other teenagers, ranging in age from 15 to 19, were wounded, Garrity said. Two remained hospitalized in stable condition Monday afternoon and three were treated and released on Sunday morning, Garrity said.  The chief said the owner of the home where the shooting occurred was out of town and that a relative hosted the party that prompted an earlier noise complaint that officers did not respond to.  ""That night, there were a lot of parties going on throughout the Yuma community with all the graduations and stuff,"" said Garrity, adding that the noise complaint was made about 55 minutes before the shooting while officers were tied up on other calls. ""There was no indication that there was any type of violence going on, which would have made it a priority one call."""

Michael Williams, known as Sheff G, is among 32 purported street gang members charged Tuesday in a series of shootings in Brooklyn that left one person dead and a dozen more injured.  According to the indictment, the defendants are all members of 8 Trey Crips and its affiliate, the 9 Ways gang, and allegedly committed shootings, possessed guns and used stolen cars to eliminate rivals that included members of Folk Nation Gangster Disciples and ICG Babiiez.  The indictment covers 27 alleged acts of violence, including 12 shootings.  ""The senseless gun violence, allegedly committed by these defendants, terrorized our neighbors for years and left more than a dozen people with serious injuries. It is distressing to know that some of the violence was allegedly fueled by a young man who used money he made from a successful music career to allegedly pay for and encourage acts of violence,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said.  Williams offered money and expensive jewelry to those who carried out acts of violence, prosecutors said.  The indictment also outlined one shooting in which Williams allegedly coordinated a group of three shooters, drove those shooters to the crime scene, and then acted as the getaway driver.  Michael Williams in a mugshot provided by Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. Brooklyn District Attorney's Office  Williams was expected to appear in court on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear who his attorney is.  One of the charges stems from a mass shooting on Oct. 21, 2020, where one defendant, Kamondre Dekattu, is allegedly captured on surveillance video emerging from the sunroof of a white Infiniti and opening fire while other individuals fired guns from the driver's side and rear driver's side windows.  An alleged Folk Nation rival, Theodore Senior, 23, was killed and five other alleged Folk Nation members were shot and injured.  Dekattu is charged with the murder and his co-conspirators, including Williams and his sister, Crystal Williams, are charged with being part of the conspiracy to commit murder, for this incident and others.  Two days after the homicide, Michael Williams allegedly hosted a lavish dinner with his fellow 8 Trey Crips and 9 Ways members, including Tegan Chambers, at a Manhattan steakhouse to celebrate the death of Theodore Senior and the injuries of the five other shooting victims.  ""Sheff G became a prominent member of this gang and became central to our investigation,"" Gonzalez said during a news conference. ""Sheff G used a lot of the money that he earned to facilitate further gang activity. He encouraged gang members to participate in violent crimes."""

Police said an armed 17-year-old boy, identified by his family as Mekhi Franklin, was shot near an alleyway on Catherine Street while running from officers in Baltimore's Shipley Hill neighborhood around 1:30 p.m. on May 11.  Det Cedric Elleby is on administrative leave while the shooting remains under investigation. pic.twitter.com/WQ4n5jnUXA — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  Police identified the officer who opened fire as Detective Cedric Elleby, who has been a member of the BPD since 2019.  The video shows Detective Elleby sitting on a stoop next to Franklin but there is no audio until just before the foot pursuit. Family members and neighbors have said officers had been ""harassing"" the teen. The video does not show how the encounter began.  Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the officer was in the Southwest Baltimore neighborhood engaging with residents before a foot pursuit happened.  ""Until the behavior escalated, it caused the officer to heighten his attention, and then you saw the pursuit,"" Harrison said.  Harrison said the officer saw what he believed was a gun and approached the teen before he took off.  ""There are a number of things that are taught in training for officers to observe particularly bulges, the way the person stands or swings their arms or the shift in body stance,"" Harrison said. ""It is the way they adjust their arms to either keep the firearm from falling or to support it and keep it up. And sometimes they are fidgeting with something in their pocket.""  The video appears to show the 17-year-old boy pulling something out of his waistband and dropping it on the sidewalk after he was shot by Elleby during the foot chase after refusing the officer's commands.  Harrison said police recovered a stolen 9mm Smith & Wesson with an extended magazine with four rounds.  He said the weapon the teenager had was stolen from a vehicle in the Western District two years ago.  ""What we know is that this officer believed this person was armed and the subject fled and the officer felt the need to give pursuit,"" Harrison said. ""The officer observed him pull out the gun, just as you did, and the officer discharged his weapon.""  Harrison said the officer fired at least four shots, and Franklin was struck once. His condition has been upgraded from critical to stable.  Weapon was stolen out of automobile in the Western District in 2021. @wjz pic.twitter.com/fJkCBqtF8o — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  ""The decision to use deadly force is always based on the need—reasonable, proportionate and necessary—and the officer has to determine that in a second,"" Harrison said about police use of force.  Franklin's mother told WJZ the officer shot her son twice.  Officer Elleby has not yet been interviewed for the investigation.  Franklin's mother told WJZ he had past interactions with her son and questions remain about what led up to the encounter.  The detective has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.  Harrison said the department does not yet have all the answers it seeks but understands the high level of scrutiny involving the incident.  Police fired 4 times at the 17yo by my count. They say he refused commands to drop weapon pic.twitter.com/EHGXEyLliD — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  Harrison said the Shipley Hill neighborhood is a focal point for police because it is a ""historically violent area.""  ""This area is a focused area to provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime in this historically violent area,"" he said.  Harrison said that just in the past 28 days in the neighborhood, officers have responded to more than 150 calls for service, for assault, armed people, burglaries, disorderly persons and drugs.  Recently, officers walked with community members and discussed concerns about illegal dumping, boarded-up homes, and removing illegal cars from the streets.  Harrison said the police department and the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office are investigating this shooting.  ""We understand the high level of scrutiny that comes with any use of force by our officers or any law enforcement officers. We do not take that scrutiny lightly,"" Harrison said. ""While we do not have all information today, our office is committed to doing a thorough, transparent investigation along with our State's Attorney's Office.""  Elleby is a member of a District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Department's specialized units that focus on proactive patrols, warrant apprehension and other measures in areas of Baltimore where gun violence is most frequent.  The Maryland Attorney General's office told WJZ Friday it will not be investigating the shooting at this time.  One witness who spoke to WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren—and declined to give his name for security reasons—said the officer was harassing the teenager.  Franklin's mother also told WJZ the officer had been harassing her son. Harrison said there is no past record of formal complaints.  WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren asked the commissioner whether it has been determined whether the teen was shot in the back. Harrison responded to him by saying that ""it's unknown or undetermined right now which one of those entries is the entry wound and which one is an exit wound.""

Farmington police said during a Tuesday, May 16 news conference at the Farmington Civic Center that Wilson, who was shot dead by officers during the incident, purchased the rifle in November 2022, shortly after his birthday in October.  Wilson also used two handguns that belonged to relatives in the shooting, but Deputy Chief Kyle Dowdy said police did not know how he had obtained them.  Farmington Municipal School District spokesman Robert Taboada said Wilson was a senior at the school and was enrolled in classes, but he said he could not say if Wilson was due to graduate with his class, which was scheduled to go through commencement exercises on May 16. He said the district would not have any more information to release about Wilson until May 17.  Dowdy said Wilson walked down North Dustin Avenue in Farmington shortly before 11 a.m. Monday firing indiscriminately.  Deputy Chief Baric Crum said investigators had counted approximately 150 rounds that were fired over the quarter-mile crime scene, but he expected that number to go up as the investigation continued.  It took the four responding police officers minutes to locate Wilson after several calls reporting shots fired in the neighborhood.  By then Wilson had already shot and killed three people: Shirley Voita, 79, Melody Ivie, 73, and Gwendolyn Schofield, 98. Two of the women shot were mother and daughter, though law enforcement did not make clear which of the victims were related.  Among those injured were Farmington Police Sgt. Rachel Discenza, a 10-year veteran of the department who was shot in the pelvis during the encounter, and New Mexico State Police Officer Andreas Stamatiadas. Stamatiadas and Dicenza were treated for their injuries and released.  Dowdy said the responding officers fired at least 16 shots at Wilson, killing him in front of a local church.  Dowdy and Crum said numerous other people were treated for injuries at the hospital or at the scene. Crum said not all those people were shot, explaining that some of them were injured when Wilson shot at the vehicle they were riding in and the windshield or windows shattered.  Dowdy said police have been unable to establish any link between the gunman and his victims.  “There’s nothing to suggest he knew any of the people,” he said, describing Wilson’s choice of victims as arbitrary.  Police said Wilson’s family members indicated during interviews with investigators that the student may have been experiencing some mental health issues. Wilson lived in Farmington but had multiple addresses, Dowdy said.  Crum said Wilson had a few minor infractions on his juvenile record, but there was nothing in his history to suggest he was capable of performing such an act or that would have prevented him from legally purchasing an assault rifle.  All the victims who were injured in the shooting were riding in a vehicle at the time of the incident, police said, adding that no pedestrians or people inside a home were shot.  San Juan County Sheriff Shane Ferrari said his agency is handling the officer-involved shooting aspect of the incident, while the Farmington Police Department is handling the criminal investigation.  Crum said one of the officers in the group confronting Wilson was armed with a long rifle and another had a shotgun. The other two officers were armed with handguns, he said.  Farmington police are planning daily afternoon briefings on the investigation into the shooting as they unearth more information. Chief Steve Hebbe was in Pennsylvania for a family wedding at the time of the shooting and was traveling back to the city during Tuesday’s news conference.  Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett said a vigil for the victims would be held at 6 p.m. Wednesday, May 17 at the Farmington Museum at Gateway Park, 3041 E.

Roberts was not injured, but his vehicle was struck.  At approximately 4:29 p.m., a responding Uniform Patrol Deputy from the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office was traveling northbound in the 400-block of Eugene Street (Denham Springs) when he spotted the suspect vehicle stopped in the roadway. Roberts was outside of the vehicle armed with a rifle which he was pointing at the LPSO deputy.

U.S. Marshals arrested Aaron Anderson, 20, on April 26 in Sacramento in the shooting death of 19-year-old Jissel Segura, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Tuesday. Anderson was booked into Marion County Jail on May 13.  Authorities have provided little information about the death of Segura, a Woodburn-area resident.  A Marion County grand jury charged Anderson in a sealed indictment on March 10 with second-degree murder and two counts of unlawful use of a weapon.  The charges allege Anderson fatally shot Segura on March 1. He is also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to use it against another woman in February.  The fatal shooting was reported shortly after midnight on March 2. A 911 caller reported hearing gunshots on Northeast Embassy Way near Northeast Satter Drive in an unincorporated area of east Salem.  Dispatch logs show that Marion County sheriff’s deputies received the call at 12:08 a.m. and arrived six minutes later at the Embassy Court Apartments.  Deputies arrived to find a woman inside a vehicle with gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff’s office said at the time in a news release, which did not identify Segura by name.  Anderson pleaded guilty in 2019 to attempted second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault in Wasco County Circuit Court. The charges stemmed from an incident at a juvenile detention facility in the Dalles, according to court documents.  A circuit judge dismissed the charges in January 2021, granting a joint petition by Anderson and the district attorney to reconsider the conviction under SB 819. The new law allowed prosecutors and people in custody to jointly petition judges to reconsider a conviction or sentence for most offenses “if the original sentence no longer advances the interests of justice.”  Anderson’s next court appearance is scheduled for May 18 in Marion County Circuit Court.

Two of the women shot were mother and daughter, though law enforcement did not make clear which of the victims were related.  Among those injured were Farmington Police Sgt.

The suspect, whose shooting spree on Monday morning through a residential area of Farmington, New Mexico, ended when police shot him dead, was publicly identified on Tuesday as 18-year-old Beau Wilson, a student at Farmington High School.  Police said Wilson stalked a quarter-mile stretch of roadway on foot firing indiscriminately at cars, with some homes also being hit, before police confronted him outside a church, exchanging gunfire with Wilson to halt his advance.  Video footage showed Wilson, dressed in black, pacing around the church driveway holding what appeared to be a handgun with an extended, high-capacity magazine before he was killed.  The minutes-long burst of violence stirred hours of fear as police searched the area to ensure order was restored in the town, a major retail center and fossil energy hub about 180 miles (290 km) northwest of Albuquerque in an area known as the Four Corners because it is where four southwest states intersect.  The gunman's actions ""appear to be purely random and had no specific targets or motives that we can identify at this time,"" Farmington Deputy Police Chief Kyle Dowdy told a media briefing on Tuesday.  The women slain were identified as Gwendolyn Schofield, 97, and Melody Ivie, 73, a mother and daughter who were struck by gunfire together in their car, and Shirley Voita, 79, who was in a separate car.  Four other people in cars struck by gunfire or shrapnel were wounded, police said, along with two police officers who have since been released from a local hospital.  Wilson was staying at an address in the neighborhood where the shootings took place, but there was no indication he knew any of his victims, Dowdy said. Wilson had a history of ""minor infractions as a juvenile"" and was believed to have suffered from an unspecified mental illness, Dowdy said.  In addition to obtaining the assault-style rifle legally a month after he turned 18 in October 2022, Wilson is believed to have obtained two other firearms used in the shooting from family members, police said.  New Mexico has some of the least restrictive gun ownership laws in the country, with no minimum age to possess rifles and shotguns. The state generally prohibits anyone under age 19 to possess a handgun, according to the Giffords Law Center gun control organization.  Proposed legislation to ban the sale of many semi-automatic firearms, limit the capacity of ammunition magazines and impose a mandatory waiting period on gun purchases all failed to pass New Mexico’s legislature during its 2023 session.

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins cited insufficient evidence when announcing her decision on Monday. She released surveillance video of the incident along with other footage and documents that she said support her decision, asking that the public review all the evidence.  ""There will be a temptation, as human beings, to only view the video footage of this incident and nothing else,"" Jenkins said at a press conference. ""We are accustomed to seeing videos online, and that often is what captures our attention rather than going the extra step to look deeper.""  The incident took place at a Walgreens in downtown San Francisco on April 27 just after 6:30 p.m. PT, according to the police report. The surveillance video, which does not have sound, purportedly shows 24-year-old Banko Brown attempting to leave the store without paying for a bag full of items. An on-duty and lawfully armed security guard, 33-year-old Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, stops Brown then punches him repeatedly. The two struggle for less than a minute until Anthony pins Brown to the ground, as shoppers continue to enter and exit the store.  The video then purportedly shows Anthony letting go of Brown, who picks up the bag and heads for the exit. Brown turns around and walks backward out the door then appears to step toward Anthony. Anthony lifts his gun and fires a single shot, striking Brown in the chest. Brown falls to the ground just outside the store.

In an interview with police, Anthony said he told Brown to ""put the items back"" but that Brown ""refused"" and was ""aggressive."" Anthony said he went to take the items but that Brown fought to keep them and repeatedly threatened to stab him as a struggle ensued. Police said a knife was not found on Brown.  Anthony told police he didn't have any handcuffs and his partner was on break at the time, so he tried to hold Brown's arms back and put him in ""a chokehold-type move."" Anthony said he told Brown he would let him go if he calmed down. Anthony said he released Brown but drew his gun and kept it pointed at the ground in case Brown tried to stab him. Anthony said he fired the gun when Brown turned back around and advanced toward him, not realizing that Brown would just ""try to spit"" at him.  When asked for comment on Tuesday, a Walgreens spokesperson told ABC News: ""We are offering condolences to the victim's family during this difficult time. The safety of our patients, customers and team members is our top priority, and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in our stores.""

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins released the information amid public outcry over the April 27 death of Banko Brown, a 24-year-old who was not armed, outside a downtown Walgreens. Last week, the Board of Supervisors approved a resolution urging her office and the police department to release more evidence. She cited self-defense in her decision not to charge the guard, Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony.  But the release of surveillance video did not appear to quell critics in a city dogged by brazen shoplifting and wide division over the appropriate responses to crime, particularly when the suspect is homeless or impoverished.  The footage, which does not have sound, shows Brown heading for the door with a bag in his hand when he is stopped by Anthony, who then punches him repeatedly. The two struggle until Anthony pins Brown to the ground. Meanwhile, shoppers continued to enter the store during the confrontation.  When Anthony lets Brown go, Brown picks up the bag and moves to exit the store. He turns around and appears to step toward Anthony, at which point Anthony lifts his gun and shoots once, sending Brown falling back onto the ground outside.  In a police interview, Anthony said he told Brown to put the items back, but Brown was aggressive and fought to keep the items. He said he told Brown he would let him go if he calmed down, and that Brown kept saying he was going to stab him. A knife was not found on Brown.

He said he shot when Brown advanced, not realizing Brown would just spit at him.  San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton said in a statement that the video does not show justification for the shooting. He plans to join Board President Aaron Peskin in calling on the state attorney general for an independent review of the prosecutor’s decision.  But Jenkins, who initially discharged the case May 1, said that even after seeking more evidence, there was nothing to rebut the guard’s reasonable claim of self-defense. She pleaded with viewers to review all the evidence, including witness and police reports, especially since the video footage lacks sound.  “There will be a temptation, as human beings, to only view the video footage of this incident and nothing else. We are accustomed to seeing videos online, and that often is what captures our attention rather than going the extra step to look deeper,” she said in a news conference.

Supervisor Dean Preston introduced legislation last week so that private security guards could not draw their firearms unless there is an actual and specific threat to a person.  Walgreens did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Walgreens, Target and other merchants downtown have complained about brazen shoplifting. Whole Foods recently announced it would temporarily shutter a downtown location, citing employee safety.  Kingdom Group Protective Services, which provides security for Walgreens, said in a statement that it is cooperating with law enforcement and could not provide further comment.  State records show Anthony has been licensed as a security guard since 2012.  Jenkins became district attorney last year after voters ousted her predecessor, Chesa Boudin, over criticism that he was too soft on crime. She pledged to be a fair but tough prosecutor who would not ignore blatant retail theft and open-air drug dealing.  Associated Press reporter Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed."

Mekhi’s message to those doing the shooting: “Instead of going and trying to hurt someone you should first try to go and love someone. You can ruin their life; but my life is not ruined.”  The victims of gun violence in Chicago are increasingly some of the city’s youngest residents.

The girl had been in critical condition since the May 3 attack.

A girl who was gravely wounded in a mass shooting in a school in Belgrade earlier this month has died, bringing the death toll to 10, authorities said on Monday.  The girl died on Monday morning at a children's clinic in Belgrade, Serbia's health ministry said, according to official media. The girl had been in critical condition with head injuries following the May 3 attack, said a statement.  The shooting happened in the Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school in central Belgrade when a 13-year-old boy took his father's gun and opened fire, initially killing eight children and a school guard, and wounding six students and a teacher.  The first ever school shooting in Serbia stunned the Balkan country. A day later a 20-year-old randomly fired from an automatic weapon in two villages south of Belgrade, killing eight people and wounding 14.  The two mass killings in as many days triggered calls for action. Tens of thousands of people have marched in protests in Belgrade and other towns and cities demanding resignations of top officials and a ban on pro-government television stations that air violent content and host war criminals and crime figures.  RUSSIAN WILDFIRES TEAR THROUGH URALS, SIBERIA  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Serbia's populist government has launched a gun crackdown that includes a one-month amnesty for those who voluntarily hand over unregistered weapons, as well as stricter control of gun owners, a moratorium on new licenses and prison sentences for possession of illegal guns.  Police have said that citizens handed over some 13,500 various weapons by Sunday. The amnesty period will last until June 8 but analysts have warned that similar actions in the past have had limited success.  Critics of populist President Aleksandar Vucic say the increasingly authoritarian Serbian leader who is a former pro-Russian ultranationalist, has contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance in society by fostering hate speech against opponents and taking strict control over mainstream media and state institutions.  Vucic has denied this. He has suggested that he might call an early election for September in response to the protests and mounting public pressure over the shootings."

Porfiri directs NYU’s Dynamical Systems Laboratory and the Center for Urban Science and Progress. Succar is a engineering graduate student in Porfiri’s lab focusing on complex systems and network science.  Left photo courtesy of Maurizio Porfiri; right photo courtesy of Rayan Succar  How can we discourage mass shootings?  Maurizio Porfiri: Our work supports a no-notoriety approach, in which we want to dry up the news about mass shootings—limit the number of details—and try to disentangle the presentation of the mass shooting news from the fame it can get.  If we provide too many details, then if I am somebody who is trying to gain fame, I will use these details to plan an attack that you don’t expect, something society is not aware of. We find in our new study that the more mass shootings differ from previous history, the more they capture the attention of the public. It seems that fame-seeking mass shooters don’t aim for a high death count, but try to stand out in other ways.  Rayan Succar: We quantify fame by looking at Wikipedia. So for each shooting, we see how many people visited this Wikipedia page over time. We controlled for the number of victims and casualties, and we did not find any correlation between surprise and lethality for fame-seeking mass shooters. So they see surprise as a path to fame that’s independent of the death count.  We want to dry up the news about mass shootings.  Porfiri: From that point of view, it can help to set good guidelines and practice for the media to talk about mass shootings. On the preventative point of view, it adds some level of alert, which is related to red flag laws. Red flag laws, which can remove firearms from a person who seems to be a danger to themselves or others, have to do with some hint that some event, however unlikely, can happen, and it’s a good idea to follow up on it. When people are thinking about trying to gain fame through mass shooting, they’re looking at the details of past mass shootings and trying to distinguish themselves so as not to be the same.    Say you hear about something that to you is like, “Oh, no, nobody’s ever done it. So maybe it’s not going to happen.” No, pay attention to even these details, report them, and we should act with red flag laws to prevent any possible mass shootings that could occur.

When Feng Feng Lee saw a strange man with closely cropped white hair at her church, she didn’t think much of it.  Hours later, the man opened fire at a luncheon, wounding five parishioners and killing a 52-year-old man who had accompanied his mother to church.  Now, Lee has flashbacks about that day a year ago at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. Her husband, a doctor, checking on the injured as they cried out in pain. The agonized words from the mother of the man who died charging at the gunman — she did not want her son to be a hero but only to be there with her.  Shooting survivor Feng Feng Lee speaks at the one-year anniversary of the attack at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  Advertisement  Lee can’t shake the guilt that she should have done more.  “We didn’t prevent the stranger from coming. … The bad guy pretended to be one of us,” said Lee, 77, who on Sunday attended a gathering at the church to mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting.  Lee and most of the hundreds of others at Sunday’s commemoration spoke in the Taiwanese dialect, as they typically do during church services. One parishioner wore a yellow hat that read “Yes! Taiwan.” The choir sang “Hometown at Dusk,” a Taiwanese song from the 1950s popular with those living overseas and those supporting an open declaration of the island’s independence.  The gunman, according to prosecutors, hated them for that.  On Sunday, some said their belief in God had been shaken, but many said that grappling with the tragedy has renewed their faith.  “I don’t think anyone’s scared,” said Tony Chen, a 76-year-old church elder.  Parishioner Jerry Chen, right, helps visually impaired shooting survivor Li-Yen Hong to the lectern during the one-year commemoration. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  David Wenwei Chou, 69, has been charged in both state and federal court with murder, attempted murder and hate crimes, with prosecutors alleging that he targeted the church because of the congregants’ Taiwanese national origin.  He pleaded not guilty to the state charges and has yet to make a court appearance in the federal case.  Chou was born in Taiwan and was from a family with recent roots in China, which considers the island democracy part of its territory. According to local law enforcement, Chou left notes in his car opposing Taiwanese independence.  Jerry Chen, 73, said he is in touch with the mother of John Cheng, who died in the shooting, which makes it hard for him to forgive Chou.  “She blamed herself and said, ‘How am I going to face my daughter-in-law?’ ” Chen wrote in a commemorative book recently published by the church.  She said she should not have tried to get her son to go to church with her that day, Chen wrote.  Of Chou, Chen wrote: “His hatred for Taiwan and Taiwanese people led him to live in sorrow. God is love, and the Devil is hatred. Because of hatred, the shooter became a disciple of Devil.”  On Sunday, Billy Chang, the church’s former longtime pastor, spoke of the “confusion” of emotions in a recorded video from Taiwan. He was being honored at the luncheon last May when Chou began shooting. After Cheng’s doomed attempt to stop Chou, Chang struck Chou with a chair and hogtied him with the help of others.  “I am very grateful and full of gratitude, but on the other hand, I often cry, feeling sad, heartbroken and regretful,” Chang said.  Parishioners and members of the Taiwanese community attend the one-year anniversary memorial service. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  Another speaker, Carol Lin, recalled being at a new year’s celebration in Taiwan earlier this year and hearing celebratory firecrackers that reminded her of the shooting.  “Rain and tears were all together,” Lin said.  Peter Chen, a representative from the Formosan Assn. for Public Affairs, which advocates for Taiwanese independence, said Cheng, who was a sports medicine doctor, represented the “true spirit” of the Taiwanese people.  “The heroic action of Dr. Cheng is not only honorable but also holy. His bravery truly represents the Taiwanese value of peace-loving,” Chen said. “Dr. Cheng, not only will you not be forgotten, but you will forever inspire us.”  The church’s full name is Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church, but it rents space from Geneva Presyterian Church in Laguna Woods. A week after the May 15 shooting, parishioners returned to worship and have found solace there ever since.  But only last month did they resume their post-service luncheons in the room where the shooting happened — it had been too difficult to share a meal there.  Over lunch, they once again spoke of their lives and their families. Attendance at the church has been growing and remains “very healthy,” said pastor Albany Lee.  But like many immigrant congregations, the members are aging. Lee wonders how the next generation will reshape the church — perhaps they will speak Mandarin, not Taiwanese.  “I cannot foretell the church’s future,” Lee said. “But I will be here for a while.”  Special correspondent M. Benson Huang contributed to this report."

The shooting happened just after 11 a.m., Sunday, May 14, 2023 and the store was closed for several hours afterward.  “I was just thinking this world that we live in is crazy.

The witness said she was inside Kroger at the register when the shooting happened.  “I witnessed people running out of the store. I heard loud voices.

The woman said she still feels safe shopping at the South Charleston Kroger despite the incident.  According to the criminal complaint, by the time police arrived at the scene, the suspect had already left and was near the Krispy Kreme just a few feet away.  Spencer is currently at the South-Central Regional Jail facing attempted murder and wanton endangerment charges.  “Things like this don’t happen in South Charleston,” said Captain Andrew Gordon, Deputy Chief Bureau Commander of the SCPD. “Without getting overly involved in the investigation, these people that were involved in the incident yesterday had prior knowledge of each other. They knew each other.”  Spencer was convicted in 2015 for drug possession with intent to deliver, meaning that she was not legally allowed to possess a gun, according to court records.  “Part of that is taking into consideration when you have an incident involving a firearm or weapon, if someone is prohibited from having that, that could mean additional charges. There’s other factors and other things that are being investigated that could mean additional charges as well,” Gordon said.

Roundtree says the city hosted the Augusta Air Show and Mayfest, and several Thug Rider members attended before traveling to the Outcast clubhouse.  “We didn’t know that trouble was coming to our city. We didn’t know that trouble was already in our city,” he said.  The suspects range in age from 44 to 26, and hailed from Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. Four suspects were a part of the Outcast Motorcycle Club, and eight were Thug Riders.  Roundtree confirmed a fire vehicle ran over a dead body on the scene. He said fire personnel did not see the person, and the agency has a traffic report that is not yet available for release.  “To bring this type of violence to our city, to add us to a national mass shooting list is unconscionable. This is something we will not tolerate here in Richmond County. That is why each individual who is involved or we feel to be involved or has any part in this will face charges,” he said.  He says there was no lack of police presence in the city. Roundtree said they had more deputies on the roads because they were leaving two events.  At least 20 officers were on the scene, and he said you could hear gunfire from a few blocks away.  “While this incident of violence is horrific, and many of the other tragic incidents that have occurred in this country and will still occur ... my light will continue to push forward in the confidence that I have in the men and women of the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office and the citizens of Richmond County,” said Roundtree.  Investigators found more than 150 shell casings on the scene. Roundtree says this was an “extremely large scene,” and kids were playing outside in a neighborhood right down the street.  “With 150 rounds, I’m sure it was more than two individuals,” he said.  Officials said they believe people from Florida traveled three to four hours to engage in the targeted attack. They believe it stemmed from a recent incident that started in Florida, but additional information on that wasn’t released.  In response to the shooting, regional affiliates with the clubs were mobilizing to retaliate again in Augusta, Roundtree said. The sheriff’s office briefed Mayor Garnett Johnson and other city officials about the potential threat of another major shooting. The sheriff says there’s still an ongoing threat, but they’re prepared.  “We continue to monitor this situation in real-time, and we will advise the public of any confirmed threat if they develop,” said Roundtree.  He said 13 motorcycles were taken into evidence, along with one car and 10 firearms. Weapons were found inside the clubhouse, vehicles and nearby businesses from when the suspects fled the scene.  One Richmond County patrol car was also hit in the shooting.  Copyright 2023 WRDW/WAGT via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved."

The boy and a 20-year-old, Angel Gomez, arrived at a Sonic Drive-In in Keene, Texas, on Saturday night, police said. Sonic employee Matthew Davis, 32, confronted Gomez after he allegedly became disorderly in the parking lot. The argument escalated and became physical.  The 12-year-old boy, who was a passenger in Gomez's vehicle, allegedly pulled out a gun and repeatedly fired at Davis, the Keen Police Department wrote on Facebook. The boy used an AR-style weapon and fired at least six rounds at Davis, CBS affiliate KTVT reported.  Gomez and the unnamed juvenile suspect, who are both from Fort Worth, then left the scene.  Davis was lying in the parking lot when officers arrived at around 9:40 p.m. Saturday, police and the Johnson County Sheriff's Office said. He had suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was having a hard time breathing. Davis was flown to a hospital where he was rushed into surgery, but he died from his injuries.  Police said Gomez returned to the Sonic after the deadly shooting and was arrested on murder charges. Officers found the juvenile in Rio Vista, about 15 miles away, and took the 12-year-old boy into custody on murder charges. They also recovered several firearms.  The Sonic remained closed Monday, KTVT reported. A memorial was set up in honor of Davis.  He left behind a 10-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe set up to cover his funeral costs."

Fifteen groups — including the Dallas Asian American Historical Society; Dallas Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation; SAAVETX Education Fund; Asian Texans for Justice; Remembering Black Dallas; Rise AAPI and Somos Tejas — coordinated the vigil in honor of the eight victims who died in the shooting: Cindy, Kyu and James Cho, Daniela and Sofia Mendoza, Aishwarya Thatikonda, Christian LaCour and Elio Cumana-Rivas.  More than a dozen people spoke at the vigil inside the Oak Lawn United Methodist Church in Dallas. A 15-year-old Allen student read a poem in which she begged for “the adults” to “keep me and my friends safe.” Ramiro Luna with Somos Tejas listed off the mass shootings that have involved an AR-15. The Turtle Creek Chorale, a Dallas men’s choir, performed “If I Can Dream” by Elvis Presley.  Erika L. Moritsugu, deputy assistant to the president and Asian American and Pacific Islander senior liaison, spoke on behalf of the White House. She said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris sent their condolences and are dedicated to “end the scourge of gun violence.” Moritsugu read a statement from Harris aloud in which Harris said she will “fight alongside you to protect families” and to “keep dangerous weapons out of dangerous hands.”  Several speakers addressed the shooter’s white supremacist ideals. Earlier Monday, several groups that coordinated the vigil held a press conference and demanded law enforcement thoroughly investigate the shooting as a hate crime.  At the vigil, some speakers demanded that the Texas Legislature take action on gun reform. Mohammed Farshori, vice chair of the Asian Chamber of Texas, said elected officials “are no longer able to serve the public or serve our interests” and called on people to vote in order to make those officials “irrelevant.” Luna with Somos Tejas said legislators have “blood on their hands” if they do not propose gun reform.  Nearly every speaker referenced the fact that they were echoing words that have been said at countless vigils held for countless other shootings across the country. The calls for change, several noted, have been made after nearly every mass shooting, and still the violence continues.  “How did we get to this place?” Beverly Davis, vice president of Remembering Black Dallas, asked the congregation. “Where we call ourselves the greatest democracy that’s ever existed, and yet we cannot protect the most innocent among us?”"

Deputies were called out to Sand Bar Ferry Road just after 6:30 p.m. Saturday for reports that someone had been shot.  When deputies arrived at the scene, they found five people with gunshot wounds.  Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen confirmed to WJBF that Keith Coates, 30, of Valdosta, and Germayne Farrell, 51, Daytona Beach, Florida, were pronounced dead at the scene.

This time, in Yuma where two young men, just 19 and 20, are dead and five other teens were injured late Saturday night.  All of the dead and injured were between 15 and 20 years old, in this, America’s latest mass shooting.  It’s the 33rd mass shooting just this month and at least the 215th nationwide, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are either killed or injured.  Fox News was quick to play up Yuma shooting  No suspects are in custody and there’s not much to know as yet about what happened here, but leave it to Fox News to deliver the story that its audience craves.  “7 people shot in Yuma, Arizona, just 10 miles from the US-Mexico border,” the network screams.  “The shooting unfolded at a time when the border city of just about 97,000 residents is dealing with a large influx of migrants surging across the border,” Fox reported.  In Arizona:Sen. Sinema talks about rollout of gun law  “Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls appeared on Fox News on Friday to sound the alarm that Border Patrol had begun releasing migrants onto the streets a day after Title 42 expired.”  The story — of the shooting — includes a photo of the U.S.-Mexico border and two more photos of migrants who were released by the Border Patrol in Yuma and nearby Somerton and, well, you get the picture.  This is Arizona's 4th mass shooting in 2023  Interestingly, Fox never noted that Saturday’s shooting was Arizona’s fourth mass shooting of the year.  Or that early indications suggest that this was not migrants on the rage but local teens having a party.  A woman told Z93 radio that her 15-year-old son attended a party in the foothills and was shot in the leg after a fight broke out. He was caught in a crossfire.  “My kid attended a party like 15-year-olds do,” she said. “Is this what is happening in Yuma now? I am sickened, saddened and pissed off. We need to do better.”Fox News must be so disappointed.  Reach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com. Follow her on Twitter at @LaurieRoberts.

Police Chief Steve Hebbe said the assailant, who was killed by responding officers, used an AR-15-style rifle and two other guns as he roamed a quarter-mile area through a neighborhood Monday morning.  The gunman killed three people, wounded two law enforcement officers and four civilians. He shot at least six houses and three vehicles before he encountered Farmington Police officers shortly after 11 a.m. MDT.  The rampage seems to be random, the chief said.  “There were no schools, no churches, no individuals targeted,” he said, adding the shooter appeared to fire at what “entered his head.”  San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington received seven patients, spokesperson Laura Werbner told CNN in an email. Werbner said she could not comment on the patients’ conditions.  The chief said a New Mexico State Police officer who was shot drove himself to the medical center and is still hospitalized.  “He’s doing well at this moment,” Stebbe added.  A Farmington Police officer who was also wounded by gunfire has already been released from the hospital, the chief said.  “The event is difficult to understand, how something like this happens,” he said. “But we are doing the best that we can to piece through (evidence), and talk with family members of the suspect to piece through what was going on” and determine a motive, he added.  The crime scene is “wide and complex” and it will take time to figure out what happened, Stebbe said.  Authorities didn’t identify any victims or the shooter. The chief said police expect to hold another news conference Tuesday afternoon.  The Phoenix division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) earlier tweeted that it was “responding to a report of a mass shooting” in Farmington.  New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she is praying for the victims and their families and has directed the state to support the investigative efforts of the city and county.  “Although details continue to emerge about this incident, this serves as yet another reminder of how gun violence destroys lives in our state and our country every single day,” she said in a statement. “This administration will not stop fighting the epidemic of gun violence from every angle possible.”  Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett said he has received calls of support from the White House, lawmakers in Washington, the Navajo Nation and mayors throughout the state.  “We are a resilient community, a community that cares for each other,” Duckett said. “In the face of adversity, we must stand together, comfort one another, and make a determined effort to heal these wounds so we can emerge stronger and not allow this act of violence to define us.”  About 46,400 people live in Farmington, which is in northwestern New Mexico, just south of the Colorado state line. It is about 150 miles northwest of Albuquerque and about 50 miles from the Four Corners area where the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah intersect."

Bill Lee has signed into law a measure providing additional protections from lawsuits filed against firearms and ammunition dealers, sellers and manufacturers.  Legislative records show the Republican governor signed the bill Thursday. It takes effect July 1.  Senate Republicans gave final approval to House Bill 1189 on April 18, less than a month after the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville that left three 9-year-old children and three adults dead. The House approved the measure three weeks before the shooting, on March 6.  Lee also plans to call lawmakers back into special session on Aug. 21 to address safety concerns.  ""It gives a mixed message to the general public, and to afford the firearms manufacturers' additional liability protections is really unconscionable,"" Rep. Yusuf Hakeem, D-Chattanooga, said Thursday by phone regarding Lee's signing of the measure into law. ""And it goes against everything else he's trying to do with regard to the special session and public safety and things of that nature.""  The governor is hoping to persuade GOP supermajorities in both chambers to approve a temporary order of protection measure aimed at keeping firearms from people deemed by a judge to be dangerous to others or themselves. Second Amendment advocates charge it's a red flag law, which a number of states have adopted.  But Lee argues his legislation will provide protections to gun owners. He says it allows them to make a case before a judge that their weapons should not be removed. That, Lee said, is a substantive difference from laws in some other states.  House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons of Nashville called Lee's signing of the measure ""disappointing"" in a phone interview. He noted the House Republican supermajority passed the bill prior to the school shooting. But senators approved it weeks afterwards, he added.  ""If you look at the GOP supermajority, I find it very concerning that our legislature found time to pass that kind of legislation but couldn't consider any kind of legislation to better protect our children,"" Clemmons said.  During the Senate debate April 6, bill sponsor Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, defended the bill.  Staff photo by Andy Sher / Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee speaks with reporters on Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at a Metro Nashville Police Precinct Station about his effort to press an order of protection bill following the March 27, 2023, deadly shooting at The Covenant School in which three children and three adults died.    ""This is just to try to help businesses in this state that have chosen to come here, to give them a little civil liability (protection),"" he said.  With its firearms-friendly policies, warm business climate and generous taxpayer-funded economic incentives, Tennessee has become home to an increasing number of firearms and ammunition manufacturers with some moving their home office operations to the state.  Hensley said his bill is intended to keep that going and argued the legislation won't block lawmakers from passing new laws in response to The Covenant School shooting, which Lee hopes will occur.  Hensley's legislation doesn't provide blanket protection against lawsuits. There are six exceptions leaving gun and ammunition dealers, other sellers and manufacturers liable. The list includes a person or company directly involved in the crime giving rise to the action or steps taken against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence.  The state also has no power over existing federal laws dealing with the firearms industry.  Last month, Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, objected to the bill's passage in the upper chamber debate.  ""There are people that we should be going out of our way to protect this week,"" Yarbro said, alluding to protests that erupted at the Capitol in the wake of the shooting. ""And we've been receiving emails and calls. People are holding up signs, telling us to go out of our way to help those people. Not one of those signs says to protect the gun manufacturers.""  Last week, the governor signed into law his $230 million measure, approved by lawmakers, that he brought to boost public and private security in the wake of the shooting.

Police said a large brindle mastiff was found by a borough resident shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday near 23rd Street and Lenz Avenue. Officers could not locate a tag, and transported the dog back to the station to try to locate a chip. In a now-deleted post from the Ambridge Borough Police Department Facebook page, officers showed the dog poking her head out the back window of a police cruiser.  ""She decided to do a ride-along with Officer Turner today,"" the post read. ""She will be hanging out with him for the next hour.""  Police initially said if the dog was not claimed within an hour, it would be taken to the Beaver County Humane Society for care.  Shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday, an officer went to the department's outdoor kennel to retrieve the dog and take her to the humane society. An Ambridge police Facebook post then says the dog ""immediately became aggressive and attempted to bite the officer in the hand. As the officer turned and began to run away, the dog bit him on his left knee.""  A second officer tried to help corral the mastiff using a dog pole, but ended up closing it back in the kennel and going inside the station, according to the post. When they came back outside, the dog had escaped the kennel and was running loose around the station parking lot.  ""As officers attempted to catch the dog, she then charged at one of the officers,"" the post reads. ""The dog got within arm's reach of the officer and lunged to attack him. The officer had no choice at the time but to dispatch the dog with his service pistol.""  After covering the dog's body with cardboard in the parking lot, officers discovered a short time later that she was still breathing and alive.  Story continues  After contacting the county humane society, ""it was determined that it was best to put the dog down on scene,"" police wrote.  The department has come under heavy criticism from social media for its handling of the situation.  Tribune-Review news partner WPXI reported that a computer specialist will be going through the department's video surveillance footage on Monday to determine if the incident was caught on camera. The building containing the police department, borough administration and fire department is covered by cameras on multiple sides, including one directly above the kennel on the side of the police station.  Police said they were contacted by a man who claimed to be the dog's owner, but he never showed up at the station. Police said they've received additional, noncredible calls from people claiming to also be the owner.  ""If you are the owner of this dog, please contact the Ambridge Police Department,"" the post reads. Ambridge police can be reached at 724-266-5977.  Patrick Varine is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Around 2:45 a.m., Columbus police responded to a report of a fight in the 900 block of N. High Street in the Short North, near United Dairy Farmers and SeeSaw Columbus restaurant and bar. When police arrived, they discovered Arthur Pickens, 21, suffering from a gunshot wound.  Pickens was transported to OSU Wexner Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased at 3:07 a.m. The shooting is under investigation and police have not identified any suspects.  More on Short North violence:Columbus police release bodycam videos showing police responding to Short North gunfire  In a statement, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said ""in high-traffic and populated areas like the Short North, the threat (of gun violence) to public safety is magnified when guns mix with alcohol and large crowds of people and vehicles.""  ""While CPD is still investigating all the facts of this incident, what we do know is that something needs to change,"" said Klein, who is fighting legal challenges against new city firearm ordinances. ""We cannot accept gun violence as the norm in the Short North or any Columbus neighborhood.""  Short North fatal shooting comes on heels of ""explosion of gunfire""  The Sunday morning shooting comes on the heels of an ""explosion of gunfire"" between police and suspects last weekend that left 10 injured and still-unanswered questions about whether anybody had been hit by Columbus police gunfire.  Last Saturday, officers had gone to the 600 block of North High Street around 2:30 a.m. after getting a report of a shooting. While the officers were on the scene, more gunshots were heard a few blocks north.  Body camera footage shows officers firing as they moved toward a gunman who was down in front of Roaming Goat Coffee at 849 N. High St. The video shows one of the officers kicking a handgun away from the man, who was bleeding heavily. The 20-year-old man was handcuffed and transported to Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in critical condition.  In all, 11 firearms were recovered from the scene.  Police have not said whether any of those injured were struck by police gunfire. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations is leading the investigation into the incident.  @Colebehr_report  Cbehrens@dispatch.com"
