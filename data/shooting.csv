The California Highway Patrol said the crash was reported around 9:30 a.m. just south of San Miguelito. One of the drivers, a 30-year-old man from Lancaster, was also arrested, the agency said in a news release.  The crash shut down the freeway for several hours and hampered traffic throughout the day.  The CHP said a preliminary investigation showed the Lancaster man was driving a commercial Ford F-550 faster than 65 mph and struck a pickup directly in front driven by the Ventura man, identified as Jose A. Zarate, which caused a chain reaction affecting three more vehicles. The vehicles were all in the fast lane.  Zarate's truck caught fire when hit from behind, and he was not able to get out, the CHP said. The 50-year-old driver died at the scene.  The driver from Lancaster was booked into Ventura County jail on suspicion of felony gross vehicular manslaughter. He is slated to appear in Ventura County Superior Court Thursday at 1:30 p.m. and is being held on $60,000 bail, jail records show.  This incident is still under investigation by the CHP Ventura area office. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact the office at 805-662-2640.  Police seek info on shooting  SIMI VALLEY — Simi Valley police are looking for information about a shooting victim who showed up at a Simi Valley hospital Monday afternoon.  The 33-year-old man had been dropped off in the emergency room at Adventist Health Simi Valley around 4:20 p.m., according to the Simi Valley Police Department. Hospital staff called police who arrived after the man had been transported to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks.  Simi police said officers contacted the gunshot victim who provided little information about the shooting. Authorities said they do not believe there is any threat to public.

The first shooting occurred in the city’s Broadway Slavic Village neighborhood at around 10 p.m.  When officers were called to the scene, they discovered a man with a gunshot wound to the head—later dying after being transported to University Hospitals, Cleveland Police Sergeant Jennifer Ciaccia said.  The second shooting occurred in St. Clair Superior neighborhood at 3 a.m. on Sunday.  As police arrived, they found two women dead following a shooting. A third person was in need of immediate medical attention after sustaining a gunshot wound to the buttocks.  Bianca Mason, 31, was identified as one of the women who died in the shooting by her family members. She was a mother to three young children.  “I feel like it’s senseless. And, I feel like somebody needs to talk because if it was their loved one, they’d want somebody to standup and speak, but, it’s senseless. She didn’t deserve to die,” one of Mason’s family members—who asked to remain unnamed—said.  The third shooting took place at the city’s Bellaire Puritas neighborhood at around 3 a.m. on Sunday.  Cleveland medics discovered a man, approximately 35 years old, dead after being shot in the head.  The fourth, and final, shooting happened in the Broadway Slavic Village neighborhood.  A man was found dead from a gunshot wound in the 5700 block of Hamlet Avenue.  Cleveland officials did not identify the four victims.  James Box, a long time Cleveland activist with Truth Ministries and Jim Brown’s Peace Squad, said that it was time for the city to come up with a plan of action to silence the violence.  “But, while y’all trying to make up your mind on what you need to do, young people dying continuously in this city,” Box declared.  © 2023 Cox Media Group"

Not in 2023 when we are in the throes of the Golden Age of Fear.  A 58-year-old Louisiana man is in jail today after shooting onto his neighbor’s property.  His target?  Shadows he saw Sunday night prompted him to grab his gun.  And then when he saw the shadows running away, he did what paranoid people are doing these days if they are armed with a weapon — he opened fire.  The Calcasieu Parrish’s Sheriff’s Office released a statement indicating that David Doyle claimed he did not realize he had actually struck somebody.  That somebody was a 14-year-old girl who was hit in the back of the head playing what most people Doyle’s age would view as a wholesome game compared to edgy and much more dangerous pastimes inspired by social media platforms.  Fortunately, the girl — who is in a hospital — does not have life-threatening injuries.  It Is the latest in a long and growing list of paranoia fanned attacks on kids.  Three weeks prior, 6-year-old Kinsley White was shot by a 24-year-old when she entered his yard to retrieve a basketball that had rolled into it. For added measure, police in Florida’s sad Robert Louis Singletary shot her parents as well.  To be clear, one doesn’t have to possess a gun to strike out at kids.  All it can take is consuming 12 cans of beers, seeing a teen moon you, and becoming angry with rage.  Such is the case of 45-year-old Anurag Chandra in Riverside County in Southern California back on Jan. 19, 2020.  Chandra was convicted a week ago of murder in the death of three 16 year-old boys.  They were among six teens in a Toyota Prius when one was dared to either jump into a pool at night or play “ding dong ditch.”  The teen opted for the doorbell prank.  He ran up to Chandra’s door — a complete stranger — and rang the bell.  After Chandra opened the door, the teen turned around, dropped his pants and mooned Chandra.  Chandra’s defense?  He had feared for his family’s safety and “wanted to express his anger” telling the jury he was “extremely, extremely mad” about the prank.  It didn’t help that he had consumed 12 beers in the hours leading up to the doorbell ringing.  So. Chandra jumped into his vehicle and went after the six boys.  He eventually caught up with them, ramming the Prius at 99 mph and sending it into a tree.  Chandra, by the way, was awaiting prosecution on domestic violence charges at the time of the incident.  April also saw 16 year-old Ralph Yarl who was shot and wounded by an 84-year-old man who opened fire through a glass door after he went to the wrong house to pick up two siblings and rang the doorbell.  The suspect told authorities he was “scared to death”.  Andrew Lester told police he was in bed when the doorbell rang, grabbed his gun and then — because after opening the main door and seeing the teen — became fearful of the teen’s size and whether he could defend himself before opening fire through a screen door.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. People have been shot while backing up after realizing they turned into the wrong driveway, shot while making Door Dash deliveries, and shot after they got into the wrong car, realized it, and got out.  These incidents did not occur in New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland, or whatever big city has a reputation of being a shooting gallery and a Mecca for violence.  The shooters aren’t all angry old men, nor are they all white.  The victims aren’t all minorities.  These incidents are taking place across the country in suburbia, small towns, and quiet neighborhoods.  The common thread is paranoia fueled by fear.  It is not a modern malady.  But the deep prevalence of fear in our everyday lives is.  The more we hear something, the more we tend to be consumed by it.  The Missing Children Milk Carton Program launched in the mid-1980s to find abducted children illustrates what happens.  The FBI reports, on average, fewer than 350 people under the age of 21 are abducted by strangers. Of those, less than 120 are under 18 years of age.  Non-custodial parent kidnappings are a 1,000 times higher.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children indicates 800,000 children a year are reported missing. Of those, 99 percent return home.  That includes 200,000 taken by family members — sometimes during custody battles — those who are lost, injured, or are runaways.  To be clear, one missing child is one too many. Stanger danger lessons are critical.  That said, there are those who are convinced from the constant bombardment of numbers — even though stranger abductions extremity rare — that their child is in eminent danger of being kidnapped.  Vigilance is good. Losing perspective and having it boil over into paranoia isn’t.  A local example was the 2008 case when a terrified malnourished 16-year-old boy wearing only boxer shorts with a heavy chain around his ankle escaped a nearby home where a guardian had held him captive and tortured for a year had made his way to the Tracy In Shape on Tracy Boulevard.  Cable news was saturated 24/7 every 15 minutes with “updates” for two days.  More than a few people started seeing that as the norm.  It is little wonder in 2023 with such cable programming on steroids, the instantaneous spread of exaggerated information and rumors via social media that are repeated over and over again until your senses become numb that many have become paranoid and/or in a constant state of rage.  A teen mooning you playing a stupid game of ding dong ditch? Run them down.  A 6-year-old disrespecting your property by retrieving their errant ball? Shoot them and their parents.  Mysterious shadows in the neighbor’s yard at night? The hordes are combining to kill young and not possibly something as innocent as kids playing hide and seek or even your neighbor chasing off a cat in his own yard.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt had it right.  We have nothing to fear but fear itself.  That’s because fear drives us to make rash decisions.  And nothing fans fear and rash decision more than a 24/7 diet of social media and cable TV news programs."

The students decided to wear orange cords. The color is a nod to the national Wear Orange campaign supported by Everytown For Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action as a way of honoring survivors of gun violence while pushing for gun reform.  Sources said some viewed the cords as being too political.  ""From my understanding, 175 seniors ordered the cords on their own online to be delivered to their homes, and then when they asked towards the end of the year they were told by administration that they wouldn’t be permitted,"" parent Marisa Prince said.  Related: Oxford shooting families get key win in lawsuit against district  When she heard this wasn't allowed, she ordered her own boxes of orange cords for seniors to wear with their caps and gowns.  ""I think the orange cord is a subtle way for students to show what they’ve been through on their graduation day in front of their loved ones,"" Prince said. ""The student that was killed from this graduating class just touched a lot of lives and so had friends all over his grade, and I think a lot of people are just even treating the cord as a way to remember him.""  Tate Myre, one of the four students killed in the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting would have graduated this year.  The superintendent sent a letter out to parents saying in part:  ""The reason I am not approving or endorsing the orange cord that is being distributed by an outside organization is because the tradition of Oxford High School’s graduation has been to keep the focus solely on students and their accomplishments. My endorsement of other symbolic graduation wear would set a precedent that could erode that tradition and more importantly the focus on students and their accomplishments. I personally endorse many worthwhile public and charitable agendas, but I do not do that within the scope of my duties as Oxford Community Schools superintendent.""  The district came up with an alternative way of showing support. It approved a navy and gold Wildcat honor cord as part of the graduation wear, a tribute to the ""resilience and strength these students have had to find within themselves"" according to another statement sent out to the community.  ""I was surprised that the district took such a hard line on this,"" Prince said.  She said she is expecting even more students to go their own way on this one.  ""I was just shocked that we can’t show some compassion and show some understanding and try to listen to the students. Try to allow them to express what they need and try to come together with some compromise,"" she said."

Ishman Jaren Archie was convicted of discharging a weapon into occupied property and fleeing to elude arrest.  A trial had begun in Guilford County Superior Court in High Point before a jury, but on the third day of the trial Archie agreed to the terms of a plea deal, District Attorney Avery Crump said.  Archie also had been charged with attempted first-degree murder, possession of a stolen firearm, possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana, possession of marijuana paraphernalia and driving while license revoked, but those charges were dismissed, Crump said.  Superior Court Judge Aaron Berlin sentenced Archie to 17 to 33 months in prison, but Crump said that the sentence was suspended pending Archie's successful completion of two years of supervised probation.  Archie was arrested Nov. 11, 2019, after the burgundy Nissan he was driving was chased by police in connection with a drive-by shooting in the southeast part of High Point. Another person in the car was livestreaming the chase through a cellphone, police said at the time.  High Point Police Department officers punctured two of the Nissan's tires to try to end the chase, which caused the car to wreck. Police said that Archie ran away but was caught a short time later.  Archie was accused of shooting at least five rounds into a sedan and wounding a man, who then was treated at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist High Point Medical Center for injuries that police described at the time only as not life-threatening.  One codefendant of Archie, Jiquan V. Quick of Lexington, previously pleaded guilty to discharging a weapon into occupied property, Guilford County Assistant District Attorney Cyrus Brown told The Enterprise. Quick was 17 at the time of his arrest in the case.  The case of another codefendant, Niala D. Leach of Thomasville, is pending, Brown said. Leach was 17 at the time of her arrest.  pjohnson@hpenews.com — 336-888-3528 — @HPEpaul"

A 58-year-old Sarasota man was shot by another man after what appears to have been a road rage incident on Fruitville. The Sheriff's Office isn't releasing the names of the two men – or that of a female witness – because they are covered by Marsy's Law. The law prevents police agencies from releasing the identities of crime victims who choose to remain anonymous.  Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Dana Judge said no one has been arrested in this case.  Deputies responded to the area at approximately 8:08 p.m. on Saturday. They found that the 58-year-old was deceased in a pick-up truck on Fruitville, according to a Sheriff's Office news release. The deputies also saw an 18-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man – who are both Sarasota residents – in a nearby sedan. The man was the sedan's passenger, and the woman was the driver.  Judge said there had been a back-and-forth exchange between the people in the two vehicles about a traffic issue. Traffic was stopped on Fruitville at the time. The sedan's passenger told the Sheriff's Office that there was a verbal altercation, and then the driver of the pick-up truck pointed a gun at him and the driver of the sedan, according to the news release. The passenger then exited the sedan and fired multiple rounds into the driver’s side of the pick-up truck, striking the driver.

She said that based on the initial investigation, there were no charges to be filed against the two people at the time.  The deceased man was released to the Medical Examiner’s office, and his next-of-kin were notified. Judge said the Sheriff's Office hopes to provide an update on the incident sometime over the next two or so days."

On March 19, 2021, Engdahl had been driving on Walker Road near the South Shore entrance to Lynx Lake when the victim in the case drove past him. ""Outraged"", YCSO said in the statement, Engdahl followed the victim, catching up to him near mile marker 3, and proceeded to fire a shot at the victim's vehicle with a black handgun.  The victim provided law enforcement with a description of both Engdahl and his vehicle, which YCSO was able to confirm through an investigation.  In a last-ditch effort, Engdahl went on the run, changing his physical appearance by shaving off his ""long-standing and distinct"" mustache. Additionally, Engdahl removed the roof rack and bumper sticker from his vehicle, drove to Las Vegas and dumped it at a buddy's house.  Engdahl then enlisted that same friend to lie to local law enforcement, saying the vehicle in question had resided at the residence for the past month.  However, when confronted with conflicting evidence, Engdahl's friend later backpedaled on how long the vehicle had been there, according to the Sheriff's Office.  On April 29, 2021, YCSO detectives arrested Engdahl after receiving tips from the public alongside evidence obtained through the investigation.  Engdahl was booked into jail on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, endangerment and criminal damage.  On Friday, May 12, 2023, a Yavapai County Jury found Engdahl guilty on charges of drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, criminal damage and tampering with physical evidence.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said in February that Yia Xiong was holding a 16-inch knife when St. Paul officer Abdirahman Dahir shot him.  Xiong’s family has said the Hmong-American veteran was deaf in one ear as a result of his involvement in the Vietnam War. They also said he wasn’t a threat, and raised questions about why he was killed.  The BCA led the investigation, and the Ramsey County attorney’s office said Tuesday that the agency formally presented its investigative file to its office. County Attorney John Choi asked Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison participate in the prosecution review, which he agreed to.  “Our first commitment is to a complete and transparent review of the evidence as presented by the BCA in this matter,” Choi said in a statement. “The addition of Attorney General Ellison to the review process adds a layer of trust and confidence to our process, and I am grateful for his office’s involvement.”  The county attorney’s office will also have “a nationally recognized officer use of force expert to assist in the review of the evidence,” according to a news release.  Snowdon Herr, chairman of the Justice for Yia Xiong group, said Tuesday that a thorough review is needed.  “We really believe that Yia Xiong deserves some answers,” he said.  On Feb. 11 at 4:55 p.m., police responded to the Winslow Commons building on the 100 block of South Western Avenue off West Seventh Street after receiving 911 calls. Officers told Xiong to drop the knife, but he didn’t respond and turned to unlock his apartment door, according to the BCA. Xiong went inside his apartment and the door began to close.  “The officers kicked the door to stop it from fully shutting and ordered him to come out,” the BCA said in a statement at the time. “They then backed away from the door and down the short hallway. Xiong opened the door and stepped into the hallway, knife still in-hand.”"

Officers found a 15-year-old boy, identified as Tyler Brooks, lying in the street.

Detective Edward Davis, who was a patrol officer at the time of the shooting, described a chaotic scene that early morning at Lowell General Hospital’s Main Campus. Davis said “dozens” of medical personnel were treating Kimborowicz, who was in critical condition from the single bullet that pierced his torso.  Davis testified that Kimborowicz was in great discomfort, but answering questions, though he was reluctant to speak to police. To get Kimborowicz to open up about who shot him, Davis testified that he told the Lowell man he might die due to his injuries.  “I asked him ‘who did this to you’,” Davis said.  According to Davis, Kimborowicz eventually told him “he wasn’t a snitch,” before instructing Davis to check the doorbell camera at his grandmother’s house on Sutherland Street. Davis testified Kimborowicz also stated from his hospital bed that “C-Mello was in the vehicle.”  Shortly after the encounter with Davis, Kimborowicz was flown by medical helicopter to a Boston hospital for further treatment. He succumbed to his injuries approximately a month later.  As revealed during the trial, the camera referenced by Kimborowicz captured the moment Lemay, along with Braedyn Baraby and Ian Godbout, arrived outside his grandmother’s home on Sutherland Street shortly before the shooting.  Lemay, Baraby and Godbout drove to the home, where Kimborowicz lived with his grandmother, for what was supposed to be a one-on-one fistfight between Baraby and Kimborowicz’s close friend, Osvaldo Luna.  Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Chris Tarrant told jurors during his opening statement on May 9 that Baraby wanted revenge on Luna for stealing an eighth of an ounce of marijuana from him several months earlier.  The footage from the doorbell camera, which was shown during the trial, shows Kimborowicz instructing Lemay, Baraby and Godbout to drive to the end of the road where they would meet for the fight. Kimborowicz did not want to disturb his grandmother who was sleeping upstairs.  Kimborowicz is seen in the footage going inside the home, while the trio drive away in Lemay’s car toward Barker Avenue. Moments later, Kimborowicz and Luna then exit the home, and start walking in that direction.  Instead of a fair fistfight, however, prosecutors said Kimborowicz and Luna walked into an armed ambush. Shortly after 3:50 a.m., prosecutors allege Lemay and Baraby, both armed with guns, got out of the vehicle, parked on Barker Avenue near the intersection of Sutherland Street, and opened fire in the direction of Luna and Kimborowicz as they approached in the darkness.  Two spent casings, one from a 9mm round and another from a .380 round, were recovered by police at the scene. The guns prosecutors said were used have not been recovered.  Luna, who was uninjured during the shooting, has testified he saw Lemay fire a gun. A video taken by Godbout inside Lemay’s vehicle allegedly captured footage of Baraby with a gun at the time of the shooting.  Lemay, who was 18 years old at the time, and Baraby, who was 16, are both charged with first-degree murder, armed assault with intent to murder, attempted assault and battery by discharging a firearm, and possession of a firearm.  A separate trial for Baraby is scheduled to begin on Aug. 7.  Lemay’s attorneys, Ryan Sullivan and Steven Rappaport, have contended throughout the trial that one gun was fired that early morning, and Baraby pulled the trigger, not Lemay.  The defense has stressed the only witness who puts a gun in Lemay’s hands is Luna, who they have described as an unreliable witness.  While on the stand, Luna stated the gunman was light-skinned, tall, and skinny, and was wearing a gray hoodie. Sullivan and Rappaport have stressed the doorbell camera, as well as Godbout’s camera footage shows Baraby was wearing a gray hoodie. Though Lemay is not seen in Godbout’s video, he is seen in the doorbell camera footage, and is wearing black at that time.  The defense has also questioned Luna’s ability to clearly see who the gunman was. Throughout the trial, a common sentiment among witnesses is that the intersection of Sutherland Street and Barker Avenue is poorly lit, with a single streetlight casting a dull glow on the area.  The defense is set to call the trial’s final witness to the stand on Tuesday morning. Sullivan has stated the witness will be a firearms expert who will challenge the prosecution’s witness, Sgt. Kevin Callahan, of the State Police Ballistic Unit, who testified the two spent casings recovered by police came from different guns.  Judge Patrick Haggan informed jurors at the end of Monday’s proceedings that they should expect to begin deliberations on Tuesday.  Haggan explained during jury selection on May 8 that prosecutors are proceeding in the case against Lemay using a legal theory called “joint venture.”  Haggan explained to jurors under this theory prosecutors are not obligated to prove that Lemay fired the fatal bullet. Prosecutors are instead required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lemay knowingly participated in the murder with Baraby, had the knowledge that Baraby was armed with a firearm, and “shared the required criminal intent for murder,” Haggan said.  The judge added Lemay’s presence alone at the crime scene would not prove the prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Follow Aaron Curtis on Twitter @aselahcurtis"

Robinson and Brewton were each indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and Atkins was indicted on one count of first-degree murder. All three defendants will be charged as adults for the murders of Michael Hodo Jr., Layla Silvernail and Camile Quarles.  Their bodies were found between March 30 and April 1, 2023, in different locations in Ocklawaha, which is in Marion County. But investigators said the three victims were shot at the same time.  The defendants were also indicted on charges of robbery with a firearm and tampering with evidence.  According to investigators, Layla Silvernail, 16, was found lying near a dumpster on March 30 after being shot in the head. She later died at a hospital. Michael Hodo Jr., 17, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of the head on March 31, not far from the first scene. And Camille Quarles, 16, was found shot to death on April 1 in the trunk of a sedan partially submerged in a pond.

Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said the group had engaged in burglaries and robberies before the shootings.  “Although we had out there that it was gang-related, we have nothing specific to say that it was any rivalry,” Woods said. “However, each and every one of them in some shape or form is associated with a gang. Basically, simple terms, there is no honor among thieves, and at some point these three individuals turned on our three victims and murdered them.”  WATCH: Press play below to watch the news conference:  Detectives said they used phone records -- like text messages and pictures on the victims’ iPhones -- and tips from the community to link the suspected killers with the shooting.  When asked how the minors obtained the weapons used in the shooting, Woods said two had acquired theirs through car burglaries.

A Burleson man appeared before a judge for the first time this week after he was charged with possessing a homemade bomb.  22-year-old Noah Calderon was charged last month with one count of possession of a destructive device.  According to court documents, Calderon allegedly posted a series of photos of homemade explosives on Snapchat, and the FBI was alerted by a tipster in October 2022.  The posts included an explosive marked ""SS,"" which investigators believed was a reference to the Nazi paramilitary group.  On social media, Calderon allegedly shared posts embracing white supremacy and said he had a fascination with mass shooting, especially the 1999 killing at Columbine High School, according to documents.  Investigators say that Calderon also posted several photos of himself posing with AR-15 rifles and handguns.  In March 2023, the FBI received a tip that Calderon detonated a homemade bomb in a residential neighborhood, with many people calling 911 about the loud sound.  A look into Calderon's Google searches found several searches for the Columbine killers, Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, and instructions on how to make various bombs. He also looked up the names of several local schools, according to investigators.  ""It’s indicative of somebody that wants to hurt people or property,"" said Richard Roper, a former U.S. attorney not involved in the case. ""And that combined with the provocative statements that he made and the conduct, it's very serious.""  Federal agents raided Calderon's home on April 17 and found items that could be used to detonate a bomb, metal BBs and lead and more than 600 grams of explosive powder.  In Calderon's room, police said they found a handwritten note labeled ‘Manifesto’ that talked about the Columbine shooters and white supremacy.  ""This defendant exhibited several indicators of potential violence: a fascination with mass shooters, an obsession with weapons, and hatred towards a protected class. What’s worse, he had allegedly progressed from ideation to planning and preparation,"" said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton in a statement. ""In apprehending Mr. Calderon, we may have averted mass tragedy. We are especially grateful to the tipster who alerted law enforcement to Mr. Calderon’s concerning social media posts.""  Featured article  ""The takeaway from this is that somebody reported suspicious behavior,"" Roper said. ""And maybe suspicious behavior turns out to be nothing, but the idea that you report something that you see suspicious is important.""  Calderon's trial is expected to begin on June 26 in federal court. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.  His arrest came weeks before the shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, in which investigators say the shooter expressed a ""neo-Nazi ideation."" Eight people were killed, and several others were injured."

Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding."

It’s a long and detailed essay that covers the meeting she and fellow singers Amy Grant, Sheryl Crow, Ruby Amanfu, Allison Russell and Will Hoge had with Gov. Bill Lee and the unexpected empathy she felt for him, the faith she has in Gen Z, and the change she believes women can create when working together.  “On that dreadful Monday, March 27th, when six souls lost their lives in the Covenant shooting,” she begins, “my father-in-law called me to break the news. “There’s been a shooting at a school in Green Hills,” he started, and I dropped to the ground. I couldn’t breathe, my head was spinning. I felt like I might have a nervous breakdown when he continued, “It’s not their school. It’s not their school.” Tears were rolling down my cheeks. My two children were at a different school in the area, and while I breathed a sigh of relief that my kids were safe, my heart was already breaking for Nashville.  “At the same time, I got a text message from my kids’ teachers saying they were in lockdown but not in danger. My hands trembled as I tried to reply. I thought about driving to go pick them up and bring them safely home, but the roads were closed. In the days that followed, I contemplated quitting my career and homeschooling them. How can we send our children into this evil world with broken people? How can we send them straight into danger? They were safe, and for that, I thanked God.  “My 12-year-old hugged me when I picked him up. They were placed on lockdown immediately when the sound of sirens began screaming through the neighborhood. “The sirens lasted all day,” he said. I kissed both their heads, buckled them in, and tried to hide the tears in my eyes as we drove home. It was a traumatic day for the city, and my mind was far away. I couldn’t stop thinking of the parents and families who lost their loved ones. It’s a loss so devastating, so unthinkable, that it has us all thinking very deeply about how we can make it so something like this never happens again.”  Read the entire piece at RollingStone.com."

Records for the U.S. Northern Ohio District Court show that an arrest warrant was served on Deltonio L. Dorsey, 41, of Keri Drive SW.  Dorsey appeared in federal court May 10 on the complaint filed by U.S. Marshals accusing him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Carmen Henderson scheduled a detention hearing for Dorsey for 11:30 a.m. today at the Youngstown federal courthouse. Records show Dorsey was taken from Trumbull County jail that day to the custody of federal marshals as his case is being considered by a grand jury.  Dorsey is being accused of the federal crime because of previous felony convictions, including aggravated burglary and burglary charges in 2002 out of Trumbull County Common Pleas Court; another felon in possession of a firearm charge on Sept. 29, 2009, and an aggravated robbery in 2017 in Trumbull County court.  According to a federal affidavit, a Warren police officer answered the shots fired call on April 11 to find a man wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants standing in the parking lot of the South Street apartment complex. The man was identified as Dorsey, began to walk away from the officer with his hands up heading between two of the apartment buildings. As the man walked through a small gate, the officer saw him make a throwing motion after reaching to his waist, the report states.  After that, the man became compliant with the officer and was taken into custody.  The officer later went to the area of the gate where a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver was found on top of landscaping, next to a short brick wall that made up the entrance gate, the report states. The officer noted that one of the rounds of the revolver had been fired.  The affidavit states that prior to the shots fired at the apartment complex, two men standing in the parking lot saw a “flash and heard a pop” and then saw a person dressed in all black run from the lot.  A witness told authorities he went to the lot and confronted the man in the gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, telling him to leave the property immediately after he saw a revolver in the man’s hand. The witness told authorities he had seen the man, identified as Dorsey, coming and going from an apartment belonging to a woman tenant for several months prior."

It was tough for Alejandro Baez to talk about his son on Tuesday, who he said was his best friend. He described the pain his family now carries after deputies killed his oldest son, 20-year-old Jayden Baez, and why they are pushing for those responsible to be held accountable. “The pain, as a father having his oldest child killed like that. It's something I live every day,” he said.Alejandro Baez can’t believe his son’s life ended at such a young age. “What happened for Pokémon cards and pizza — that's not good,” he said. “The pain is every day. It doesn't get better.”Jayden Baez was with two teenagers when deputies came to Target responding to a call about a suspicious car and stolen Pokémon cards and pizza worth about $40. Since that day, more than a year ago last April, charges were dropped against the two teens. But the quest for justice is just beginning. “They go to jail or prison, losing jobs. This world needs to be kept better,” Alejandro Baez said. On Tuesday, attorney Mark NeJame, who is representing the Baez family, said he plans to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against Sheriff Marco Lopez and at least two other deputies from the sheriff’s office, claiming they used “excessive, unreasonable and unnecessary force and violence.” He’s also looking into questionable reports from the day of the shooting. “I've never in many decades of practicing seen four reports filed at the same minute in the same hour, signed by the same program, signed by or witnessed by the same person.

It has been more than a year since the shooting took place. While on scene at the shooting, Sheriff Lopez requested the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to do an independent review into the actions of the deputies.

While the department says the incident is isolated, residents stress there is a bad feeling about their neighborhood.  “All around the road, you’ll find needles on the road,” one woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said. “People be walking up and down our street at 3 a.m.”  She has been trying to move for some time and said she doesn’t know how safe her family is.

An 18-year-old man was arrested Monday in suburban Maywood and charged in the May 2022 attack of Dakotah Earley, police said. The man faces three felony counts, including attempted murder, armed robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle, as well as a misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a vehicle.  The man’s name has not been released.  Earley was walking in the 1300 block of West Webster Avenue when he was ambushed by a pair of robbers, one of whom shot him twice in his back and once in his head, prosecutors said. A neighbor who witnessed the attack rushed to Earley’s aid until paramedics arrived, likely saving his life.  Tyshon Brownlee, 19, was also charged with attempted murder in the shooting.  Earley was seriously wounded in the shooting, which left him on life support as he underwent more than a dozen surgeries, including having his left leg amputated below the knee, his family said.  Joy Dobbs, Earley’s mother, has shared updates on social media throughout his recovery. She said she had “mixed emotions” to hear the second man had been charged.  “We are happy that this individual has been removed from our streets and will be held accountable for his role in the shooting, but it is also very hard for us to relive that day again,” Dobbs said.  Credit: GoFundMe Dakotah Earley was a culinary arts student up until recently, when he decided to take a break to focus on other things.  Earley has sued former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, former police Supt. David Brown and two unnamed police officers, claiming they missed multiple chances to stop the men accused in the ambush.  Larry Disparti, one of Earley’s lawyers, reiterated in a statement Tuesday that the police department’s “no-pursuit” policy played a significant role in the attack on Earley.  “We will continue to fight on the family’s behalf until justice is served,” Disparti said.  Cass Casper, another of Earley’s attorneys, previously said the crime was preventable. Attorneys reviewed dispatches that show police spotted Brownlee in a stolen BMW near Soldier Field about an hour before the shooting.  Brownlee sped away, and officers did not chase him, Casper said.  “If police continued their pursuit earlier, it could have prevented this entire chain of events,” Casper said. “All they had to do was tail the perpetrator and make him stop. But they didn’t.”  There were “numerous incidents” where police could have previously caught Brownlee, who was known to law enforcement for a “violent rampage” and robbery spree in the days prior to Earley’s shooting, Casper said.  Casper blamed a police directive issued in August 2020 “ingrained in the minds of rank-and-file officers not to chase under any circumstances.”  The changes to the department’s chase policy came after the City Council approved a $15 million settlement to the family of a 37-year-old mother of six who was killed in 2020 when an officer chasing a carjacking suspect slammed into her car in Lakeview. That officer had been ordered to stop the chase before the fatal crash occurred.  Now, officers must “consider the need for immediate apprehension of an eluding suspect and the requirement to protect the public from the danger created by eluding offenders.” Marked police cars chasing someone must have their lights and sirens activated.  Credit: Twitter/Joy Dobbs Dakotah Earley is walking again by using a test prosthesis.  Earley spoke publicly for the first time in February. He said he plans to stay in Chicago and is talking to his mom about going back to school.  Good music got him through the days he battled for his life, he said.  “I try not to think about what happened too much. There are times I think maybe I should have done that, or done this, but this could happen to anyone,” Earley said. “Push forward.

The next day, charges against Haydee Rivera-Nadeau were upgraded.  After her arrest, two days after the shooting in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rivera-Nadeau faced a charge of attempted murder. She now faces a charge of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the Strafford County Department of Corrections, officials said Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak to her arrest.  Rocheleau's death was found to be a homicide caused by a gunshot wound, officials said.

The 50-year-old was a mother of three, and Rivera-Nadeau was her former domestic partner, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.  A woman was arrested in North Carolina after a shooting that left another woman critically injured in Rochester, New Hampshire.  Rocheleau's shooting, at the Professional Arts Building on Winter Street, was reported just before noon on May 1. She'd been shot in the head and rushed to the hospital, where she was in critical condition, officials have said.  Police said they were able to identify a female suspect early on in their investigation and issued an arrest warrant for Rivera-Nadeau, a 65-year-old from Somersworth, charging her with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and, at the time, attempted second-degree murder.  Rivera-Nadeau was arrested shortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday night by police in Charlotte after Rochester police contacted them to let them know they believed she was in the area, police said. She was taken into custody without incident and charged with being a fugitive from justice, then extradited to New Hampshire."

He is currently being held without bond in the Jennifer Road Detention Center and is scheduled to appear May 22 in District Court.  According to charging documents, Nunez-Menendez attended the party on Brick Church Road with his uncle. A witness who knew the uncle through work told police an argument broke out between the two victims and Nunez-Menendez, who drew a handgun and shot both men multiple times, police said.  After the shooting, Nunez-Menendez and his uncle fled the party in a pickup truck, the witness said.  Speaking to witnesses and friends of the family, investigators were able to gather information on Nunez-Menendez before witnesses positively identified him in a photo lineup.

Bobby Solis is accused of fatally shooting John Eric Garcia at a West Side apartment complex.  An arrest affidavit says witnesses told police at the time of the shooting that they saw Solis in the complex’s parking lot in the 1100 block of Callaghan Road.  They said they also saw Garcia going out to meet with Solis and heard gunshots a few minutes later.  According to the affidavit, police spent months researching the case and eventually found surveillance video and cellphone records that placed Solis at the scene.  In court on Tuesday, Solis’ defense attorney said both men were in the Mexican Mafia and had an ongoing feud.  Solis is not denying that he was with Garcia but says another person with him was the one to shoot Garcia, and he had nothing to do with it.  The first evidence to be shown to the jury was two 911 calls that were made after Garcia was shot.  His girlfriend and aunt can be heard trying to render aid to Garcia, but he would later die at the scene from his wounds.  Testimony will continue Wednesday morning. If Solis is found guilty, he is facing up to life in prison.  Related:"

The families of two teenagers shot to death at the program filed a lawsuit alleging the program and Keeps were negligent in not keeping the premises safe. (Associated Press)  DES MOINES — The families of two teenagers shot to death in a Des Moines alternative education program have filed a lawsuit alleging the program and its founder were negligent in not keeping the premises safe.  The families of Rashad Carr, 16, and Gionni Dameron, 18, filed the lawsuit Monday against the program Starts Right Here and its founder Will Keeps.  Both teens were killed Jan. 23 in a shooting at the educational program designed to keep at-risk youth out of trouble. Keeps, an activist and rapper whose given name is Will Holmes, also was shot and seriously injured but survived.  Advertisement  Student Preston Walls, 18, has been accused of the shooting, and police allege Bravon Tukes, 19, drove a getaway car. Both Walls and Tukes face charges including two counts of first-degree murder.  Prosecutors have said in court filings that the shootings revolved around a dispute between rival gangs.  In the lawsuit, the families of Carr and Dameron argue that Keeps and the program knew of potential dangers but didn't take needed steps to protect the two teens. At the time, Starts Right Here did not have security guards, but after the shootings the program reopened with guards and metal detectors.  The program has a contract with Des Moines schools to work with students who have struggled in their traditional high schools. The program is housed at an office park on the edge of downtown Des Moines.  In a text message sent to Des Moines media outlets, Keeps said he was “surprised and deeply hurt” that the families would sue him.  “I am crushed that after being thanked for helping to save and change the lives of their sons that I am now their target,"" Keeps said.

Some may find them disturbing.  JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The State Attorney’s Office on Tuesday ruled the police-involved shooting on Jacksonville’s Northside that left two people dead — and seriously wounded a Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office K-9 — justifiable.  In a report released by the State Attorney’s Office, it was determined the shooting on Zoo Parkway in July was a valid use of force.  The officers involved will have to go before an internal board to see if the shooting was within departmental guidelines.  K-9 Huk was shot on Zoo Parkway on the Northside in July after police pursued three suspects from a shooting incident. The two men who died at the scene were identified as Lockett and Tyjarius Holton, 18. The report said a third person, Robert Motley, 32, who is in custody.  Related: ‘Get him out of here now!’ Bodycam shows moments officers save K-9 shot while going after suspects | Bodycam shows what led to JSO K-9 Huk, men being shot following pursuit & crash  According to a report, the shootout started when Lockett fired shots at police on West 45th Street and then sped off with two people in the car. The report says – Lockett was driving up to 97 miles per hour. During the chase, officers did not know Lockett had two passengers inside. One of the passengers, Motley, told police he asked Lockett multiple times to let him out of the car, but Lockett refused.  When Lockett got to Zoo Parkway he hit a car which caused him to lose control and crash into a fence at Jacksonville Zoo. Police were worried Lockett would get out of the car - and enter the zoo. That’s when they sent in K-9 Huk.  RELATED: Who is Huk? A loyal police K-9 who’s helped capture wanted men, including deputy’s suspected killer  JSO released body cam footage showing Huk going toward the suspect’s car. Moments after he goes in shots are fired by police. Huk was then hit in the rear leg.  More body cam footage shows Huk, his handler, and another officer in a helicopter taking the K9 to a veterinary office. His handler was discussing the shooting.  To be clear, JSO hasn’t finished its investigation into what happened, and whose bullets hit the dog. The body camera video previously released by JSO shows the moment Huk was hit. The service dog yelps in pain as officers fire into the suspects’ vehicle, killing two of the three men inside.  News4JAX Crime Analyst Lakesha Burton said situations like this are common in the police world.  “We call that friendly fire,” Burton said. “And that’s when an officer accidentally hit someone that’s on their side. So that is ultimately what the response to the resistance board is for. So they will examine all of the evidence and have the officer be able to articulate why he shot and you know, officers are accountable for every bullet that they fired from their firearm.”  Burton said if the officer is found responsible for shooting the K-9 he could receive training counseling or something along those lines.  JSO’s Response to Resistance Board will review the incident to see whether the use of deadly force was within departmental guidelines."

Noe Mejia, 38, was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on March 14 in southwestern Arizona north of Sasabe. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck, according to Mejia’s autopsy report obtained by The Arizona Republic.  Defibrillator pads were on Mejia’s front torso when the autopsy exam was conducted the day after the shooting. Mejia’s time of death was 7:26 p.m.  Mejia was suspected of smuggling five undocumented migrants in a BMW before fleeing from Border Patrol agents.  The Pima County Sheriff's Department is conducting an external criminal investigation into the shooting. The department will make a recommendation to the Pima County Attorney's Office whether criminal charges should be filed.  Tucson Sector has highest number of use-of-force incidents  The shooting took place in the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector, which has the highest number of use-of-force incidents across the agency, with 142 incidents reported so far in fiscal year 2023, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.  In 2022, 196 incidents were reported. The Tucson Sector is followed by El Paso, where 120 incidents have been reported so far this fiscal year, per CBP data.  Body camera footage:CBP releases body camera video for fatal Border Patrol shooting in Arizona  CBP released the body camera footage of the shooting April 14, nearly a month after it happened. The release was the first time that CBP released a body camera video of an agent-involved shooting.  Mejia’s family was “horrified and re-traumatized” by the release of the body camera footage showing the shooting, according to Joy Bertrand, one of the attorneys representing various members of Mejia’s next of kin.  “They're devastated,” said José Saldivar, an attorney co-counseling with Bertrand on the case.  At least one of Mejia’s siblings was allowed to review the footage before it was made public, Saldivar said. Saldivar said more footage is available that would “paint a better picture” relating to the delay in rendering aid to Mejia after he had been shot.  Video shows fatal encounter  In the video, Mejia can be seen immediately slumping forward toward the steering wheel after being shot. Mejia had a sleeve of black tattoos on his left forearm and was wearing a San Francisco 49ers winter hat.  The agent had positioned his pickup truck behind the BMW before getting out and smashing the rear and front driver’s side windows with his baton. Mejia and the agent then began to struggle as the agent tried to hold onto Mejia’s left arm, which was coming out of the broken driver’s side window.  Initial reporting:Border Patrol agent shoots, kills man after vehicle pursuit near Sasabe  The agent continued to try to hold onto Mejia’s arm as he began to reverse the car.  Then, as Mejia began to sharply turn the wheel to turn the car left, the agent pulled out his handgun and fired once at Mejia inside the car.  Two agents rendered aid to Mejia by trying to resuscitate him and by using a defibrillator. Mejia was pronounced dead at the scene by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.  “I believe that this officer does need to be charged criminally,” Saldivar said.  BMW first spotted near Sasabe port of entry  The episode began at 6:18 p.m. when a Border Patrol remote camera operator saw several suspected undocumented migrants load into a BMW about one mile north of the Sasabe port of entry.  Two Border Patrol agents started following the BMW and noticed that the driver was driving in an “erratic manner.” The agents turned on their emergency equipment to perform a traffic stop, but the driver kept going and a chase ensued.  The agents chased the BMW as the driver turned west near mile marker 20 on State Route 286 onto Brown Bear Canyon Road. The BMW driver tried to turn around at 6:41 p.m. by turning the car south 3.8 miles west of SR 286.  The video footage and other evidence were given to the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department hours after the shooting, CBP said.

Jeremiah M. Grady, 20, of Minneapolis agreed on Monday in Hennepin County District Court to plead guilty to second-degree intentional murder and second-degree attempted murder in connection with the shooting of London Bean on Sept. 8, 2021, outside Grady's apartment building at N. 8th and Aldrich avenues.  The plea agreement between the prosecution and the defense calls for Grady to be sentenced to a term of more than 30½ years. With credit for time in jail since his arrest, Grady is expected to serve the first 18⅔ years in prison and the balance on supervised release. Grady remains jailed ahead of sentencing on Aug. 11.  According to the charges:  London was shot after getting into a fight with another boy, believed to be Grady's younger brother, while several adults looked on.  As the fight continued, witnesses told police that Grady — wearing a black ski mask and dressed in all black — came around from the back of the building and pointed a gun at everyone, yelling, ""Yeah! Wassup!""  As people ran, Grady fired off several shots, two of which struck London in the chest and abdomen. London was taken by emergency responders to a nearby hospital and was pronounced dead there.  As Grady fled, he fired at a blue SUV parked nearby, narrowly missing a teenage girl, police said. Grady, who was 18 years old at the time of the shooting, surrendered to police about three weeks later.  Also charged in connection with London's death is Grady's father. Letterance Grady, 41, of Minneapolis allegedly encouraged his son to retaliate against the Bean family for perceived bullying and drove him to the scene of the shooting.  Letterance Grady is charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, aiding and abetting attempted second-degree murder and harboring a fugitive. He was arrested four days after his son.  The father is in jail in Anoka County, where he's charged with first-degree robbery on allegations that he was one of two people who held up a T-Mobile store in Columbia Heights in August 2021."

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.  On a cold evening in March, at a school board meeting in Oxford, Michigan, Buck Myre approached members with a sheaf of papers. As they were passed down the line, he paced and fidgeted.  For three minutes, the room was quiet. One board member covered her eyes with both hands. Finally, Myre stepped to the lectern. He released a shaky exhale, crackling the microphone.  “I don’t even know where to start, and I don’t even know what to say,” he said. “But imagine — you can’t imagine. But imagine going to the coroner’s office and picking this up.”  The papers were copies of his 16-year-old son’s death certificate.  On Nov. 30, 2021, Tate Myre and three other students — Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17 — were shot and killed inside Oxford High School by a 15-year-old sophomore. Seven more were shot but lived.  The shooter, who pleaded guilty to murder, terrorism and other felonies, awaits a hearing to determine whether he’ll face a life sentence without parole. His parents, who bought a gun for the troubled teenager four days before the shooting, are charged with involuntary manslaughter and awaiting trial.  But for many families, that’s not enough. They want a full accounting of what happened and whether it could have been prevented — which they still haven’t received.  “I do believe that things went wrong that day,” Myre told the school board in March. “And I don’t understand why we’re running from it. I don’t get it.”  Oxford has ordered an external review of the shooting, and school officials say they too want answers. But many parents say those same officials have stonewalled them, delayed the review and not committed to full transparency or accountability.  Nationwide, there’s no protocol for such reviews. If they happen at all — “usually where we see higher body counts” — they vary widely in process and purpose, said James Densley, co-founder and president of the Violence Project, a nonprofit research center. Such a haphazard approach not only leads to mistrust inside communities, experts say, but wastes an opportunity to extract lessons that may prevent the next tragedy.  After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, a state commission delivered a preliminary report 322 days later, reaching the community before the first anniversary.  In Newtown, Connecticut, the local state’s attorney issued a report 346 days after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. After a 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, a state panel’s report arrived in 136 days.  In Oxford, it’s been more than 525 days, and counting.  Two weeks after the shooting, Oxford’s school board voted unanimously for a review to begin “immediately.” But the board declined multiple offers from Michigan’s attorney general to investigate. For six months after the shooting, following guidance from a lawyer retained by its insurance company, the board insisted a review must wait for criminal and civil cases to resolve.  Finally, in May 2022, after facing community pressure, Oxford decided to hire Guidepost Solutions, a company that has investigated abuse allegations at the Southern Baptist Convention.  But Guidepost struggled to get people to cooperate with its review, including those who work for the district. Unions and the lawyer brought in by the school’s insurance provider cautioned against talking. “In our experience, the extent of third-party interference of this investigation has been unusually extraordinary,” Guidepost has said in a statement.  During the tumult, two board members resigned, later saying that they felt the board was not well served by the lawyer’s involvement.  Guidepost declined to comment for this story. Oxford Community Schools and its insurance company didn’t respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment. The lawyer, Timothy Mullins, didn’t respond to ProPublica’s inquiries about his actions on behalf of the board.  “Obviously, this community wants answers,” the school board’s president, Dan D’Alessandro, told ProPublica. “That’s why we hired Guidepost — to get those answers.”  He added: “Once we have an opportunity to look at everything, then we’ll make any changes that are necessary.”  Guidepost delivered a report this month that assessed Oxford’s current strategies for security, suicide intervention and threat assessment. But it’s the second report, the one that will examine the events surrounding the shooting, that many parents feel is essential. It will draw from interviews as well as case files from investigators. However, it is unclear when it will be released.  Meanwhile, in lieu of a timely and comprehensive accounting, many Oxford families are left with unsettling questions.  “Every Tuesday marks another week without those four precious children that didn’t get to come home,” said a woman who works for the school at the March meeting, “and we still don’t get to have the answers for what happened, and people are still working at this school who were directly involved.”  I’m here, she added, to “demand the report be given to us.”  ‘I have access to the gun and ammo’  On the rural-urban fringe of southeast Michigan, where about 1,800 students attended Oxford High School, the final weeks of 2021 had everyone on edge.  In November, a student displayed a severed deer head in the courtyard with red paint looking like blood. He was disciplined, but less than a week later, in a boys’ restroom, students found a bird’s head in a jar.  Law enforcement and school personnel investigated but were unable to determine its origin, the district superintendent said in an email sent weeks later. As it happened, a sophomore named Ethan Crumbley was responsible for the bird’s head. He recorded the decapitation on his phone and wrote about it in his journal.  This is one of many disturbing details from the weeks before — and the day of — the shooting that were described in court documents and public testimony.  Ethan was spiraling, public records show. His Spanish teacher emailed school counselor Shawn Hopkins, saying he seemed sad. In a brief meeting outside a classroom, Hopkins told Ethan he was available if he wanted to talk.  On Nov. 26, Ethan’s father bought him a SIG Sauer 9 mm handgun. Three days later, an English teacher caught him searching online for bullets. She emailed Nicholas Ejak, dean of students, and Pamela Fine, another counselor.  At a five-minute meeting with Fine and Hopkins, Ethan told the counselors it was hobby research. Appearing calm, he said he’d gone to the range with his mom that weekend with his new gun. (She posted about it on Instagram: “Mom and son day testing out his new Xmas present.”)  Fine left a voicemail with Ethan’s mom, saying guns may be a hobby but searching for ammunition during class wasn’t good behavior.  His mom texted Ethan: “Seriously? Looking up bullets in school?? … Lol, I’m not mad you have to learn not to get caught.”  That evening, Ethan posted on Twitter: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. See you tomorrow Oxford.”  Early on a foggy Tuesday morning, Hopkins got an email sent by Ejak about an English teacher who’d caught Ethan watching a shooting video. Some 20 minutes later, a math teacher informed Ejak that on a test review, Ethan drew a picture of a handgun, a bullet, a laughing face with tears and a twice-shot figure with blood pouring from its mouth.  “Blood everywhere,” Ethan wrote.  “My life is useless.”  “The world is dead.”  “The thoughts won’t stop.”  “Help me.”  The video he watched was only a game, Ethan said in the counselor’s office.  Hopkins, Ejak and Fine are among the school staff that have faced civil suits from the case, including in federal court. Mullins, a lawyer representing them and the school district, said in an email that because of ongoing litigation, he wouldn’t comment on the facts of the case. In a motion to dismiss federal lawsuits, Mullins wrote that “nothing about what the individual defendants knew could have put them on notice” that Ethan “posed the specific risk of shooting multiple students.”  Hopkins asked about the drawing. By then, Ethan modified it, adding phrases like “Harmless act” and “I love my life so much!!!!”  Ethan said the drawing depicted a game he wanted to design. Asked about “my life is useless,” Ethan’s demeanor became sad, according to Hopkins’ testimony in a pretrial hearing in the criminal case against Ethan’s parents. He described difficulties, including a grandparent’s death and a family dog dying.  He said he wasn’t a danger to anyone, but Hopkins felt “there was enough suicidal ideation” to call Ethan’s mom, the counselor testified. Both parents arrived about 10:30.  The description of what happened next is based on court documents and public testimony, including from Hopkins. There is not yet a full public account from Ethan or his parents about the office meeting.  Ethan needs help, Hopkins remembered telling the parents, “today, if possible.” He provided a list of mental health resources.  But, the counselor testified, Ethan’s mom said they couldn’t take him that day because they needed to return to work. Hopkins was taken aback. It was the first time he’d had such a meeting where parents would not take their child home, Hopkins said. He told them he wanted Ethan to get support within 48 hours. “I’ll be following up,” he recalled saying.  Looking at his drawing, Ethan’s dad told his son he had people he could talk to and his journal to write in.  “Are we done?” Ethan’s mother asked.  Hopkins asked Ejak if any disciplinary issue prevented Ethan from returning to class. No, Ejak said.  “I guess so,” Hopkins said.  Less than 15 minutes after the meeting began, it was over. Ethan’s parents left without him.  Hopkins wrote Ethan a pass. At some point that morning, Ejak retrieved Ethan’s backpack from math class and returned it to him. No one asked about Ethan’s access to weapons or searched his backpack.  Back at work, his mom mentioned to her boss that she needed to find Ethan a counselor. She texted her son. “You ok? … You know you can talk to us and we won’t judge.”  At a pretrial hearing, a lawyer for Ethan’s mother noted that Hopkins was a mandatory reporter; if he truly felt Ethan was at risk of not getting proper medical attention, including psychological, he must report it to Children’s Protective Services. But no one called outside authorities. Nor did he insist that Ethan leave school.  He wasn’t forced to leave school, Hopkins testified, because “there was no discipline issue.” At the time, Hopkins was concerned that Ethan was a threat to himself and thought it best for him to not be alone. He intended to follow up the next morning about mental health services.  When a lawyer asked if Hopkins thought he should have done anything differently that day, Hopkins said: “I want that situation to be as different as possible. I acted off the information I had available.”  Ethan’s lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. A gag order prevents attorneys involved in his parents’ criminal cases from speaking to the media.  Less than two hours after the meeting with his parents, Hopkins and Ejak, Ethan emerged from a bathroom with the gun that had been in his backpack, along with ammunition and his hard-bound black journal. Every entry described shooting the school, including the last one: “The shooting is tomorrow. I have access to the gun and ammo.”  Ethan turned left and fired.  A patchwork system  When a plane crashes, a federal agency begins an automatic and immediate investigation. Olivia Upham, whose brother was close to where shots were first fired, thought something like that would happen after a school shooting.  “I assumed that an outside agency, whether it be the attorney general, or the FBI, or some sort of commission of education and rule of law experts, would come in and help us with that,” said Upham, who, along with her mother, taught at Oxford’s middle school at the time.  In fact, comprehensive, third-party reviews of school shootings aren’t particularly common.  They typically happen in high-profile cases, said Densley of the Violence Project. “Higher body counts mean more scrutiny, more media attention, more parents who are asking questions about their loved ones.”  Even then, it’s a patchwork process. Multiple government agencies may issue distinct, sometimes overlapping reports, each informed by different investigative tools. Private companies, which may boast of former law enforcement officers and risk management professionals on their staff, are more often brought in for security assessments than for accountability reviews. Victim privacy and preserving a defendant’s right to a fair criminal trial also can add complexity.  Stephen J. Sedensky III, the local state’s attorney who authored one of several reports on the Sandy Hook shooting, said in an email that such reviews by public agencies are “often necessary and helpful in answering questions the public may have, in assisting policy and law makers and in preventing speculation as to the unknown.”  However, he noted, even with numerous Sandy Hook reports, speculation and conspiracies still took root in a vocal minority. “Victims’ families suffered and continue to suffer.”  Parkland is unusual in how thoroughly it was investigated. The state appointed a commission with parents, educators, law enforcement, advocates, public officials and mental health professionals. Even with the alleged shooter facing trial, the commission issued the preliminary report before the first anniversary. Within 20 months, it delivered its full 389-page report.  It was a deep dive into the shooter’s life and exposed chaotic breaches of protocol by school officials and law enforcement. The report catalyzed a number of significant new policies. The commission, which is funded by Florida’s Legislature through 2026, continues to address school safety and threat assessment statewide.  Max Schachter, a commissioner whose 14-year-old son died in the Parkland shooting, said the work was difficult “because every time we met, I basically had to relive Alex’s murder all over again.”  But, he said, the commission is devoted to making sure “that something good comes from this tragedy.”  ‘We couldn’t be true to our community’  Both of Steve St. Juliana’s daughters were at Oxford High School the day of the shooting. Only one came home.  Hana — athletic, empathetic, “a really bright soul,” her dad said — was shot and killed. As early details emerged about the shooter’s interactions with school officials, St. Juliana said he tried “desperately to give them the benefit of doubt.”  School officials sent some signals that they wanted to get answers for families like his.  Within a week, Oxford’s superintendent and the school board president at the time called for a third-party review. The board subsequently voted 7-0 on an eight-part resolution for a review that “will look far beyond the criminal investigation and into all the systemic factors that were at play.”  But by then, Mullins had assumed a large role in shaping decisions, advising the board and speaking on behalf of the district. Scarcely three hours after the shooting stopped, the district’s insurance company, SET SEG, connected Mullins with Oxford.  The insurer retained Mullins, and it would come at no cost to the district, according to a Nov. 30 email from a SET SEG claim manager to two top school officials. Mullins can “provide any legal assistance you may need.”  Mullins’ speciality: school immunity. He has successfully defended districts when a school conducted strip searches of students and when a football player died at practice.  Tom Donnelly, then the school board president, told ProPublica that it seemed that Mullins never wanted a review. “He had no intention of it happening.”  Mullins later told a Detroit News reporter that a review was premature and a waste of money. “Any lawyer would say don’t talk to anybody but us,” he said.  In December, state Attorney General Dana Nessel made her first of three offers for an investigation. The district turned her down. Mullins replied to Nessel in an email saying the district was already cooperating with the local prosecutor and sheriff, according to The Detroit News.  “I’m disappointed, quite honestly,” Nessel said on CNN. She said she hoped the district “cares as much about the safety of their students as they do shielding themselves from civil liability.”  Weeks passed. Months. No investigation.  To St. Juliana, the stakes couldn’t have been higher. “If you can’t even talk about it, if you can’t even admit what you did wrong, how are you supposed to fix it?” he said. “And we’re just supposed to have faith that you’re going to fix this behind the scenes? … And, more and more, you find out just how badly they messed up.”  A small cohort of community members began to conduct their own investigation of sorts, exploring not only Oxford’s policies on paper but its practices. They questioned whether Oxford consistently trained staff in threat assessment — a process for determining if a student poses a threat of violence — and whether it had in place the threat assessment team described in its own policies. If there was such a team, they asked, why wasn’t it activated in November 2021?  “We were not prepared,” said Danielle Krozek, an Oxford mom. “And so as a parent with a kid in school now, are we prepared now?”  In an email to community members in January 2022, the superintendent at the time said that “we have always taken threats very seriously and will continue to listen to students and parents who report threats to the district. In reminding everyone to ‘say something if you see something’ we are in no way suggesting that our community has ever hesitated to do so in the past.”  The principal, administrators, teachers and support staff “followed their training and implemented our District’s detailed emergency plans and protocol” on Nov. 30, 2021, and “put the safety of our students above their own safety,” wrote then-Superintendent Tim Throne, who has since retired.  The board insisted that a formal review couldn’t proceed because it would interfere with the criminal cases against the shooter and his parents. Two former board members said they believed this because of what Mullins told them.  The prosecutor’s office contradicted that explanation. Following inquiries from parents, it sent a March 4 letter to Oxford families saying that a review wouldn’t interfere with criminal proceedings — and that it had communicated this to school attorneys, too.  “To be clear,” the letter said, “decisions about what, when and how to conduct any investigation or assessment are up to the School Board and the community, and our office is not asking anyone to delay those efforts.”  But board members continued to blame looming legal cases for the delay. Lawyers for the district never delivered the prosecutor’s message to them, according to Donnelly and former board member Korey Bailey. They felt they had few options. Their understanding, they said, was that if they didn’t heed the advice of the attorney retained for Oxford by SET SEG, the insurer could rescind its coverage.  “Insurance companies had us by the throats,” Donnelly said. “We couldn’t be honest, and we couldn’t do our jobs, and we couldn’t be true to our community.”  Parents forwarded the prosecutor’s message to school officials, spoke at meetings and held a press conference. Donnelly and Bailey acknowledge it took two more months for the board to realize that the parents were right. In May, after the prosecutor’s office issued a letter affirming its support for an independent investigation, the board changed course. It retained its own law firm and soon hired Guidepost.  “I did not feel the level of confidence and trust in the attorney from the insurance company to allow him to continue representing me as a board member,” Bailey said, “and I strongly supported the board finding our own legal representation that we could trust.”  As Guidepost began seeking interviews with school employees, Mullins played a role in urging union members to be careful about participating.  Doug Pratt, the Michigan Education Association’s director for public affairs, told ProPublica in an email that the union passed along Mullins’ advice, which he said was that “members who are or could be litigants shouldn’t participate in the third party review, which is voluntary.” Some members have participated, and some declined, Pratt said.  In an email to ProPublica, Mullins said that “critical witnesses have all been interviewed by law enforcement officials. They have also been deposed — under oath — by victims’ attorneys. Their sworn testimony has been set forth in voluminous transcripts, which are available to all parties and were provided to Guidepost by my firm.”  By fall, Donnelly and Bailey had seen enough. They resigned from the board and held a press conference alleging failures in Oxford’s threat assessment practices.  Bailey said he believes that in the aftermath of school shootings, there needs to be a high-level agency that automatically investigates what happened. Without one, “the school’s insurance company was allowed to come in and take charge.”  D’Alessandro, the current board president, said he’s aware of the community’s anxiety and mistrust as it waits for answers. “Sometimes the messaging that comes out from the legal system and the legal teams isn’t necessarily reflective of that of what the school district is trying to do,” he said.  In January, Guidepost reported that it didn’t have interviews with 20% to 30% of witnesses and 50% to 60% of critical witnesses. Noting the absence of criminal allegations against school personnel and immunity protections for government employees, Guidepost urged people to come forward.  Over nearly 18 months, Oxford has taken steps to invest in the physical security of the high school, as this month’s 179-page report documented. That includes installing a weapons screening system at several entrances, using a camera-based artificial intelligence technology intended to detect weapons and mandating that students only carry clear backpacks during the school day. It also made changes to its threat assessment protocol. The report described strengths in current policies and practices, as well as gaps and excesses.  That’s not enough, said Brian Cooper, the father of two high schoolers. He wants to see the report on what went wrong. “I feel like they’re delaying it intentionally to make people give up. And that’s damaging for families that lost children, and had their children shot.”  ‘You are running out of time’  Oxford will soon graduate the second class of students who escaped with their lives.  “You are running out of time to look these kids in the eye and tell them what was broken on Nov. 30,” 2021, said Renee Upham at an April board meeting. Along with her daughter Olivia, she used to teach at Oxford Middle School, and her son was inside the school during the shooting.  In March, a circuit court dismissed civil allegations against the district and its employees, including school counselors and the dean of students, affirming that the defendants are protected from the claims against them by governmental immunity. An appeal is expected. On Friday, a federal judge issued an opinion on 10 related lawsuits, granting them in part and dismissing them in part. The claims that Hopkins, Ejak and Oxford Community Schools presented a state-created danger can go forward.  “I don’t want to make a profit off of this. This is about forcing them to change,” said Andrea Jones, co-founder of the student-parent group Change4Oxford, which initiated a federal lawsuit. “And it’s really sad, if you think about it, that we have to bring a lawsuit to do that.”  The community remains shaken, and tensions roil. An Instagram account run by students shares their poetry, with titles like “Stuck,” “Why” and “Nothing will happen if we do nothing.” Parents report problems with bullying and kids struggling to attend class in the same building where they were shot at.  Some students, including Reina St. Juliana, Hana’s sister, created the group No Future Without Today to prevent future tragedies. She and her father advocated at the state Capitol for gun safety bills, which, after a February shooting at Michigan State University, were signed into law.  And a battle is brewing over the May 18 graduation ceremony. Many students want to wear orange cords sent to them by Students Demand Action, which is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group. But the superintendent said in a statement that no unapproved apparel is allowed.  Family members protested in emails to school officials. Despite the school’s “lack of procedures and protocols that allowed November 30 to happen, these students continue to show up and participate to earn enough credits to graduate,” wrote Chalmers Fitzpatrick, an Oxford mom. “They want to wear orange, and this should be a no-brainer.”  After hearing from family members and students, the district offered to let students wear navy and gold cords to acknowledge “the incomparable challenges they have had to face in their journey.”  “I get the impression they want people to graduate, move on, forget,” Olivia Upham said. “The less people in Oxford that were there that day, the less pressure they’re going to get.”"

Dan Taylor said on Monday, he discovered a bullet just feet from one of his windows.  “It’s 125 inches from my house on my driveway, when the night before I had family members for Mother’s Day parked right here,” Taylor told KSL TV.  Taylor said it was only the latest concerning event on his property.  Over the past three years, he said he had discovered as many as 10 bullet holes through sheds and elsewhere on his farm.  “It’s frustrating.”  Taylor said he believed the bullets and bullet holes were coming from target shooting just over the hill to the east of his property.  Neighbors acknowledged the area above the Payson dump was a popular spot for shooters.  “It’s got to be pretty much in a straight line, and they’re just coming over that saddle and right to where we’re at,” Taylor said as he pointed at the saddle-shaped ridgeline.  Taylor reported the most recent case to police.  A spokesman for the Santaquin Police Department, which is tasked with patrolling the Genola area, said officers had been investigating issues related to errant target shooting over the past three years.  According to the spokesman, the department was also concerned about the potential safety issue posed by the errant shots and had urged the Bureau of Land Management to shut down target shooting in that specific area.  Efforts to reach BLM officials Tuesday evening did not immediately result in a response.  Numerous signs were visible in the target shooting area, warning prospective shooters that homes are on the other side of the ridge.  Taylor wasn’t the only neighbor to voice worries. Mike Olsen said he also had found several bullet holes on his property in recent years, and displayed a bullet he found behind his wife’s car next to his house.  “It just seems like if you’re standing out there, you’re just a target,” Olsen said. “There’s so many little kids around this town riding 4-wheelers and their horses, and I’m just afraid one day, somebody’s going to get killed by a stray bullet.”  Taylor, while a KSL TV crew was present, spoke to another neighbor who had a scary experience.  “Ours came through the barn about five feet above my head when I was standing there,” the woman told Taylor while on speakerphone.  Taylor said he has no problem with guns or shooting in general.  “I was born with a gun in my hand,” the former law enforcement officer-turned-farmer laughed.  He urged people to be careful, but he and Olsen both agreed the problem likely wouldn’t go away until the area was shut down to target shooting.  “It’s scary,” Taylor said. “It’s only a matter of time until a person gets hit, something of value gets hit. I’ve got a lot of equipment here. I’ve got a lot of livestock here, and it’s only a matter of time until a person or something valuable is going to get hit. And who is going to be liable? There’s no way of knowing who pulled the trigger over there a mile-and-a-half away, so they walk away and say it was an accident, so the only way to stop that from happening is to close it down for shooting completely.”"

""The power of God just showed brightly and gave me an opportunity to fight through this process and evil is not going to win,"" said Walker, 46, as he sat next to the doctor who treated him and his attorney.  Eight people were killed, including three children. Seven others were injured when a gunman opened fire on innocent shoppers and employees at the busy outdoor shopping center on May 6.  Walker lives in Lewisville but is originally from Lafayette, Louisiana. He is the father of an adult daughter and works in the insurance industry. He said had just dropped off his girlfriend at a store at the mall because it was so busy. When he drove off to find parking, he encountered a barrage of gunfire.  ""I didn't see the shooter, I just felt the shots,"" explained Walker.  Dashcam video for another car showed the moment when the gunman parked his car in the middle of the parking lot and started walking toward the mall. Walker happened to be driving by when he was shot three times.  ""When you see the shots to the windshield you're going to wonder, 'how he's even sitting here today?'"" said Daryl K. Washington, Walker's attorney.  ""I knew I was bleeding profusely, so I got out of my vehicle and I saw what appeared to be a security officer approaching on a Segway and I ran towards that way,"" explained Walker who then encountered Christian LaCour, the Allied Universal security guard who was working at the time and died while helping others to safety.  He said he was running, which turned into jogging and walking and LaCour told him to sit down due to his injuries.  ""And he was behind me and, I don’t have much to say after that. The tragedy occurred,"" he shared.  Walker said he had never been shot before and spoke about how he relied on his faith to get him through the tragedy and the days after.  ""Anytime I am in trouble, I call on the Lord. So I began to praise him, be thankful and glorify him, and I asked him for his protection,"" said Walker.  He was taken to Medical City McKinney, which is about three miles from the Allen Premium Outlets. He was the first of eight patients from the shooting to arrive about 14 minutes after it began, according to the hospital.  He underwent a couple of surgeries to address his injuries. Last week, his daughter spoke about her father's condition and the long journey ahead.  On Tuesday during the news conference, Dr. Elizabeth Kim, MD., who is the trauma director for Medical City McKinney, said they were concerned not only for Walker's bullet wounds but the bullet fragments around his head, neck, chest and arm.  She said he didn't need surgery immediately on that Saturday, but was given a CT scan to see how deep the bullet wounds were. Kim said there were several bullet fragments they were extremely worried about.  ""The bullet was this close to his heart,"" said Kim as she used her index finger and thumb in a pinching motion to illustrate how close he was to death.  ""He had multiple wounds; too many to even count. On his head, shoulder, neck, chest. All those places and some of those bullet tracks were so extensive we actually had to open him up and clean everything out underneath,"" explained Kim.  Walker remains at the hospital and will now begin his rehabilitation process. Medical City McKinney said they're still taking care of three other patients from the shooting.  For Walker, he echoed how his attitude and belief system are helping him push forward.  ""I believe you give love, you get love, and that is why I am here today,"" he said.  Tuesday afternoon Irvin Walker, a survivor of the mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, talked about his recovery and experience.  Hospital staff also shared their experience in treating patients who were brought there from the Allen Premium Outlets.  ""On May 6, in a matter of minutes, our community was shaken and lives were changed forever. A matter of minutes could have altered the course of my life. My family and I had just gotten home from the Allen mall when I received the notification that there was a shooting there. And after the fact, I learned that we had walked the exact same path that the shooter had gone less than an hour before. I came directly to Medical City McKinney, where we immediately stood up the command center,"" said Cassidi Summers, a Registered Nurse who is the chief nursing officer at Medical City McKinney.  She said prior training for critically injured trauma patients prepared them for this moment.  More than 100 nurses, surgeons, physicians, leaders and support staff from Medical City McKinney and across the Medical City Health Care system were in place and ready to go.  Kim said she was at a wedding reception for a hospital colleague when the call came in. She said she left immediately and began coordinating care with surgeons, mobilizing anesthesiologists, blood and so forth within her 20-minute drive.  Once she arrived, Kim said she too could see that their drills and training prepared them for that day. She also commented on a moment that stood out.  ""You had a smile there that I saw when I came in that room, it really was one of the bright parts of that day, you were calm and an inspiration for me,"" said Kim to Walker who replied with a ""Thank You"" during the news conference.  Walker said he has a long journey ahead but credited not only his faith but his support system -- his family and his Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. brothers who have been there with him at the hospital and were there with him during the news conference.  ""I never imaged that I would have to experience this, but I also didn't imagine that, that many people love me,"" said Walker about the support from family, friends and strangers he's received over the past 10 days.

""There's a word that we use when a lot of us are going through the membership intake process and it's the word 'heavy,' you know, and heavy describes adversity, it describes a time that most people regret in their lives, and these guys make sure that I'm not heavy.

As for those who were injured or killed during the shooting, he said, ""It's a horrible situation. It hurts to have to see people suffer. To see their family or kids pass away,"" said Walker who asked for continued prayers for the community.  With the outpouring of support for the victims of the mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets, GoFundMe has launched a centralized hub for all verified fundraisers related to the shooting.

(Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News)  Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes  OGDEN — An Ogden man has been sentenced to four years of probation after pleading guilty and mentally ill in a 2022 accidental shooting that led to the death of a 14-year-old boy.  Zedekiah Mendel Pool, 19, pleaded guilty and mentally ill to manslaughter, a second-degree felony, in January as part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to a term of one to 15 years in the Utah State Prison, but that term was suspended if his probation is successfully completed.  Pool is also required to finish serving 363 days in jail, 354 of which were already completed as of April 25.  On May 5, 2022, police were called to 468 River Drive in Ogden following the report of a gunshot wound. They discovered that 14-year-old Richard Michael ""Mikey"" Mendenhall Jr. had been accidentally shot in the neck.  A GoFundMe account* says Mikey died before paramedics could reach him. ""They brought him back using CPR, but at the time Mikey had already had lack of oxygen for 20 minutes. Mikey was brain dead,"" it states. He died three days later at a hospital.  ""Mikey ended up donating his liver, heart, and kidneys to other children in need,"" the account says.  The post also explains that Mikey was at a friend's house when Pool, ""a newly moved-in roommate,"" brought out the gun.  Police believe Pool was moving the slide on a handgun when the weapon fired in the living room, with the bullet hitting the boy. They do not believe Pool meant to aim at the teen.  ""Follow-up investigation has determined that defendant had consumed marijuana less than five hours prior to the shooting and used and possessed his firearm while he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance,"" court documents state.  In exchange for Pool's plea, charges of possessing equipment for a clandestine laboratory, a second-degree felony, and possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person, a third-degree felony, were dismissed.  *KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

Brooke County Prosecutor Joseph Barki said, in a statement released Tuesday, “Upon a complete and thorough investigation, which included the review of hours of body cam footage and recordings, the State Police has determined that the involved officer exercised a proper and justified use of force, which unfortunately led to the death of Joseph Anthony Henderson, 43.”  Brooke County Sheriff Rich Beatty reported earlier that Follansbee Police and deputies were dispatched after the county’s emergency 911 call center received a call that Henderson was attempting to break into a home on Highland Street at about 12:30 a.m.  Beatty said Henderson was found soon after in his own home elsewhere on the street and had refused to come out for four hours.  The initial investigating officers had been joined by members of the West Virginia State Police and special response teams from Weirton Police and the Brooke and Hancock county sheriffs’ departments.  Barki said, “During multiple attempts to communicate with Mr. Henderson, he made multiple references regarding his possession and intent to use a .40 caliber handgun and potentially shoot law enforcement officers.”  “Thereafter, he exited the residence with what appeared to be a semiautomatic handgun in his hand and his actions thereafter required the use of force,” said Barki.  He said the weapon was found to be an air gun modeled in appearance after a Walther CP99 semiautomatic handgun.  Beatty said earlier that after tear gas was released into the house, Henderson emerged from the rear, brandishing the handgun, and was shot by one of his deputies.  Henderson was transported to a Pittsburgh hospital where he was later pronounced dead.  Barki said he “met with the lead investigator from the West Virginia State Police to review the investigative materials and collect evidence and determined that there does not appear to be any evidence to establish that the involved officer had committed a criminal act. Accordingly, no charges will be presented to the Brooke County grand jury for consideration.”  (Scott can be contacted at wscott@heraldstaronline.com.)"

The Covenant School and Covenant Presbyterian Church filed motions to intervene in lawsuits calling for the Metro Nashville Police Department to release several records relating to the mass shooting.  The school wrote that the requested records may include confidential information that could endanger its school's students and faculty if released.  ""The records sought ... may include and/or relate to sensitive information owned by The Covenant School, including, but not limited to the schematics of school facilities, and confidential information pertaining to The Covenant School employees and students,"" the school wrote in its expedited motion to intervene, filed Monday. ""The release of such information could cause security and safety issues.""  The requested documents include the shooter's writings as well as nearly all police communications about the writings, including ""emails, texts and other communications.""  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch earlier characterized the shooter's writings more as ""ramblings"" rather than pointing to any clear motive.  Covenant is hoping to argue its motion to intervene at a status conference set for Monday afternoon in one of the lawsuits.  The plaintiff in that case, Clata Brewer, acting on behalf of the National Police Association, didn't object to Covenant's request. Brewer wrote in a response on Monday that she does not oppose the motion to intervene ""for the limited purpose of allowing Covenant Church to claim the specific interest it alleges.""  Covenant filed a nearly identical motion in another lawsuit seeking the shooter's writings filed last week by the owner of the conservative radio station The Tennessee Star.  Meanwhile, calls for the release of records related to the shooting are growing in the statehouse. On Monday, the House GOP delivered a letter signed by 66 of the House's 74 Republican members to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake asking that the shooter's writings and ""all relevant medical records and toxicology reports"" be released. The letter doesn't specify what medical records the legislators consider relevant.  Republicans argued that the writings are needed to understand the shooter's motives ahead of a special legislative session on gun reform called by Gov. Bill Lee.  ""We are united in our shared common goal and duty to protect the safety and wellbeing of Tennesseans. The release of these records is critical to the General Assembly's ability to construct effective solutions that can prevent future acts of violence,"" they wrote.  House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, responded in a statement that Republicans have refused to reach across the aisle on gun safety legislation because they've been ""bizarrely focused on a diary.""  “Gun violence is an epidemic plaguing our communities and threatening the safety of every family on a daily basis. The people of Tennessee deserve courageous and sensible leadership on this issue. These GOP delay tactics only serve to leave our families exposed and vulnerable. Meanwhile, Democrats are researching and drafting potential legislation that an overwhelming majority of Tennesseans support,"" Clemmons said. ""I hope to see as many GOP signatures on our bipartisan gun safety legislation as they got on that letter.”  The legislature will reconvene for the special session on Aug. 21.

Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the carnage, which also left 17 wounded.  In the 12 months since one of the bloodiest school shootings in U.S. history transformed this quiet Texas community into another example of the nation’s complicated relationship with guns, the parents of the children killed last May 24 have not moved on.  Some have harnessed their anger into political action, wielding it like a shield to protect themselves from getting lost in their pain. Others have seen their worlds shrink under the weight of unrelenting grief, with only close friends and family allowed inside their increasingly insular worlds.  Of the six parents NBC interviewed in Uvalde, all said the shooting remains fresh in their minds. They said they still expect to hear their children’s voices when they wake up in the morning or when someone tells a joke that would have made their kids laugh. They have built makeshift memorials filled with toys, photos and other memories that have remained as vibrant as the day they were made.  “We take it day by day,” said Brett Cross, whose 10-year-old son, Uziyah Garcia, was among those killed last year. “There’s no good days anymore. There’s just all-right days.”  Uziyah's dad  On a breezy April afternoon, Brett Cross slowly shook his head as he gazed at his son’s memorial in the Uvalde town square. It’s just one of almost two dozen similar memorials surrounding a large fountain in a lush municipal park. Murals of the 21 victims light up public walls throughout the city, turning Uvalde into an outdoor gallery filled with colorful works by various Texas artists.  Adorned with flowers and handwritten notes, Uziyah’s memorial stands apart from the others with its oversize stuffed lion and red Spiderman basket.  “Time doesn’t heal,” Cross said, exhausted from a recent trip to Austin where he joined other families and advocates pushing for a gun bill that would raise the minimum age from 18 to 21 for buying an assault-style weapon.  Cross has become a full-time gun reform activist and one of the most vocal proponents of new gun laws in the year since his son was killed, driving three hours every week to the Texas capital to champion tougher laws that supporters say would prevent future tragedies. He now has more than 58,000 followers on Twitter, regularly speaks with elected leaders and trained himself to speak out after mass shootings."

The shooting happened on Pulaski Road near Wilcox Street in West Garfield Park at 5:39 p.m. – not too long after school let out. The Legler Regional Library is located near the scene.  As CBS 2's Charlie De Mar reported, a security guard near the shooting scene is being credited with keeping the younger boy alive.  Evidence markers indicating shell casings covered the ground near the scene after the shooting.  ""I saw just kids crying – and it was crazy,"" said witness John Christian. ""It looked like they were coming out of the library, and coming in at the same time as it happened - like right after school.""  Inside the library, 115 S. Pulaski Rd., Chicago Police found a 12-year-old who had been shot. A security guard had carried the boy inside the library and attempted to render aid to him and keep him alive until an ambulance arrived.  ""I heard shots go off, and I knew it was close by – so I came down,"" Christian said.  The 12-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital of Cook County in fair condition.  The 16-year-old boy was shot twice in the leg and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in good condition, police said.  Officers found an adult male suspect, and a female suspect, nearby in the 3900 block of West Madison Street – and arrested both of them. Police radio traffic suggests the female suspect could be as young as 10 years old.  The radio traffic indicated that police believe the girl was with the gunman and handed him the gun before he began shooting.  ""It was traumatizing. Kids - it involved kids,"" Christian said. ""Kids don't deserve that.""  Charges were pending late Tuesday, and a gun was recovered."

RELATED: ‘Pro-mass shooting’ suspect arrested in Savage had machine gun, wanted to ‘fight the police’  Federal authorities also learned Smith had access to an AR-style rifle, handguns, body armor and a Kevlar helmet, and he studied his “enemy” by watching police bodycam videos of shootings.  According to federal prosecutors, Smith asked a different confidential FBI source for auto sears on Nov. 17, hoping to make his AR-15 rifle and handguns into fully automatic weapons. He then bought the auto sears from the informant on Nov. 28 and also asked about grenades, which he then bought from the source in December.  Smith was arrested during a scheduled meeting between him and the confidential source.  His sentencing date hasn’t yet been scheduled."

Credit Yuma Police Department  Garrity said several weapons were recovered from the scene and investigators continue to work to identify those responsible for the deadly gunfire. He asked anyone with information about the episode to contact the police.  ""We want to talk to everyone because we want to make sure that we get the people who are responsible for this and hold them responsible for this heinous event,"" Garrity said.  A $1,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible, police said.  The gunfire erupted about 10:54 p.m. Saturday when an altercation broke out at the party that had grown from just a few people in attendance to more than 100 after word of the party was posted on social media, Garrity said.  ""We can confirm that this was a house party that was going on and that all individuals involved in this are known to each other,"" Garrity said.  He said four off-duty law enforcement officers were in the area at the time of the shooting, heard the gunfire, responded to the scene and began providing first aid to those injured and assisting arriving on-duty officers.

Michael Williams, known as Sheff G, is among 32 purported street gang members charged Tuesday in a series of shootings in Brooklyn that left one person dead and a dozen more injured.  According to the indictment, the defendants are all members of 8 Trey Crips and its affiliate, the 9 Ways gang, and allegedly committed shootings, possessed guns and used stolen cars to eliminate rivals that included members of Folk Nation Gangster Disciples and ICG Babiiez.  The indictment covers 27 alleged acts of violence, including 12 shootings.  ""The senseless gun violence, allegedly committed by these defendants, terrorized our neighbors for years and left more than a dozen people with serious injuries. It is distressing to know that some of the violence was allegedly fueled by a young man who used money he made from a successful music career to allegedly pay for and encourage acts of violence,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said.  Williams offered money and expensive jewelry to those who carried out acts of violence, prosecutors said.  The indictment also outlined one shooting in which Williams allegedly coordinated a group of three shooters, drove those shooters to the crime scene, and then acted as the getaway driver.

It was not immediately clear who his attorney is.  One of the charges stems from a mass shooting on Oct. 21, 2020, where one defendant, Kamondre Dekattu, is allegedly captured on surveillance video emerging from the sunroof of a white Infiniti and opening fire while other individuals fired guns from the driver's side and rear driver's side windows.  An alleged Folk Nation rival, Theodore Senior, 23, was killed and five other alleged Folk Nation members were shot and injured.  Dekattu is charged with the murder and his co-conspirators, including Williams and his sister, Crystal Williams, are charged with being part of the conspiracy to commit murder, for this incident and others.  Two days after the homicide, Michael Williams allegedly hosted a lavish dinner with his fellow 8 Trey Crips and 9 Ways members, including Tegan Chambers, at a Manhattan steakhouse to celebrate the death of Theodore Senior and the injuries of the five other shooting victims.

Police said an armed 17-year-old boy, identified by his family as Mekhi Franklin, was shot near an alleyway on Catherine Street while running from officers in Baltimore's Shipley Hill neighborhood around 1:30 p.m. on May 11.  Det Cedric Elleby is on administrative leave while the shooting remains under investigation. pic.twitter.com/WQ4n5jnUXA — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  Police identified the officer who opened fire as Detective Cedric Elleby, who has been a member of the BPD since 2019.  The video shows Detective Elleby sitting on a stoop next to Franklin but there is no audio until just before the foot pursuit. Family members and neighbors have said officers had been ""harassing"" the teen. The video does not show how the encounter began.  Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the officer was in the Southwest Baltimore neighborhood engaging with residents before a foot pursuit happened.  ""Until the behavior escalated, it caused the officer to heighten his attention, and then you saw the pursuit,"" Harrison said.  Harrison said the officer saw what he believed was a gun and approached the teen before he took off.  ""There are a number of things that are taught in training for officers to observe particularly bulges, the way the person stands or swings their arms or the shift in body stance,"" Harrison said. ""It is the way they adjust their arms to either keep the firearm from falling or to support it and keep it up. And sometimes they are fidgeting with something in their pocket.""  The video appears to show the 17-year-old boy pulling something out of his waistband and dropping it on the sidewalk after he was shot by Elleby during the foot chase after refusing the officer's commands.  Harrison said police recovered a stolen 9mm Smith & Wesson with an extended magazine with four rounds.  He said the weapon the teenager had was stolen from a vehicle in the Western District two years ago.  ""What we know is that this officer believed this person was armed and the subject fled and the officer felt the need to give pursuit,"" Harrison said. ""The officer observed him pull out the gun, just as you did, and the officer discharged his weapon.""  Harrison said the officer fired at least four shots, and Franklin was struck once. His condition has been upgraded from critical to stable.  Weapon was stolen out of automobile in the Western District in 2021. @wjz pic.twitter.com/fJkCBqtF8o — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  ""The decision to use deadly force is always based on the need—reasonable, proportionate and necessary—and the officer has to determine that in a second,"" Harrison said about police use of force.  Franklin's mother told WJZ the officer shot her son twice.  Officer Elleby has not yet been interviewed for the investigation.  Franklin's mother told WJZ he had past interactions with her son and questions remain about what led up to the encounter.  The detective has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.  Harrison said the department does not yet have all the answers it seeks but understands the high level of scrutiny involving the incident.  Police fired 4 times at the 17yo by my count. They say he refused commands to drop weapon pic.twitter.com/EHGXEyLliD — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 16, 2023  Harrison said the Shipley Hill neighborhood is a focal point for police because it is a ""historically violent area.""  ""This area is a focused area to provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime in this historically violent area,"" he said.  Harrison said that just in the past 28 days in the neighborhood, officers have responded to more than 150 calls for service, for assault, armed people, burglaries, disorderly persons and drugs.  Recently, officers walked with community members and discussed concerns about illegal dumping, boarded-up homes, and removing illegal cars from the streets.  Harrison said the police department and the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office are investigating this shooting.  ""We understand the high level of scrutiny that comes with any use of force by our officers or any law enforcement officers. We do not take that scrutiny lightly,"" Harrison said. ""While we do not have all information today, our office is committed to doing a thorough, transparent investigation along with our State's Attorney's Office.""  Elleby is a member of a District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Department's specialized units that focus on proactive patrols, warrant apprehension and other measures in areas of Baltimore where gun violence is most frequent.  The Maryland Attorney General's office told WJZ Friday it will not be investigating the shooting at this time.  One witness who spoke to WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren—and declined to give his name for security reasons—said the officer was harassing the teenager.  Franklin's mother also told WJZ the officer had been harassing her son. Harrison said there is no past record of formal complaints.  WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren asked the commissioner whether it has been determined whether the teen was shot in the back. Harrison responded to him by saying that ""it's unknown or undetermined right now which one of those entries is the entry wound and which one is an exit wound.""

Farmington police said during a Tuesday, May 16 news conference at the Farmington Civic Center that Wilson, who was shot dead by officers during the incident, purchased the rifle in November 2022, shortly after his birthday in October.  Wilson also used two handguns that belonged to relatives in the shooting, but Deputy Chief Kyle Dowdy said police did not know how he had obtained them.  Farmington Municipal School District spokesman Robert Taboada said Wilson was a senior at the school and was enrolled in classes, but he said he could not say if Wilson was due to graduate with his class, which was scheduled to go through commencement exercises on May 16. He said the district would not have any more information to release about Wilson until May 17.  Dowdy said Wilson walked down North Dustin Avenue in Farmington shortly before 11 a.m. Monday firing indiscriminately.  Deputy Chief Baric Crum said investigators had counted approximately 150 rounds that were fired over the quarter-mile crime scene, but he expected that number to go up as the investigation continued.  It took the four responding police officers minutes to locate Wilson after several calls reporting shots fired in the neighborhood.  By then Wilson had already shot and killed three people: Shirley Voita, 79, Melody Ivie, 73, and Gwendolyn Schofield, 98. Two of the women shot were mother and daughter, though law enforcement did not make clear which of the victims were related.  Among those injured were Farmington Police Sgt. Rachel Discenza, a 10-year veteran of the department who was shot in the pelvis during the encounter, and New Mexico State Police Officer Andreas Stamatiadas. Stamatiadas and Dicenza were treated for their injuries and released.  Dowdy said the responding officers fired at least 16 shots at Wilson, killing him in front of a local church.  Dowdy and Crum said numerous other people were treated for injuries at the hospital or at the scene. Crum said not all those people were shot, explaining that some of them were injured when Wilson shot at the vehicle they were riding in and the windshield or windows shattered.  Dowdy said police have been unable to establish any link between the gunman and his victims.  “There’s nothing to suggest he knew any of the people,” he said, describing Wilson’s choice of victims as arbitrary.  Police said Wilson’s family members indicated during interviews with investigators that the student may have been experiencing some mental health issues. Wilson lived in Farmington but had multiple addresses, Dowdy said.  Crum said Wilson had a few minor infractions on his juvenile record, but there was nothing in his history to suggest he was capable of performing such an act or that would have prevented him from legally purchasing an assault rifle.  All the victims who were injured in the shooting were riding in a vehicle at the time of the incident, police said, adding that no pedestrians or people inside a home were shot.  San Juan County Sheriff Shane Ferrari said his agency is handling the officer-involved shooting aspect of the incident, while the Farmington Police Department is handling the criminal investigation.  Crum said one of the officers in the group confronting Wilson was armed with a long rifle and another had a shotgun. The other two officers were armed with handguns, he said.  Farmington police are planning daily afternoon briefings on the investigation into the shooting as they unearth more information. Chief Steve Hebbe was in Pennsylvania for a family wedding at the time of the shooting and was traveling back to the city during Tuesday’s news conference.  Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett said a vigil for the victims would be held at 6 p.m. Wednesday, May 17 at the Farmington Museum at Gateway Park, 3041 E.

RELATED: Teen believes man who followed her home was suspect involved in shooting that injured officer  Denham Springs officer critically injured in shooting; suspect dead  Thursday, May 11th, 2023 at approximately 4:15 p.m.: Officers with the Denham Springs Police Department responded to 2358 South Range Avenue in reference to a 911 call of a male and female arguing in the parking lot of the Petco. The male suspect began shouting at the woman, who later stated she did not know the suspect. The woman reportedly responded to the suspect by threatening to call the police. The woman then got in her vehicle and the male suspect began following her through the parking lot while in his vehicle, a gold Jeep Cherokee.  DSPD Corporal Shawn Kelly and a trainee arrived on scene in reference to the 911 call. At approximately 4:22 p.m. the officers exited their vehicle and the male subject (later identified as Justin Roberts) fired upon them through his driver’s side window while still seated in his vehicle. Cpl. Kelly was struck multiple times. Roberts then drove across the parking lot in the direction of the Raising Canes restaurant. Within seconds, Roberts turned his vehicle around and drove back toward the DSPD Officers, where he fired upon them once again. The DSPD trainee returned fire before Roberts fled the scene. Roberts was not injured, but his vehicle was struck.  At approximately 4:29 p.m., a responding Uniform Patrol Deputy from the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office was traveling northbound in the 400-block of Eugene Street (Denham Springs) when he spotted the suspect vehicle stopped in the roadway. Roberts was outside of the vehicle armed with a rifle which he was pointing at the LPSO deputy. The LPSO Deputy quickly stopped and exited his vehicle and fired several times upon Roberts, striking him and causing him to become incapacitated. Roberts was transported to an area hospital where he later died from his injuries.  Click here to report a typo.  Copyright 2022 WAFB. All rights reserved."

U.S. Marshals arrested Aaron Anderson, 20, on April 26 in Sacramento in the shooting death of 19-year-old Jissel Segura, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Tuesday. Anderson was booked into Marion County Jail on May 13.  Authorities have provided little information about the death of Segura, a Woodburn-area resident.  A Marion County grand jury charged Anderson in a sealed indictment on March 10 with second-degree murder and two counts of unlawful use of a weapon.  The charges allege Anderson fatally shot Segura on March 1. He is also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to use it against another woman in February.  The fatal shooting was reported shortly after midnight on March 2. A 911 caller reported hearing gunshots on Northeast Embassy Way near Northeast Satter Drive in an unincorporated area of east Salem.  Dispatch logs show that Marion County sheriff’s deputies received the call at 12:08 a.m. and arrived six minutes later at the Embassy Court Apartments.  Deputies arrived to find a woman inside a vehicle with gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff’s office said at the time in a news release, which did not identify Segura by name.  Anderson pleaded guilty in 2019 to attempted second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault in Wasco County Circuit Court. The charges stemmed from an incident at a juvenile detention facility in the Dalles, according to court documents.  A circuit judge dismissed the charges in January 2021, granting a joint petition by Anderson and the district attorney to reconsider the conviction under SB 819. The new law allowed prosecutors and people in custody to jointly petition judges to reconsider a conviction or sentence for most offenses “if the original sentence no longer advances the interests of justice.”  Anderson’s next court appearance is scheduled for May 18 in Marion County Circuit Court.

They were Shirley Voita, 79, Melody Ivie, 73, and Gwendolyn Schofield, 98. Two of the women shot were mother and daughter, though law enforcement did not make clear which of the victims were related.  Among those injured were Farmington Police Sgt.

The suspect, whose shooting spree on Monday morning through a residential area of Farmington, New Mexico, ended when police shot him dead, was publicly identified on Tuesday as 18-year-old Beau Wilson, a student at Farmington High School.  Police said Wilson stalked a quarter-mile stretch of roadway on foot firing indiscriminately at cars, with some homes also being hit, before police confronted him outside a church, exchanging gunfire with Wilson to halt his advance.  Video footage showed Wilson, dressed in black, pacing around the church driveway holding what appeared to be a handgun with an extended, high-capacity magazine before he was killed.  The minutes-long burst of violence stirred hours of fear as police searched the area to ensure order was restored in the town, a major retail center and fossil energy hub about 180 miles (290 km) northwest of Albuquerque in an area known as the Four Corners because it is where four southwest states intersect.  The gunman's actions ""appear to be purely random and had no specific targets or motives that we can identify at this time,"" Farmington Deputy Police Chief Kyle Dowdy told a media briefing on Tuesday.  The women slain were identified as Gwendolyn Schofield, 97, and Melody Ivie, 73, a mother and daughter who were struck by gunfire together in their car, and Shirley Voita, 79, who was in a separate car.  Four other people in cars struck by gunfire or shrapnel were wounded, police said, along with two police officers who have since been released from a local hospital.  Wilson was staying at an address in the neighborhood where the shootings took place, but there was no indication he knew any of his victims, Dowdy said. Wilson had a history of ""minor infractions as a juvenile"" and was believed to have suffered from an unspecified mental illness, Dowdy said.  In addition to obtaining the assault-style rifle legally a month after he turned 18 in October 2022, Wilson is believed to have obtained two other firearms used in the shooting from family members, police said.  New Mexico has some of the least restrictive gun ownership laws in the country, with no minimum age to possess rifles and shotguns. The state generally prohibits anyone under age 19 to possess a handgun, according to the Giffords Law Center gun control organization.  Proposed legislation to ban the sale of many semi-automatic firearms, limit the capacity of ammunition magazines and impose a mandatory waiting period on gun purchases all failed to pass New Mexico’s legislature during its 2023 session.

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins cited insufficient evidence when announcing her decision on Monday. She released surveillance video of the incident along with other footage and documents that she said support her decision, asking that the public review all the evidence.  ""There will be a temptation, as human beings, to only view the video footage of this incident and nothing else,"" Jenkins said at a press conference. ""We are accustomed to seeing videos online, and that often is what captures our attention rather than going the extra step to look deeper.""  The incident took place at a Walgreens in downtown San Francisco on April 27 just after 6:30 p.m. PT, according to the police report. The surveillance video, which does not have sound, purportedly shows 24-year-old Banko Brown attempting to leave the store without paying for a bag full of items. An on-duty and lawfully armed security guard, 33-year-old Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, stops Brown then punches him repeatedly. The two struggle for less than a minute until Anthony pins Brown to the ground, as shoppers continue to enter and exit the store.  The video then purportedly shows Anthony letting go of Brown, who picks up the bag and heads for the exit. Brown turns around and walks backward out the door then appears to step toward Anthony. Anthony lifts his gun and fires a single shot, striking Brown in the chest. Brown falls to the ground just outside the store.

In an interview with police, Anthony said he told Brown to ""put the items back"" but that Brown ""refused"" and was ""aggressive."" Anthony said he went to take the items but that Brown fought to keep them and repeatedly threatened to stab him as a struggle ensued. Police said a knife was not found on Brown.  Anthony told police he didn't have any handcuffs and his partner was on break at the time, so he tried to hold Brown's arms back and put him in ""a chokehold-type move."" Anthony said he told Brown he would let him go if he calmed down. Anthony said he released Brown but drew his gun and kept it pointed at the ground in case Brown tried to stab him. Anthony said he fired the gun when Brown turned back around and advanced toward him, not realizing that Brown would just ""try to spit"" at him.  When asked for comment on Tuesday, a Walgreens spokesperson told ABC News: ""We are offering condolences to the victim's family during this difficult time. The safety of our patients, customers and team members is our top priority, and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in our stores.""

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins released the information amid public outcry over the April 27 death of Banko Brown, a 24-year-old who was not armed, outside a downtown Walgreens. Last week, the Board of Supervisors approved a resolution urging her office and the police department to release more evidence. She cited self-defense in her decision not to charge the guard, Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony.  But the release of surveillance video did not appear to quell critics in a city dogged by brazen shoplifting and wide division over the appropriate responses to crime, particularly when the suspect is homeless or impoverished.  The footage, which does not have sound, shows Brown heading for the door with a bag in his hand when he is stopped by Anthony, who then punches him repeatedly. The two struggle until Anthony pins Brown to the ground. Meanwhile, shoppers continued to enter the store during the confrontation.  When Anthony lets Brown go, Brown picks up the bag and moves to exit the store. He turns around and appears to step toward Anthony, at which point Anthony lifts his gun and shoots once, sending Brown falling back onto the ground outside.  In a police interview, Anthony said he told Brown to put the items back, but Brown was aggressive and fought to keep the items. He said he told Brown he would let him go if he calmed down, and that Brown kept saying he was going to stab him. A knife was not found on Brown.

San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton said in a statement that the video does not show justification for the shooting. He plans to join Board President Aaron Peskin in calling on the state attorney general for an independent review of the prosecutor’s decision.  But Jenkins, who initially discharged the case May 1, said that even after seeking more evidence, there was nothing to rebut the guard’s reasonable claim of self-defense. She pleaded with viewers to review all the evidence, including witness and police reports, especially since the video footage lacks sound.  “There will be a temptation, as human beings, to only view the video footage of this incident and nothing else. We are accustomed to seeing videos online, and that often is what captures our attention rather than going the extra step to look deeper,” she said in a news conference.

Supervisor Dean Preston introduced legislation last week so that private security guards could not draw their firearms unless there is an actual and specific threat to a person.  Walgreens did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Walgreens, Target and other merchants downtown have complained about brazen shoplifting. Whole Foods recently announced it would temporarily shutter a downtown location, citing employee safety.  Kingdom Group Protective Services, which provides security for Walgreens, said in a statement that it is cooperating with law enforcement and could not provide further comment.  State records show Anthony has been licensed as a security guard since 2012.  Jenkins became district attorney last year after voters ousted her predecessor, Chesa Boudin, over criticism that he was too soft on crime. She pledged to be a fair but tough prosecutor who would not ignore blatant retail theft and open-air drug dealing.  Associated Press reporter Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed."

Travis McDermott, 40, of Minot, is being held on charges of manslaughter, reckless endangerment, and extreme indifference with a weapon. The victim is 32-year-old Greyson Sletto of Willow City.  Police say the shooting happened around 1:45 a.m. at the Original Bar and Night Club. Court documents say investigators relied on surveillance footage from the nightclub to charge McDermott. The footage showed Sletto approach a table where McDermott and his girlfriend were sitting. The two men exchanged words before McDermott brandished a handgun, at which point Sletto pushed him to the ground. McDermott then fired the handgun at Sletto, hitting him twice in the torso.  Police say bar patrons detained McDermott until officers arrived. Sletto was pronounced dead at 2:12 a.m."

A girl who was gravely wounded in a mass shooting in a school in Belgrade earlier this month has died, bringing the death toll to 10, authorities said on Monday.  The girl died on Monday morning at a children's clinic in Belgrade, Serbia's health ministry said, according to official media. The girl had been in critical condition with head injuries following the May 3 attack, said a statement.  The shooting happened in the Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school in central Belgrade when a 13-year-old boy took his father's gun and opened fire, initially killing eight children and a school guard, and wounding six students and a teacher.  The first ever school shooting in Serbia stunned the Balkan country. A day later a 20-year-old randomly fired from an automatic weapon in two villages south of Belgrade, killing eight people and wounding 14.  The two mass killings in as many days triggered calls for action. Tens of thousands of people have marched in protests in Belgrade and other towns and cities demanding resignations of top officials and a ban on pro-government television stations that air violent content and host war criminals and crime figures.  RUSSIAN WILDFIRES TEAR THROUGH URALS, SIBERIA  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Serbia's populist government has launched a gun crackdown that includes a one-month amnesty for those who voluntarily hand over unregistered weapons, as well as stricter control of gun owners, a moratorium on new licenses and prison sentences for possession of illegal guns.  Police have said that citizens handed over some 13,500 various weapons by Sunday. The amnesty period will last until June 8 but analysts have warned that similar actions in the past have had limited success.  Critics of populist President Aleksandar Vucic say the increasingly authoritarian Serbian leader who is a former pro-Russian ultranationalist, has contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance in society by fostering hate speech against opponents and taking strict control over mainstream media and state institutions.  Vucic has denied this. He has suggested that he might call an early election for September in response to the protests and mounting public pressure over the shootings."

Porfiri directs NYU’s Dynamical Systems Laboratory and the Center for Urban Science and Progress. Succar is a engineering graduate student in Porfiri’s lab focusing on complex systems and network science.  Left photo courtesy of Maurizio Porfiri; right photo courtesy of Rayan Succar  How can we discourage mass shootings?  Maurizio Porfiri: Our work supports a no-notoriety approach, in which we want to dry up the news about mass shootings—limit the number of details—and try to disentangle the presentation of the mass shooting news from the fame it can get.  If we provide too many details, then if I am somebody who is trying to gain fame, I will use these details to plan an attack that you don’t expect, something society is not aware of. We find in our new study that the more mass shootings differ from previous history, the more they capture the attention of the public. It seems that fame-seeking mass shooters don’t aim for a high death count, but try to stand out in other ways.  Rayan Succar: We quantify fame by looking at Wikipedia. So for each shooting, we see how many people visited this Wikipedia page over time. We controlled for the number of victims and casualties, and we did not find any correlation between surprise and lethality for fame-seeking mass shooters. So they see surprise as a path to fame that’s independent of the death count.  We want to dry up the news about mass shootings.  Porfiri: From that point of view, it can help to set good guidelines and practice for the media to talk about mass shootings. On the preventative point of view, it adds some level of alert, which is related to red flag laws. Red flag laws, which can remove firearms from a person who seems to be a danger to themselves or others, have to do with some hint that some event, however unlikely, can happen, and it’s a good idea to follow up on it. When people are thinking about trying to gain fame through mass shooting, they’re looking at the details of past mass shootings and trying to distinguish themselves so as not to be the same.    Say you hear about something that to you is like, “Oh, no, nobody’s ever done it. So maybe it’s not going to happen.” No, pay attention to even these details, report them, and we should act with red flag laws to prevent any possible mass shootings that could occur.

When Feng Feng Lee saw a strange man with closely cropped white hair at her church, she didn’t think much of it.  Hours later, the man opened fire at a luncheon, wounding five parishioners and killing a 52-year-old man who had accompanied his mother to church.  Now, Lee has flashbacks about that day a year ago at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. Her husband, a doctor, checking on the injured as they cried out in pain. The agonized words from the mother of the man who died charging at the gunman — she did not want her son to be a hero but only to be there with her.  Shooting survivor Feng Feng Lee speaks at the one-year anniversary of the attack at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  Advertisement  Lee can’t shake the guilt that she should have done more.  “We didn’t prevent the stranger from coming. … The bad guy pretended to be one of us,” said Lee, 77, who on Sunday attended a gathering at the church to mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting.  Lee and most of the hundreds of others at Sunday’s commemoration spoke in the Taiwanese dialect, as they typically do during church services. One parishioner wore a yellow hat that read “Yes! Taiwan.” The choir sang “Hometown at Dusk,” a Taiwanese song from the 1950s popular with those living overseas and those supporting an open declaration of the island’s independence.  The gunman, according to prosecutors, hated them for that.  On Sunday, some said their belief in God had been shaken, but many said that grappling with the tragedy has renewed their faith.  “I don’t think anyone’s scared,” said Tony Chen, a 76-year-old church elder.  Parishioner Jerry Chen, right, helps visually impaired shooting survivor Li-Yen Hong to the lectern during the one-year commemoration. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  David Wenwei Chou, 69, has been charged in both state and federal court with murder, attempted murder and hate crimes, with prosecutors alleging that he targeted the church because of the congregants’ Taiwanese national origin.  He pleaded not guilty to the state charges and has yet to make a court appearance in the federal case.  Chou was born in Taiwan and was from a family with recent roots in China, which considers the island democracy part of its territory. According to local law enforcement, Chou left notes in his car opposing Taiwanese independence.  Jerry Chen, 73, said he is in touch with the mother of John Cheng, who died in the shooting, which makes it hard for him to forgive Chou.  “She blamed herself and said, ‘How am I going to face my daughter-in-law?’ ” Chen wrote in a commemorative book recently published by the church.  She said she should not have tried to get her son to go to church with her that day, Chen wrote.  Of Chou, Chen wrote: “His hatred for Taiwan and Taiwanese people led him to live in sorrow. God is love, and the Devil is hatred. Because of hatred, the shooter became a disciple of Devil.”  On Sunday, Billy Chang, the church’s former longtime pastor, spoke of the “confusion” of emotions in a recorded video from Taiwan. He was being honored at the luncheon last May when Chou began shooting. After Cheng’s doomed attempt to stop Chou, Chang struck Chou with a chair and hogtied him with the help of others.  “I am very grateful and full of gratitude, but on the other hand, I often cry, feeling sad, heartbroken and regretful,” Chang said.  Parishioners and members of the Taiwanese community attend the one-year anniversary memorial service. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)  Another speaker, Carol Lin, recalled being at a new year’s celebration in Taiwan earlier this year and hearing celebratory firecrackers that reminded her of the shooting.  “Rain and tears were all together,” Lin said.  Peter Chen, a representative from the Formosan Assn. for Public Affairs, which advocates for Taiwanese independence, said Cheng, who was a sports medicine doctor, represented the “true spirit” of the Taiwanese people.  “The heroic action of Dr. Cheng is not only honorable but also holy. His bravery truly represents the Taiwanese value of peace-loving,” Chen said. “Dr. Cheng, not only will you not be forgotten, but you will forever inspire us.”  The church’s full name is Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church, but it rents space from Geneva Presyterian Church in Laguna Woods. A week after the May 15 shooting, parishioners returned to worship and have found solace there ever since.  But only last month did they resume their post-service luncheons in the room where the shooting happened — it had been too difficult to share a meal there.  Over lunch, they once again spoke of their lives and their families. Attendance at the church has been growing and remains “very healthy,” said pastor Albany Lee.  But like many immigrant congregations, the members are aging. Lee wonders how the next generation will reshape the church — perhaps they will speak Mandarin, not Taiwanese.  “I cannot foretell the church’s future,” Lee said. “But I will be here for a while.”  Special correspondent M. Benson Huang contributed to this report."

One day later, emotions have settled down, and community members keep echoing the same message: South Charleston is typically a safe community, and the shooting was anything but normal.  “It’s a pretty unusual thing in South Charleston to have something like that happen. I’m just happy no one else got seriously hurt.

The shooting happened just after 11 a.m., Sunday, May 14, 2023 and the store was closed for several hours afterward.  “I was just thinking this world that we live in is crazy.

The witness said she was inside Kroger at the register when the shooting happened.  “I witnessed people running out of the store. I heard loud voices. I did not hear the shot, but apparently everyone else did,” she said.  The woman said the entire store emptied out immediately.  Close Thanks for signing up!

The woman said she still feels safe shopping at the South Charleston Kroger despite the incident.  According to the criminal complaint, by the time police arrived at the scene, the suspect had already left and was near the Krispy Kreme just a few feet away.  Spencer is currently at the South-Central Regional Jail facing attempted murder and wanton endangerment charges.  “Things like this don’t happen in South Charleston,” said Captain Andrew Gordon, Deputy Chief Bureau Commander of the SCPD. “Without getting overly involved in the investigation, these people that were involved in the incident yesterday had prior knowledge of each other. They knew each other.”  Spencer was convicted in 2015 for drug possession with intent to deliver, meaning that she was not legally allowed to possess a gun, according to court records.  “Part of that is taking into consideration when you have an incident involving a firearm or weapon, if someone is prohibited from having that, that could mean additional charges. There’s other factors and other things that are being investigated that could mean additional charges as well,” Gordon said.  Kroger said they will not be commenting at this time because the investigation is still ongoing."

(WRDW/WAGT/Gray News) - A weekend shooting left two dead and four others injured Saturday evening stemmed from a dispute between two motorcycle clubs, Richmond County Sheriff Richard Roundtree said in a news conference on Monday.  Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen identified those who died as Keith Coates, 30, of Valdosta, and Germayne Farrell, 51, of Daytona Beach, Florida.  Roundtree said this shooting adds Augusta to the list of over 280 mass shootings seen so far in 2023.  “Gun violence has risen nationwide this year, and sadly, Augusta is not exempt,” said Roundtree.  Left to right, top to bottom: 31-year-old James Bryant, 39-year-old Freddie Crosson, 38-year-old Tyson Harper, 26-year-old McKayla Rickett, 44-year-old Larry Ross, 30-year-old Cory Sapp, 30-year-old Jessica Sapp, 42-year-old Larry Sutton, 43-year-old Kenneth Taylor, 28-year-old Matthew Willis are all suspects in a deadly mass shooting that happened in Augusta, Georgia, Saturday night. (Contributed)  The shooting occurred at the clubhouse of the Outcast Motorcycle Club and involved members of that club and the rival Thug Riders.  Roundtree says 10 suspects were arrested and charged with two counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Three are still receiving treatment, including Deja Dotson and Jonathan Keaton, who have arrest warrants issued. Only one suspect has a local address.  Roundtree says the city hosted the Augusta Air Show and Mayfest, and several Thug Rider members attended before traveling to the Outcast clubhouse.  “We didn’t know that trouble was coming to our city. We didn’t know that trouble was already in our city,” he said.  The suspects range in age from 44 to 26, and hailed from Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. Four suspects were a part of the Outcast Motorcycle Club, and eight were Thug Riders.  Roundtree confirmed a fire vehicle ran over a dead body on the scene. He said fire personnel did not see the person, and the agency has a traffic report that is not yet available for release.  “To bring this type of violence to our city, to add us to a national mass shooting list is unconscionable. This is something we will not tolerate here in Richmond County. That is why each individual who is involved or we feel to be involved or has any part in this will face charges,” he said.  He says there was no lack of police presence in the city. Roundtree said they had more deputies on the roads because they were leaving two events.  At least 20 officers were on the scene, and he said you could hear gunfire from a few blocks away.  “While this incident of violence is horrific, and many of the other tragic incidents that have occurred in this country and will still occur ... my light will continue to push forward in the confidence that I have in the men and women of the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office and the citizens of Richmond County,” said Roundtree.  Investigators found more than 150 shell casings on the scene. Roundtree says this was an “extremely large scene,” and kids were playing outside in a neighborhood right down the street.  “With 150 rounds, I’m sure it was more than two individuals,” he said.  Officials said they believe people from Florida traveled three to four hours to engage in the targeted attack. They believe it stemmed from a recent incident that started in Florida, but additional information on that wasn’t released.  In response to the shooting, regional affiliates with the clubs were mobilizing to retaliate again in Augusta, Roundtree said. The sheriff’s office briefed Mayor Garnett Johnson and other city officials about the potential threat of another major shooting. The sheriff says there’s still an ongoing threat, but they’re prepared.  “We continue to monitor this situation in real-time, and we will advise the public of any confirmed threat if they develop,” said Roundtree.  He said 13 motorcycles were taken into evidence, along with one car and 10 firearms. Weapons were found inside the clubhouse, vehicles and nearby businesses from when the suspects fled the scene.  One Richmond County patrol car was also hit in the shooting.  Copyright 2023 WRDW/WAGT via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved."

The boy and a 20-year-old, Angel Gomez, arrived at a Sonic Drive-In in Keene, Texas, on Saturday night, police said. Sonic employee Matthew Davis, 32, confronted Gomez after he allegedly became disorderly in the parking lot. The argument escalated and became physical.  The 12-year-old boy, who was a passenger in Gomez's vehicle, allegedly pulled out a gun and repeatedly fired at Davis, the Keen Police Department wrote on Facebook. The boy used an AR-style weapon and fired at least six rounds at Davis, CBS affiliate KTVT reported.  Gomez and the unnamed juvenile suspect, who are both from Fort Worth, then left the scene.  Davis was lying in the parking lot when officers arrived at around 9:40 p.m. Saturday, police and the Johnson County Sheriff's Office said. He had suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was having a hard time breathing. Davis was flown to a hospital where he was rushed into surgery, but he died from his injuries.  Police said Gomez returned to the Sonic after the deadly shooting and was arrested on murder charges. Officers found the juvenile in Rio Vista, about 15 miles away, and took the 12-year-old boy into custody on murder charges. They also recovered several firearms.  The Sonic remained closed Monday, KTVT reported. A memorial was set up in honor of Davis.  He left behind a 10-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe set up to cover his funeral costs."

Fifteen groups — including the Dallas Asian American Historical Society; Dallas Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation; SAAVETX Education Fund; Asian Texans for Justice; Remembering Black Dallas; Rise AAPI and Somos Tejas — coordinated the vigil in honor of the eight victims who died in the shooting: Cindy, Kyu and James Cho, Daniela and Sofia Mendoza, Aishwarya Thatikonda, Christian LaCour and Elio Cumana-Rivas.  More than a dozen people spoke at the vigil inside the Oak Lawn United Methodist Church in Dallas. A 15-year-old Allen student read a poem in which she begged for “the adults” to “keep me and my friends safe.” Ramiro Luna with Somos Tejas listed off the mass shootings that have involved an AR-15. The Turtle Creek Chorale, a Dallas men’s choir, performed “If I Can Dream” by Elvis Presley.  Erika L. Moritsugu, deputy assistant to the president and Asian American and Pacific Islander senior liaison, spoke on behalf of the White House. She said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris sent their condolences and are dedicated to “end the scourge of gun violence.” Moritsugu read a statement from Harris aloud in which Harris said she will “fight alongside you to protect families” and to “keep dangerous weapons out of dangerous hands.”  Several speakers addressed the shooter’s white supremacist ideals. Earlier Monday, several groups that coordinated the vigil held a press conference and demanded law enforcement thoroughly investigate the shooting as a hate crime.  At the vigil, some speakers demanded that the Texas Legislature take action on gun reform. Mohammed Farshori, vice chair of the Asian Chamber of Texas, said elected officials “are no longer able to serve the public or serve our interests” and called on people to vote in order to make those officials “irrelevant.” Luna with Somos Tejas said legislators have “blood on their hands” if they do not propose gun reform.  Nearly every speaker referenced the fact that they were echoing words that have been said at countless vigils held for countless other shootings across the country. The calls for change, several noted, have been made after nearly every mass shooting, and still the violence continues.  “How did we get to this place?” Beverly Davis, vice president of Remembering Black Dallas, asked the congregation. “Where we call ourselves the greatest democracy that’s ever existed, and yet we cannot protect the most innocent among us?”"

This time, in Yuma where two young men, just 19 and 20, are dead and five other teens were injured late Saturday night.  All of the dead and injured were between 15 and 20 years old, in this, America’s latest mass shooting.  It’s the 33rd mass shooting just this month and at least the 215th nationwide, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are either killed or injured.  Fox News was quick to play up Yuma shooting  No suspects are in custody and there’s not much to know as yet about what happened here, but leave it to Fox News to deliver the story that its audience craves.  “7 people shot in Yuma, Arizona, just 10 miles from the US-Mexico border,” the network screams.  “The shooting unfolded at a time when the border city of just about 97,000 residents is dealing with a large influx of migrants surging across the border,” Fox reported.  In Arizona:Sen. Sinema talks about rollout of gun law  “Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls appeared on Fox News on Friday to sound the alarm that Border Patrol had begun releasing migrants onto the streets a day after Title 42 expired.”  The story — of the shooting — includes a photo of the U.S.-Mexico border and two more photos of migrants who were released by the Border Patrol in Yuma and nearby Somerton and, well, you get the picture.  This is Arizona's 4th mass shooting in 2023  Interestingly, Fox never noted that Saturday’s shooting was Arizona’s fourth mass shooting of the year.  Or that early indications suggest that this was not migrants on the rage but local teens having a party.  A woman told Z93 radio that her 15-year-old son attended a party in the foothills and was shot in the leg after a fight broke out. He was caught in a crossfire.  “My kid attended a party like 15-year-olds do,” she said. “Is this what is happening in Yuma now? I am sickened, saddened and pissed off. We need to do better.”Fox News must be so disappointed.  Reach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com. Follow her on Twitter at @LaurieRoberts.

Police Chief Steve Hebbe said the assailant, who was killed by responding officers, used an AR-15-style rifle and two other guns as he roamed a quarter-mile area through a neighborhood Monday morning.  The gunman killed three people, wounded two law enforcement officers and four civilians. He shot at least six houses and three vehicles before he encountered Farmington Police officers shortly after 11 a.m. MDT.  The rampage seems to be random, the chief said.  “There were no schools, no churches, no individuals targeted,” he said, adding the shooter appeared to fire at what “entered his head.”  San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington received seven patients, spokesperson Laura Werbner told CNN in an email. Werbner said she could not comment on the patients’ conditions.  The chief said a New Mexico State Police officer who was shot drove himself to the medical center and is still hospitalized.  “He’s doing well at this moment,” Stebbe added.  A Farmington Police officer who was also wounded by gunfire has already been released from the hospital, the chief said.  “The event is difficult to understand, how something like this happens,” he said. “But we are doing the best that we can to piece through (evidence), and talk with family members of the suspect to piece through what was going on” and determine a motive, he added.  The crime scene is “wide and complex” and it will take time to figure out what happened, Stebbe said.  Authorities didn’t identify any victims or the shooter. The chief said police expect to hold another news conference Tuesday afternoon.  The Phoenix division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) earlier tweeted that it was “responding to a report of a mass shooting” in Farmington.  New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she is praying for the victims and their families and has directed the state to support the investigative efforts of the city and county.  “Although details continue to emerge about this incident, this serves as yet another reminder of how gun violence destroys lives in our state and our country every single day,” she said in a statement. “This administration will not stop fighting the epidemic of gun violence from every angle possible.”  Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett said he has received calls of support from the White House, lawmakers in Washington, the Navajo Nation and mayors throughout the state.  “We are a resilient community, a community that cares for each other,” Duckett said. “In the face of adversity, we must stand together, comfort one another, and make a determined effort to heal these wounds so we can emerge stronger and not allow this act of violence to define us.”  About 46,400 people live in Farmington, which is in northwestern New Mexico, just south of the Colorado state line. It is about 150 miles northwest of Albuquerque and about 50 miles from the Four Corners area where the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah intersect."

Legislative records show the Republican governor signed the bill Thursday. It takes effect July 1.  Senate Republicans gave final approval to House Bill 1189 on April 18, less than a month after the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville that left three 9-year-old children and three adults dead. The House approved the measure three weeks before the shooting, on March 6.  Lee also plans to call lawmakers back into special session on Aug. 21 to address safety concerns.  ""It gives a mixed message to the general public, and to afford the firearms manufacturers' additional liability protections is really unconscionable,"" Rep. Yusuf Hakeem, D-Chattanooga, said Thursday by phone regarding Lee's signing of the measure into law. ""And it goes against everything else he's trying to do with regard to the special session and public safety and things of that nature.""  The governor is hoping to persuade GOP supermajorities in both chambers to approve a temporary order of protection measure aimed at keeping firearms from people deemed by a judge to be dangerous to others or themselves. Second Amendment advocates charge it's a red flag law, which a number of states have adopted.  But Lee argues his legislation will provide protections to gun owners. He says it allows them to make a case before a judge that their weapons should not be removed. That, Lee said, is a substantive difference from laws in some other states.  House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons of Nashville called Lee's signing of the measure ""disappointing"" in a phone interview. He noted the House Republican supermajority passed the bill prior to the school shooting. But senators approved it weeks afterwards, he added.  ""If you look at the GOP supermajority, I find it very concerning that our legislature found time to pass that kind of legislation but couldn't consider any kind of legislation to better protect our children,"" Clemmons said.  During the Senate debate April 6, bill sponsor Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, defended the bill.  Staff photo by Andy Sher / Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee speaks with reporters on Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at a Metro Nashville Police Precinct Station about his effort to press an order of protection bill following the March 27, 2023, deadly shooting at The Covenant School in which three children and three adults died.    ""This is just to try to help businesses in this state that have chosen to come here, to give them a little civil liability (protection),"" he said.  With its firearms-friendly policies, warm business climate and generous taxpayer-funded economic incentives, Tennessee has become home to an increasing number of firearms and ammunition manufacturers with some moving their home office operations to the state.  Hensley said his bill is intended to keep that going and argued the legislation won't block lawmakers from passing new laws in response to The Covenant School shooting, which Lee hopes will occur.  Hensley's legislation doesn't provide blanket protection against lawsuits. There are six exceptions leaving gun and ammunition dealers, other sellers and manufacturers liable. The list includes a person or company directly involved in the crime giving rise to the action or steps taken against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence.  The state also has no power over existing federal laws dealing with the firearms industry.  Last month, Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, objected to the bill's passage in the upper chamber debate.  ""There are people that we should be going out of our way to protect this week,"" Yarbro said, alluding to protests that erupted at the Capitol in the wake of the shooting. ""And we've been receiving emails and calls. People are holding up signs, telling us to go out of our way to help those people. Not one of those signs says to protect the gun manufacturers.""  Last week, the governor signed into law his $230 million measure, approved by lawmakers, that he brought to boost public and private security in the wake of the shooting.

No arrests have been made, he said, and the shootings remain under investigation.  2 men suspected in beauty store heist in Simi Valley caught  Two men were caught and arrested Saturday after allegedly stealing $2,000 worth of fragrances from a beauty supply store in Simi Valley.  The suspects fled in a sedan with covered license plates after the theft reported around 9 p.m. from the Ulta store at 1555 Simi Valley Town Center Way, according to the Simi Valley Police Department.  The agency said an officer spotted the suspects' vehicle traveling east on Highway 118 and followed it to North Hollywood, where the men were taken into custody and booked into the main jail in Ventura.  Police said the stolen property was recovered.  The suspects both live outside the county — one was identified as a 23-year-old from Upland and the other a 26-year-old from Los Angeles. By Sunday evening, the Los Angeles man had been released from jail, but the Upland man remained in custody in lieu of $40,000 bail.  These items may be updated."

Manchester Police Lt. Matthew Barter said Saturday the investigation is ongoing.  “Our detectives are out there working, they’ll be working into the night,” he said.

Police said a large brindle mastiff was found by a borough resident shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday near 23rd Street and Lenz Avenue. Officers could not locate a tag, and transported the dog back to the station to try to locate a chip. In a now-deleted post from the Ambridge Borough Police Department Facebook page, officers showed the dog poking her head out the back window of a police cruiser.  ""She decided to do a ride-along with Officer Turner today,"" the post read. ""She will be hanging out with him for the next hour.""  Police initially said if the dog was not claimed within an hour, it would be taken to the Beaver County Humane Society for care.  Shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday, an officer went to the department's outdoor kennel to retrieve the dog and take her to the humane society. An Ambridge police Facebook post then says the dog ""immediately became aggressive and attempted to bite the officer in the hand. As the officer turned and began to run away, the dog bit him on his left knee.""  A second officer tried to help corral the mastiff using a dog pole, but ended up closing it back in the kennel and going inside the station, according to the post. When they came back outside, the dog had escaped the kennel and was running loose around the station parking lot.  ""As officers attempted to catch the dog, she then charged at one of the officers,"" the post reads. ""The dog got within arm's reach of the officer and lunged to attack him. The officer had no choice at the time but to dispatch the dog with his service pistol.""  After covering the dog's body with cardboard in the parking lot, officers discovered a short time later that she was still breathing and alive.  Story continues  After contacting the county humane society, ""it was determined that it was best to put the dog down on scene,"" police wrote.  The department has come under heavy criticism from social media for its handling of the situation.  Tribune-Review news partner WPXI reported that a computer specialist will be going through the department's video surveillance footage on Monday to determine if the incident was caught on camera. The building containing the police department, borough administration and fire department is covered by cameras on multiple sides, including one directly above the kennel on the side of the police station.  Police said they were contacted by a man who claimed to be the dog's owner, but he never showed up at the station. Police said they've received additional, noncredible calls from people claiming to also be the owner.  ""If you are the owner of this dog, please contact the Ambridge Police Department,"" the post reads. Ambridge police can be reached at 724-266-5977.  Patrick Varine is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

While the officers were on the scene, more gunshots were heard a few blocks north.  Body camera footage shows officers firing as they moved toward a gunman who was down in front of Roaming Goat Coffee at 849 N.

The 20-year-old man was handcuffed and transported to Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in critical condition.  In all, 11 firearms were recovered from the scene.  Police have not said whether any of those injured were struck by police gunfire.
