But saying which disease or condition causes the most pain is subjective because people experience pain differently.  According to U.S. News & World Report, passing a kidney stone is one of the most painful medical conditions you can have.  News Medical Life Sciences lists sickle cell disease as one of the 20 most painful chronic conditions, with episodes of pain occurring when sickle-shaped red blood cells block small blood vessels.  McGill University in Canada has a “pain index” based on a questionnaire that asks people to describe what kind of pain they experience. The index consistently lists CRPS as the worst known pain to humans.  Verywell Health reports that fibromyalgia is one of the most common pain conditions, affecting 10 million people in the U.S. and causing widespread body pain, sleep problems, fatigue and distress.  After living with multiple pain conditions for over 20 years and speaking with tens of thousands of other patients, I no longer believe it matters which type of pain a person has or who has the most pain. We all experience pain. How much pain we feel depends on the individual and a host of other factors, such as genetics, life experiences, and whether effective treatment is available and affordable. That is what matters.  When we do not manage pain effectively, suicides go up. We also see drug abuse and misuse rise. According to a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 5% to 7% of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are intentional suicides. Many of those deaths are pain patients.  Since 2011, we have seen a steady decrease in opioid prescribing. Be it acute or chronic, providers are weary of prescribing opioids for pain. It’s not because opioids don’t work. More often than not, the reason they stop prescribing is because they have invested so much into becoming a provider (education, cost, time, family and social connections) that they are now at risk of losing due to laws and medical guidelines based on misleading information about opioids.  We need to get away from the generalities of treating pain and into individualized patient care. It may or may not involve pain medication, surgery, implants, cognitive therapy and other treatments. For those who have the audacity to say that anyone else should remain in pain because you are not comfortable with their form of treatment -- shame on you.  I have chosen not to use opioids for over 10 years because I have other options that work for me. I want all people to get whatever treatment they need to control their pain. It will be different for each of us and whatever condition or comorbidities we live with. We all need and deserve to get the care we choose after careful consideration, research and discussions with our providers. Laws and guidelines should not be used to take away medications that have been available since the beginning of time.  At a recent pain education event I attended, I heard the argument that there were no long-term studies on the use of opioids for pain. But there are millions of patients who have taken opioids safely for years who will tell you otherwise. Opioids actually gave them more life, because they were able to work, exercise and function when their pain was properly managed.  As a pain patient myself, I want the freedom to do what is best for me. I am currently working on getting access to ketamine infusions again after my ketamine clinic closed down. I want that same right in selecting treatment to be available to others. It should be left to patients and their providers to decide on treatment, without interference from others.

She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), cordial partner of The Sting. The opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writers and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.  The COVID-19 pandemic has put significant pressure on healthcare systems and healthcare providers, leading to high levels of stress and burnout among healthcare staff, and has raised concerns about the increased risk of suicide among this group. Burnout can have a significant impact on the well-being of healthcare providers, as well as the quality of care they are able to provide to patients.  The exact number of healthcare staff who have been lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to determine as it varies by country and region. While it is difficult to determine exact numbers, some reports have indicated increased suicide rates among physicians during the pandemic.  A study published in JAMA Network Open in 2021 analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and found that between January and December 2020, 239 physicians died by suicide in the United States. This represents an increase from previous years, although it is important to note that suicide is a complex issue and cannot be attributed solely to the pandemic.  In response to concerns about physician suicide, organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have called for increased resources and support for healthcare providers. This includes initiatives such as providing access to mental health resources and promoting the destigmatization of seeking help for mental health concerns.  To address healthcare mental health and burnout, there are several steps that can be taken.    1: Healthcare organizations should prioritize the well-being of their staff by providing access to mental health resources, promoting self-care, and addressing workload issues. This can include providing time off, implementing workload management strategies, and adjusting staffing levels to reduce stress and burnout.  2: Healthcare organizations should promote a culture of teamwork and collaboration, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and overwhelm among healthcare providers. This can be achieved by creating opportunities for staff to connect with one another, work together on projects, and share ideas and experiences. Encouraging teamwork and collaboration can help healthcare staff feel supported and engaged in their work, reducing the risk of burnout.    3: Develop Support Networks: Healthcare providers benefit from a strong support network, including colleagues, mentors, and peer groups. Developing support networks within healthcare organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare providers. Let’s also raise awareness in public about how important mental health is to the healthcare staff in their community. Compassion for All.    4: Promote a Culture of Self-Care: Healthcare organizations can promote a culture of self-care by providing access to wellness programs, stress-management techniques, and mental health resources. Encouraging healthcare staff to take care of themselves can help prevent burnout and improve the overall well-being of healthcare providers.    5. Implement Work-Life Balance Policies: Healthcare providers often have demanding schedules and work long hours. Policies supporting work-life balance, such as flexible schedules, remote work options, and time off, can help prevent burnout.    6: Address Workload Issues: High workloads and long hours are major contributors to burnout in healthcare providers. Healthcare organizations can address workload issues by adjusting staffing levels, providing time off, and implementing workload management strategies that allow healthcare providers to focus on high-priority tasks.    7: Increase Staffing: One of the most important factors contributing to burnout is understaffing. To prevent burnout, healthcare organizations need to ensure that they have adequate staffing levels to meet patient needs. This can be achieved through a combination of recruitment, retention, and training programs.    8: Provide Mental Health Support: Healthcare providers may experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues because of their work. Providing access to mental health support, such as counseling and therapy services, can help prevent burnout and support the well-being of healthcare providers.    9: Ensure Adequate Resources: Providing healthcare staff with the resources they need to do their jobs effectively can help prevent burnout. This can include access to up-to-date technology and medical equipment, as well as adequate funding and support for research and development.    10: Increase Compensation and Benefits: Healthcare providers are often underpaid for their work. Increasing compensation and benefits can help reduce financial stress and prevent burnout.  11: Provide Professional Development Opportunities: Healthcare organizations should invest in professional development opportunities for their staff. This can help keep healthcare providers engaged and motivated in their work and prevent burnout by providing opportunities for growth and career advancement. This improves the overall quality of care provided to patients.  12: Policymakers should address systemic issues within healthcare systems that contribute to burnout, such as inadequate resources and administrative burdens. This can include implementing policies that provide funding and support for research and development and addressing issues related to healthcare access and affordability. Addressing these issues through policy changes can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare staff.    Implementing these strategies can help prevent burnout and improve the well-being of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a stronger healthcare system. It is important to recognize the impact of burnout on healthcare staff and advocate for policies that promote staff well-being and resilience.Overall, addressing healthcare burnout requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes the well-being of healthcare providers, promotes collaboration and teamwork, invests in professional development, and addresses systemic issues within healthcare systems.  It is important to prioritize the mental health and well-being of healthcare providers and to continue to raise awareness about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This can help reduce stigma and promote access to resources and support for those who may be struggling.

Ron DeSantis of Florida passed the “Paternal Rights in Education” bill also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill (HB 1557). The bill restricts “teachers and school districts from discussing gender identity and topics surrounding sexuality in the classroom.” The law has been in effect for the 2022-23 school year. Although this measure primarily affects Florida’s LGBTQ community and their freedom of speech, many anti-transgender bills similar to this one are being considered across all states.  Even here in the state of Connecticut, there is a bill proposed regarding a student’s “biological gender.”  Connecticut House Bill 6331 proposes that “public school educators are required to recognize each student by the biological gender of the student.” Even though the bill is unlikely to pass, I believe even the proposal of this bill can lead to an unsafe environment and disparities in health, particularly mental health, and it should be called out.  The author of HB 6331, State Rep. Joe Hoxha, (R-Bristol) does not seem to notice the difference between biological (assigned) sex and gender identity. Biological sex is the sex assigned at birth based on the infant’s anatomical and biological characteristics. Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of being; whether that is male, female, or something else.  There is no such terminology as “biological gender.”  Megan Gaffney  Why would Rep. Hoxha use that term rather than the proper term, biological sex? The wording shows that Rep. Hoxha does not understand the issue, nor has he done enough research to know what term to use when drafting the bill. Was Rep. Hoxha aware that biological gender is not the proper term? Why is he drafting legislation on a subject he hasn’t researched?  Schools need to provide a safe and accepting environment for all students, yet many LGBTQ young people experience bullying, harassment, and other discrimination because of their gender identity. A national survey by GLSEN has found that “75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who can persevere had significantly lower GPAs, were more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and were less likely to plan on continuing their education.”  If school administrators ignore these students by refusing to acknowledge their gender identity and even penalize them for expressing it, they can put kids at risk.  A survey by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community, provided some key findings, showing that approximately 45% of LGBTQ youth have had suicidal ideation within the past year, 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide within the past year, and 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted to receive mental health treatment were not able to receive it in the past year.  Federal and state laws and “the U.S. Constitution prohibits discrimination, bullying, and harassment against students because they’re transgender. This includes Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools.”  There are 16 states, including Connecticut, that have laws that prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals. In New Haven Public Schools “a student has the right to be addressed by a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required, and the student need not change his or her official records.”  But even though here in Connecticut transgender individuals have protection, there have still been debates about transgenders athletes in the news. Four cisgender women, formerly high school athletes in Connecticut, sued the state for its trans-inclusive policies, saying that, “allowing transgender women to compete in high school girls’ sports put them at an athletic disadvantage.” While they lost their case last year, they have sought to revive it.  We should recognize that we are lucky that Connecticut has strong protections for transgender individuals. While this bill is unlikely to pass, Connecticut residents should greet Rep. Hoxha’s proposal of the bill with a resounding “no.”  To repurpose a phrase from our Southern neighbors, “Don’t Florida my Connecticut!” The anti-LGBTQ policies of Florida do not have a place here in Connecticut.

A new retrospective study with up to 40 years of follow-up shows significant reductions in death rates from all causes and cause-specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants with severe obesity, according to a new study published in Obesity, The Obesity Society’s (TOS) flagship journal.  The study also found evidence suggesting increased risk of death from chronic liver disease, in addition to higher death rates from suicide in younger patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The study’s authors observe that the findings of increased suicide rates among younger patients who have had bariatric surgery may promote more aggressive, pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up.  As a result of the decades-long durability of bariatric surgery in reducing death from all causes and decreasing deaths related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer compared to matched participants, researchers note the findings may not only increase interest in bariatric surgery treatment for patients with severe obesity but, in addition, further stimulate important research related to the discovery of physiologic and biomolecular mechanisms leading to non-surgical treatment that results in weight loss and improved mortality similar to that achieved by bariatric surgery, said Ted D. Adams, Intermountain Surgical Specialties/Digestive Health Clinical Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine and Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Adams is the corresponding author of the study.  Experts explain that multiple association studies connecting bariatric surgery and mortality outcomes have been reported, predominantly retrospective, with wide variation in study design pertaining to participant number, control cohorts, mean follow-up, procedure type, age at surgery, clinical end points such as life expectancy and death rates for all causes and specific causes, and presence or absence of prevalent diabetes. The new study builds upon the groups’ reported mortality outcomes following gastric bypass surgery by extending follow-up to 40 years, tripling the number of surgical patients, and using four, instead of one, bariatric surgery procedures.  Researchers used data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) for the current study. The UPDB includes linked, population-based information from Utah with statewide birth and death certificates, driver licenses and ID cards, and voter registration cards. The UPDB creates and maintains links between the database and the medical records held by the two, largest healthcare providers in Utah.  Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in Utah between 1982 and 2018 were identified from three, large bariatric surgical practices in Salt Lake City, Utah, and from medical records from the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouses in Salt Lake City. Non-surgical participants were selected from Utah driver license records or ID cards. Because driver licenses are generally renewed every five years, multiple records were available for selection for matching to the bariatric surgeries.  Nearly 22,000 participants with bariatric surgery and without were matched (1:1) for age, sex, body mass index and surgery date with a driver license/renewal date. Mortality rates were compared by Cox regression and stratified by sex, surgery type, and age at surgery. Whereas mortality after gastric bypass surgery was previously reported from 1984 to 2002, this study extends mortality follow-up through 2021. The four bariatric surgery procedures included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and bilio-pancreatic diversion with duo-denal switch.  Results revealed that all-cause mortality was 16% lower in patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. Lower mortality was observed for both males and females. Mortality after surgery versus non-surgery decreased by 29%, 43%, and 72% for cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, respectively. Death rates for males and females from chronic liver disease were 83% higher in patients who had surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The hazard ratio for suicide was 2.4 times higher in surgery compared with non-surgery participants, primarily in individuals with ages at surgery between 18 and 34 years.  “This important study adds to the mounting evidence that bariatric surgery, not only improves quality of life for patients, but will also increase their life expectancy. This work will hopefully improve patients’ access to this effective treatment for obesity, which is still limited to only one percent of qualified patients. Also, the study highlights the importance of providing more resources for pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up, especially for younger patients,” said Jihad Kudsi, MD, MBA, MSF, DABOM, FASMBS, FACS, Bariatric Surgery Division, Duly Health and Care, Downers Grove, Ill.

During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative / A bronze relief of Mona Lee Brock.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize the need for greater connection to military members and veterans by designating Nov. 12, 2023, as ""National Warrior Call Day."" The duo led a similar resolution in 2022 that passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent. The resolution this year is initially supported by 20 senators.  Led by the Troops First Foundation, Warrior Call is a coast-to-coast push that engages all Americans to build and maintain meaningful relationships with servicemembers and veterans in order to help curtail suicide deaths.  Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it. Tweet this  Simple by design, Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it, because isolation often is a precursor to suicidal ideation. In addition, many veterans may be suffering from undiagnosed brain injuries that can mimic mental illness and other ailments that spur isolation.  ""We thank Sens. Shaheen, Cotton and all cosponsors for their help in elevating this initiative and helping push the message to the grassroots level,"" said Frank Larkin, COO of Troops First and Chair of Warrior Call. ""We are hopeful the resolution will again move through the Senate, that leaders in the U.S. House will join in too, and that ultimately as many people as possible will work this year to help troops and vets through simple yet critical connection. It is not hyperbole to say a single call can turn a life around.""  Sitting on key committees in the Senate, the senators are strong advocates for the troops and veterans.  According to the most recent data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 6,146 veterans died by suicide in 2020. The unadjusted rate of suicide among U.S. veterans was 31.7 suicide deaths per 100,000, compared to 16.1 per 100,000 for civilians. After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide was 57% higher for veterans than for non-veteran adults.  The government, however, may still be drastically underestimating suicide deaths. Many other deaths may not be reported or classified as suicide because the evidence doesn't support a death determination. This is a statistical ""gray zone,"" especially as society wrestles with alcohol and opioid addiction.  ""Warrior Call and other efforts to connect with these brave men and women have never been more important,"" added Larkin. ""Working together, we can save lives.""  SOURCE Warrior Call"

The two largest events, consisted of cycle rides from John O’Groats to Lands’ End in 2020, and again The Loneliest Road Cycle Tour across Europe, and New York to San Francisco in 2022. Teams of cyclists rode as Kelly’s Heroes, who not only raised in excess of £300k, created enormous awareness for mental health whilst breaking down stigma around suicide.

Having organised the Kelly’s Heroes cycle rides, I’ve trained and ridden with those heroes and the charity evolved, developing expertise and forming its own identity, growing from a foundation of pure grief to a place of hope. The family and also the cyclists have met with some of the recipients of where the funding goes, people who have used the support, accessed bereavement workshops and more, and it quickly became clear to us, that they are all heroes, each and every one of them. We will always want Kelly’s name to be remembered and we think the new name is a fitting tribute to her memory and the tireless work put in by our staff and supporters over the last 4 years’.  Kelly’s Heroes hopes to continue breaking down barriers and open up more conversations around the importance of not only managing your mental health but maintaining and promoting good positive wellbeing. Recognising the importance of early interventions, providing accessible mental health support, as well as offering bespoke training to local schools, businesses, and communities around mental health and suicide prevention. Mental health deserving a space for conversation.  CEO, Sherry Adams added:  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ‘The charity was founded around two purposes, to raise much needed funding, and to enable people in need to get support when they need it. The two are coming together under one name, one identity, all the events and work every fundraiser undertakes, all the donations they all underpin our support services, it became clear we needed just one name. Through changing to solely “Kelly’s Heroes”, it better reflects the ethos of all that we do, and that everyone who either works for the charity, fundraises for the charity, or bravely reaches out for support, they are all Kelly’s Heroes. If you cycle thousands of miles, run a marathon with tired limbs, have a cake sale, or be the one that reaches out and asks for help when you are feeling low, each and every person has mental health, and all of those actions are admirable, brave and determined, defining heroic’.  Rachael Hewitt, Kelly’s mum, and co-founder of the charity said:  ‘We are incredibly proud of what we have been able to achieve in the first four years, and in awe of all those who have reached out and recognised they needed support with their mental health. We are now looking forward to building on our identity as Kelly’s Heroes and aim to support more people and earlier, ideally before any crisis. We want to offer new services, support and activities that help promote and maintain good positive well-being, for adults and young people. Including all those who have found support and are in recovery, the earlier people get support the better for everyone, and our community. It’s our ambition and aspiration to help people live well and stay well, that will be fitting for Kelly’s legacy.’  Kelly’s Heroes will continue to support with free services, including 365 days of online support, every evening from 6-9pm, their ‘Listening Ear’ service offers emotional support to everyone, for anyone struggling to manage good positive wellbeing, to dealing with poor mental health, suicide ideation, and bereavements by suicide.

Services are on offer for everyone, whether it be someone who wants advice on staying well or wanting to make lifestyle changes, through to those looking for structured counselling and one to one support.  The training courses available range from Mental Health First Aid through to Safeguarding from Suicide, and are available to schools, colleges, universities, businesses, charities, and everyone in the community. All funds raised by delivering training go directly back to supporting people in need.  Amy Hewitt, Kelly’s sister, and co-founder of the charity added:  ‘Millions of people of all ages from all walks of life are experiencing issues with their mental health and so many struggle to find help, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to take the first step in getting support. With the charity and now the support services being known as Kelly’s Heroes it will broaden the awareness of the charity. It starts with where funds are being raised, through to accessing support services, and booking a training course and coming along to an awareness event. You can be one of Kelly’s Heroes, no matter how you are involved, in whatever capacity, whatever you do, or wherever you are.’  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad"

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Today marks the anniversary of the end of the Azovstal siege, sometimes described as “Ukraine’s Dunkirk”.  The three-month battle for Mariupol ended with a last-ditch defence of the city’s steelworks that inspired a wave of international sympathy.  Russia almost completely flattened Mariupol with endless airstrikes and artillery barrages. The destruction of the one of the city's maternity units and Mariupol's theatre, where hundreds of people were taking shelter, shocked the world.  READ MORE: Bombing hospitals, gassing children - the bloody atrocities of ‘Butcher of Mariupol’  But the massive Azovstal iron and steel works remained, described by witnesses as a “fortress within the city”.  Putin ordered his troops to blockade the plant, “so not even a fly can escape”.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  The main Ukrainian unit sealed inside the sprawling steelworks was The Azov Regiment, a force developed from a far-right all-volunteer militia that was often used in Russian propaganda broadcasts as evidence that Ukraine was run by “Nazis”.  They were reinforced by regular Ukrainian marines and foreign volunteers.  Hundreds of civilians had also taken refuge in the factory's miles of tunnels.  (Image: Interior Ministry of the Donetsk)  Conditions inside the dark, freezing and badly-ventilated underground base started as bad, and became truly horrific as stocks of food, water and vital medicines dwindled.  Amputations were carried out with little or no anaesthetic and the defenders ran dangerously low on ammunition.  One defender said: “It feels like I’ve landed in a hellish reality show in which us soldiers fight for our lives and the whole world watches this interesting episode. Pain, suffering, hunger, misery, tears, fears, death. It’s all real.”  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  A desperate helicopter airlift was put in place to resupply the defenders.  Between March 21 and May 11 last year, a total of 15 helicopters and 45 aircrew made nearly 30 rescue missions to Azovstal.  They delivered communications gear from Elon Musk’s Starlink company as well as ammunition and medicine. On the return flights the helicopters were loaded with wounded Ukrainian fighters.  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  Six flights successfully completed the mission and returned. More than 20 did not.  The helicopters were stripped of any non-essential gear to make the deadly journey through a ring of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.  Colonel Hryhorii, a squadron leader in the 12th Brigade of Army Aviation, told The Times: “Everything that was unnecessary was unloaded from the aircraft to make way for the cargo, even the machineguns.  “The pilots saw their task and understood it was dangerous to the point of impossible. But no one refused.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  One of the pilots, who gave his names “Ginger” explained that while the first resupply missions caught the Russians by surprise, subsequent mission were more dangerous: “The next flights looked like impudence on our part,” Ginger said.  “They were waiting for us. Every helicopter was fired upon, many of them taking damage.”On March 31, four Mi-8 helicopters made the trip, escorted by a Hind Mi-24 attack helicopter for cover.  As the Hind took on Russian anti-aircraft emplacements two of the transports here hit with shoulder-mounted ground-to-air missiles: “One was shot down and the other returned with only one engine,” Ginger said. “But he brought 22 wounded back.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  As the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest reached its climax, the frontman for the winning basin – Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra, begged the massive TV audience: “I ask all of you, please help Azovstal, right now!”  Finally, on May 16, President Zelenskyy told the defenders it was time to surrender. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” he said.  Even then, the fighters’ torment was not over.  Oksana, an Azovstal employee, told The Guardian: “No one came out of there unchanged. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.”  (Image: ALESSANDRO GUERRA/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  One of the fighters, Mykhailo Dianov, told Sky News after his release from a Russian POW camp he thought he would never survive: “We thought this every day. At Azovstal we thought it was the end.  “After a month of starvation, when you close your eyes, you forget about your family, everything. The only thing you think about is food.” He lost over six stone during the siege.  In the Russian prisoner-of-war camp, he said, the guards “treated us like animals. It was impossible to eat.”  (Image: President.gov.ua)  As the 2,500 Ukrainian fighters emerged from the ruined steel plant, they were loaded onto buses and shipped off to destinations in Russian -occupied territory. For months their fate remained a mystery.  The Kremlin hinted at trials, and possible death sentences.  But then, in September, Kyiv announced that over 200 POWs had been returned as part of a prisoner swap deal, including Lt Colonel Denys Prokopenko, the Azov Battalion’s commander.  But by the end of the year, some 1,000 Azov soldiers remained prisoners of war. And Ukrainian officials say that the bodies of an unknown number of soldiers still lie buried under the rubble of Azovstal.

A notable exception is the suicide rate among children and adolescents.  According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate among people aged 17 and under was 1.2 per 100,000 in 2000. However, the figure more than doubled to 2.7 in 2021. The comparable rate primarily for middle school students aged 12-14 jumped nearly fivefold, from 1.1 to 5.0 persons.  That, along with Korea's lowest birthrate worldwide, casts doubt on this society's health and sustainability. So many buds wither or are trampled long before they blossom. What has gone wrong?  Suicide by teenagers, and its weaker or preceding stage of reclusion, are due to the avoidance of social activities such as study and play. Another possible cause is society itself teeming with limitless greed and competition. All parents here wish the worldly successes of money and reputation for their children ― and only that. Kids unable or unwilling to go all the way drop out of the rat race.  Korea may not be alone. But nowhere else are these phenomena more severe than here. This country industrialized and democratized itself over the span of just two generations and is the only one among 140 nations that became independent after World War II. It is the fifth hardest-working country in the OECD and perhaps the only one that can make Japan appear lazy. Korea and its establishment deserve praise for that and may as well have pride.  However, according to a survey conducted by the vernacular daily Dong-A Ilbo, 29.4 percent of people in their 20s said they ""don't like being Korean."" As reasons, they pointed to their country being ""too competitive,"" ""complicated,"" and ""exhausting."" Young Koreans think they have nothing to do with their country's or parents' accomplishments. These only pressure and discourage youngsters who will not and cannot repeat what their seniors did. For the poor, the increasingly hierarchical society also appears hopeless.  In this gloomy social atmosphere, various websites and online communities are mushrooming into the dark side of this IT-savvy country.  About a month ago, a girl in middle school jumped to her death from a 19-story building in Seoul's Gangnam District. The suicide was streamed live on Instagram and viewed by dozens of people. The operator of the website believed to be responsible for abetting the suicide has rejected a police request for a voluntary and temporary shutdown, maintaining that other online sites will continue to remain open. The Korea Communications Standards Commission does not enforce its closure, citing ""freedom of expression."" Meanwhile, two more teenagers attempted copycat suicides but failed.  The incident reveals two problems.  First, numerous ugly and wicked adults are bent on abusing and exploiting disoriented teenagers. They approach young victims online disguised as helpers, but abuse them sexually and financially offline, encouraging self-harm and suicide and extorting money. More and more teens fall prey to them amid social ignorance and legal leniency. Second, as one former victim said, there is the problem of having ""no other adults to talk to,"" forcing teenagers to visit these websites and risk danger. Parents and teachers are of no help to these desperate kids, some of whom are already injured, mentally if not physically.  What society should do is clear enough.  In the short term, the government must punish individuals and organizations that abuse children and adolescents. It should force relevant online communities to shut down voluntarily by enacting laws if necessary and prosecuting those responsible. Protecting young lives is far more important than freedom of expression. It should also open many ""anonymous"" ― instead of open and public ― websites through which these youth can communicate freely and frankly.  In the long term, this society and the country should rethink its direction. Korea, where its people, especially younger ones, are almost the unhappiest worldwide, should be where most can live while doing what they want to do without social alienation or economic want.  Aiming to be a wealthier and stronger country is okay. However, what good is this if people are unhappy?    (END)"

Suicide prevention services can also be reached at 888-568-1112 or 800-273-TALK (8255).First responders' jobs are traumatic almost by definition. They run toward the danger. They go into the burning building. They put themselves on the line to help the rest of us. How could that not take an emotional toll on them?Tragically, Bangor experienced a gutting recent reminder of that toll. A young firefighter, Jacob Madden , died by suicide in late April.""Jake was a loving and caring man, who always kept humor at the center of his life. His bright smile and consistent banter brought joy to everyone that he interacted with,"" his obituary reads. ""Jake had an eccentric and quirky personality that was irreplaceable. Those closest to him knew him as nostalgic, sentimental, and a true romantic. Above all, Jake was an extremely proud father and family man.""Bangor firefighter Jared Willey , president of Local 772 of the International Association of Firefighters , spoke with Bangor Daily News reporter Kathleen O'Brien about first responders struggling with mental health and the high risk of dying by suicide. Firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, according to the U. S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .Willey said that mental health support is available, but stigma and a ""suck it up and be a man mentality"" can be barriers to getting help.""We have to talk about mental health and suicide because, if we don't, we're not going to see change,"" Willey said. ""We don't want to lose another firefighter, so we have to make sure everyone feels comfortable enough to sit down and talk about it. If my back hurts because of a fire last week, I'm going to sit with others and complain about it and get it fixed. The same needs to go for mental health.""We could not agree more. That is true this month, with May being Mental Health Awareness Month, and it is true all year long. And this is an instance where everyone can help to be part of the solution. Across society, we need to normalize talking about and addressing mental health challenges. We owe it to the first responders who put their physical and emotional well-being on the line, just as we owe it to our neighbors, friends and family. There is nothing wrong with needing help.Aside from this universal, interpersonal step to help support firefighters and other first responders, there is also a much more bureaucratic step to take. O'Brien explained how the U.S. Fire Administration has only recorded six firefighter suicides since its On-Duty Firefighter Fatality Program's started in the 1970s. Other firefighter groups estimate that there are roughly 100 firefighter suicides each year in the U.S.Clearly, the Fire Administration's reporting system isn't fully tracking this issue, and that is a problem. To better address an issue like this, policymakers and the public need to be fully aware of its scope. That requires having accurate and comprehensive data.As O'Brien reported, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has said the Fire Administrator's system only counts on-duty deaths and relies on voluntary reporting, so the seemingly obvious steps would be to update those elements of the system. The federal government should find a more proactive way of collecting this information from departments across the country, and make sure to include off-duty deaths by suicide — because the trauma doesn't just shut off when a first responder is off the clock.""After that call and when you're left with your own thoughts is when it haunts you,"" Willey told O'Brien about witnessing tragedies on the job. ""Many people have night terrors because when you don't process those traumatic events, your brain re-lives it when you sleep.""First responders need to know that resources exist to help them process that trauma and that there is nothing wrong about needing that help.___"

That’s why one set of parents is bringing it to the forefront after losing their son to suicide.  Anthony Salas said his son, Ben was happy and cheerful. In a home video of a younger Ben, he can be seen sledding down a winter slope of snow and laughing the whole ride down. That laughter continued in another video of an older Ben, but the smile is just the same.  The videos showed snippets of what Ben revealed to the world, but it faded behind closed doors.  “Ben hid it so well, so to speak, and he covered it with mounds of normalcy,” Salas said.  In late April, Salas and his wife received a text message from the 21-year-old college student they would have never expected.  “He said that he made the tough decision to take his life,” Salas said.  On all accounts, Salas said his son was happy. Ben was a junior at North Carolina State. He was recruited to the rifle team and was talking about the future with his girlfriend.  “I couldn’t believe it. I just couldn’t believe it. To get a text message like that from someone that just I would have never in a million years suspected that he was going through, having these kind of thoughts and going down this path,” Salas said.  The grief is very much there, but Salas said he is not going to stay behind the wall of trauma.  He and his wife are choosing to share Ben’s story as well as theirs in hopes this won’t happen to someone else’s Ben.  “It is personal. It is hard. You know we lost our baby, so but I think it’s important my wife and I are committed to sharing Ben’s story and share our story,” Salas said. “Don’t settle for, ‘I’m okay’.

The convict, S. D. Gafoor, complained to Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge court in Rangareddy court complex that at the behest of the prison superintendent an under-trial prisoner assaulted him by fingering his private parts. “I have attempted suicide unable to bear this third degree torture of fingers being forcibly put into my anus. Officers hitting me with lathis. I am unable to practice my religion and having to face daily torture and humiliation,” Gafoor said in his complaint to the IV Additional MSJ.  Mr. Gafoor was serving sentence in the prison and facing a couple of other cases. He was brought to the court by the prison authorities for appearance in other cases on Tuesday. Soon after being presented before the judge, the prisoner started narrating the alleged torture by the prison authorities. Mr. Roy, Krishnamurthy, Venkat Reddy and Satya hand-cuffed and beaten with fiber lathis, he charged. “Venkat Reddy kicked me in my face and my legs. I got bleeding injuries in my mouth,” he told the judge.  With the judge asking him to give a specific complaint, advocate D. Suresh Kumar of Indian Association of Peoples Lawyers (who was present in the court) volunteered to file vakalat to represent Mr. Gafoor. Mr. Kumar informed the court oral statement of the prisoner was sufficient for the judiciary to act upon on the issue. As Mr. Gafoor spoke in Urdu and Hindi, a young lawyer Rizwan present in the court came forward to assist the court.  He translated Mr. Gafoor’s complaint into English and presented it to the court. The prisoner explained to the court that he had slashed his head and neck with a blade on Monday, a day after being tortured by the prison officials.  The prisoner charged that constables of the prison made him consume soap water. According to him, Venkat Reddy and Satya threatened to implicate him in narcotics cases. Mr. Gafoor told the court that magistrates were not visiting the under-trial prisoners who were confined in single cells. They were only visiting the general barrack, he said.  On receiving the written complaint of the prisoner, the judge directed the prison authorities to take him to conduct medical examination of the injuries Mr. Gafoor had sustained. When the government counsel requested the court to hear prison officials’ contentions, the judge said he would listen to them eventually. The matter was posted to May 30 for next hearing."

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Sign up for news and features from our diverse communities  A mental health hospital accused of attempting to 'cover-up' failures that contributed to a patient’s suicide has an 'issue with transparency', a senior staff member has admitted. Winbourne Charles, 58, died in his room at Goodmayes Hospital, North East London, on April 10 2021, having spent five months undergoing treatment for depression with psychotic symptoms.  In an inquest last month, a jury ruled that the dad-of-two’s suicide was 'contributed to by neglect' and failure to protect him from an 'obvious risk of self-harm'. Senior coroner for East London Graeme Irvine accused staff at North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT) – which runs the hospital – of attempting to 'cover-up' evidence of failing to regularly check on Winbourne’s welfare.  READ MORE: Met Police officers investigated after man Tasered before falling to his death from fifth floor balcony  Nurses' notes claimed he was alive 2 days after he had died  These included 'factually inaccurate' records of when Ilford staff had observed him and 'governance process failings' that saw its failings left out of three internal reports about the suicide. Two nurses' entries to Winbourne’s observation notes claimed he was alive and 'wake in his bedroom' two days after he died.  NELFT’s integrated care director Bob Edwards told Redbridge Council’s health scrutiny committee that the trust has 'an issue with transparency', despite encouraging staff to speak up. He said: “We absolutely strive to make sure that safety is the highest possible objective.""  He continued: “I think for people in the inpatient services included in this particular case, we could have done very much better, which we accept as an organisation, and we need to make sure we do so in future.”  Where to get help if you're struggling You don't have to suffer in silence if you're struggling with your mental health.

Concerns raised in a 'prevention of future deaths' report issued by the coroner last week include the fact that an investigation signed off by the integrated care director 72 hours after Winbourne’s death did not admit that observations had been missed.  The trust’s final serious incident report, handed to the coroner before the inquest, also failed to address “poor” assessments of Winbourne’s risk of self-harm and “inadequate” information in previous reports.  Witnesses to the inquest reported nurses using the “cut and paste” function to record when they observed patients and senior staff admitted medical notes appeared “dishonest”.  Mr Irvine noted that two staff members declined to answer questions about the accuracy of their notes, instead invoking an inquest rule protecting themselves from self-incrimination.

Londeka is popularly known for her character as Nkanyezi on Showmax’s drama series, Adulting, produced by Tshedza Pictures.  During an interview with Lungelo KM on Engineer Your Life, the actress revealed that she wanted to kill herself because she felt like there was no purpose to her life.  “I remember that falling pregnant was the only thing that stopped me from killing myself. Before my daughter, Liyana, my life was not worth living.”  Bagging a role in Adulting  The actress said scoring a role in Adulting restored her acting dream she had already gave up on because she felt inadequate and thought she did not deserve a chance in the industry.  She also shared that acting alongside her real-life crush Thembinkosi Mthembu, who plays Bonga on the show, was quite a shock to her, especially after finding out that she would be playing Bonga’s love interest.  “The crush is gone now. We are all good and well. He has and continues to teach me a lot about the industry,” she said, adding that fame has brought a lot of attention to her from other male celebrities.  ALSO READ: REVIEW: ‘Adulting’ gets off to a sexy start  “Having sex on TV“  Londeka shared that her mother is a pastor, and she was nervous about telling her about her role as it included a lot of explicit scenes.  “When I told her that I was going to shoot this, she was excited for me because this is something I have been wanting to do. But I did not give her context to say this is exactly what we are shooting. When the first episode aired, she was excited and told the congregation, and I had to get off my phone for a while. We never spoke about it again,” she said.  Showmax aired the 8th episode of Adulting last Monday, which marked the end of season 1. However, the show topped the trending topics on Twitter yesterday as fans complained that Monday was not the same without the show.  The eight-part drama series tells the story of four varsity friends who are trying to find love and success after varsity. Their strong bond has held them together even as their journeys in life have taken them in very different paths.  NOW READ: Who is the anonymous witness in Senzo Meyiwa trial?

Huntsville Police Department (HPD) officers Pegues and Beckles were dispatched to the call. Upon arrival, Pegues drew her pistol and made a partial entry through the front door, thereby exposing half her body to the inside. She observed Parker sitting on a couch with what appeared to be a gun at his own head. She told Beckles, still outside, what she saw. Beckles informed police dispatch that Pegues had seen Parker with a gun to his head. [1]  Officer Darby heard Beckles’ radio call about “a guy with a gun … threatening suicide” and responded. Darby arrived and saw that Pegues had her gun drawn but pointed down. He commanded her to point her gun at Parker because he thought that Parker “could kill her.” Pegues moved completely into the residence and briefly raised her gun but almost immediately lowered it. Both Beckles and Darby followed her inside and demanded that Parker drop the weapon.  Pegues also pleaded with Parker to drop the weapon, but he kept it pointed at his head and refused to drop it. Darby, believing that all three officers were in danger of being shot, fired at Parker and killed him.  The Darby murder trial  Darby was charged with murder. After a jury trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Officer Pegues testified at Darby’s trial that prior to Darby’s arrival, she attempted to de-escalate the situation, but that once Darby entered the residence, she “could feel the tension just rising.” She testified that Parker didn’t threaten her or “do anything to make her believe he wanted to do anything other than commit suicide.”  Officer Beckles testified that “at no time during this event did he feel the need to take deadly force action.” He stated that Parker “didn’t make any overt action to” indicate that he was about to point his weapon at the officers. He estimated that Parker was ordered to drop the weapon about seven times but failed to comply.  An HPD detective investigated the shooting incident and testified that he found no evidence that Parker “ever made a hostile determination towards anybody other than himself.”  Officer Darby testified that upon entering the residence he realized that all three officers had no cover between them and Parker. He ordered Parker to drop the gun twice, but Parker refused. Darby shot and killed him. “Darby also presented testimony from three other law enforcement officers (expert witnesses) who each testified that Parker's refusal to put his weapon down constituted an imminent threat to the responding officers' lives.” [2]  After both sides presented their evidence, Darby requested the trial judge to charge the jury as follows: ""The reasonableness of an officer's actions in using deadly force must be objectively reasonable judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, the fact that officers are forced to make split-second decisions, and in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them at the time.”  In support of his requested jury instruction, Darby cited the United States Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [3] The trial judge rejected Darby’s requested instruction. Instead, the judge provided the jury with a general self-defense instruction that is available to all citizens who assert self-defense as a justification for their actions. This permitted the jury to examine Darby’s conduct from the perspective of an ordinary citizen rather than a trained law enforcement officer.  Darby appealed and argued that the trial judge delivered an erroneous self-defense instruction that permitted the jury to ignore, as irrelevant, the expert testimony from several witnesses that reasonable law enforcement officers would believe they were facing an imminent threat to their personal safety.  The decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals [4]  The Alabama Court of Appeals reversed Darby’s conviction and ordered that he receive a new trial. The court ruled that it was not bound to accept Darby’s offered instruction that was based upon the Supreme Court’s opinion in Graham v. Connor. The court explained that Graham does not govern a state court’s application of state criminal statutes because it “involved a civil action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” (The federal civil rights statute). [5] Nonetheless, the court observed that the Alabama legislature passed a self-defense statute designed for Alabama peace officers that states: ""A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes it necessary in order … [t]o defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force."" [6]  The court ruled that the trial judge erred by giving the jury a self-defense instruction designed for ordinary citizens instead of an instruction intended by the Alabama legislature to be used for peace officers in self-defense situations. The court explained, “[T]he Alabama Legislature has made clear that there is a unique standard to be used in judging a police officer's use of deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer. Thus, the proper perspective from which to evaluate a police officer's use of deadly force in such situations is indeed that of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  The court observed that the ordinary citizen self-defense instruction given to the jury permitted the jury to ignore “extensive testimony from multiple witnesses regarding the training a police officer receives with respect to confrontations with an armed person.” The court noted that this testimony “supported a finding that a reasonable police officer in Darby's situation could have concluded that Parker's conduct represented the imminent use of deadly force. In other words, that testimony supported a finding that Darby acted in self-defense or defense of another when he shot Parker.”  Lessons learned  Here’s a summary of the lessons law enforcement officers can take from this case:  Parker called the police himself and threatened suicide. There was no indication that there were other civilians in immediate danger. Once the first officer saw Parker with a gun to his head, her tactical response should have been to back out, take cover, call for help, set up a perimeter, request a mental health professional, and attempt to de-escalate and negotiate a peaceful surrender.  The tactical decision(s) by all three officers to completely enter the room and expose themselves to a person holding a gun was extremely dangerous and unnecessary. This involved an unforced error that dramatically escalated an already dangerous encounter.  Once the officers placed themselves in this precarious predicament, a strong argument can be made that the officers were faced with a significant threat to their personal safety.  An action/reaction study conducted by Dr. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, involved students holding training guns loaded with marking cartridges to their heads while being confronted by officers 10 feet away with training pistols pointed at the students. Each confrontation involved one student and one officer. The confrontation was repeated several times with different students and officers participating each time. Once the officers ordered the students to drop the guns, the students would attempt to shoot the officers as quickly as they could. The average time for the students to fire was .40 of a second. The average officer response time to fire was .40 of a second. The study demonstrates how fast a situation can turn from encountering a potential suicide subject to becoming the victim of a cop killer.  This case demonstrates the sobering reality that in prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter etc., state court judges can, as the court did in the instant matter, reject an officer’s legal defense grounded in the “objective reasonableness” use of force standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [7]  As discussed, the murder conviction reversal was based not upon Graham but rather upon an Alabama statute that treated peace officers differently than ordinary citizens who claimed self-defense for their actions. The court ruled, “[W]here there is evidence to support a defendant police officer's claim that he used deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer, the trial court should instruct the jury to evaluate the defendant's actions from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  Police officials and police attorneys should ensure that officers under their command or counsel are made aware of the state deadly force standard that they would be judged by if charged with murder or manslaughter. Further, if the current state deadly force standard for officers criminally charged, is not favorable to law enforcement, strong consideration should be given to attempting to influence the state legislature to change the law to reflect more favorably upon law enforcement officers.  In 2019, the California legislature passed a new unfavorable deadly force statute for police officers that changed the deadly force standard for police officers from “reasonable” (Supreme Court’s Garner/Graham standard) to “necessary.” [8] Commenting on the new law, a recent University of Toledo Law Review article observed, ”the proposed law was tempered to allay concerns raised by police associations … the bill was watered down in an attempt to ensure its passage.” [9] The proposed law was amended by the California legislature to make it more acceptable for law enforcement due to pressure from police advocacy groups. The result, although unfavorable to police, could have been much worse.  The California law doesn’t define “necessary” but does state that deadly force may be used to “defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” [10] The law also contains language that suggests that imminent means immediate. [11] The California statute also permits examination of an officer’s pre-shooting conduct (which the Supreme Court suggests is not relevant in Graham v. Connor). [12]  The effect of the new California statute on prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter is yet to be seen. Suffice it to say that California’s move away from the Supreme Court’s “reasonableness” standard to an undefined statutory “necessary” standard to govern police use of deadly force is likely to result in more criminal prosecutions and convictions of police officers in that state.  References  1. It would later be determined that Parker was holding ‘a flare gun that had been intentionally painted black,’ but there is no evidence indicating that any of the officers were aware of that fact.  2. Quote is taken from the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals opinion.  3. 490 U.S. 386 (1989}. In Graham, the Supreme Court created an objective reasonableness standard for police use of deadly force grounded in the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that “the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Further, the Court ruled that when police use of force situations are evaluated, the fact that officers are “forced to make split-second judgments” must be considered.  4. Darby v Alabama, (CR-20-0919) (3/24/23).  5. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals determined when reviewing state criminal statutes, it is not bound to follow a constitutionally grounded Fourth Amendment-based opinion of the United States Supreme Court regarding the standard for police use of deadly force. The Alabama court cited a quote from a California case, People v. Perry, 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 465, 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 522, 536 n.10 (2019) as authority for declining to follow Graham v. Connor regarding its application to a state’s criminal statutes. The California court ruled, “Perry contends throughout his briefing that we are bound to apply the standards articulated in Graham in this case. Graham was a civil rights action brought pursuant to section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code and it involved an alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment. Long-standing and deeply held principles of federalism counsel that we have no obligation to import those standards into our state law defining criminal offenses."""

A Border Police spokesman said the suspect ran toward the checkpoint near the settlement of Shaked, known as “checkpoint 300,” while brandishing a knife. “Border Police troops operating at the crossing fired at the terrorist and neutralized him,” the spokesman said. The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry identified the man as 33-year-old Ahmed Muhammad Atatreh, and said he had died of his wounds.  “Lone wolf” stabbing and car ramming attempts that result in the death of the attackers happen about once a week; there have been at least 13 of them this year  But the perpetrators of these attacks have different demographics than the Palestinian terrorists killed in arrest raids. They are usually older, often with families of their own, and they are sometimes women.  These incidents happen often enough that the attackers know very well what is going to happen. The soldiers they attack will almost never be injured, and the attackers will probably end up dead.  It doesn’t take much thinking to realize that these aren’t terror attacks. They are suicides.  If you are a troubled Palestinian, with emotional, relationship or money problems, traditional suicide is not an option. It is a major sin in Islam; Muslims who commit suicide are taught that they do not enter Paradise, and a suicide would bring shame on the rest of the family. But martyrdom is the opposite: it is honorable, and brings honor as well as monetary compensation to the families.  There are two guaranteed consequences of these attacks: the attackers will be honored as heroic martyrs, and their families will get a guaranteed income from the Palestinian Authority.  Suicidal Palestinians have an easy decision on how to kill themselves: one path towards shame and hellfire, and the other towards honor, Paradise, and guaranteed family income and security.  Although this is only a theory, it seems to be a compelling one. There are huge disincentives to traditional suicides and giant incentives to “suicide by IDF.” The way to verify it would be if the media would investigate the personal lives of the would-be stabbers and car rammers to see what their family situations were like, what their personalities were, and to dig beyond the relatives claiming that they were angry at Israel to see of there were any other things going on in their lives.  But, of course, no media bother to do that. Even though they have enormous resources at their disposal – look at how they reported on Shireen Abu Akleh’s death – as far a I know, no mainstream media have ever investigated the circumstances of these attackers’ lives.  And the reason for that is just as obvious: they have a narrative of Israeli evil, and they have no desire to disprove what “everybody knows.” Especially when doing so would bring the exact dishonor to the victims that they were trying to avoid.  This is another example of media bias by omission. And the world only sees the simplistic lies of desperate Palestinians driven to act by how terrible their lives are under “occupation.”  {Reposted from EoZ}"

The women police officers warned the girl about the consequences of such actions and advised her against repeating such acts in the future.  (With inputs from Hariom Singh)"

In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to grow up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  “The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,” said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study. “This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.”  Recent research shows that since 2019 half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death – whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence – increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community. Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don’t own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020. The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  “For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,” said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center. “However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.”"

This conclusion has been made after the revenue department reached out out nearly five lakh families of farmers in the region as part of a survey conducted in December last year, Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrekar told reporters on Tuesday.  The Marathwada region, which comprises Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad and Parbhani districts, reported 1,023 farmer suicides in 2022.  As many as 10,431 farmers committed suicide in this region since 2001, as per figures provided by the divisional commissioner’s office.  Kendrekar said the administration studied the socio-economic condition of farmers and their families in the eight districts of Marathwada.  “The survey was conducted to find the families where farmers were vulnerable to taking the extreme step due to various conditions. The farmer suicide rate in Marathwada is more (compared to other parts of Maharashtra,” he said.  “Less crop yield, no good returns on crops, climatic conditions, problems due to wild animals and costly farming inputs were some of the main reasons for farmer suicides in the region. We called four such families and had discussions with them,” the official said.  He said the families get aid after they lose their member to suicide.  “To find such suicide vulnerable farmer families, we decided to reach out to the cultivators through a survey comprising 104 questions. It was like a psychological test,” the official said. Through this survey, the farmers families were found that were tired of their (socio-economic) condition, he said.  “The situation is serious. There are families with girls to be married, children who have left their education. If a family has five-seven acre of land and doesn’t have ample water, it yields less crop. They take loans from banks and private money lenders,” he noted.  Kendrekar said farmers need money in this “risky” business of farming.  “Like the Telangana government, I think the farmers should be given an aid of Rs 10,000 per acre before a crop season. They can purchase seeds and make their farms ready for sowing. After this, they can purchase other farming essentials without any debt and interest. We will recommend this to the state government soon,” the official said.  Market reforms are also necessary to prevent farmer suicides, he added."

GARNER, N.C. (WTVD) -- Local Emergency Rooms are under pressure to help those facing mental health episodes.  Last year, WakeMed Hospital admitted 4,000 adults and children with suicidal thoughts. That represents a 15 percent increase from the previous year.  Victor Chambers knows people suffering, but they're having difficulty accessing resources.  ""(They're) just mostly peers. I'm still kind of young myself so it's very prevalent in my age range,' said Chambers.  Wake County is committing about $30 million every year to support behavioral health services, but a newly released report shows there are several gaps in getting people the help they need.  The report notes that right now ""there is an overreliance on calling 911 for behavioral health crisis"" and then a ""lack of coordination with the new 988 crisis call line.""  One recommendation is to increase funding to the mental health facility WakeBrook and turn it into a crisis hub.  The report is being released as WakeMed is inching closer to building a new medical health hospital in Garner.  WakeMed Behavorial Health Department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Micah Krempasky said only about half of the people, who are admitted to the ER and need a psychiatric bed, actually get one.  ""We are vastly underserved in the amount of in-patient psychiatric beds available,"" she said. ""There are people that wait days, weeks, months or are actually never able to access that level of care. Instead, we stabilized them in the hospital. We connect them with out-patient services. We do the best that we can.""  WakeMed said there was a 104 percent jump in the number of pediatric patients since 2020.  Hospital leaders are trying to tackle the problem and building a new medical health hospital in Garner. The site is located near the intersection of White Oak Road and Timber Drive.  The facility will eventually have a 150 psychiatric beds and help with a shortage.  ""The need for behavioral health care is far bigger than what WakeMed can handle alone. We have to come together to come up with community solutions for the overwhelming need that is here and that has been under addressed for year,"" said Krempasky.  Ground is expected to be broken on the new mental health center in 2024 and supposed to open in 2026."

Hours later she was found hanging in the bathroom of her room, and she died at a hospital on Saturday evening.The girl’s mother alleged that the girl had even disclosed to her about the issues faced by her at the madrassa when she visited home during vacation.“The inquest and postmortem report revealed that she was not subjected to any physical or sexual assault. The probe team has to find out what the cause for her suicide was, including whether she was subjected to any mental torture. We will be focusing on collecting evidence in the initial phase. Her social media accounts, mobile phone, etc, will be examined in detail first. Later, her friends and the people associated with the madrassa will be questioned,” said an officer of the probe team.Meanwhile, there were reports that the religious school was functioning without any valid licence.

It really is about understanding people’s autonomy and respecting their decision and their choice when they are in a situation where they are suffering or when they are dying about the timing and the manner of their death.”  South Australia’s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Kyam Maher said 10% of suicides police attended in the area were of elderly people with terminal illnesses.  He said: “There has to be a better way that someone at the end of their life can die with the same dignity with which they lived their life.”  Dr Chandana Banerjee, a professor in palliative medicine in California, said having the option of assisted dying gives patients “peace of mind”.  “It allows them and their families to really plan for things rather than wait for the disease to get so debilitating that they can’t enjoy their lives for those last six months.”  There are strict rules in most countries that have legalised the practice.  Dr Banerjess said most people still think assisted dying in the US is “for anyone and everybody” but added: “That’s not the case. It really is highly regulated for those who have a prognosis of six months or less.”  Dr Lydia Dugdale, director at the centre for clinical medical ethics at New York’s Columbia University, highlighted the importance of safeguarding with the case of Canada, which has been highly criticised for its right-to-die laws.

Dr Dugdale said: “What kind of society do we want to live in where we solve the problem of ageing and lack of access and poverty by Euthanisa?  “That’s what we’re seeing in Canada which has not had it legalised for that long. People can’t pay their rent, they get euthanised. People can’t afford their medicines, they get euthanised. People need a wheelchair lift and the veterans’ affairs office offers them euthanasia.”  Professor Roderick MacLeod, a former senior palliative care consultant in New Zealand, was the voice of general concerns about assisted dying.  Saying he’d like to see the law reversed, he said: “For a long time I’ve spoken about the fact, as a palliative physician, people would ask me quite frequently if there was anything that I could do to end their life and when I was in practice I would say I couldn’t because it was illegal.  “But requests for a hastened death are not uncommon in palliative care because people are essentially saying ‘I don’t want to live like this’ and that is a very reasonable statement to make.  “What I know from my own practice and the practice of my colleagues is after a variable length in the palliative care service those requests for hastened death melt away.”  Last month, crossbench peer and chair of the charity Dignity in Dying, Molly Meacher, told MPs the reality of end of life could include vomiting faeces, endless nausea and bad-smelling decaying tumours.  She has long campaigned for reform to laws in the UK, where assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.  British retiree David Hunter is currently on trial in Cyprus after killing his cancer-stricken wife after she begged him to help end her misery.  He wept as he told the court on Monday: “It was her decision that she wanted to die, not mine - hers. It was her decision that she didn’t want any more treatment.  “She has her own mind and she asked me. I would never in a million years have done it. She wasn’t just my wife - she was my best friend.  “I didn’t just decide to kill her. I loved her so much. I still love her.  “You don’t know what we went through. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”  If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

The university student named Ho sustained injuries to his head and right leg after he jumped onto the tracks at about 7.40 pm and was hit by the moving train before becoming trapped beneath it.  He was rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital in critical condition.  Police found a suicide note at the scene, and a preliminary investigation revealed Ho had been conned on a social networking app.  Sources said Ho could not repay the debts, and the stress might have led to his suicide attempt.  The service of the East Rail Line was once suspended and resumed at 8.30 pm.  In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy was also defrauded on a social networking app by being blackmailed with indecent clips and photos of himself.  Police said the boy was recently lured into a nude chat, with his mother receiving some of the indecent images taken by the scammer, asking for HK$10,000.  It is unknown whether the mother paid the ransom.  Officers recommended that parents explain more about online pitfalls to their children and remind them not to be naked in front of the camera, click on suspicious links, or download programs from unknown sources. When children encounter unreasonable demands when making friends online, they should ask their parents or teachers for help.    If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts, help is available.

(WJBF) – The National Institutes of Health reports insomnia as a common sleep disorder, affecting up to half of patients with schizophrenia. Insomnia can also increase the risk of suicide in schizophrenic patients.  Doctors at the Medical College of Georgia at AU are investigating ways to lower this risk and improve patients’ quality of life.  Insomnia disorder affects about 10 percent of adults.  “Insomnia was a risk factor for suicidal thinking, suicidal behavior and suicide death,” said Dr. William Vaughn McCall, Chair of Psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.  During his earlier studies, Dr. McCall says he wanted to see if treating insomnia in people with active suicidal thinking would make a difference.  “It did,” said Dr. McCall. “Treating insomnia appeared to mitigate people’s tendency towards suicidal thinking. And this was the first time that it had been shown.”  Now, he and Dr. Brian Miller, professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, are working to treat this occurrence in patients with schizophrenia- using a drug called clozapine.  “We use it because it dramatically changes people’s lives when it works,” said Dr. Miller.  “I’ve started patients on clozapine who’ve been able to go back to school and finish degrees. And pursue advanced degrees. And get meaningful employment.”  Dr. Vaughn notes that a person’s ability to think clearly is noticeably diminished if they don’t get enough sleep.  “The decision they land upon is ‘I might commit suicide’, which is a decision they might not make if they slept better,” said Dr. McCall.  The doctors are also looking at ways to better recognize signs and symptoms of high alertness, which is often linked to insomnia.  Using a device called a pupillometer, they can measure the rate of pupil responses to determine the patient’s level of physiological excitement.  It has proven to be a helpful instrument in the stages of both diagnosis and treatment.  “We have an additional study with the pupillometer to measure these pupillary responses to light in patients before and after they get treated with clozapine,” said Dr. Miller.  “We think that the autonomic nervous system will tell us things about the patient that they may not be able to even access themselves,” said Dr. McCall.  Drs. Miller and McCall tell us they remain committed to proving their hypotheses and providing better care for patients in need."

Ms Vardy, wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, left the Jehovah's Witness community after being ""shamed"" for the sexual abuse, she has claimed.  Ms Vardy also claims to have been shunned by the community alongside family members after her parents got divorced.

She says: ""I was brought up in a strict and controlling religious organisation.""What happened to me during my childhood still affects me every single day.

Matt Pinkett’s new book proposes that classes centered around anger management, friendship, and active listening could potentially reduce male suicide rates.  Pinkett’s book delves into key research that explores factors influencing boys’ mental health, discussing topics such as body image, pornography, and self-harm. Additionally, it offers practical strategies for teachers to initiate positive change. The guide is grounded in evidence gathered from teachers, school staff, well-being experts, and therapists.  Research indicates that teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, a rate that triples when boys transition into adulthood. According to official data used by the U.K.-based researcher, 264 people between 10 and 19 years-old committed suicide in 2020 in England, Scotland, and Wales — with boys constituting 72 percent of these cases. In England specifically, suicide is the leading cause of death among men under 45.  Despite these grim statistics, Pinkett remains optimistic. In his book, “Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in School,” he urges teachers to refrain from stigmatizing anger, suggesting they should instead help boys understand the neurological and physiological roots of their feelings.  “Anger isn’t inherently bad. Telling boys it is only leads to shame and concealment. Instead, we should teach them that anger is as natural as joy or sadness, and equip them with the tools to manage it and the language to express it,” the author says in a media release.  Pinkett also believes that teachers should normalize loving, male relationships. He maintains that every social interaction in the classroom is observed and internalized, hence, male teachers should openly compliment male colleagues, speak affectionately about others, and acknowledge and applaud male emotional vulnerability whenever possible. He advocates for teaching boys about bromances, as this can furnish young men with the skills to listen actively and exhibit compassion and affection towards one another.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work. However, the fact is that we are in front of these children for significant portions of their lives. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing,” says Pinkett, who also co-authored the book, “Boys Don’t Try.”  He further adds that the challenge lies not in encouraging young men to talk, but rather in teaching their peers to listen. Pinkett’s research suggests that boys don’t listen as effectively as girls.  “There is so much discussion about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through effective listening?”  His research proposes that boys yearn for emotional intimacy and the liberty to express themselves without ridicule. However, he identifies toxic masculinity as an obstacle to nurturing these beneficial peer relationships. He believes boys should be taught kindness, vulnerability, and emotional articulation. Pinkett hopes his book will embolden others to tackle difficult topics that will benefit everyone.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to discard harmful and outdated expectations of masculinity, society as a whole will benefit. It is only through education that the blight of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Armed with extensive research, Pinkett offers advice on intervening when a child may be at risk and provides tips on establishing group tasks that foster friendships while facilitating learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists. It’s simply about having the courage to intervene and provide boys with an opportunity to learn a different way of being.”  South West News Service writer Alice Clifford contributed to this report."

Illinois has six crisis call centers statewide. In July 2021, the state was last in the country, with only 19% of crisis calls answered in state.  After the 988 launch in July 2022, that number jumped to 81% and new data just released for April 2023 found 87% of calls were answered in-state, the highest ever.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “You can call it and have your call answered in about 36 seconds is the average now, while it used to be close to 170 seconds. So that's a huge improvement,” Cummings said.  Nationwide, people in crisis contacted the 988 lifeline nearly 368,936 times last month. That’s 160,314 more contacts in April 2023 compared to April 2022.  A year over year comparison for the month of April also found calls answered went up by 52%, chats answered increased by 90% and text responses went up by 1,022%.  “I was thrilled, because a lot of the people who do the texting are younger people, and we want to get to them as soon as possible,” said Cara Levinson.  Levinson is the board chair for the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Levinson lost her daughter, Elana, 18, to suicide in 2007.  “Not that every minute is occupied with missing her but it's, as you can see, it's, it's still, still there,” Levinson said, tears in her eyes.  Levinson said she can’t help but wonder if the outcome would have been different had the 988 lifeline been available to Elana.  “With anyone who dies, there’s always this feeling, especially with suicide, if… only….” Levinson said.  Levinson was recently at an event where people she spoke with weren’t aware calling or texting the three-digit code, 988, provides immediate access to trained counselors.  “I can't tell you how many people did not know of its existence. That’s a problem,” Levinson said.    She’s determined to raise awareness, hoping to spare another family the pain she feels from losing Elana.  “If it can't be there for her, then her death though, has prompted me to do this work,” Levinson said."

None convinced North Charleston police not to charge him with murder. On May 16 Harris' plea for bond failed to persuade a judge to grant the request.  Harris, 20, is accused of murder in the July 5, 2021, fatal shooting of Anissa Shank, of Moncks Corner. He has been held in jail nearly two years without bond. After hearing from both sides on the issue of bond May 16, Circuit Judge B. Alex Hyman ruled against Harris.  The day Shank died, North Charleston police responded to a 911 call around 1 a.m. at his residence, 4853 Lecque St. The call was about a suicide. But North Charleston police officers who responded to the call and found Shank dead determined the fatal gunshot wasn't self inflicted. Detectives determined a charge of murder was appropriate for Harris, whom they believed tried to stage Shank's death as a suicide before he fled the scene.  Harris later told police he was ""playing"" with a gun and accidentally shot Shank, 9th Circuit Assistant Solicitor Kelsey Davis said during the May 16 bond hearing.  Her killing devastated an already grief-stricken family. Shank's mother died just three weeks before she was killed, according to Dana Rabon, who identified herself in the courtroom May 16 as the victim's aunt. Rabon implored the judge to deny bond.  Nicholas D'Angelo, of the Charleston County Public Defenders Office, said he is concerned for his client's wellbeing in the county jail. Harris has been held for 802 days awaiting trial. The attorney said he just learned his 22-year-old client had been placed on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center. Harris' mother and his new girlfriend supported him in the courtroom.  The case will likely not be scheduled for trial this year, D'Angelo said. Prosecutors and defense attorneys in Charleston's General Sessions Court are still working to resolve cases that predate Harris' case, which is nearing two years old.  The case backlog has grown to 14,000 pending cases. Last year, the typical case in General Sessions Court lasted 625 days — more than 1½ years — according to a recently released report by the Charleston County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council."

The fundraiser is being held at The Grand Roxy in Brighton-Le-Sands from 6.30pm and will raise money for the Black Dog Institute towards Mental Health Awareness and Suicide Prevention.  The night will be focused on personal stories from the family and other guest speakers, including Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Ahead of the fundraiser, The Greek Herald spoke with Glenn and Katrina to hear all about their personal connection to losing a family member through suicide.  Anna, Glenn and Liza.  Glenn Anthony:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I lost my brother Terry to suicide in 2017. He was suffering from mental health issues and depression for many years. We as a family had lived with this and tried to get help for Terry, but this was very difficult and challenging for my parents, sister and myself. After Terry’s passing, it was extremely difficult to process and all our lives were changed.  Personally, my views on life were altered and nothing seemed important anymore. I shut myself off to everyone and everything, and slipped into a terrible depression. I had many questions but no answers. I spent three years with my bereavement councillor to help me focus and see clearly again.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I do believe it is a taboo topic regardless of which community you come from. There is a stigma attached to suicide which generates thoughts within the community of weakness, blame, shame or even sin. The topic makes people uncomfortable and unsure of how to react.  Since my brother’s suicide, I have been able to understand a bit more about this disease and along with this better understanding, I have felt more comfortable discussing it. It is more frowned upon within the Greek community as it is looked at as a sin and having lack of faith.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we are open and honest about the topic, the more people will feel comfortable talking about it. When we don’t talk about our problems or our depression or dark thoughts, then it builds up and it always feels much worse. The more we talk, the more we raise awareness, people are likely to seek help and advice. Let’s talk, let’s make a difference, let’s save lives together.  What do you hope to achieve with your fundraiser?  The fundraiser is about bringing people together from all communities to raise awareness for mental health and suicide prevention. The Black Dog Institute will be there on the night sharing what they are doing and what programs they have to assist people affected. We hope this night shows people there is a lot of help out there.  People can expect some educational insight as to what is being done, they can expect to hear from people that have been affected by suicide, as well as plenty of good food, wine, music and fun, as this night is also a celebration of life.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  As far as dealing with mental health issues, there are many different organisations to help with advice on recognising mental health, what to do, what to say and how to deal with this debilitating disease.  As far as a message for someone dealing with suicide, I would say to talk about your feelings, be open with your family and friends and don’t shut yourself off. The sooner you understand and accept what has happened, the sooner you can get peace of mind and ease your soul. It’s not easy. It’s a type of bereavement that never leaves you, so you have to find a way to best deal with it as it becomes part of your everyday life.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I knew nothing about mental health. But when I lost my son, George, to suicide in 2012, I was unable to accept the tragedy. I developed post-traumatic stress and depression and became suicidal. In order to help myself, I had to obtain treatment and knowledge from mental health services. Now I use this knowledge to raise awareness and help others.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I think it is a taboo subject in every community. Society in general, is very unaccepting and judgemental. The Greek community I found even more so. I found myself treated like a leper, people were cruel with their judgement and criticisms. Greeks don’t understand mental health is a chemical imbalance in the brain, a physical condition. They treat it as an aberration, a weakness, a lack of faith, and something to be avoided. They consider people be more religious and stronger.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we talk openly about the subject, to bring it out of the shadows, the safer people will be. When they know others understand, and they can put up their hands and ask for help without judgement, they will seek help. This will save lives. My son did not seek help, fearing he would be labelled, and his teammates would think less of him.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  Losing a family member to suicide is devastating. My family unit imploded. We couldn’t deal with the grief, the mental health issues and beating the guilt of the ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybes.’ That ate us up alive.  My message is – you cannot fix them, you cannot take away their pain, but you can be there for them. Show compassion and understanding, be prepared to listen and support without judgement, have empathy, and give of yourself to share their grief.  Is there anything else you’d like to say?  There are many organisations dealing with mental health and there is a lot of assistance out there. There is a life lost to suicide every three hours, the toll is horrific. We need to raise awareness with our youth, teach them to recognise mental health, tell them where to get help, and how to build resistance. With knowledge and these tools, we can make a difference, we can save lives.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain  Black adults—particularly Black women—with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to have grown up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm, and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  ""The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,"" said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study.  ""This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.""  Recent research shows that since 2019, half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death—whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence—increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community.  Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don't own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020.  The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  ""For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.  ""However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.""

Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public “when dysregulated and engaging in aggressive behaviour” in a fast food restaurant, and how the video was shared thousands of times on various social media sites.  Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public (Peter Byrne/PA Wire)  The Tory peer explained how the video was reported by the boy and his mother, but the sites would not take it down, and the teen “became overwhelmed” by the negative comments, eventually trying to end his own life.  Her remarks came as peers called on the Government to create an avenue of redress for individuals unhappy with how a platform has dealt with their complaint.  She said: “This footage was shared out of context across social media with much of the response online labelling Harry as a disruptive teenager who was engaging in unacceptable aggression and vandalising public property.  “This was shared thousands of times over the course of a few weeks.  “When Harry and his mum reported it to the social media platforms, they were informed it didn’t violate community guidelines and that there was a public interest in the footage remaining online.  “The family, quite rightly, felt powerless, Harry became overwhelmed at the negative response to the footage and the comments made about his behaviour.  “Harry became withdrawn and stopped engaging. He then tried to take his own life.  “It was at this point that Harry’s mum reached out to the voluntary-run service Report Harmful Content as she had nowhere else to turn to. Report Harmful Content is run by the charity South West Grid for Learning.  “They were able to mediate between the social media sites involved to further explain the context and demonstrate the real-world harm that this footage, by remaining online, was having on the family and Harry’s mental health.  “Then, and only then, did the social media companies concerned remove the content.”  Lady Newlove gave the troubling account as peers continued their line-by-line scrutiny of the Online Safety Bill.  Peers across the House called for an independent appeals procedure for social media users who have exhausted the internal complaints process of these sites – an ombudsman separate to Ofcom to provide an impartial out-of-court resolution.  This suggestion was rejected by the Government, with technology minister Viscount Camrose saying: “The Government does remain confident that service providers are best placed to deal with individual user complaints as they will be able to take appropriate action promptly.  “This could include removing content, sanctioning offending users, reversing wrongful content removal or changing their systems and processes.”  He added that the Bill includes “super-complaints provisions” that allow for systemic issues to be raised with Ofcom, who will be required to publish a response.  Individuals can also submit complaints to Ofcom but it “will not be able to investigate or arbitrate in individual cases” – instead, these reports will be used to inform its overall enforcement activity.  Liberal Democrat peer Lord Allan of Hallam, who worked as Facebook’s director of policy in Europe for 10 years, highlighted that online providers struggle to deal with the “vast funnel of reports”, most of which are “spurious or vexatious”, and the challenge of separating the “genuinely serious reports” from the “vast amount of noise”.  He argued an independent body is needed to identify circumstances where a platform has correctly enforced its policies, but that in a particular case, like Harry’s, it is “deeply unfair, problematic and harmful for an individual”, and provide an avenue for redress.  Children’s rights campaigner Baroness Kidron said the minister responding to the debate had been given “a sticky wicket here of defending the indefensible”.  The film director and independent crossbencher said: “The Government has chosen to give individuals no recourse under the Bill and that is the current situation as it stands, and there is no concession on that matter.  “I believe I have been in meetings with people when they have been promised such things and I think it’s really important that we state what the situation is.”  Offering a meeting with peers to discuss the matter further, Viscount Camrose said: “We are giving users greater protection through the Bill.”  Labour frontbencher Lord Stevenson of Balmacara told him: “This is a very complicated Bill and you and I are now learning the hard lessons.  “It’s quite clear there’s something here that needs to be resolved and the way the Government is approaching it, it is heading towards a brick wall.”  He added that the Bill is “reinforcing an inequality of arms” between individuals and companies, concluding:  “The Government is in a mess, please sort it.”"

House Bill 140, sponsored by Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, permits a terminally ill adult resident of Delaware to request and self-administer medication to end the individual’s life in a humane and dignified manner.  The bill was introduced last year, but didn’t survive the session.  Under HB 140, both the individual’s attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse and a consulting physician or nurse would have to agree on an individual’s diagnosis and prognosis and believe the individual has decision-making capacity, is making an informed decision, and is acting voluntarily.  Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, who was against the bill, was among those who thought the bill would prematurely end some people’s lives, saying citing religious belief and prayer sometimes prolongs life.  “My father was diagnosed with lung cancer and was given 18 months,” Briggs King said. “He lived 18 years.”  Rep. Mike Smith, R-Pike Creek, questioned a major talking point for proponents of the bill, which was that 70% of Delawareans support assisted suicide, and that is consistent nationally across surveys.  He said the survey question, which asked whether a health care provider honoring a terminally ill patient’s request to end his or her life should be subject to criminal or civil penalties.  “Doctors are not trained in this. Doctors are trained to treat disease,” he said. “They’re not trained to teach you when to die, or how to die.”  Rep. Stell Parker Selby, D-Milton, said she received dozens of emails from Sussex County residents that were in opposition to the bill.  She said when her mother died, she and her family agreed that she wouldn’t go on any machines or have doctors give her anything, and most people in Sussex agree that they want to die without any assistance.  One common form of assisted suicide that was discussed was a powder that is mixed with a small amount of water or other solution that a patient drinks and typically dies within a few hours.  However, the powder often causes nausea and patients can vomit it up causing a delayed reaction.  READ: Food service workers, paraprofessionals could get raises  Doctors from out-of-state testified that they give patients medications to treat nausea before giving them the solution to ensure it works as it’s supposed to, with a painless death a few hours later.  One speaker said 80% of patients who take the solution die within one hour.  Smith and some others pushed the fact that patients must be in the right state of mind while making the decision, and even suggested mandating a psychiatric evaluation prior to making a decision.  “The physicians regularly are assessing the mental capability of their patients,” Baumbach said.  The idea of assisted suicide legislation has been thrown around in the General Assembly for nearly a decade without success.  Personal anecdotes were shared throughout the meeting.  Kevin Hensely, R-Kevin Hensley, R-Middletown, said his mom, who recently died, wanted to go out her way, by her own choice.  “’I’m sorry to lay that all out here,” he said. “But it’s really fresh, and it’s helped me see it from a different perspective.”  Proponents of the bill said someone who is terminally ill and in pain should be the one to make a decision on their life.  Because several committee members left sometime during the meeting, the committee did not have enough voting members to declare if it was released or not.  That will be made clear hours after the meeting on the bill’s tracker site.  Also Tuesday:  House Bill 150, dubbed the Cover All Delaware Children Act and sponsored by Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Greenville, would help Delaware children who are undocumented and do not have access to routine or preventative healthcare, including vaccinations and physicals, because they cannot afford the services.  HB 150 directs the Department of Health and Social Services to develop and operate a limited medical assistance program for children in Delaware who are not otherwise covered, including children who are not documented.  A child resident in the state whose family income is low enough that they would qualify on that basis for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, but is not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, is eligible for coverage and medical care under this Act.  The coverage would be co-extensive with that provided by CHIP and Medicaid, except that it would not include in-patient care at a hospital or other healthcare facility.  HB 150 also requires the state to submit a plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services so that the state can take advantage of the federal CHIP option to include coverage of pregnant women regardless of immigration status.  HB 150 had enough voting members to constitute a quorum, and legislators voted to release the bill, which will now head to the House floor.  Senate Bill 98, sponsored by Sen. Nicole Poore, D-Delaware City, also was released and is on its way to the House floor.  SB 98 would allow dental clinicians possessing a DDS or DMDS to participate in the Health Care Provider Loan Repayment grant program. The bill also extends the time in which providers may apply for a Healthcare Provider Loan Repayment grant from six months to two years following completion of their graduate education.

We urge the Senate to follow through and help state authorities understand the root causes of this problem.  A 2022 state-mandated report on suicide prevention revealed that the number of suicides among Texas children in foster care jumped from one in 2017 to four in 2021. There are about 50,000 youths in the state’s foster care system.  Foster care youth experience higher rates of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Sadly, their suicide rate is three times higher than that of the general youth population in Texas, according to the state’s suicide prevention report. Still, it’s the job of Texas’ child welfare agency to protect children in its care from harm or death.  Understanding why children in foster care attempt suicide can help the state prevent deaths, said Angela Ott, a policy fellow at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health, a nonprofit affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin. Currently, the state is not required to report suicide attempts.  Opinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  House Bill 4065, which was approved 145-0 in the lower chamber, would require the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to maintain records and collect data on suicide attempts of children in foster care. The Senate now has to take up the bill.  The causes of suicide are complex, and they must be addressed as part of the state’s larger effort to support better mental health programming and infrastructure.  The Legislature is looking at increasing funding for mental health programs. Senate Bill 26, which has been forwarded to the House for debate, would fund grants for community-based organizations that work with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The bill would give priority to organizations that work with children considered high risk for mental health issues, according to The Texas Tribune.  Better data collection must inform the strategies that the state adopts to prevent suicides in the foster care system. These are Texas’ most vulnerable children, and they deserve our best effort.

He said on the call that they had gone to the gas station and were eating dinner at home when he decided to call 911.

In 2020, Congress passed the 988 National Suicide Designation Act, requiring a new and universal three-digit calling code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to how 911 is used for public safety emergencies. However, state and local governments were responsible for implementing the 988 system, which launched in July of 2022, though Congress allowed states to assess a fee on cell phone bills to recover the costs related to 988 and the associated crisis services.  House Bill 160, sponsored by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Senator Nicole Poore, would implement a 60-cent monthly surcharge on each wireless access line, establish a fund for the surcharge, and create a board composed state agencies and stakeholders to report on the state’s crisis intervention services. It would also institute a one-time, 60-cent fee on prepaid services. Under the bill, the funds collected through the surcharge would specifically be earmarked for operating the 988 system, providing crisis intervention services and staffing associated services. Unspent money would revert to the fund each year and could not be used for general state expenses.  “People in crisis need to know when they call 988 that they are being connected to knowledgeable, caring professionals who will help steer them through incredibly difficult situations. However, 988 calls in Delaware are currently funneled to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, which is chronically understaffed. We need to provide our behavioral health professionals with the tools and resources they need to save lives. Establishing a small monthly surcharge, similar to way we fund 911 emergency services, will strengthen our mental health services in Delaware and ensure that a person reaching out for help receives quality care. HB 160 builds on our ongoing efforts to address the mental health crisis and provide a continuum of care for residents,” said Rep. Longhurst.  “Delaware can’t sit by and hope that the behavioral health crisis that has been affecting our nation for decades will simply go away on its own,” said Sen. Poore, the Senate prime sponsor of HB 160. “That’s why I have joined with Rep. Longhurst and our colleagues in the Delaware General Assembly to make real investments in a system of care capable of helping people who need it most. This legislation builds on that work by giving our new behavioral health crisis and suicide prevention help line the staff and resources it needs to deescalate emergencies, quickly provide families with immediate access to support and services, and most importantly, save lives.”  Currently, Delaware’s crisis lines handle about 25,000 contacts, though state officials say they expect those numbers to increase due to a greater need for behavioral health services, with a possible growth of 60% or more.  HB 160 would allow funds collected to be used for the establishment and operation of the 988 system and center, including staffing, providing crisis intervention services, providing specialized training, raising public awareness, and data collection and analysis.  HB 160 has been assigned to the House Health & Human Development Committee."

The 29-year-old trot singer was found dead by the police on 12 May, reported Naver. This is the second death of a K-pop star to hit the South Korean entertainment industry in less than a month.  In mid-April, famous K-pop star Moonbin’s death had left fans shocked globally. The 25-year-old member of the boy band Astro appeared to “have taken his own life”, as per the police.  These tragic incidents have once again put the spotlight on the dark side of the K-pop world and the Korean entertainment industry.  Series of cases  26-year-old actor Jung Chae-yull was found dead in her home on 11 April. Another actor Yoo Joo-eun died last year at the age of 27.  Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), passed away in October 2019. The 25-year-old had faced cyberbullying throughout her career. A month later, her close friend and a K-pop star, 28-year-old Goo Hara, was found dead at home.  In a rare admission for a K-pop star, Goo had previously revealed in a video that she was suffering from depression.  In December 2017, the lead singer of the boy band Shinee, Kim Jong-hyun, died in a suspected suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.  In a note shared a day before his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt “broken from inside”.  “The depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,” Kim wrote, adding he “couldn’t defeat it anymore”, reported The Guardian.  The heavy cost of fame  According to experts, a variety of factors contribute to higher pressure on young entertainers in South Korea than pop stars of other countries.  This includes presenting a perfect image in public, a stringent training schedule and a culture of online bullying, noted Variety magazine.  K-pop artist Amber Liu opened up about the intense industry pressure in 2020. She told CBS Mornings, “If you aren’t under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut”. “You’re told what to do, what to say, what to think.”  As per CNN, a K-pop star works for an average of 16 hours or so a day, doing everything from dance practices and singing lessons to language classes and camera training.  K-pop artists have to undergo a rigorous training period, even preparing for 10 years or more sometimes before they can make their debut.  There is also extreme competition in the industry for K-pop stars or “idols” as they are called.  “The control from celebrities’ agencies and fan culture are two main contributors to the massive stress Korean stars face,” Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine, told BBC.  South Korea has “fandoms” or organised groups of admirers who spend time and money to prop up their favourite stars and target their opponents, reported Daily Mail.  The stars, in return, have to maintain their perfectly crafted image.  In South Korea’s conservative society, scrutiny of entertainers starts once they debut, with their every move being closely watched by everyone, especially the fans.  As per Daily Mail, drug use or drunken driving can end careers in the industry.  “Korea has a very strict moral standard for celebrities compared to other countries,” Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-kun told BBC.  “If a star behaves only a little different from what’s perceived ‘decent’, the public would attack them. And it’s hard for a star to ignore this kind of assault because of the high social pressure from strong collectivism.”  “Koreans have a strict moral code for their celebrities,” Jeeheng Lee, a culture expert at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, was quoted as saying by Variety. “Demonising the K-pop industry alone doesn’t solve the problem. Sulli and Hara suffered more from misogynistic attacks than from K-pop fans.”  As The Diplomat said in December 2022, while the Korean Wave overtakes the world, “mistreatment, suicide, slave labour contracts, gruelling training schedules, ‘no dating’ clauses, sexual assault, and sexualisation of minors by K-pop agencies cannot go unnoticed”.  ALSO READ: How toilet paper in Japan is helping suicidal youth  Mental health stigma  South Korea has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, as per Bloomberg.  BBC noted that suicide cases among people in their 20s are increasing in the Asian country.  While the stigma around mental health is not limited to South Korea, the added pressure from the country’s entertainment industry has made matters worse for its young celebrities.  Royce Lee, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, told Variety in 2019: “All cultures have a stigma against mental illness. It’s not uniquely Korean”.  “But when talking about celebrities, the intersection of culture and psychology becomes very important. The idea that one must please everybody is both a very Korean idea and a very common problem with fame. So it is a double whammy.”  According to Paik Jong-woo, a psychiatrist and the director of the Korea Suicide Prevention Center, artists are hesitant to approach mental health professionals due to “fear of public shame” and their hectic schedules, CNN reported in 2019.  Speaking to CBS This Morning, Liu, who was a former bandmate of Sulli, talked about the stigma against mental illnesses in the country. “When (people) hear you’re getting help they’re like, ‘What? Why are you getting help? That’s weird’,” she said in 2020.  “That stigma against mental health is just so strong.”  As per reports, while several agencies have started therapy sessions for trainees and stars, the problem of stigmatisation continues to persist.

""As a kid, it’s very disappointing,"" eighth grader Josiah Pope said.  ""I get pretty scared because you don’t know when it can happen,"" eighth grader J.R. Crooks said. ""It can happen at any time to anybody.""  For the past year, students in a class titled ""Youth for the Future"" created a new way to market 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number that replaced the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline last July.  News 5 The students pose with advisers Sally Bradley and Joslin Seeds and their poster after a presentation with area leaders at the Ashtabula County Building Resiliency Together (BRT) Collaborative meeting on May 10.  ""We want to change how people look at [988],"" classroom adviser Joslin Seeds said. ""It isn’t just suicide. It’s everything.""  The goal of the poster, which features a student wearing a hoodie, is to connect with students that the lifeline could also be used for other mental health challenges instead of strictly suicidal thoughts.  The idea, Seeds explained, came from watching school shooting after school shooting and learning that in some cases, the shooter tried to reach out for help.  RELATED: She checked her Instagram. She didn't expect a message from The Covenant School shooter.  ""Young kids shouldn’t be dying,"" Pope added. ""We want to get our program out there to as much people as we can.""  ""I think it might be one of the most important things I’ve done and might be in my life,"" Crooks explained.  In student Haiden Peterson’s case, fear took over his house.  ""When I was in third grade, my mom home-schooled me and the rest of my siblings because she was scared of someone coming into the building and shooting us,"" Haiden explained.  988 launched in July 2022  Last year, 988 was unveiled across the country as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, replacing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  The new number is a chance for anyone across the country to call or text and reach a trained professional who can help those experiencing a mental health or an addiction crisis.  In Ohio, experts were expecting around a 40% increase in calls when the number changed, but tell News 5 they’ve only seen a slight uptick.  Across the state, that averages out to about 8,600 calls per month handled by counselors.  Help Network of Northeast Ohio handles the 988 calls for those living in Mahoning, Trumbull and Ashtabula counties.  ""Today, the effects of the pandemic appear to be more mental health,"" said Vince Brancaccio, CEO of the Help Network of Northeast Ohio. ""We're getting a lot more calls from people traumatized by the pandemic. They're feeling depressed, they're anxious and frightened and calling saying they need mental health.""  It comes at a time when, whether it’s trauma, or the harmful effects of technology and social media, the impacts on our children's mental well-being are everywhere.  ""We have a youth mental health crisis in our country,"" U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during a visit to Cleveland in April.

The class, run by Seeds and Sally Bradley, meets every day with its all-male class to deal with the academic, social and emotional needs.  ""We want the kids we see every day to normalize those feelings of depression and anxiety,"" Seeds explained.  Already, the campaign, which has not been finalized, is getting attention.  ""Those young men, their voice is a force to be reckoned with,"" said Joleen Sundquist, Chief Clinical Officer at the Ashtabula-based Community Counseling Center. ""There are thoughts that [988 is] just for people taking their own life. As our 'Youth for the Future' students said, it’s for hurt people who are thinking about hurting people. That could be themselves or someone else.""  The next step will be for the poster to be finalized by the Ashtabula County Mental Health Recovery Services Board. If approved, the poster could end up on billboards, inside grocery stores, schools and more.  The students have their own ideas as well about how to catch the attention of their peers: from Instagram stories and Snapchat to the big screen at a Cleveland Cavaliers game.

Now parents tell The Post how their families have suffered as social media severely impacted their teenage children, even driving them to suicide.  The American Psychological Association released 10 new recommendations last week on protecting teens while they use social apps, underlining the growing concern among parents, experts, and lawmakers about interacting with others through phones and screens for hours unchecked.  The guidance does not suggest specific daily limits for teens. But it urges parents to keep children away from content about “beauty” and “appearance” – saying comments on photos can lead to poor body image, eating disorders, and depression, particularly among girls.  Parents protested at Snap’s headquarters last week, saying their children died as a result of the company’s Snapchat platform. One mom who spoke to The Post, Rosellene Bronstein, said her son took his own life after being bullied on it. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  It also tells parents to make sure children are not stopped by social media from getting eight hours of sleep, to keep them away from screens an hour before bedtime, and to monitor usage for problematic content.  “Within the field, there is pretty clear consensus that it is not how much time kids are on screen that matters as much as what they are doing during that screen time,” the APA’s chief science officer, Mitch Prinstein, who helped develop the advice, told The Post.  Prinstein said teens should focus on homework or reading the news instead of passive scrolling or exposure to potentially destructive content.  “It may be easiest for parents to consider how much their children are balancing social interactions that allow for the development of mature social competence as compared to the amount of social interaction that is via social media,” Prinstein said.  Protests from the parents of dead teenagers are only part of the pressure on social media platforms, with members of both parties in Congress proposing bans on its use for under-13s and new restrictions for other teens. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  Social media giants, including Meta’s Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and smaller platforms including Roblox, Discord, Reddit, and Twitch, are facing not just criticism from parents and psychologists but calls from both parties in the Senate for an all-out ban on their use by under-13s and severe restrictions for 13- to 18-year-olds.  And relatives of the 10 people murdered by a racist gunman in the Buffalo, New York, supermarket shooting last May are now suing Meta, Snapchat’s parent company Snap, Discord, Reddit, 4chan, YouTube’s owner Alphabet and Twitch’s parent company Amazon. They claim the platforms radicalized the teen gunman before the mass shooting.  One school resource officer told The Post he tells parents to keep kids off social media until “at least 13” because of the risk that they will be exploited for nudes or money by extortionists.  Corp. David Gomez, an officer with the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said he operates multiple fake accounts to see what “kind of drug issues” are impacting the area, as well as to search for local runaways. He regularly gets contacted by men and women while portraying both boys and girls, he said.  Corp. David Gomez, of the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said “dangers” await young users of social media sites, including scammers in search of money or sexually explicit content.  “I just regurgitate what the kids say and then I get adult predators who want to meet for sex,” Gomez, 50, said. “As a community, we need to increase our education of parents and kids about social media dangers.”  He also cultivates relationships offline with students, but he realizes authorities are outnumbered.  “This is like emptying the river with one cup at a time,” Gomez said. “Most adults cannot fathom the amount of kids that are becoming victims to these things.”  SNAPCHAT BULLIES TOLD MY SON: ‘GO KILL YOURSELF’  Rosellene Bronstein, 49, of Chicago, traveled to California for a protest outside Snap headquarters in Santa Monica on Friday because she does not want another family to lose a child to suicide – as she did last year.  She joined dozens of parents calling for stricter regulations on social media companies and expressing support for the proposed Kids Online Safety Act. The measure, proposed by a bipartisan group of senators, would require annual independent audits assessing risks to teens and increased parental controls.  Nate with his parents, Rob and Rosellene Bronstein, during a trip in 2020, roughly two years before the bullied teen committed suicide. Social media sites deliberately use algorithms to “create addiction” among young users, his mother told The Post. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “The algorithms are deliberately designed to create addiction to the content our children are exposed to,” she continued. “And couple with our children’s desire to be validated by likes, shares and views, these online environments are extremely harmful to our children’s mental health.”  Bronstein’s son, Nate, took his own life in January 2022 following relentless bullying by more than 20 classmates at the Latin School of Chicago.  Just weeks before hanging himself, the 15-year-old had received a Snapchat message from a basketball teammate urging him to “go kill yourself,” she recalled.  Bronstein said Nate reported the abuse to school officials, but his parents weren’t informed until it was too late. She and her husband Rob Bronstein later filed a $100 million lawsuit against the school, alleging their son was initially targeted by bullies who wrongly believed he was unvaccinated.  “Social media platforms do not care about our children. They only care about profits.” Rosellene Bronstein  They also joined a class-action lawsuit that accuses platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and others of being designed to maximize screen time and encourage addictive behavior, often resulting in emotional, mental or physical harm.  “It’s really up to us parents to come together to create our own societal shift and say, ‘Enough is enough, we’re not going to put our kids on social media,’” Bronstein, whose daughters Mia and Sydney are 19 and 15, told The Post.  Nate Bronstein, 15, was found hanged in his family’s home just one month after he received a Snapchat message urging him to “go kill yourself,” his mother told The Post.  She said parents should consider keeping their teens away from social media altogether if possible, likening abuse of sites like Facebook or TikTok to smoking or doing drugs.  “It’s the same idea, it has to be applied to social media,” Bronstein said. “But parents aren’t there yet. And what really upsets me is that parents have their heads down in the sand, thinking this is not a crisis. That’s the issue.”  She also wants Snapchat to allow parents to monitor all the content its teenage users receive by permitting third-party apps such as Bark to monitor messages, something the platform does not currently allow.  A $100 million lawsuit filed by Robert Bronstein, left, and his wife Rosellene alleges the Latin School of Chicago committed “willful failure” to stop continual bullying of their son Nate. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “If I would’ve been able to use Bark with Snapchat, the minute he would’ve gotten that message, I would’ve gotten like a three-alarm alert on my phone,” she said. “We would have been able to save our son.”  Users must be at least 13 to create a Snapchat account and teens receive an alert if they’ve accepted a friend request from an adult. The app also recently launched its “Family Center,” a tool allowing parents to track friends of their teens without getting access to their messages, a company spokesperson told The Post.  PREDATORS AT PLAY  April Veneigh, 39, wants other parents to know that young adolescents – like her 12-year-old daughter Kaelyn – can be targeted outside traditional social media giants such as Instagram or TikTok.  Kaelyn, then 11, connected with another user on the online gaming platform Roblox early last year. The chat later moved to Discord, a voice-video-text service where most conversations are private.  The other user claimed he was 14, and started to “groom” Kaelyn, now in the sixth grade, by sending explicit videos and requesting nude photos from her, Veneigh told The Post.  April Veneigh, 39, of King City, Oregon, with her two daughters, Kimberly, 16, and Kaelyn, 12. An online predator recently targeted Veneigh’s younger daughter, she told The Post. Courtesy of April Veneigh  “He claimed he was 14, but was very advanced for a 14-year-old,” said Veneigh, of King City, Oregon. “He got her to think we were abusive and that she could only trust him with everything.”  Veneigh said she noticed changes in Kaelyn’s behavior after she connected with the stranger, including severe anxiety and panic attacks.  That led her to contact her cellphone provider, Verizon, which was able to show the files Kaelyn had been sending, leading to the horrifying discovery that she had been groomed into sending naked images.  Veneigh then called cops, who told her the investigation would include FBI officials since the other user was suspected to be in Wisconsin. No arrests have been so far, she said.  “I’m still waiting to hear back from police and what they find,” Veneigh said.  Veneigh said other parents should regularly check with cellphone providers to find out what files are being sent since all data, including sexual content, is backed up. The “cloud doesn’t lie,” she said.  “You don’t know who is really on the other end of that computer. There are too many face filters. People can be older but make themselves look like a child. It’s scary,” Veneigh continued. “You also don’t know who’s going to be grooming your child.”  The mother of two urged other parents to get their kids away from screens with exercise or running errands.  “I’m embarrassed and ashamed this is happening to my family,” Veneigh said. “It’s so depressing.”  HOW TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM LED TO ANOREXIA  Jon Sayah, 61, of Dallas, said his three children use TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat at least four hours per day. “They’re hooked on social media,” he told The Post.  But three years ago, at the peak of the pandemic, his eldest daughter, Lucy, 20, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, an illness he believes was exacerbated by her social media use.  “She is just getting better now,” Jon told The Post. “Social media provided detailed strategies on eating less, strategic foods to eat, behaviors to avoid the professional check-ins, and most important what her friends were doing and what she was missing or not included.”  Jon Sayah, his wife Julie, and their children (from left) Betsy, 18, Lucy, 20, and Dustin, 13. The couple tried to enforce restricted use of social media, but that only caused more friction, Jon told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Lucy, now a sophomore at Northwestern University, said she wishes she had not become so invested in social media. She first logged onto Instagram at 13, later joining TikTok.  “Social media has caused me to constantly compare myself to others online and has greatly contributed to the onset of my anorexia nervosa,” she said, adding she no longer uses others’ posts to gauge herself.  “I would encourage parents, especially of young teens, to set boundaries with their children on social media use and time spent as it can have an extremely negative and maladaptive impact,” Lucy told The Post.  “Social media does not allow children and young teens to live in the present and instead forces them to view false realities of other individuals’ lives, which has the potential to be harmful.”  Dustin, 13, Betsy, 18, and Lucy, 20, would rather be in front of a screen instead of spending time together as a family because “they’re hooked on social media,” their father told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Sayah’s 13-year-old son, Dustin, has already learned plenty on social media about sex and alcohol – topics normally associated with high schoolers, he said.  “Not sure yet what the impact is of growing up too fast,” said Sayah, who said attempts to restrict and lessen social media usage only caused more drama and tension in the family. Algorithms tailored for young users make them especially vulnerable, possibly triggering harmful behavior that seemingly appears “normal and popular,” he said.  “It is dominating their time and allows them to connect without ‘real connections,’” Sayah said. “It is a substitute for so many other activities.  “Conversations in the car, figuring out how to spend downtime, being creative, being uncomfortable trying to make friends or spending time on passions are all sacrificed when they can ‘kill’ several hours on social media a day during any time.”"

State Rep. Brandon Guffey, 54, told CNN that he got the Instagram message on the day his son Gavin would have turned 18 — and less than a month after he found him dead last year at their family home in Rock Hill.  “It said, ‘Did I tell you your son begged for his life,’ with a laughing face emoji,” Guffey told the outlet.  The sick, tragic crime was behind Guffey introducing “Gavin’s Law,” which was passed by state senators Thursday and is expected to be signed into law soon.  It threatens scammers who extort a minor or an at-risk adult with up to five years in prison for a first offense.  Guffey said he had no idea his son, a recent high school grad, was being blackmailed when he found him dead in the bathroom last July after hearing the loud thump of his body hitting the floor after he shot himself.  The lawmaker only realized 17-year-old son Gavin was being blackmailed after sextortionists started messaging him, too. Facebook / Gavin âGoopâ Guffey Remembrance  “My initial thought was, this is my fault — I left the gun out,” he said, adding he will never forget the pain of realizing his son died by suicide.  The sick plot emerged in part after the sextortionists started barraging Guffey and his family — including his younger son, Coen, 16 — with Instagram messages demanding more money.  They then realized that Gavin thought he was sharing nude photos with a young woman who first sent him pics — only to be told they’d be released to everyone he knew unless he paid blackmail.  The sextortionists started messaging the family of Gavin (here on his graduation day) after his death. Family Handout  Gavin had used Venmo to send the scammers all the money he had: $25.  “He was telling them he would get them more money, please don’t send these images out,” Guffey told CNN.  “They didn’t care.”  The grieving dad said the scammers used disappearing messages to make “kids feel safe” that their intimate pics would be scrubbed.  “What they don’t realize is, someone has another device recording that device,” he said.  “If you can extort 10 teenage boys that aren’t gonna say anything for $100 each, and do all that with one image that you got from a girl, it’s fairly simple.  “And teenage boys, whenever they see they’re getting that attention (from a girl), they’re not necessarily thinking.”  The FBI said that last year there were at least 7,000 reports of sextortion of minors, with at least 3,000 victims, mostly boys. More than a dozen are known to have died by suicide.  The true number may well be way higher because “the shame, fear, and confusion children feel when they are caught in this cycle often prevents them from asking for help or reporting the abuse,” the FBI says.  When Gavin died, his dad was in the middle of his successful run for state representative — and briefly considered quitting to focus on hunting for his son’s scammers.  “My wife said, ‘Absolutely not. You’re one of the few people that have a voice that can get out there and truly make a difference,’” he recalled.  The lawmaker’s wife persuaded him to use his office to help other young victims. Facebook / Brandon Guffey  He stayed in office, with “Gavin’s Law” his first order of business.  “I feel like he (Gavin) would want me trying to save additional kids from ever having to feel the way that he felt at that time,” he said proudly.  An FBI spokesperson told CNN that no arrests have been made in the Guffey case. The rep declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing investigation.

University Boston University  Researchers have uncovered a marker in the brain that could help identify people at a higher risk of suicide.  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  As reported in the paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says lead author Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, assistant professor of psychiatry a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  The researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  The findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting, Jagger-Rickels says.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  The Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health supported the work.

A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  The report, The Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data Summary & Trends Report: 2011–2021, focuses on a decade of research on youth sexual activity, substance use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, violence, poor mental health, unstable housing, school connectedness, and parental monitoring, while also exploring the data by sex, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, and sex of sexual contacts.  CDC data from 2021 showed “significant increases in the percentage of youth who seriously considered suicide, made a suicide plan, and attempted suicide,” and that was true across all demographic categories. It was up to 22% compared to the 2011 report which showed that 15.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 months before the survey. In this latest study, female students were 16% more likely than males to make this consideration, at 30% and 14%, respectively. By race and ethnicity, the youth with the highest rates of ideation were youth identifying as Native American at 27%, followed by youth identifying as multiracial at 24%, youth identifying as white at 23%, youth identifying as Black or Hispanic both at 22%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander at 21%, and youth identifying as Asian at 18%. The rates spiked even higher for youth identifying as LGBTQ+ at 45% compared to 15% among youth identifying as heterosexual. The report noted that nearly 60% of female students and 70% of LGBTQ+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness and that 10% of female students and 20% of LGBTQ+ students had gone as far as attempting suicide.  “As we saw in the 10 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health among students overall continues to worsen, with more than 40% of high school students feeling so sad or helpless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year—a possible indication of the experience of depressive symptoms,” the report stated. That’s 14% higher than 2011.  “Nearly all indicators of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased from 2011 to 2021,” the report noted, although it showed no increase in the number of students treated for suicidal injuries.  Contributors to Instability in Mental Health  While the data showed an overall decrease in bullying and risky behaviors involving sex and substances, and a high level of parental monitoring among most youth, there was plenty of alarming data that could help to account for the continued decline in mental health among female students. For example, in 2021, almost 20% of them reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and 14% had been physically forced to have sex.  Other contributing factors for mental health decline among all students might include unstable housing, not feeling connected at school, and fear of violence. The report notes that a high level of parental monitoring, defined as “parents or other adults in a family most of the time or always knowing where they were going or who they would be with, and school connectedness, which it defines as “the feeling among adolescents that people at their school care about them, their well-being, and their success,” both correlate to decreased sexual risk, substance abuse, experiences with violence, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Overall, only 3% of students had experienced unstable housing, although the rates were disproportionately higher for Black and Native American students, as well as among youth identifying as LGBTQ+ who had any same-sex partners. Overall, 7% of students had been threatened or injured by a weapon at school, down about 3% from 2011 among males and unchanged among females. The percentages decreased among Asian and Hispanic students and there was no change among Blacks and whites. However, LGBTQ+ students were more likely than their peers to be threatened or injured in this scenario. And overall, 9% of students had to go to school in the past 30 days because of fear of violence. The rates in this category were especially high among students identifying as Native Americans at 13%, Black at 12%, Hispanic at 11%, and LGBTQ+ at 14%, and females were 3% more likely to stay home than their male counterparts who reported not going at 7%.  Finally, it’s debatable whether school, the setting where 95% of youth spend their daily lives, was a welcoming and safe environment. While white students felt more connected than any other group at 65%, only 61% of all youth surveyed said they felt close to people at school. Females were even less likely to feel that way at 58% compared to 65% among males. Only 54% of Native American and Black youth felt close to people at school and the numbers were only slightly higher among Hispanic youth at 58%. Meanwhile, only 58% of LGBTQ+ youth felt close to someone at school compared to 65% of their heterosexual counterparts.  Recommendations  “These data make it clear that young people in the U.S. are collectively experiencing a level of distress that calls on us to act,” the report said in its key findings section. “Although the primary goal of school is academic learning, they play a key role in shaping mental, physical, and social growth.”  To address this, the CDC made the following recommendations:  Increase school connectedness across all grades.  Increase access to needed services by improving school-based services and connecting youth and families to community-based sources of care.  Implement greater health education for all grades.  The report also recommended that schools reference the CDC’s What Works in Schools program, an evidence-based approach to the above recommendations that have led to improvements in sexual behavior, substance abuse, violence, and missed school due to safety concerns. It also noted that “schools that implemented policies and practices to support LGBTQ+ youth not only saw improvements in health and well-being for young people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, but also their heterosexual counterparts.”  An Intersectional Perspective  While the ten-year report did not explore the prevalence of these issues at the intersection of race and gender identity, a supplemental study released in April did use unadjusted logistic regression models to explore prevalence across some subgroups from 2019 to 2021. The study, titled Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among High School Students — Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 2021, showed a significant spike in serious consideration of suicide among Black, Hispanic, and white females students. For example, suicide ideation was up 6% among Hispanic females, 6.8% among Black, and 7% among white females, compared to 4.6% among multiracial females, 2.2% among Asian females, and .2% among Native Americans. It also showed a higher increase in suicide attempts requiring medical treatment for multiracial, Black, and Hispanic females, up 3.7%, 1.7%, and 1.1% respectively compared to an increase of .3% among Asian females and .6% among white ones, with no change for Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander females.  While this supplement does not include data on suicidal tendencies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender identity, UnidosUS knows Latinx students identifying as LGBTQ+ already are indeed struggling with mental health and safety issues. According to the 2021 UnidosUS fact sheet Latinx LGBTQ+ Students and Their Experiences, 22% of Latinx students identify as LGBTQ+, 40% have experienced assault and/or harassment due to race or gender orientation, 57% feel unsafe at school due to their gender expression, and 35% are likely to miss school because they feel unsafe there. The fact sheet also notes that 70% of these students experience symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, 64% major depressive disorder, 43% have considered suicide, and 18% have attempted suicide. And a new UnidosUS factsheet on mental health shows that Latino LGBTQ youth are 30% more likely to attempt suicide than non-Latino LGBTQ youth.  “The data shows that youth with intersectional identities, such as students of color who also identify as LGBTQ+ are disproportionately at risk and therefore it is important to recognize their unique experiences in order to equitably address their mental health and offer culturally and linguistically relevant supports and interventions,” says Amalia Chamorro, education policy project director at UnidosUS.  South Florida-based Afro-Latina LGBTQ+ youth human rights advocate Ayari Aguayo says the pandemic contributed to feelings of isolation, as well as exposure to violence and unwanted sexual behavior. She cited societal phenomena such as the hypertextualization of girls of color as contributors to exploitation and low self-esteem, and she fears feelings of sadness and hopelessness are likely to get even worse in a state like Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis has pushed through legislation banning classroom discussions of gender identity and some Black studies curricula, further adding to the fragile mental health of youth who feel further stigmatized.  “It’s all layered with not being in an empowered community, not having the tools, workshops, or the support services,” Aguayo said, adding that during the pandemic, she and her colleagues found they were able to combat these concerns by helping to introduce youth to inspiring characters who had been in similar life situations.  “We brought role models who were courageous and vulnerable, who said, ‘I grew up with abuse and this is how I became resilient, this is what I did to overcome it,’” said Aguayo.  This type of intervention is congruent with CDC study’s goal of maintaining high-quality surveillance systems, conducting, and translating youth supporting scientific research, and helping school systems provide health education for safer, more supportive learning.  In its fact sheets and other policy and advocacy materials, UnidosUS’s policy team encourages schools and districts to fund GSA, ethnic clubs, and staff professional development programs focused on improving mental health and creating diverse and inclusive learning environments. It also urges the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to enforce existing federal laws created to prevent and combat gender and race discrimination. And it also wants to see that same office disaggregate data to reflect multiple identities of students related to race, ethnicity, and gender identity when conducting student-focused research on topics like this one.  A February announcement by the U.S. Department of Education that it had received $188 million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support mental health and student wellness can help schools provide critical and necessary support. UnidosUS supported the passage of this legislation.  “As the President outlined in his State of the Union address, we must do more to tackle our nation’s growing mental health crisis, which is particularly acute among our youth,” Domestic Policy Advisor to the President Susan Rice said in the U.S. Department of Education’s February 16 announcement.  “Mental health and wellness have profound implications for our students, their academic success, and their overall outcomes, and we know that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in that same announcement. “The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act represents an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to supercharge efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students.”"

Some of this comes in the wake of the alarming CDC report released in February showing unprecedented levels of sadness and suicidality, especially in teen girls. Some say social media is to blame for this recent rise in mental health problems, and I remain skeptical.  But before we try to understand what variables might be causing the problem, we should first clarify whether there is, in fact, a problem, and what exactly the problem is. Some of this depends on how we interpret mental health trend data. Is the American adolescent suicide rate at an all-time high? And how do we compare to the rest of the world?  While it is the case that the suicide rate among American teenagers increased over the last 10 to 15 years, if we pull back the lens a bit, things get more complicated. Across recent history, we can see that overall, the teen suicide rate is about the same now as it was in the 1970s. In fact, the suicide rate amongst teen boys was higher in the 1990s than it is now. Following this, it dropped in the late 90s and early 2000s (no one knows why), before rising again in the 2010s. Look for yourself at the CDC data here.  Still, even if teen suicides are lower than last century, it is still alarming to see them rising in recent years. Something is definitely going on. If, for example, we hypothetically found out that cancer or pregnancy death rates were increasing over the past few years, the notion that they had gone down 30 years ago and were now returning to baseline would be cold comfort. But is the recent increase in youth suicide a worldwide phenomenon? The answer appears to be no. In most other countries throughout the world, the suicide rate among adolescents has not increased over the past 10 to 15 years. A paper published in 2020 by a group of researchers from Britain found that the suicide rate amongst teenagers has risen only in Australia, Canada, the UK, and USA. Whereas in France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, Japan and Korea, the teen suicide rate has fallen.  These researchers characterize the four countries with rising teen suicidality as being unique in several ways. These are “populous high-income predominantly English-speaking nations” which also have high levels of economic inequality. These four countries were all in the top five highest for economic inequality (measured by Gini index) out of all the countries studied. Simply put, the people in these countries are “W.E.I.R.D” relative to the rest of the world. The researchers also point out that social media cannot be an explanatory factor for the rise in teen suicides, since all countries studied throughout the world have the same media access as American teenagers do. If social media was the key variable that explains the rise in teen suicide, we’d be seeing comparable rises in most other countries. But we don’t see that in the data.  The study authors also ran analyses examining whether the places with an increase in teen suicides also had a greater increase in social media usage compared to the other countries. They did not find any statistical difference. They also looked at the proportion of young people who used social media for more than one, three, or six hours per day, and it was also not statistically different across those countries. Simply put, social media usage does not appear to be different across the countries with rising vs. flat suicide rates.  If you’re interested in looking at other countries besides those discussed in this research paper, Our World In Data provides a resource based on data from the World Health Organization. The same decrease in adolescent suicides over the past decade can also be found in countries such as New Zealand, Russia, Argentina, India, and Iran. For other countries such as Israel, Cuba, Norway, and Denmark there is virtually no change across this period.  What do all these countries have in common? This is for future research to discover. Some studies show that cultural factors such as strong social norms are a variable that predicts suicide in various countries, but this does not necessarily explain stability or changes in youth suicides across time. It would also be useful to consider specific subpopulations (e.g., young secular girls/women on the political left), to see if there are trends in suicide-related distress occurring in other countries besides America.  One thing does seem clear. The suicide rate among young people is not increasing throughout most countries around the world over the past decade, or even since the year 2000. Furthermore, we cannot blame social media for the rise in suicide among American teenagers. The data simply do not support this conclusion, for the simple reason that teenagers in other countries also have access to the same media that we do. It would be unwise and incorrect to declare that social media usage plays a role in suicidality."

In a place to promote healing, Dr. Emily Bullock offers the space for people to process at her psychotherapy clinic in Woods Cross, Utah.  “All different kinds of traumatic events that people have gone through, sometimes from long ago, sometimes current, sometimes accidents, sometimes sexual trauma, military trauma, things like that,” Bullock explained.  The kinds of therapy found in her clinic include EMDR, assisted psychotherapy, clinical yoga and ketamine.  “Ketamine is used as a tool to help people in their therapy to be able to accomplish whatever their goal is that they’re working on in their treatment,” she said.  She’s seen clients who utilize ketamine as medicine and has found it brings “a lot of hope and promise” to their lives.  “These psychedelic medicines and ketamine specifically — which is the one that’s FDA approved right now — have been incredibly beneficial and impactful for people in their lives when they’re used as a tool to aid them in their recovery or their mental health journeys,” Bullock said.  Something else has been impacting her this week, as those in the psychedelic medicine community talk, discuss and express emotions following what took place at a different clinic over the weekend.  “When you hear about a tragedy like this, it’s very confusing. It’s very distressing,” Bullock said.  Police said Dr. Parth Gandhi died by suicide after shooting and killing his 16-year-old son inside Salt Lake City Psychedelic Therapy and Research Saturday. It’s unknown if any substances were used prior.  Gandhi was known in the healing world for his work with psychedelics, specifically as they relate to autism, concussions, addiction and depression.  “It’s terribly upsetting for everyone in the psychology community in the medical community, in the psychedelic medicine field,” Bullock expressed.  Dr. Scott Allen, a physician and anesthesiologist who runs a psychedelic medicine clinic, knew Gandhi.  “Dr. Gandhi was a fairly influential educator within the psychedelic movement within Utah and sort of nationally to here,” he said. “He led a fairly large training course that a lot of people attended.”  He indicated how the people who are used to helping others are now working themselves to process this terrible event.  “We’re trying to figure out a way going forward in which we can help support each other,” he said.  Allen said they would host their next professional journal club in a couple of weeks and have been discussing ways to support each other’s thoughts, feelings and emotions as they work to take care of other physicians.  “We’ve been discussing ways that we can offer services to people and have a venue for people to kind of talk about what they’re feeling personally,” he said.  He said this one tragic act does not represent the psychedelic medicine community as a whole.  “Psychedelics, in general, tend to promote a lot of feelings of love, of connectedness, oneness with the universe. That’s usually what people experience is, is more love and more compassion for other people, more empathy. That’s usually what we see,” Allen said. “And so, for somebody involved with the psychedelic community, I think it kind of compounds the shock of it because most of us who have engaged with it, we’re like, ‘Wow, these substances make us so loving towards others.'”  Dr. Bullock, who specializes in working with complex trauma and led the Traumatic Stress Response Team in the U.S. Air Force, explained that in horrible traumas like this, it’s normal to experience a range of different emotions, and she talked about how crucial it is to reach out, get support and speak with others.  “It’s so, so important to be able to get take care of yourself and your basic needs following a tragedy,” she said. “But then also, getting the right kind of help and support immediately and thereafter.”  For anyone wanting to reach out for services, Bullock said the Utah Psychological Association is always available and is currently on standby to be able to refer people affected by last weekend’s events to the appropriate agency.  She said anyone in a dangerous or emergency situation should call 911, and there’s also the 988 mental health emergency line. That line will link people to a crisis response center, and they can deploy a team of mental health experts to intervene. The 24/7, free, confidential domestic violence hotline is also at 1-800-897-LINK.  The Utah Psychological Association released the statement below in response to the situation. It explains their sorrow for Gandhi’s daughters, his son’s mother and others close to them, and how they’re ready to help his clients.

Alexandre Baril: “I coined the term suicidism to refer to an oppressive system in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence. Our society is replete with horrific stories of suicidal individuals facing inhumane treatment after expressing their suicidal ideations. The intention is to save their lives at all costs and interventions range from being hospitalized and drugged against their will, to being handcuffed and shot by police, to losing their jobs, to having their parental rights revoked, to even being kicked off university campuses. Thus, suicidal people often remain silent and complete their suicide without reaching out to anyone.”  “Worse, I argue that suicide prevention services do more harm than good. Simply put, suicide prevention often increases deaths by suicide rather than prevents them. This is especially true for marginalized suicidal people such as Indigenous, racialized, homeless, poor, queer, trans, disabled, neurodiverse and Mad individuals, for whom suicide intervention often increases the racist, colonialist, classist, sexist, heterosexist (or homophobic), cisgenderist (or transphobic), ableist and sanist violence they experience. My thesis is that suicidal people are oppressed by suicidism and the oppression they experience remains under-theorized.”  Q: Support for suicidal persons is not working. Please explain why that is.  AB: “Suicide statistics remain relatively stable and have not improved significantly over the past decades. Despite decades of multiple strategies and billions of dollars invested in outreach initiatives, studies show that those most determined to die carry out their suicidal plans without reaching out for help. In sum, our prevention strategies do not work.”  “My work found current prevention services generally fail to connect with suicidal people, who do not feel safe asking for help. This silencing effect, due to suicidist consequences (experiencing forms of harm when revealing suicidal plans) leads suicidal people to not feel supported to share their distress.”  Q: You believe that offering assistance in dying to suicidal patients would better prevent unnecessary deaths. How?  AB: “The most radical idea of my book is to theorize suicide as a positive right that would involve supporting suicidal people in their quest for death through assisted suicide. This support would be delivered through a suicide-affirmative approach. This might save more lives than current prevention strategies.”  “This non-stigmatizing approach would provide suicidal people with the chance to speak freely and to benefit from an accompaniment process to reach an informed decision about their desire to live or die. My approach has the potential to drastically reduce rates of suicidality, particularly among marginalized groups, by opening channels of communication with people who are currently too afraid to reach out for help.”  “Even for the small minority of people who would go ahead with an assisted suicide, they would have a less lonely and violent death and a relational process of dying that would also be less traumatic for family and friends.”  Q: Should this idea ever come to fruition, what kind of impact would you expect to see? How would this influence a person’s suicidal ideation?  AB: “My approach is a radical de-stigmatization of suicidality. Slogans such as ‘Speak Up, Reach Out’ or ‘Let’s Talk’ urge suicidal people to share their distress. But suicide prevention services send a paradoxical message since those who open their hearts often experience harm, forced treatments, and rights violation in the name of care and of saving vulnerable people from themselves, all because suicide is never an option.”  “Through my approach, suicide becomes an option, one that should be carefully thought through within an accompanied process during which various options would be seriously considered to help the person make an informed decision. By removing the suicidist violence suicidal people experience when they share their suicidal ideations and plans, and by supporting the assisted suicide of the person if they determine that this is indeed the best option for them, suicidal people would finally feel safe to speak up, reach out for help and talk about their distress. In my approach, the priority is the suicidal person, not life itself. Instead of completing their suicide without speaking with anyone, they would be accompanied as they contemplate making this crucial decision, weighing all the pros and cons, informing their relatives and family members, and preparing for this passage from life to death.”  Q: Are there examples of this model working elsewhere in the world?  AB: “There has never been a model such as this before. Throughout history, some philosophers, bioethicists and thinkers have promoted the right to die by suicide, but it’s always a negative right. Those in favor of a positive right to die limit this exclusively to the context of assisted death in the case of disability/sickness/illness.”  “My work questions why we offer assistance in dying to people who, in the vast majority of cases, don’t want to die and ask for better living conditions. And those who do want to die, such as suicidal people, are denied any assistance and are forced to die alone in atrocious conditions. If such an idea was adopted, it would lead to a completely different social, political, and legal landscape than the one we are used to. This is an out-of-the-box idea, which invites us to radically rethink both our perspectives on suicide and assisted suicide.”  Q: The inspiration comes from the support that transgender persons receive. Please elaborate on this parallel.  AB: “The positive right to assisted suicide for suicidal people may be new, but my suicide-affirmative approach is inspired by trans-affirmative approaches to rethink the care offered to trans people – not based on forms of control and gatekeeping – but to support their autonomy. My suicide-affirmative approach is anchored in self-determination, informed consent, and harm reduction. Instead of trying to cure trans people of their transness or suicidal people of their suicidality, we develop safer spaces in which we can examine their suicidality with them and discuss a variety of options.“  “A shift from prevention to accompaniment would empower suicidal people. Similarly to a trans-affirmative approach, the suicide-affirmative approach offers care and support through an informed consent model, taking for granted that the expert in the decision to transition—in this case, from life to death—is the person making the decision.”  “Regarding the theorization of suicidism and the rights and recognition of suicidal people, we are currently where trans people were regarding trans rights and recognition in the 1930s. Indeed, everything needs to be imagined, theorized, and transformed, as was the case for trans people several decades ago when transitioning was not even an option. My work constitutes a first step in this direction; it allows us to open our hearts and imaginations regarding the possibility of envisioning suicide and assisted suicide from a different point of view, from the standpoint of suicidal people.”  Baril, Alexandre.

It depicts a daughter having brave conversations with her father as she recognizes in him common warning signs of suicide. The PSA ends with the daughter asking her father directly about suicide, bringing him back from the shadows and into the light. Its message is clear: we can't begin to address suicide if we don't take the first step and start the conversation.  ""In the past several years, we have made tremendous progress in our openness surrounding mental health. However, many people are still unsure about what to do when someone they know is struggling with their mental health,"" said AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia. ""Our campaign is a powerful reminder that we all have the ability to help.""  ""I have experienced loss from suicide, so our work on this is incredibly meaningful to me,"" said TBWA\Chiat\Day New York Chief Creative Officer Amy Ferguson. ""To partner with AFSP and put the talent and efforts of our agency to use on such an important issue is so incredibly rewarding.""  AFSP will be hosting a virtual event on its Instagram channel with experts at 4 p.m. ET on May 16 to discuss best practices for having important mental health conversations with loved ones. The PSA will appear nationwide across broadcast, digital, social, and print and it connects with Spanish-speaking communities, offering translated resources.

""When someone is in a vulnerable situation, it can be difficult to put this experience into words and know what to say to ask for help,"" says(Opens in a new window) Dr. Megan Jones Bell, director of consumer and mental health at Google.  Starting soon in the US, those who search for suicide-related terms will see conversation starters below the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. ""If you're struggling, it's OK to share your feelings. Use these messages as a starting point to send to a trusted contact or suicide hotline,"" the page says.  Available messages range from ""I'm struggling right now and just need to talk to someone—can we chat?"" to ""When you get a chance can you contact me? I feel alone and suicidal, and could use some urgent support.""  Developed in partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention, these prompts aim to reduce the stigma of reaching out for help, which, according to Jones Bell, can help people get support when in crisis.  ""People often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments,"" she says. ""In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on."" It's unclear if the prompts will show up on the desktop, given the text message component.  Google-owned YouTube, meanwhile, recently updated its approach to eating disorder-related content, removing videos that show or describe certain behaviors and adding age restrictions to recovery-based clips. A crisis resource panel also appears under related videos and search results to reach more people.  ""If you or a loved one are experiencing a mental health crisis, there are resources available to help from Google and many other trustworthy organizations,"" Jones Bell says."

On Monday, the company said it will soon display messages that people searching about suicide could use to ask for help. Based on specific templates, the prewritten messages will contain different requests to speak or chat with a friend, family member, or other trusted contact.  If you need help, visit: The International Association for Suicide Prevention  The idea behind Google's initiative is that a person thinking of suicide might run an online search looking for answers or guidance or information, especially if they don't know where else to turn. In that case, the person might not even know how to describe what's wrong or why they're having suicidal thoughts. And they may be reluctant or embarrassed to contact a friend or family member directly.  Designed to remove some of the difficulty and stigma involved in reaching out to another person, the messages will offer direct requests such as the following:  Also: Is ChatGPT an effective therapy alternative? 80% of this study's participants thought so  ""I'm struggling right now and just need to talk to someone—can we chat?""  ""This is really hard for me to say but I'm having painful thoughts and it might help to talk. Are you free?""  ""I don't want to die but I don't know how to live. Talking with you may help me feel safe. Are you free right now?""  The person could choose the message that best expresses their feelings and thoughts and then text it directly to a loved one, who hopefully will be able to intervene and provide aid and comfort to that person.  The pre-written messages were developed by Google in partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention. But this isn't the first time Google has made an attempt to help individuals thinking of suicide.  For several years, suicide prevention information has been available at the top of relevant search results. Last year in the US, the company updated this information to display the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of state and local call centers from the US Department of Health.  A 2022 survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 90% of the people polled felt that the US is facing a huge mental health crisis. On its end, Google said that searches for ""mental health crisis"" have risen each year. In this environment, people in crisis need easier access to mental health resources and to friends and family members for support.  Also: Generative AI could lower drug prices. Here's how  ""People often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments,"" Dr. Megan Jones Bell, Director of Consumer and Mental Health at Google, said in a blog post. ""In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on.""  Google has also directed certain resources to teenagers and young adults. For people in the 10-34 age group, suicide is the second leading cause of death, according to the CDC. In response, the company offers crisis support resource panels on YouTube to help young people connect with live crisis professionals for suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. To address that last issue, Google has started to remove content from YouTube that shows or promotes eating disorders such as binging and purging."

It will recommend appropriate action if the allegations are found to be true after a police investigation.  Commission chairperson Leena Gangopadhyay told PTI it has spoken to all concerned, including the complainant – a woman student residing in a state-run Kazi Nazrul University hostel near Asansol on Saturday. The members of the commission recommended to the police that all the points referred to in the woman's complaint, including the alleged life threat sent to her by the accused via SMS, be examined.  Gangopadhyay said the commission received a complaint from the post-graduate student that the accused had raped her at her cabin at a private hospital where she had been admitted after her “death by suicide attempt” as their relationship had turned sour. ""Apart from our members who had met her personally, I have interacted with her more than once over the phone and heard her views.  ""We have also been informed by her that when she lodged a complaint with the police, she got a threat via SMS allegedly from the professor. We know that the accused was arrested and then got bail. We have nothing to comment about the judicial process but will ensure that the complaints are investigated thoroughly by the police. If the charges are found to be true, the accused should be punished as per law,"" Gangopadhyay said.  ""The commission has spoken to all stakeholders to arrive at the truth, she said. There are some inconsistencies in the alleged incident of rape at the nursing home and the claims of the university authorities,"" the chairperson of the commission said.  ""We want to ensure the security of the girl student. We have sent certain recommendations to the police and university to see that no physical harm is done to her,"" she said. A Bangladesh Deputy High Commission spokesperson said ""We have received an official complaint from the student. We have forwarded the same to the university authorities and the police urging them to look into the issue, examine the complaint and take suitable action.""  A university spokesperson told PTI that the student concerned has 18 months left to complete the course. He said the university will extend all cooperation to the investigating authorities and take appropriate action if the charges are proven correct. ""As of now we don't have anything else to comment on the alleged incident,"" he said. The name of the accused, who got anticipatory bail after lodging the complaint last week, was withheld as investigations were on."

Gujarat BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama. (File Photo)  As per the complaint lodged by Chag’s son Hitarth Chag at Veraval police station, his father had lent about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.75 crore to Naran Chudasama who wanted it for his business. On being asked to return the money, Chudasama and his son refused to do so and had threatened to kill the complainant and his father, as per the complaint. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.  The FIR is filed under IPC Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  Dr Chag, 59, who is also a philanthropist in the coastal town of Veraval, was found hanging at his residence with a suicide note beside him on February 12.  The one-line suicide note written in Gujarati blamed Rajesh Chudasama and Naran Chudasama for his death. Hitarth alleged that the names mentioned in the suicide note are Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh-Gir Somnath and Naran Chudasama is his father.  On February 17, Hitarth lodged a complaint with Veraval police, demanding that the MP and his father be held accountable for his father’s suicide.  As the police did not immediately register an FIR against the MP and his father based on Hitarth’s application, he approached the Gujarat high court in March.  In his plea he alleged that police had acted in contempt of the Supreme Court’s Lalita Kumari judgment by refusing to lodge an FIR in the case. The SC judgment lays guidelines for registering FIRs in cognizable offences and prescribes a time-bound inquiry for non-cognizable ones.  The petition was disposed of by the court earlier this month on the grounds that the appropriate forum should address the grievance."

The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said. (Representational Image/Getty Images)  Police said that the student was depressed after learning of her poor performance in the board exams, the result for which was announced on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) GS Sidhu said that the student had left a suicide note saying she was upset over the result and had walked out of her home on Friday. Police did not clarify how far away the drain was from the victim’s house, but said it was in the same neighbourhood.  “We have not found any foul play behind the death so far,” the officer added.  The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said.  DCP Sidhu said that the girl was dejected. Her parents said that around 3.30pm, she quietly walked out of her home and it was only later that they discovered the suicide note written by her, after which they approached the police at around 9.30pm, police said.  “We launched an extensive search operation to find her. We also took all other legal steps to trace her by informing the police control room (PCR) and flashed wireless messages to all the station house officers in Delhi and all the deputy commissioners of police by describing the student. The details of the missing girl were also uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet) but we got no response,” said the officer.  On Sunday morning, police received a call about the partly submerged body of a girl being found in a drain. “The body was taken out from the drain with the help of locals and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. She was soon identified as the missing victim by her father,” said the DCP.  Since there was no indication of foul play, the police initiated proceedings under the CrPC instead of registering an FIR.  This is the third known case of a student dying by suicide in the Capital due to performance issues in the Class 12 board exam since Friday. In the first instance, a 19-year-old woman student died in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri after failing. In the second case, a 16-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar hanged herself to death after scoring 75%, which was lesser than what she had hoped.  A senior official from the Directorate of Education said that the department offers a helpline to students where they can reach out for counselling. “Students can call up the Yuva helpline and get in touch with education and vocational guidance counsellors on the toll-free helpline.

The charity has temporarily removed mascot Pudsey’s eye covering to show “not all of the challenges that children and young people may be facing are visible”, the broadcaster said.  The campaign encourages conversations between children and parents, carers and other trusted adults “to ensure no child faces their emotional and mental health challenges alone”.  Behind The Bandana ambassador Dr Alex George (BBC/PA)  Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, who has campaigned for better mental health after the death of his 19-year-old brother Llyr by suicide in 2020, has been named Behind The Bandana ambassador.  He said: “I know how important early intervention is in helping make a difference to the emotional wellbeing of children and young people and so I am very proud to be the ambassador of such a powerful campaign that really shines a light on the mental health crisis we are facing.  “As highlighted by Pudsey bear himself, mental health issues can be less visible on the outside, but conversations and positive relationships really can help.”  As part of the campaign, Children In Need has released the findings of a new Censuswide survey shedding light on how comfortable children feel when asking for help with their feelings and how often they feel the need to put on their “metaphorical bandana” and hide their emotions.  While nine in 10 parents surveyed said they talk to their child about their mental health at least once a month, more than a quarter of young people surveyed said they had not talked to someone they trust about their mental health in the last six months.  Children In Need’s boss Simon Antrobus said: “This research is a clear indication that our Behind The Bandana campaign is urgently needed.  “What’s also clear is that we can all play a role in addressing early signs of worry and anxiety by showing children and young people that we’re here to listen and to support them.  “By recognising and acknowledging that some feelings of worry and anxiety can be hidden means early conversations, sensitively delivered with kindness and empathy, can make a real difference to a child’s wellbeing and can help prevent mental health problems from becoming embedded.”"

Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney at just 17 to chase a contract in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns throughout a rollercoaster career that almost broke him in more ways than one.  The 28-year-old spent seasons on the sidelines battling a foot injury that left his chances of running again uncertain and his playing career in freefall.  A product of a tough upbringing, Brown struggled when he moved to Australia and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide.  While playing with Cronulla at age 19, Brown says he felt isolated and disconnected from everyone.  Bulldogs backrower Fa'amanu Brown pictured with his mother who passed away in 2020  Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney to play in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns that almost broke him in more ways than one  'I went and signed papers at Cronulla Leagues Club … and I was, like, 'Man, I'm done. I want to go home or else I'm going to commit suicide',' he told ABC News.  And one night when the pressure became unbearable, Brown swam out into the ocean as far he could.  'God, if you're going to take me, take me now because, man, I'm done,' he recalled thinking at the time.  'But, for some reason, I floated on my back, swimming backwards back to the shore … I remember just crying,' he said.  Brown spoke to his mother afterwards and she encouraged him to be strong.  The young footy star started earning big bucks with the Sharks, but without proper guidance Brown soon developed a gambling problem.  'I ended up becoming broke. I went through a gambling phase. There was a point where I had to ask [the club to be paid] in an advance,' he admits.  It was his mother's cancer diagnosis that finally made him pull himself together and became the defining moment of his life.  Brown struggled when he moved to Australia to play footy and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide  Brown (pictured with his partner) started earning a large wage with the Sharks, but without proper guidance the youngster soon developed a gambling problem  'There was a time where Mum was going to be put into a rest home, where people look after them until they pass, or we had an option where me and my brothers look after our mum,' he explained.  Brown thought a care home would be the best idea, but his brothers talked him out of it.  'But my brothers know the Samoan way more than me … My older brothers said: 'Trust me, you'll understand once you start looking after her.'  'This beats my NRL debut, making whatever money … I don't think getting married will top this.'  In a social media post from 2020, the footy star detailed how he was feeling while looking after his dying mother.  Brown says his mother's cancer diagnosis pulled him together and became the defining moment of his life  Brown thought about putting his mum in a care facility for her final days, but was glad he spent the time with her instead  'What I've learnt through my relationship with mum is there's no point in holding grudges towards others,' he wrote.  'Life is too short to darken your heart. Every time you say goodbye to your loved ones that could be the last time you will hear or see them. Now she is sick, I regret so many things.  'I should've would've could've but i know it's made me who i am today. Realise before it's too late.  'Everyday embrace your loved ones. Tell them you love them. Say it sincerely. Record memories. Be present. Say sorry. Talk it out. Continue to love & forgive even when it hurts.'"
