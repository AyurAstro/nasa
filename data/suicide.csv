"suicide","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:09:00","Max Liu: ‘Britain’s answer to Hunter S Thompson is fizzling out into fear and loathing’ (Photo: Getty Images Europe)  My first thought on reading Will Self’s 2,300-word diatribe about Adrian Chiles was: where did it all go wrong for a writer who was once considered one of the most ambitious and original of his generation?  Self takes issue with Chiles’s Guardian column, which has acquired a cult following, and attributes its success to his relationship with the paper’s editor, Katherine Viner. He also speculates at length about Chiles’s penis.  Self criticises Viner’s editorship but she would have done a much better job than whoever ushered this self-indulgent mess into the New European – although no amount of editing could have saved such a silly piece.  It has been shared widely on social media by people appalled by its puerility, misogyny and colons. But I wonder how many actually made it to the end. It took me a few attempts to get past the multi-clause sentences, digressions and general lack of focus. But I got there eventually, so you don’t have to.  Readers of Self’s fiction have always needed powers of endurance. I tried to read his novella Cock and Bull on a coach from Leeds to Cornwall but had to put it aside around Leicester because I felt like my head was going to fall off and roll down the aisle.  His journalism, however, used to be a pleasure. His “Real Meals” column in The New Statesman was a must and, as a cultural critic, he could enliven any subject whether it be politics, pasties or Alain de Botton (“Alain de Bum-Bum”, as Self dubbed the philosopher in another example of his childish sense of humour).  Self’s capacity to divide readers used to make his work exciting, but reactions to his piece about Chiles have been unanimously negative. It feels desperate and reminded me of his son Luther Self’s tweet from 2018 about his father’s habit of declaring the death of the novel: “He’s a novelist who hasn’t sold any of his last two books so he assumes that the whole medium is dying.”  Is Self’s column about Chiles an attempt at committing professional suicide? Certainly, the chances of him writing for The Guardian again look slim, but the sloppiness of the piece suggests a general weariness.  Clarity has rarely been Self’s forte, but here his prose is incontinent, veering all over the place to critique Chiles’s column, pontificate about his relationship with Viner and tell us about the time Self went for a “clap test”.  Self’s maximalist style previously set him apart from his peers and had readers looking up the meanings of words such as “matitudinal” and “phlogiston”. It was often worth the trouble and he was hailed as Britain’s answer to Hunter S Thompson due to their shared enthusiasm for long sentences and drugs. After he died, Thompson’s ashes were fired from a canon but, on the basis of his piece on Chiles, Self’s career is fizzling out into fear and loathing in south London.  Self, who once said his own face resembled “a bag full of genitals”, wants you to find his fixation on Chiles’s penis deranged, as he refers to “Chiles lightly holding his guttering cock” and exclaims, bizarrely: “O! How your cock, Chiles, leavens this heavy dough of unwanted concupiscence!” But this stuff is just daft and made me feel both embarrassed for a writer who thought this was worth filing to his editor and impatient for it to be over.  There is a part about circumcision which, to put it mildly, crosses the boundary that separates the strange from the downright weird.  No doubt Self thinks his critics humourless, but that is often the last defence of the unfunny. He claims Chiles’s columns are dull, but perhaps he is jealous of their popularity. Chiles’s writing is clear, understated, surprising – the opposite of Self’s overbearing and congested bilge. Self, who says he only read two of Chiles’s columns, calls one an “advertisement for himself”. He’d know.  Self accuses Chiles of having an “engorged sense of entitlement”, which is surely an act of Self-parody too far. He knows that is what he displays in banging on so long and impenetrably about, well… what exactly? Self’s column is not really about Chiles – its true subject is Will Self. “Why would someone do that, and why would they write about it for a daily newspaper?” Self asks his reader. My thoughts exactly.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvb3Bpbmlvbi93aWxsLXNlbGZzLWNvbHVtbi1hYm91dC1hZHJpYW4tY2hpbGVzLWlzLWFuLWFjdC1vZi1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtc3VpY2lkZS0yMzUzMzUx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Quitman"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:05:53","If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.  Georgians living in rural communities continue to call into the national suicide prevention hotline at higher rates than other parts of the state as the one-year anniversary of the rollout of 988 approaches.  But there’s another alarming statistic causing concern in recent years about Georgia’s rural areas: The suicide rate increased even as the overall rate declined.  “We know the challenge in rural Georgia – and across really rural America – is a lack of access,” said Kevin Tanner, commissioner of the state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities.  “Many parts of our state are having to drive well over an hour to access care and services. We also know that stigma is much higher in rural parts of our state,” he said.  Tanner, a former Republican lawmaker who became commissioner late last year, called 988 a “catalyst” for reducing stigma. This July will mark the one-year anniversary of the national three-digit dialing code’s launch.  Georgia has an advantage over other states that are building call intake centers from scratch. The Georgia Crisis and Access Line, where 988 calls go, was established in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to assist evacuees.  The state is also seen as a leader when it comes to its mobile crisis program, which sends trained mental health professionals out across the state. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency overseeing 988, held a town hall event in downtown Atlanta Friday to spotlight Georgia, holding it up as a model.  “This state is a star, and this state is one that should be lifted up as an example – and it already is,” Monica Johnson, director of the federal 988 and Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office, said at the event.  But the attention comes as the state agency responsible for the crisis call center was dealt a setback earlier this month when Gov. Brian Kemp rejected a $2.3 million funding increase for additional support to manage the ongoing rollout. Kemp also nixed extra salary bumps for mental health professionals.  Those cuts were part of a long list of line items in the budget that Kemp struck down across several agencies as concerns about future state revenues grow. Revenues dropped 16.5% last month, but overall tax collections remained up slightly – 0.9% – for the year.  “Call volume has not increased to a level requiring additional administrative support over existing levels,” Kemp wrote.  Other funding increases for 988 survived, including the $6.2 million the governor originally proposed for mobile crisis teams that are part of the services someone who calls the hotline may receive.  The calls to Georgia’s crisis center have increased by about 12%. But a federal estimate projects those calls will double once the new three-digit number is promoted through a marketing campaign, which is coming later.  “There’s some folks who may be skeptical of those numbers,” Tanner told reporters Friday. “We want to be very careful that we lay out a very clear, distinct plan about what we expect to see in Georgia, and we don’t just base it on maybe national data.”  To test what impact intensive marketing may have on call volume in Georgia, Tanner said his agency is planning a monthlong marketing campaign this summer in two mid-sized communities. The results may help justify future budget requests, he said.  Harper: ‘It takes care of the rest of us as well’  Things aren’t getting any easier in rural communities, particularly for farmers.  Inflation has made already rising input costs higher, causing ag producers to spend more to earn less as they put in long hours at tasks that often risk physical injuries. And their income depends on the whims of the market, crop-killing diseases and pests, and, of course, the weather. Just recently, a late freeze devastated Georgia peach crops.  But seeking help to deal with stress does not tend to come naturally in a profession where farmers are hard-wired to be self-sufficient, says Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper.  “They go to work every day with one thing in mind and focus on doing the job that they feel they’ve been called to do, and they do a phenomenal job at it,” Harper, who is also a farmer, said in an interview as part of mental health awareness month.  “But at the same time, I think – as those of us in this arena – that’s part of our weakness, too. Because whenever we are presented with a problem, we always try to find a way to fix it ourselves first.”  Harper, a Republican who was elected commissioner last fall, said he is working to increase his agency’s focus on mental health awareness. Harper pointed to a survey that yielded troubling results last year.  Nearly 30% of farmers reported thinking of dying by suicide at least once a month, according to the report produced by the Georgia Rural Health Innovation Center at Mercer University School of Medicine.  And 42% of all farmers have thought about dying by suicide at least once in the past 12 months, according to the report.  Among first-generation farmers, 61% said they had thought about dying by suicide in the last year.  “What happens so often is that person bottles up their emotions until they can’t do that anymore, and that’s what we’re seeing in our agricultural community,” said Tanner, who owns a poultry farm.  Harper’s department has been promoting the hotline and other mental health resources as a way of encouraging farmers to reach out for help.  “By asking for help, you’re better able to take care of yourself, you’re better able to keep your nose to the grind, you’re better able to be self-sustaining and support your family, which in turn takes care of our state and takes care of our economy. It takes care of the rest of us as well,” Harper said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VvcmdpYXJlY29yZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3J1cmFsLWdlb3JnaWEtc3RpbGwtZGlhbGluZy05ODgtYXQtaGlnaGVyLXJhdGVzLWFzLWNhbGxzLWluY3JlYXNlLTEyLW92ZXJhbGwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2020-09-26","15:00:00","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T04:14:11","Washington [US]: Teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to commit suicide, and as boys become men, they are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. After years on the frontline of teaching and observing, first-hand, a decline in teenage mental health, a teacher has warned that we need to deal better with male anger, friendships, and attitudes towards sex in order to combat the male suicide crisis.  Official statistics for England, Scotland, and Wales show that in 2020, 264 people aged 10-19 died by suicide - 72% of these were boys. In England, suicide is the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45. They are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. While statistics surrounding male suicide paint a bleak picture of the future of boys in our schools, teacher Matt Pinkett thinks all is not lost.  What can be done? Pinkett has gathered evidence from teachers and school staff, wellbeing experts and therapists to create a powerful guide to helping boys, in Boys Do Cry, released next month. The practical and engaging guide, backed up by the latest research from the fields of psychology and education, suggests that teachers must stop stigmatising anger and instead help angry boys understand the neurological and physiological reasons for their feelings.  Pinkett says: ""Anger isn't an inherently bad thing and telling boys it is just leads to shame and hiding away. Instead, how about we teach them that anger is a feeling as natural as joy or sadness, and give them ways to manage it and the words to talk about it?"" He also suggests that teachers need to make loving, male relationships the norm, and to assume that every social interaction that takes place in a classroom is being watched and internalised.  He advises male teachers to compliment male colleagues openly, to talk lovingly about other people, and praise and salute male emotional vulnerability wherever and whenever possible. ""I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists - that would never work,"" Pinkett explains, ""but the fact is that we are in front of these children for massive chunks of their life. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing.""  Also read: Men deserve 'Tender Loving Care' too!  Talking isn't enough: In Boys Do Cry, Pinkett advocates the benefits of the 'bromance', suggesting that teachers and schools harness this relatively recent phenomenon of male-to-male relationships. He argues that in teaching boys about bromances, teachers can equip young men with the skills to actively listen and display compassion and affection towards each other.  He suggests teachers can help facilitate emotional connection between boys and help build friendships that are supportive. He explains: ""The problem isn't encouraging young men to talk - it's teaching their peers to listen. Research suggests boys don't listen as well as girls. There is so much conversation about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through listening effectively?""  Demonstrated through research and case studies, Pinkett argues that boys crave emotional intimacy and the freedom to express themselves without being mocked, but that toxic ideas about masculinity are preventing these fruitful peer relationships. ""We need to teach boys to be kind, and that it is OK to be vulnerable and emotionally articulate,"" he says.  Benefit to society: With his research-backed tools and tips, Pinkett hopes the book will give teachers confidence to engage with really difficult topics - to the benefit of all. ""This isn't just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to get rid of those harmful and outdated expectations of what it means to be a man, all of society will be better off,"" Pinkett says. ""It is only through education of young people that the scourge of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.""  Boys Do Cry examines key research on factors impacting boys' mental health, including topics such as body image, pornography and self-harm, and provides teachers with practical strategies to start enacting positive change. With his extensive research, he has created advice on intervening when a child may be in danger, to tips on how to set up group working so friendships can be made while learning. ""This isn't about turning teachers into therapists,"" Pinkett adds, ""It's just about being brave enough to intervene and give boys a chance to learn another way of being.""

Every Life Matters is launching a suicide alertness training called 'Orange Button' to work with Ormsgill residents to explore the role that communities can play in a grassroots approach to suicide prevention.  The Orange Button Community pilot launched in Ormsgill (Image: Every Life Matters)  This 3.5-hour training session is aimed at anyone who wants to understand more about suicide, how to know when someone may be having thoughts of suicide, how to talk directly and comfortably about suicide, and what we can all do to offer practical support.  Trained volunteers will be able to signal to anyone struggling with their mental health that they are suicide aware and ready to listen.  Shaun Blezard, Suicide Safer Communities Coordinator of Every Life Matters, said: ""There is a lot of work to be done in Barrow and Cumbria. Barrow is twice the average of death by suicides, and it is the fifth highest suicide rate by district in England.  ""People don't have to be afraid to look after their friends and family. Ask directly if you are worried about someone, and don't be afraid to ask twice.  ""One of the big things with mental health is the stigma of not wanting to come forward and admit that you have a problem. Mental health problems and suicide are things that should be looked at as just another health issue.  ""Companies are getting more inclined to treat mental health seriously and that is one of the things we are pushing with our organisation.""

"suicide","2022-07-12","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T00:00:00","  Number of Persons in Indian Country Jails Increases for Second Year  The Bureau of Justice Statistics is announcing the release of Jails in Indian Country, 2022. A total of 2,250 persons were held in 80 Indian country jails at midyear 2022, a 3% increase from the 2,180 persons held in 80 facilities at midyear 2021. This marks the second consecutive annual increase in the midyear jail population since it peaked in 2019 (at 2,890 persons) and declined rapidly in 2020 (to 2,020 persons) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Indian country jails admitted 5,570 persons during June 2022, which was a 4% decline from 5,780 admissions in June 2021. Over the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022, the number of admissions dropped 55%, from 12,500 admissions in 2012.  “It is noteworthy that the number of admissions is sizably smaller in 2022 compared to 2012. Yet, the percentage of persons held for violent offenses has increased by over a third during the same period,” said Dr. Alexis Piquero, Director of BJS.  During the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022, the number of persons held for violent offenses increased 34%, from 710 to 950 inmates. The largest absolute growth was among persons held for aggravated or simple assault, from 200 inmates at midyear 2012 to 330 at midyear 2022. The percentage held for domestic violence increased from 14% at midyear 2012 to 18% at midyear 2022.  Overall, about 58% of all persons in Indian country jails at midyear 2022 were held for a nonviolent offense, down from 70% at midyear 2012. From 2012 to 2022, the share of inmates held for a drug offense increased from 5% to 11%.  Four persons died (3 by suicide) and 46 attempted suicide while being held in Indian country jails during the 12 months ending on June 30, 2022. Indian country jails reported a total of 24 deaths (9 by suicide) and 375 attempted suicides in custody from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2022.  “BJS remains one of the few agencies to report on crime and justice data in Indian Country, helping to bring attention to an important but often overlooked segment of justice data,” continued Dr. Piquero.

At least four inmates died and 46 others attempted suicide from July 2021 through June 2022, according to the report by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. Three of the four deaths were from suicide. The report did not disclose the cause of the other death.  It is the most yearly deaths and attempted suicides recorded by the BJS since 2016. The number of attempted suicides nearly doubled from 2021, according to the study, which also found that more than half of all the inmates who were held in the jails during that same time period were never convicted of a crime.  The 15-page report also found that some of the beleaguered jails continued to wrestle with overcrowding and staff retention. At least six facilities faced chronic overcrowding and the number of correctional officers dropped by nearly 20% between 2019 and 2022 – a loss of 250 employees.  ""It's always saddening to see reports like this one, especially just a year after the Department of Interior promised to work on solving these issues,"" said Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. The committee provides oversight of the BIA, an agency of the Interior Department. ""Tragedies like these certainly warrant more investigation.""  The study, done annually, surveyed all 80 jails in Indian Country. Jail officials, who self-report the information, are not required to participate. Six jails did not, according to BJS.  Reforms were announced back in 2022, following investigation  In February 2022, the BIA announced more than two dozen reforms aimed at ""protecting the rights, dignity and safety of those in custody."" The proposed changes included beefing up staff training, improving recruitment and retention, and doing better ""interagency coordination with federal partners"" to guarantee that inmates are safe and hold correctional officers accountable.  It came on the heels of an investigation by NPR and the Mountain West News Bureau in June 2021 that found a pattern of misconduct, mistreatment and neglect that led to at least 19 in-custody deaths since 2016. Many of the victims had been arrested for minor infractions. BIA officials knew about the problems for years, the investigation found.  The examination by NPR and Mountain West News Bureau also revealed that many of the deaths occurred after correctional officers failed to provide proper and timely medical care, and that poor staff training led to several inmate deaths that could have been prevented. Officials have called the tribal jails program a ""national disgrace.""  Interior Department spokesperson Tyler Cherry acknowledged on Thursday that the BIA's corrections program has been ""under-resourced"" for decades, but said most of the reforms promised in 2022 have been implemented.  When asked, Cherry would not say which specific reforms have been put in place or are still being implemented.  ""The BIA will continue its work to reform the corrections system in Indian Country with available resources,"" he said in a statement.  Cherry pointed out that attrition rates within the BIA's law enforcement and corrections programs have declined by half since May 2022, but did not elaborate.  The agency is also working to boost salaries of BIA law enforcement, including correctional and police officers. A bipartisan bill – the Strengthening Tribal Law Enforcement Act – was introduced in the Senate earlier this year, which would allow the BIA to increase the minimum pay for law enforcement officers. Starting pay for agency cops currently is $46,000; correctional officers start at around $40,000. Cherry said that pay could increase by as much as $30,000.  Members of Congress say the findings are 'troubling' and call for accountability  Friday's report comes nearly a month after an Interior Department inspector general investigation found significant health and safety issues at three tribal detention centers in the Southwest. One facility on the San Carlos Reservation in southeastern Arizona had leaky plumbing, broken lights and, most significantly, a broken air conditioning unit in the female detention pod. Temperatures regularly hover above 100 degrees in the summer on the reservation. Staff at another jail told investigators they fear that their building could collapse due to severe structural issues, including falling cinder blocks.  The IG investigation also found that, in some cases, BIA building officials ignored these issues and rated the facility conditions as ""good.""  ""Several of these issues appear to have been exacerbated due to inaction over time and will likely require more funding and effort to repair than if they had been addressed in a timely fashion,"" according to the IG investigation.  Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, described the jail conditions as ""deplorable.""  ""This is not only a funding problem but also an accountability problem; we need to do more to address it,"" he said in a statement to NPR. ""No person should be subjected to these conditions, incarcerated or not.""  Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), called the reports ""deeply troubling.""  ""I'll be working with my colleagues to hold the BIA accountable and find a legislative fix,"" Tester told NPR.  Merkley and Tester successfully spearheaded an effort in December to appropriate $22.6 million to increase funding for the jails program.  During a budget hearing last week, Bryan Newland, the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, told Merkley's subcommittee that his agency is requesting more funding for maintenance and operations at the detention centers.  ""I think it's been well-documented – our jails across the BIA system are in poor condition,"" Newland said. ""We've also come up with an ability to rank them to prioritize which ones should be replaced, but we need the dollars to do that and to make sure the people in our care and custody get the treatment they're entitled to.""  The Bureau of Indian Affairs is asking lawmakers for a $62.1 million increase in funding for its public safety division, which includes jails and staffing  ""There is plenty of blame to go around on how we ended up in this situation, and these problems have been festering for decades,"" Merkley said. ""We must strengthen accountability and invest in staffing and infrastructure. Lives are at stake.""

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T00:35:04","It is “not fiction” to suggest that many vulnerable people would be pressured to end their lives if the UK legalised assisted suicide, a senior columnist has said.  Writing in The Times, columnist and former editor of The Sunday Telegraph Dominic Lawson said that the film Plan 75 “confronts its audience with a disturbingly realistic glimpse of a morally bleak future”, which could come to pass in the UK.  The film sees a future Japanese government instigating ‘Plan 75’ to manage its ageing population, where over 75-year-olds can be killed by euthanasia in exchange for $1,000 to be used by either themselves or their family.  ‘Far from impossible’  Lawson commented: “I have been concerned for many years about how an ‘assisted dying’ law in this country might affect the disabled — and attitudes towards them.”  A state-sanctioned solution like Plan 75 is far from impossible in a country that is growing ever more intolerant to socially weak people: the elderly, the disabled and the people who have no money. Chie Hayakawa  He highlighted that his youngest daughter, who has Down’s syndrome, is “highly suggestible, which in this context is a great worry”.  Chie Hayakawa, Plan 75’s co-writer and director, told The Guardian: “A state-sanctioned solution like Plan 75 is far from impossible in a country that is growing ever more intolerant to socially weak people: the elderly, the disabled and the people who have no money.”  ‘Image of God’  Rhys Curnow, Senior Researcher at The Christian Institute, said: “Assisted suicide campaigners will not like the chilling portrayal of incentivised euthanasia in Plan 75. While the film may be fictional, it has an important lesson to teach us.  “When a society accepts assisted suicide or euthanasia, it is denying the intrinsic value of human life. If certain lives are deemed not worth living, the ‘right to die’ will soon turn into a duty to die.  “Already in our individualistic age, elderly, disabled and terminally ill people sometimes find themselves treated as a burden. This film should make us think much more deeply about human dignity and the value of life made in the image of God.”  Parliament  Earlier this year, MPs were warned that legalising assisted suicide would undermine the culture of caring for the vulnerable.  Speaking in the House of Commons, former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Baroness Hollins said everyone needs to know they will “be directed to the right support”, but introducing assisted suicide would change the “culture, the attitude and everything”.  The House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee is currently hearing evidence on access to palliative care, the role of medics in assisted suicide, and eligibility criteria for such services in England and Wales.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbi5vcmcudWsvbmV3cy9wbGFuLTc1LWZpbG0tc2hvd3MtYS1kaXN0dXJiaW5nbHktcmVhbGlzdGljLWdsaW1wc2Utb2YtYXNzaXN0ZWQtc3VpY2lkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Nevada State Legislature Building at the state Capitol complex on Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021, in Carson City, Nev. (Benjamin Hager/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @benjaminhphoto  CARSON CITY — Scores of bills, including legislation legalizing physician assisted suicide and a bill capping certain prescription drug prices, advanced ahead of Friday’s second house committee passage deadline.  Senate Bill 239, legislation that would give terminally ill patients over the age of 18 with less than six months to live the ability to end their lives with lethal drugs prescribed by a medical practitioner, was just one of several bills that survived the deadline.  The bill passed through the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee, with state Sens. Gregory Hafen, R-Pahrump, Gregory Koenig, R-Fallon, Brian Hibbetts, R-Las Vegas, and Ken Gray, R-Dayton, voting against advancing the measure.  Lawmakers also voted to advance Assembly Bill 250, a bill that would cap the price of certain drugs at rates negotiated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. All of the Republican lawmakers on the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee voted against it.  In the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, lawmakers voted to advance a bill meant to increase safeguards against train derailments. State Sens. Ira Hansen, R-Sparks, and Scott Hammond, R-Las Vegas, voted against advancing Assembly Bill 456.  But not all bills faced split votes. Senate Bill 322, legislation that would increase the penalty for reckless driving causing bodily harm or death to a term of six to 10 years, passed unanimously by lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee.  An evening meeting of that committee also advanced an amended version of Senate Bill 35, a bill aimed at addressing mid- and high-level fentanyl trafficking. Assembly members Ken Gray, R-Dayton, Danielle Gallant, R-Las Vegas, Alexis Hansen, R-Sparks, Toby Yurek, R-Henderson, Melissa Hardy, R-Henderson, and Erica Mosca, D-Las Vegas, voted against advancing the measure.  But a fentanyl-related bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro did not receive a vote Friday, effectively killing the legislation.  And other bills weren’t so fortunate, either.  Assembly Bill 387, a bill meant address water rights conflicts, did not receive a work session vote. Senate Bill 394, a bill that would cap the amount the Governor’s Office of Economic Development can approve for a tax abatement at $500,000, also didn’t receive a committee vote.  Senate Bill 215, a bill that would require counties and cities that choose to stop using electronic voting machines purchased with state funds to repay the state, also failed to get a committee vote. Senate Bill 427, a bill which would have required employers to create a heat mitigation program to protect employees on days when temperatures reach 105 degrees or hotter, also failed to receive a vote.

Now, Fitzpatrick’s family has filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, the board of education and the borough of Manville. MyCentralJersey was first to report about this lawsuit.  According to the civil complaint, school officials ignored a ""hostile"" environment and failed to intervene as the teen was physically bullied and showed signs of self-harm in school.  The Somerset County Office of Education was also named as a defendant, filed on May 2 in Somerset County Superior Court by Myles’ mother, Danielle Warshefski.

Lawsuit says NJ teen transitioned during remote learning, returned to bullying  Fitzpatrick entered Manville High School as a student in the 2018-2019 year.  Everyone switched to remote instruction during the 2020-2021 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit.  That same year, Fitzpatrick came out as transgender and began transitioning to being a male, taking on the first name Myles, according to the complaint.  The following school year, instruction switched back to hybrid and it was then that Fitzpatrick became the target of severe harassment, intimidation and bullying by fellow students due to his gender identity, according to the lawsuit.  Among the interactions, according to the suit, the teen was pushed into lockers, had items thrown at him, was kicked and had his hair pulled.  The lawsuit also said other students made “constant comments and disparaging remarks during the school day, including but not limited to, the use of certain slurs, including “f****t” referring to him as “she” as a form of mockery and other derogatory references, including that he would never be a male.  On several occasions, harassment, bullying and discrimination was carried out in the presence of teachers and/or staff members without intervention, according to the lawsuit.  Myles Fitzpatrick (Fucillo & Warren Funeral Home) Myles Fitzpatrick (Fucillo & Warren Funeral Home) loading...  Fitzpatrick experienced severe depression and anxiety, engaged in acts of self-mutilation and/or self-harm and attempted suicide, the complaint says.  Warshefski said in the complaint that she made several complaints to school district personnel, but “nothing sufficient was done to address the complaints,” including “an apparent lack of intervention or enforcement” of district or state policies and procedures.  In 2021, Fitzpatrick had asked and was permitted to use a restroom in the faculty lounge or the nurse’s office to go to the bathroom and change for gym due to his transitioning and because he was being bullied in the locker room, the complaint said.  However, by 2022, the school took away that “privilege and/or accommodation without explanation,” the complaint said.  Manville NJ (U.S. Census, Google Maps) loading...  Warshefski said in her lawsuit that she continued to complain about the bullying and lack of intervention, and at some point asked whether Fitzpatrick could receive some “accommodation through virtual and/or homeschooling,” but the school did not offer any such accommodations.  On or about Nov. 7, 2022, Fitzpatrick committed suicide.  The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on grounds of gender ID discrimination, negligence, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and wrongful death.

Sign up to the MySalford newsletter to keep up with what's happening in and around the city  The family of a young mum who was stabbed to death by her ex-partner in a horrific murder-suicide have hit out at delays to her inquest - which have left them still waiting for answers nearly four years on from her death.  Regan Tierney, 27, was found dead by her father at her home in Salford in June 2019. Her former partner Daniel Patten, 31, was found with critical injuries at the address following her death and died two days later. Police said they were treating the tragedy as a murder-suicide following the pair's ten-year relationship, during which Regan was subject to coercive and controlling behaviour, intimidation, verbal abuse, physical violence and threats, at the hands of Patten.  At a pre-inquest review at Bolton Coroner's Court on Friday (May 19), a representative for Regan's family said they had 'immense frustration' at the delays which have plagued her inquest.  READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp community  Opening the pre-inquest review, area coroner Peter Sigee apologised to the family, citing a lack of court resources as the reason for the wait.  He said the case had last been in court for a pre-inquest review in May 2022, and he 'regretted' that there had not been the 'progress there could and should have been'.  ""I am sorry that we have not been able to make more progress with this inquest,"" he added.  Representing Regan's family, Emma-Louie Fenelon said: ""On their behalf, I'd like to outline the immense frustration with the delay with this case. Regan has been dead for now almost four years and they have had no explanation of the delays.  ""They have had to pause their grief until this legal process can be concluded.""  (Image: MEN Media)  A 2022 Domestic Homicide Review commissioned by Salford Community Safety Partnership found that just days before her death, Regan made a phone call to police reporting that Patten had threatened to 'put her head on a stick,' believing she was in danger.  But due to a three-day delay to record the report by GMP, by the time the force made contact with her, Miss Tierney had 'lost confidence' and decided not to take the matter further.  The report found that a number of opportunities were missed by services including GMP, GP practices, Bolton NHS FT services, Greater Manchester Mental Health Foundation, and Salford Royal NHS Trust.  In a statement released following her death, her family called her a young woman with 'everything to live for'.  They said: ""She was a loving mum who loved family life, she will be greatly missed by her two children and family.  ""Regan was taken from our lives too soon. She was a beautiful daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, and an amazing mother. We will forever cherish the memories.""  Coroner Sigee set the next pre-inquest review for September 6.

During an appearance on Today to promote his return to the Fast and Furious franchise in Fast X, Cena revealed that he was actually ""rejected"" from a formal audition for the iconic fashion doll's first big-screen outing, but a chance encounter with star Margot Robbie led to him being cast in Barbie.  ""It was a happy accident,"" Cena said. ""I haven't worked with Margot before. We literally randomly ran into each other as friends. Fast X was filming across the street from Barbie. And [she asked], 'Why don't you do Barbie?' I said, 'I've been trying!' And Margot makes a lot of the decisions for that, and I said, 'Well, I'll do whatever you need.'""  “They asked me if I wanted to be a merman, and I said, ‘Yeah, sure.'”  Of course, Cena and Robbie both starred in The Suicide Squad, so perhaps he's referring to the fact that they barely had any scenes together?

Read more  “When did you start throwing up?”  My 13-year-old patient arrived at our adolescent clinic complaining of “menstrual problems” and was now repeatedly vomiting. A careful history revealed that she had intentionally overdosed, trying to end her life several days ago.  “Thank you for being open with me, I know that can be hard. I do need to tell your mom about your overdose,” I gently reminded her.  “Oh, she already knows, Doc. She just told me to keep throwing up again.” My patient’s mother had grown accustomed to her daughter’s depression and now third suicide attempt. She thought she knew the drill: overdose, throw up the drugs, drink water. Wash, rinse, repeat.  Advertisement  Although I was more than halfway through my pediatric residency at the time and had cared for countless suicidal teenagers, this patient visit has stayed with me. Even her mother had become desensitized to her own child’s suicidality while awaiting a psychiatrist appointment. How could I blame her? Since I started my training in June 2020, I have admitted nearly as many adolescent suicide attempts as asthmatic patients, and asthma is one of the most common reasons for admission to our hospital.  Adolescent depression and suicidality have quickly become the “bread and butter” of pediatrics. Teens without signs of depression or suicidal thoughts or attempts are so rare in our well-visit clinic that they are memorable. I can’t recall a single shift in our emergency room without multiple listings of “intentional overdose” or “behavioral/mental health problem” on the patient tracking board.  I am a pediatrician in an underserved, poverty-stricken community in Philadelphia. But I am not alone in what I’m seeing.

In the last decade, the mental health of high school students in the United States has continued to worsen, with 40% of high school students feeling so sad or hopeless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year. The percentage of high school students who reported making a suicide plan has also increased from 13% in 2011 to 18% in 2021. During COVID-19 lockdowns, from mid-March through mid-October in 2020, the percentage of adolescents across the U.S. who presented to the emergency room for mental health crises increased 31% compared with the same time period in 2019.  The data are clear. We are failing our adolescents.  The current screening, referral, and management process leaves our teens’ mental health issues unrecognized and untreated. Despite the ubiquity of adolescent mental health conditions, less than two-thirds successfully access treatment, and those who do wait an average of 50 days for psychiatrist intake appointments.  But pediatricians are not yet trained to pick up the slack. According to an American Academy of Pediatrics survey, 65% of pediatricians say they feel they lack training in identifying and treating mental health issues, as did more than 50% of pediatric residents. In my own residency program, both residents and attendings often say they feel unequipped to deal with depression and suicidality among our teens. Changes in pediatric training are overdue.  There are legitimate concerns that psychiatrists — not pediatricians — are best qualified to provide proper mental health care to adolescents. This is certainly true for complex diagnoses such as psychosis, schizophrenia, or treatment-resistant depression or suicidality. But with the overwhelming rise of adolescent mental health needs and the scarcity of adolescent psychiatrists in the U.S., the current system must adapt.  It is essential that we incorporate basic mental health care as a core element of pediatric training and practice, so we can fill the gap and provide the care our teens need to survive. Pediatricians have the opportunity to reach patients prior to crises — to stop the cycle of wash, rinse, repeat. Teens’ lives are at stake.  Rose Bayer is finishing her pediatrics residency in Philadelphia and applying for an adolescent medicine fellowship. She continues to pursue her passion and research in adolescent mental health as well as resident wellness and burnout prevention.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvdGVlbi1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLXN1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudGlvbi0yMDIzMDUxOS5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5xdWlyZXIuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFyeS90ZWVuLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLTIwMjMwNTE5Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T13:49:57","To mark the climax of Mental Health Awareness Week 2023, the company of the Olivier-nominated international stage sensation THE CHOIR OF MAN announces details of a year-long fundraising partnership with mental health and suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM).  The aim of the partnership is to raise over £10,000 for the charity's vital work - which is enough to fund over 1000 conversations via CALM's life-saving helpline.  Every week in the UK, 125 people take their own lives. 75% of those people will be men, making suicide the biggest killer of men under 50. CALM exists to change this by offering life-saving services, provoking national conversation, and bringing people together to reject living miserably. The Choir of Man is an uplifting celebration of community and friendship, with one of the key messages being the vital importance of men coming together to open up and share their struggles, whilst enjoying a pint and a chat.  Audiences will have the chance to support the partnership in various ways - both whilst purchasing a ticket, with QR code donation points in the Arts Theatre, collections on select performances and a Text2Donate opportunity that will be highlighted during The Poet's closing monologue.  The company of the show will also be offered support and advocacy opportunities by the charity, with a CALM Champion workshop.  Simon Gunning, CEO of Campaign Against Living Miserably said ""We're absolutely thrilled The Choir of Man are flying the CALM flag and raising money to fund our lifesaving services. Although the show is incredibly entertaining, it also contains a poignant message about the importance of men looking out for each other and how the pub provides a wonderful sense of community. It's a message we're passionate about because too many men are dying by suicide and this needs to change. Asking a mate out for a pint really can make all the difference.""  An uplifting celebration of community and friendship with something for everyone... including free beer! Enjoy 90 minutes of feel-good, foot-stomping entertainment unlike anything else in the West End.  Brimming with hits from artists such as Queen, Luther Vandross, Sia, Paul Simon, Adele, Guns & Roses, Avicii and Katy Perry to name but a few. A wildly talented group of incredible instrumentalists, world-class wordsmiths, and sensational singers; this cast of nine (extra)ordinary guys serve it all...live!  THE CHOIR OF MAN has previously played three sell-out seasons at the Sydney Opera House and multiple sold-out US and European tours. Following its last run at the Arts Theatre from October 2021 to April 2022, it received an Olivier nomination for Best Entertainment or Comedy Play, and then went on to play in Coventry as part of the City of Culture Assembly Festival season and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  BEN NORRIS - who wrote the monologues for The Choir of Man and originated the role of 'The Poet' said, ""The show is so unapologetically feel-good that whatever kind of mood you arrive in at the theatre, it's impossible not to leave with a smile on your face and a spring in your step. And that goes for the cast as well as the audience!  Whether we're conscious of it or not, when we meet a friend in the pub for a pint, it's often simply the company we're after. This is especially true, I think, for men. Although things are starting to shift, we still find it much harder to open up and to ask for help. We're still taking our own lives at a far higher rate. The lockdowns and the helplessness of the pandemic hugely exacerbated this, and the imminent cost of living crisis will only worsen it further.  As a male voice choir, we wanted to make a show that brings joy to people - a show that is fun and frivolous and silly and a bloody good night out, but also one that speaks to some of those difficulties we face, and that gently questions what masculinity might look like in 2022.  Above all, we wanted to make a show that puts an arm around people, of all genders, and invites them to either forget their troubles for an evening or to share them. Sometimes it's literally life-saving.""

"suicide","2017-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T11:00:00","This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).  Videos by American Songwriter  For those that knew him, Seattle-born rock singer Chris Cornell was a kind, even gentle person. His biography, Total Fucking God Head, describes him as a thoughtful person and a friend to many.  But even he had demons.  Indeed, Cornell’s life is a prime example of what is going on inside may not match the reality outside. On the outside, the singer was a rock god, the frontman for Soundgarden and then for Audioslave. Also known for his solo work, Cornell boasted the voice of a crooner and a banshee, the best of both extremes.  Born in the Emerald City on July 20, 1964, Cornell’s life was cut short. He died in Detroit, Michigan, on May 18, 2017.  The MGM  At the Detroit MGM Grand Hotel in the early hours of May 18, 2017, the 52-year-old bodyguard found him in the bathroom of his hotel room, unconscious. The night before, he performed a gig at the Fox Theater. The bodyguard reported that a resistance exercise band was around Cornell’s neck and there was blood in his mouth. He was pronounced dead on the scene by a doctor at 1:30 a.m.  Police reported that they reviewed surveillance video from the hotel and it didn’t show anyone coming or going from Cornell’s suite after the bodyguard left at around 11:30 p.m.  Police also reported that medication was in Cornell’s system, but, they said, not in any toxic amount. Though deemed not the cause of death, ultimately, Cornell did have a number of substances in his system, including Butalbital, lorazepam (a sleep aid known as Ativan that was prescribed to him), a decongestant, caffeine, and naloxone, which was given to him by emergency responders on the scene and is meant to reverse opioid overdoses.  Vicky Cornell  Cornell’s wife blamed the sleep aid drug, Ativan. She said she spoke to Cornell after his show and noticed he was slurring his words. Worried, she said she called Cornell’s security to check on him.  After Cornell’s toxicology report came out, Vicky released a statement. “Many of us who know Chris well noticed that he wasn’t himself during his final hours and that something was very off,” she said. “We have learned from this report that several substances were found in his system. After so many years of sobriety, this moment of terrible judgment seems to have completely impaired and altered his state of mind.  “Something clearly went terribly wrong and my children and I are heartbroken and are devastated that this moment can never be taken back. We very much appreciate all of the love we have received during this extremely difficult time and are dedicated to helping others in preventing this type of tragedy.”  Wasted Time  When the details of that night were released to the public, there were obvious problems and mistakes.  The problems began to arise a little after 11:30 p.m. in Cornell’s hotel room after his show that night. According to reports, his bodyguard had gone to see him around then to help him with a computer issue. A few minutes later, Cornell talked with Vicky on the phone. According to her, he kept saying he was tired and eventually just hung up the phone. Worried, she called his bodyguard to check. This was 12:15 a.m.  The bodyguard, Martin Kristen, couldn’t get in the room. He called hotel security, he says: “I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key.” When Kristen told Vicky the update, she advised him to kick down the door. When he did, after six or seven tries, Kristen saw Cornell’s feet through the bathroom door. He loosened the athletic band from his neck and tried to give him CPR.  Professionals arrived at 12:56 a.m. but could not revive Cornell. He was pronounced dead 34 minutes later, some 75 minutes after Kristen was called by Vicky.  The Conspiracy Theories  Police were questioned by The Detroit News about why it took 41 minutes for medical professionals to get to Cornell but the police said the gaps in time and response were not as big.  But in the wake of that night, others have investigated the tapes and call logs and determined that, in fact, the police were late. This has led some, including Vicky, to think that foul play is afoot.  The Detroit News reported: “Authorities determined within days the death was a suicide, although wife Vicky Cornell told People magazine she thought the ruling was premature because it came before the toxicology or autopsy results were complete. She said the drugs in her husband’s system may have altered his mental state. Among the theories: Cornell was killed because he was about to expose a child sex ring allegedly associated with Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor some claimed was a front, although Washington police said that theory was ‘fictitious.’”  ‘We investigated all possible angles, and there were no signs this was anything but a suicide,’ Detroit police media relations director Michael Woody said. ‘But we’ve been getting inundated with different theories.’”  Vicky has since brought up the fact that Cornell reportedly suffered from a head injury that was mentioned in two clinical reports, but was not on the final autopsy.  “This has left me and my family still looking for answers, but at the same time, set off this whirlwind of conspiracies,” [Vicky] told The Detroit News. “Some of the people are just fans looking for answers, but some of them are conspiracy theorists who have said the most vile things to my children and me.”  The Lawsuit  With many nagging questions in her mind, Vicky filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that Dr. Robert Koblin “negligently and repeatedly” prescribed Cornell “dangerous mind-altering controlled substances” that “impaired Mr.Cornell’s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.” The suit also said Koblin did so for 20 months, without properly checking on Cornell.  While Cornell may have been aware of the risks of the drugs, that doesn’t mean he should have been taking them. The singer long had a history of depression, and even spoke publicly about it. He even traced it back to when he was a kid and inhaled PCP, which, he said, put a “scar” on his “psyche.”  In his defense, Koblin said Cornell was of full mind and body and aware of what he was doing and the risks. The medication was for his anxiety and, Koblin says, he did everything he could to help Cornell with his depression. In 2021, the two parties settled confidentially.  The Legacy  Thursday (May 18), Cornell would have been 58 years old. He remains a seminal figure in rock music and, especially, in grunge music.  His former band Soundgarden and his widow Vicky recently settled their own issues and now Soundgarden has control over its social media accounts and the handful of songs Cornell recorded with the band before he died. The group is likely to release those in the coming months or years. And Cornell’s legacy will continue to live on.

However, she said there were rising rates among older adults within the indigenous Pacific islander communities too.  “This suggests breakdowns and changes happening to the traditional strong community and religious support systems, likely due to urbanisation and economic changes,” she said.  “However, we also know there are many socio-cultural elements such as traditional gender norms and patriarchy leading to gender-based violence, high sexual assault and increasing drug use among others.  “Then we have issues around very high stigma, ignorance, disinformation about mental health and mental illness.  “So people do not seek help when they start to feel psychological symptoms.”  She added there was a need to significantly enhance and invest in mental health budgets from government.  “The best thing is to have interventions that foster community.  “This should be done in the national school curriculum such as emotional awareness training, problem solving, coping skills development, interpersonal relationship and sexual education.  “This is not to say the culture is bad or doesn’t care about each other, not about the country simply not caring.  “It is just the product of miseducation and lack of understanding about mental illness and a lack of normalising mental health and emotional distress and normalising help seeking.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20vaGlnaC1yYXRlcy1vZi1zdWljaWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-17","15:00:00","{""Newton"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:30:44","Right about now, America’s Red States are fast on their way to becoming…dystopias. “Open carry” laws have led to dramatic…wait for it…open…violence. Women are second class citizens. Basic freedoms are going up in smoke. Teachers are criminalized. Kids are demonized. The LGBTQ are smeared as groomers — and then attacked legislatively. Books, banned.  The fanatics have taken over.  What does the future hold for America’s Red States? I won’t mince words, it’s not going to be pretty, and it’s a warning to the world. A world which is turning to its own Red-State-America-style demagogues and fanatics for a measure of security in a troubled world. It’s — emphatically — not worth it.  What happens as Red States begin to erase modernity itself? As they become places that resemble “third world countries”? As their polities, hijacked by extremists, theocrats, lunatics, turn authoritarian? And they go on a crusade to simply annihilate anyone they regard as inferior, first rhetorically, then legislatively, and then by inciting and licensing maniacs with guns? Giving those kinds of people badges and titles? Perhaps you’ve already forgotten the last massacre. I haven’t.  The classical vicious cycle of self-inflicted ruin is what’s already beginning to happen.  There’s an open secret about Red States. They’re broke. They take in more from the federal government than they collect. That’s not true for every Red State…but it will be soon.  7 of the 10 states most dependent on the federal government were Republican-voting, with the average red state receiving $1.05 per dollar spent.  The notable exceptions are, for example, Florida and Texas. And you can already see what’s happening there. Ron DeSantis has begun to politically attack…Disney. The State’s most historic employer. Disney just pulled out of a billion dollar investment package. Pretty simple, right?  What tends to happen as societies collapse is what we economists call “capital flight.” America’s Red States didn’t have much capital to begin with. And where that capital is still in Red States, it’s already beginning to flee. If DeSantis continues his crusade against Disney, how long do you think it’ll take before Disney just…packs up…and moves? You can see the theme writ large in that example, and it’s an illustration of the larger effect.  Why does capital flight take place? Well, picture yourself as an investor. Maybe even just…I don’t know…buying a home. Would you want to live in a Red State, if you had a choice? Probably not. That’s because you’d take on all kinds of risk. The risk of…being shot by some violent maniac with a gun. The risk of having a gay kid, and them being persecuted. Your straight kid getting in trouble for…reading books. You getting in trouble for “aiding and abetting” a woman. That’s all leaving aside the emotional climate of intolerance and rage. All those forms of risk are very real.  They’re even larger for investors. Who knows when a government that’s turned authoritarian is going to…attack your company? Your investment? For God knows what? Maybe one of your execs is gay. What a crime. Maybe your CEO gets pictured on a plane reading the wrong book. Maybe your latest ad campaign says everyone’s a person. Bang. They start to attack you. They pass whole new laws and appoint “oversight committees” to start political witch hunts. Sane money avoids political instability for a very good reason: it carries with significant, usually lethal, amounts of risk.  So. There Red States are. America’s dirty secret is that their lunacy, their extremism, LOL, is being funded by…Blue States. Remember, apart from a handful of exceptions, Red States are subsidized by the government. Now, Blue States don’t resent that, because by and large, people in them think everyone should have basics like roads, schools, hospitals, books, libraries, and so forth. But as this cycle of capital flight continues…what happens?  The already barely extant public purse of Red States will shrink, as capital flees, for friendlier climes. And as it does, what little in the way of public services Red States have will shrink. Their economies will go into a tailspin, sooner or later, thanks to all this fanaticism and authoritarianism. And as it does, what kinds of places will they be left to live in?  Then you’ve got the combination of a climate of bigotry, fear, rage, hate. The gun violence. And now you’ve also got…not a lot else. Maybe cheap housing. But everything else is broken. Another Red State illustrates that pretty well, and that’s Texas. Texas is a rich state — for a reason called oil and gas. But Texas hasn’t spent that money wisely. It’s got poor to nonexistent infrastructure. It’s power grid and its water system are decrepit. Its school system is ranked 40 out of 50. That’s about all the infrastructure it has. It’s not exactly renowned for boulevards, town squares, and high speed trains, after all. All that wealth — squandered.  What happens as societies enter this vicious cycle — as political fanaticism causes capital flight? Well, sadly, that very capital flight tends to solidify and entrench fanaticism. Because as people get poorer, they get more desperate. The demagogue’s Big Lies catch hold and catch fire. Violence spirals. The rule of law stops functioning. And in that way, authoritarianism crystallizes into a newer, harder phase.  Where does that leave Blue States? In a very, very precarious and difficult position. There they are, subsidizing Red States. Paying for all this lunacy. Red States, Blue States are going to eventually say, don’t carry their weight. What do they really contribute to the common wealth, anymore? Not a whole lot. Bigotry and violence — when you don’t even pay your way? Is that really what we should be subsidizing?  At the same time, there’s not a lot that Blue States can do about it. The position they’re in is that Red States have disproportionate representation in the polity — and for that reason, effectively get subsidized. Short of a national breakup, there’s not a whole lot Blue States can do about this, which looks like one history’s rawest deal.  That brings us to the paradox of Red States. They get subsidized, but they don’t want a functioning government. LOL. That’s illogical, and it’s baffling, and people tear their hair out about it. You don’t need to overthink it. It is what it appears to be, which is plain foolishness. You probably think, having considered that, that it’s a pretty self-destructive thing to do. Even for a lunatic. I mean, do you want to really bite the hand that feeds you?  This is how societies implode. That level of self-destruction. One that says, yes, here I am, getting subsidized, by a thing that I want to destroy. I guess there won’t be more for me. Why would anyone do that? Out of sheer vengeful spite, and ignorance, to boot. I’ll take you down with me, and that way, hey, we both won’t have anything, but at least I’ll have the satisfaction of having ruined you.  There’s a simpler way to put that. Red States are turning America into a suicide pact. Who wants to live beside states that…ban books…demonize kids…criminalize teachers…let violent maniacs carry weapons of war? Not a whole lot of people. Who wants to subsidize them? Even fewer. And yet Blue States are trapped in this suicide pact, because for Red States, the goal is destruction — the destruction of democracy and modernity. How many Red States can you see out there that aren’t erasing basic rights faster than you or I can blink an eye?  Certainly, not every Red Stater feels that way. And many sane, kindhearted, democratically-minded people live in Red States, and can’t afford to pick up and leave. But unfortunately Red States are where they are. And that is turning increasingly fanatical, at a pretty startling rate, even for them. Red States have this grim reputation, and sadly, right about now, they’re not living up to it, they’re exceeding it.  Capital flight isn’t just about money. It’s about people, too. “Human capital” (to use an ugly term) flight. That’s another facet of social collapse. That means fleeing the climate of authoritarianism — but also more than that. It means that as authoritarian reaps the economic whirlwind, people have little choice but to leave.  Right about now, Red States are in a strange position — one which makes them seem stronger than they are. They’re seeing an influx of migration, because the cost of housing and living is cheaper. Of course, it’s cheaper for a reason. Living standards are often dramatically lower. Still, right now, there are still jobs in Red States. But as this new fanaticism carries on, there won’t be.  Think about what happens when Disney shelves a billion dollar investment package, or simply walks away for good. As investment dries up, it takes jobs with it, which impact the public purse, drying up funds for what little there was in the way of schools, hospitals, libraries, and suddenly, authoritarian societies look far less attractive to live in. Even if the housing’s cheap.  All of that will come to pass, but it’ll take some time. Half a decade or so, maybe more. Right now, Red States are riding high, because an influx of migration is letting fanatics basically grow drunk on power. Look at all the people moving here! We must be amazing! But really, there are two futures for Red States.  One goes like this. All those new residents from (often far more populous Blue States) begin to vote, and demand sanity, nonviolence, equality, truth, and justice, which are the fundaments of democracy. They kick the fanatics and lunatics out. The States turn…if not Blue…then maybe Purple. But not the Red they are right now. The Red of emergency, alarm, rage, hate.  The second one goes like this. Those new residents didn’t amount to enough to really change much. And so said state goes into a spiral of decline. As it does, authoritarians demand more and more. More book bans, more rights erased, more social groups persecuted and demonized, more professions and social roles criminalized. What sane people are left must go. To place where sanity still exists.  Which state will fall into which category? It’s hard to say, and you can make your own judgments.  The bigger problem, and the bigger picture, is this. Blue States are wasting money — and time — on Red States. And at some point, they themselves are going to demand a fairer accounting. That money is needed now, after all, for far better things than lunacy, violence, and bigotry. It’s needed for infrastructure, fighting climate change, giving kids an education — the very things Red States keep on blocking America from doing as a country. Sooner or later, Blue States are going to have take matters into their own hands, and just begin doing it. That means clawing back both power and money from central, federal government.  America’s becoming a suicide pact. I’m sorry if that sounds harsh. I don’t mean to insult anyone or make you feel bad. There’s enough of that in the world. My point is simple. It’s hard to break one. Blue States can’t break off the country. But they will eventually do what happens in destabilized societies. Take some form of power back, and resources with it, so they can do what the self-destructive parts of society won’t. Of course, as they try to, Red States will scream to high heaven. That they’re the persecuted ones, that they’re under attack, being replaced, all the torrid cliches, by now, you can hear the GOP screaming every day. That’s what the next decade of American politics will be about, sadly. And it’s going to be uglier than many of us yet think.

"suicide","2011-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T09:00:37","[MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  So before we jump in today, I want to tell you about something The New York Times has been working on for a while. And I’m going to level with you — that when they started telling me about this project, I was very skeptical of it, which made for a couple of awkward internal conversations, because what I understood them to be working on was a podcast app. And I thought to myself, who needs another podcast app? There are plenty of them on the market already. None of them are great, but they’re fine. And then they gave me the new app as a beta tester, and I realized that I was wrong about what they were building, at least partly wrong, because what they actually built is something nobody has created yet, which is a portal to the world of audio journalism. There are podcasts, including this one, but also stories, essays, profiles. You can listen to digests of the news, and to full news stories, and to full magazine stories. You don’t have to choose anymore between listening to a podcast and actually getting the news. You can get the news you used to read, but done in a really, really strong, really professional audio format, and not just from The New York Times. There are stories there from other publishers too. So the app, again, is called New York Times Audio. It’s an iOS app. You get it from the App Store. And it is for New York Times news subscribers, which — come on, if you’re listening to this show, I hope you’re a subscriber for that by now. So check it out. It really is something new. It really is something worth trying. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m going to start today’s show with some numbers. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of teens and young adults with clinical depression more than doubled — more than doubled. Between 2007 and 2019, the suicide rate for those in their early 20s rose by 41 percent. And the suicide rate for 10 to 14-year-olds — 10 to 14-year-olds, think about how young that is — it tripled, and it nearly quadrupled for girls. A C.D.C. survey found that in 2021, almost 60 percent of high school girls experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year, and nearly 25 percent — I just, this number, man — nearly 25 percent made a suicide plan. Something is going terribly wrong for teenagers. Whatever it is started well before the pandemic. And this is important enough and big enough that we’re going to do a couple of episodes exploring it. But I wanted our first one to really try to dig into these numbers. What do we know is happening here? Why is it happening? You can’t begin to solve a problem like this, until at least you have a theory of what has been causing it. Jean Twenge is a research psychologist who has been deep in this data for years. She was one of the earliest to see something going wrong with teen mental health. And then in her 2017 book, “iGen” and her new book “Generations,” she’s put together reams of charts and graphs and theories and tests to try to understand what it is, what has happened here. And the leading candidate, in her view, is smartphones and social media. And if that’s true, if they really are doing this level of damage to kids today, then we need to be thinking about interventions here on a whole different scale than most policymakers have been willing to touch. And I want to say this episode obviously deals a lot with suicide, and if you or someone you know or love is struggling here, get help. There is a lot of help out there. So call or text 988 to reach the suicide and crisis lifeline. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jean Twenge, welcome to the show.  jean twenge  Thank you.  ezra klein  So in your new book, “Generations,” you write, “that there’s a full blown mental health crisis among young people, and it was building long before the Covid-19 pandemic.” So walk me through some of the data — and your book is really chock-full of data and graphs, which I really appreciated about it. Walk me through some of the data that persuaded you of that.  jean twenge  Yeah, so I work with these large national surveys, often of teens. And I’ve been doing that for a number of years. So when I first started to see these trends, they were surprising, because they were so sudden. So around 2012, more and more teens started to say they felt lonely and left out. And more started to say they felt like they couldn’t do anything right, or that they didn’t enjoy life. Those last two are classic symptoms of depression. Then, other data started to pop up. Clinical level depression that requires treatment started to rise. Emergency room admissions for self-harm started to rise in C.D.C. data. Same thing for suicide attempts and completed suicides. So at first, I thought it might be a blip, a year or two of data. But it kept going. So for example, between 2011 and 2019, well before the pandemic, clinical level depression among teens doubled. Emergency room admissions for self harm tripled in 10 to 14-year-old girls. So this is why I say we know it’s not just the pandemic.  ezra klein  And those objective measures of behavior, is that one of the ways we know? Because I think this is a common suspicion at about this point in the conversation, that we’re not just dealing with a rise in reporting or a decrease in stigma — maybe it’s much easier to say and admit that you’re depressed than it was in 1985.  jean twenge  So exactly, that’s how we know it’s not just about more willingness to report, is that these objective measures, like the emergency room admissions for — not just for self harm, but also for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, have gone up. And the pattern is extremely similar to the self reports. I mean, the other thing that has to be kept in mind about these self reports is these surveys are anonymous. Many of them also ask about drug and alcohol use, all of which is illegal in these age groups. So these surveys better than anybody know how to make sure to get across to young people how confidential. It is.  ezra klein  What are we seeing in terms of the demographic differences here between boys and girls, among races, classes, geographies? Are there patterns being picked up there that are worth noting?  jean twenge  So the biggest difference is boys versus girls, and it varies a little bit from one measure to another. So for clinical level depression, it’s doubled for both girls and boys. But because teen girls’ rates of depression are and were always higher, the number of people that this affects is larger for girls. And then in many of the other measures we’ve been discussing, the changes are considerably larger for girls than for boys, so self-harm behaviors is one of those where there’s not as much change for boys as there is for girls. Same is true for the suicide rate, that it has changed for both, but it has changed more and increased more among girls than among boys.  ezra klein  I want to zoom in here on suicide itself. You compare the actual suicide rate increases between 2007, not that long ago, and 2019. And you say of the increase, quote, it’s a total of 17,677 additional young lives lost, averaging more than 1,300 a year, enough to fill nine planes. Imagine if nine airline flights filled with 10 to 24-year-olds crashed every single year, killing everyone on board. That’s a really profound and shocking rise. So how do you understand the rise in suicide itself?  jean twenge  So I think we have to look at the pattern across all of the measures, so not just suicide, but also those ER admissions for self harm, the rise in depression, the rise in anxiety, the rise in unhappiness. And across the board, all of these indicators have gotten worse in terms of mental health. And the pattern is fairly similar, that around 2010 or so, these indicators start to get worse. Now, the exact time when they start to increase varies a little bit from one measure to another, sometime between 2009 and 2013. It’s right in that time period. So you have to ask, what happened during that time period, because we’re not trying to explain all of the causes of mental health issues among teens. We want to know why it increased so much over such a short period of time. So it has to be something that changed around that time, and then kept going in the same direction over the next decade or so. So when I first started to see these changes, I had absolutely no idea what the cause could be. It was pretty clear it was not economics, because the U.S. economy finally started to improve after about 2011, after the Great Recession. It was difficult to think of any major event that occurred around that time and then reverberated throughout the decade. And then one day, I came across the results of a poll from the Pew Center for Research. And it showed that the end of 2012 was the first time that the majority of Americans owned a smartphone, and these same surveys of teens, that time period was also when social media use moved from something that about half of teens were doing every day — it was in 2009 — to by 2015, 2016, about 80 percent of them were doing it every day. So then basically, what happened is social media use moved from optional to almost mandatory among teens. So that’s when I started to think maybe that had something to do with it, that teens were spending so much more time online — also, because this lined up with other things. Like, they were also sleeping less. The trend isn’t exactly the same pattern. That started to increase after 2011 or 2012. And they also started spending less time with their friends in person, so that had started to decline just a little bit after about 2000 and then it really falls off a cliff after 2010. So you put this together, there was a fundamental change in the way teens spent their time outside of school starting in that same time period, early 2010s. And that coincides, with pretty good precision, with when mental health started to suffer.  ezra klein  So before we go deep into the smartphone thesis, I want to zoom in on something you said there about the data, which is that we’re trying to explain a change in the time series — right, there’s this very sharp — just, the line goes almost straight up, starting, as you say, around like 2011, 2012. But something that was striking when we were doing prep for this was, I saw this figure from the researchers Will Rinehart and Taylor Barkley. And they found that if you go back to the late 1960s and you graph the teen suicide rate, it looks more cyclical, rather than a trend just going upward. So it’s higher in the ‘80s than now, than it falls for a long time until about 2008. And then it picks up again, getting us to where we are now. So if we’re kind of explaining the rise, how do we also explain the fall that preceded it? I mean, there are no smartphones in the 1980s. So what do you understand as having gone on in the ‘80s that led to such a high suicide rate, and then stopped happening, such that it went down to what we’re now thinking of as a more normal baseline?  jean twenge  So it is true that the suicide rate for teens in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s was very high. It was much higher than it was, say, for Boomer teens in 1970. So one thing we have to keep in mind here is just the greater cultural context, that there was a big rise in violent crime around this time. It was kind of a disordered time in the culture, so this — there was a recession. This is around the time that Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign kept talking about change because it was such a pessimistic time in the country. And for teens in particular, and we’re talking about suicides in particular, there’s another element — so there was a huge availability of inexpensive guns around that time. So they were called Saturday Night Specials. And when you break it down for firearm suicides versus non, non firearm suicides went down or didn’t change a whole lot during that time period when it was the Gen X-ers who were teens. It was really that increase in the firearm suicides, so it may have had a fair amount to do with the preponderance of cheap guns.  ezra klein  So one of your big thesis throughout generations is that generations are technologically mediated, that more than they’re defined by cultural events, they’re defined by the technologies they have accessible to them. So your thinking on this is that technology that was mediating that was guns. But then why would it fall?  jean twenge  Well, the folks that looked at this concluded that there were more restrictions starting in the mid ‘90s. And what I do know for sure, the violent crime rate definitely started to go down after about — 1993 was the peak, and then things started to improve. And they kept improving for a really long time. So I still think that general atmosphere of that time — it was really a tough time to be a teen, particularly if — you know, depending on the neighborhood were in, but particularly if you were in a place that was impacted by this very, very high level of violent crime.  ezra klein  Violent crime actually gets at why I wanted to ask this before we got into smartphones, because I’m much more familiar with the debate over crime than I am over the debate over suicide trend lines. And the thing that has always striking to me, and I think really underplayed in our national discourse over crime, is that we don’t really understand it, that if you go into the ‘80s and the ‘90s, you see crime goes way, way up in the 70s, way, way up in all kinds of different jurisdictions, more or less all at the same time. And then it begins going way, way down in all kinds of different places all at the same time. So you have stories that people know, like there’s New York with Rudy Giuliani and broken windows policing and stop and frisk. But it also goes down in all these places that didn’t do what New York City did. It’s so widespread, both the rise and the fall, that you end up having researchers trying to think of even broader explanations, like whether or not lead and the amount of lead in young kids’ bloodstreams — and thus, the effect on their executive function when they got older, maybe that’s the causal mechanism. And it made me wonder if there isn’t a chance that suicide and teen mental health is like that, that it has this kind of all the way up, all the way down in all places, and we don’t really understand why pattern to it.  jean twenge  Well, I think — and I think your point is very well taken about crime rates, that they are a little bit of a mystery. It’s also true, sure, that for mental health, we can’t randomly assign people to be born at different times and then see what their mental health looks like. That would be the gold standard of or random assignment experiment. And it’s literally impossible. So we have to go on the data that we have. But I think for the recent rise in mental health issues, we can look at it this way, that this is a generation where violent crime is a lot lower than it was in the early ‘90s. Teen pregnancy was lower. They’re even less likely to get into car accidents or get into physical fights at school. Incomes were up for that period. There’s all these things that were going right, yet still, mental health among teens suffered. So there must have been some big mechanism. The reason why I think the smartphones and social media explanation has held up is because that is what had the biggest impact on the day to day lives of teens. It wasn’t something that happened to their parents. It wasn’t a single thing they read about in the news. It completely restructured their time outside of school because social media is social. It impacts even people who don’t use it. And it had a huge impact on the way teens spent time with their friends, that they started spending a lot less time with each other, face to face. And you think about what’s important for mental health overall, it’s relationships. Then, you think about teens in particular, that is what makes or breaks mental health for a teen, is their relationships, particularly their friendships. And the way those friendships were conducted changed completely.  ezra klein  So I want to dig into this piece of it more, because smartphones sound like a singular cause. But when I read you on this, and when I read others, it decomposes into something very multi causal. So tell me the different mechanisms. You talk about time displacement, and social effects, and time spent with friends, and sleep. What are the different mechanisms that you understand smartphones as triggering that contribute to this for you?  jean twenge  There are a lot of different mechanisms. It’s another reason why it is such a plausible explanation. So as we’ve already talked about, there’s the time displacement — not just with in person interactions with friends, but also with sleep. Sleep is absolutely crucial for mental health. Not sleeping enough is a huge risk factor for depression and suicidal thoughts. And sleep deprivation among teens in two different surveys shows exactly the same pattern as the mental health issues, which is around 2012 or so it starts going up. So that’s our first couple of mechanisms.  ezra klein  And just hold on that one for a minute. What makes you certain that that isn’t just correlation with the take off in smartphones? What makes you think that smartphones are directly leading to less sleep for teens?  jean twenge  So there’s many correlational and experimental studies, say, in sleep labs showing that, for example, people have their phones in their bedrooms overnight, that that disrupts sleep, that looking at a device before bedtime leads to less sleep and less quality sleep. So because — for a number of reasons. First, they’re psychologically stimulating. Pretty much everything people do on the phone is psychologically stimulating, particularly for teens, where the number of likes they got on their Instagram post, or whether they’re crush texted them back is very important. These are not relaxing thoughts, yet many, many, many teens are looking at their phones right up until they go to sleep. Plus, there’s a physiological element. The blue light on those devices shines into your eyes, tricks your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. And then you don’t make as much melatonin, the sleep hormone that you need to fall asleep quickly and get a good night’s sleep. And this is correlational, experimental — that piece of the research literature is extremely solid, on that connection between spending time on the devices and not sleeping enough.  ezra klein  All right, so that is smartphones and sleep. What are the other mechanisms?  jean twenge  So there’s all of the things that happen when a teen uses social media. So we can start with things like social comparison and body image issues. So this is what Facebook’s own research shows, as well as plenty of external academic research as well, that looking at, say, these ideal bodies on Instagram, or even the people you go to high school with, and they look more glamorous, and you’re comparing your body to theirs, and your appearance to theirs and coming up short. So that’s the social comparison piece, and lots of studies on this, that people that spend more time, and especially those who spend more time looking at those images on Instagram, if they have that tendency towards social comparison, that’s where you get the body image issues, appearance issues. And then those — mediated, those can then lead to depression. And in Facebook’s research, they had a bunch of focus groups as well as large surveys, and they found this over and over. And the focus group quotes, some of them were really stunning. They would talk about a grief spiral, and they start looking at these images, feel inadequate, then get depressed. Then, there’s all of the other things that people have discussed about the influence of social media, that it means popularity becomes a number — how many likes do you have, how many followers do you have. And it’s never enough. Then, cyberbullying — some of the rabbit holes that people end up going down, that has been documented. If you start looking for healthy eating, you might end up on pro anorexia sites, and there’s no way to reset that. And that negative material keeps showing up. Same thing for a lot of things around mental health. And again, it just becomes a spiral.  ezra klein  One thing about smartphones is they’re an international phenomenon. So is social media. So what do you see in the international data here?  jean twenge  So in the international data, we see exactly the same pattern as we see in the U.S. for teen mental health, that in 36 countries around the world, adolescent loneliness began to increase after 2012, just like it does in the U.S. data. We have solid data on depression and unhappiness in English speaking countries — again, exact same pattern — so in the U.K., in Australia, in Canada, exact same pattern for teens for anxiety and depression, self harm, unhappiness. It’s very, very consistent. And that also suggests some cause that was worldwide. That helps us rule out more U.S.-based explanations, like worries around school shootings, which tend not to happen in other countries, and certain political events.  ezra klein  How does the smartphone thesis map on to — not just the observation, the reality, that this has been much worse among girls than boys?  jean twenge  Well, girls spend more time on social media. And time on social media is more strongly linked to depression than time spent on, say, gaming, which is where boys spend more of their screen time. So those two factors, they spend more time on it, and it’s more strongly linked to depression for them — might explain the gender difference.  ezra klein  I found that pretty striking. Why do you think gaming is not as linked to some of these negative outcomes?  jean twenge  These days, the way most teens and adults game, it’s often interactive. So they’ll play games with their friends. They aren’t there face to face, but it’s often in real time. And they’ll often talk to each other as they’re playing the game. So not the same as running around outside playing football, say, but still in real time, and still interaction with friends, where on social media, only some of it is interaction with friends. A good amount of it is watching TikTok videos from people you’ve never met, or scanning through the pages of Instagram influencers.  ezra klein  This is one thing I was trying to sit with as I read the book, and thought about this data, that gaming has this tendency to be not just interactive, but it’s you doing it, it’s you doing something, where social media has this weird tendency to put you outside yourself, looking in. I mean, you’ve talked about it as comparative, but it’s also — you’re posting pictures, you’re writing things, and then seeing how people respond. You’re always putting yourself out for judgment. And you begin to inhabit the judger in a weird way. I mean, I’ve certainly felt this myself. And I did not get social media when I was a 13-year-old. Is there something to that, the way that gaming keeps you in yourself, and social media it takes you outside yourself?  jean twenge  I think so. It reminds me of some of the research on what’s called self objectification in terms of appearance, that particularly for women, there’s the pressure to focus on how your body looks to others, rather than what your body can do, say, in terms of sports or other things. And it’s somewhat of the same element, because in gaming, you can do things. And maybe you’re going to fail, and maybe your friends will make fun of you. But still, you’re doing something. You have at least some perceived level of control. And in social media, there is that same perceived level of control. However, there’s only so far you can go to modify your appearance and try to measure up to all the perfect people who you see online. And you’re right, it’s about — so much more about the judgment of others than it is about what you’re doing.  ezra klein  How much is social media also simply a vector for contagion of antisocial behaviors themselves, or depressive and anxious and self harming thoughts and patterns themselves? And I mean something very specific here. So back in the day when I covered more school shootings, there was an argument not to use the names of school shooters, sometimes not even — you would actually get the argument not to cover them, because there is a well known copycat effect. There’s also a well known effect like that around suicide. People know that the more they hear about suicide, the likelier suicide is to occur to others. There’s a Netflix show about the suicide of a teen called “13 Reasons Why,” and there was a big debate, including some research, about whether or not that itself increased suicide among teens. And so there’s an argument out there that as people are exposed to simply the knowledge that other people are doing these things — killing themselves, killing others, hurting themselves, hurting others — that that itself is enough for more people to do it. And anybody who’s spent time on social media also sees a lot more just discussion of anxiety, discussion of depression, those feelings as interpretive frameworks for your own feelings becomes more at hand. So how much is it just possible here that you’re seeing contagion as a force gathering its own momentum, that people are more connected to others having these kinds of experiences, and so they’re having more of them themselves?  jean twenge  I think that might explain some of the acceleration in the trend, or part of it. I don’t think it can explain why it started to begin with. So yeah, I think we have to consider that there was an origin to this, because — you know, why couldn’t it be that people are talking about how optimistic or happy they are online, and that becomes contagious. So I had to start somewhere, because there was that very sudden shift from millennials being self confident and optimistic as teens to Gen Z being not. And it happened very quickly. It was a much more stark generational difference than I’ve really documented in my whole career.  ezra klein  So I want to note that there are some studies that have looked at this and found very little effect, or no effect, or reverse effect. There’s a 2019 study in Nature Human Behavior that found, quote, the association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4 percent of the variation in well-being. There’s a 2018 study in Psychiatric Quarterly that also found very unremarkable results. You’ve kept, along with Jon Haidt and some others, this online compendium of studies on teen mental health. So when you see these studies, and there are a good number of them that come out and say, we checked into this, and we just can’t find anything significant or big here, how do you interpret what’s happening in them? And if they do, how do they change your priors?  jean twenge  So that 2019 Nature Human Behavior study has been pretty thoroughly debunked, because three other research groups analyzed the same data and found there was actually a very strong link between social media and depression, especially among girls, in that same data. It was very interesting. The same month that study came out, another research group in the U.K. used the same data set and found that three times as many heavy users of social media were depressed as non-users among girls. That’s not small. So then I and then another research group from Spain, who I have no connection to, later used the same, more sophisticated statistical technique that those authors did in the Nature Human Behavior paper, and we both independently came to the same conclusion, that first, there was some very strange methodological choices in that 2019 paper. And also, that if you zero in on social media, and if you zero in on girls, there are definitely significant and impactful differences. If — I know the 2018 “Psychiatric Quarterly” paper that you’re discussing. I reanalyzed that data for a paper recently — same thing. And it also turns out if you take that data and look at it in a more intuitive way, of — let’s just look at the percentage who are depressed at every level of social media use, it’s extremely common to find that pattern, that those who don’t use social media or use it only lightly compared to those who use it heavily, that there’s twice as many in the heavy use group, particularly among girls, who are depressed, compared to the light or no use group. So these papers that say, you know, oh, there’s nothing here often are just are looking at screen time overall. That 2019 paper included owning a computer. It also included watching TV, so they often don’t zero in on social media. They often don’t break down the data by boys versus girls. And they take correlations that translate to that doubling of depression and say, oh, that’s small. And I just don’t see how you could consider that small, to have twice as many who are depressed.  ezra klein  Tell me a bit more, actually, about that screen time question, because one thing you’ll hear in this conversation is we had a big moral panic about television. And it turns out that a lot of us grew up watching a lot of television, and many of us at least think we are fine. Maybe we are not.  jean twenge  I would argue that point, actually, but that may be a whole other discussion.  ezra klein  I sort of agree with you, that I think, actually, a bunch of the TV people were right about this, but tell me about that, because there is nevertheless, in the data as I understand it, a finding at this point that television does not seem to have the level of significant negative effects on mental health that social media does. But — so I’d first like to hear your point on, maybe we’re not fine because television messed with our brains. And then, I’d like to hear the difference between what you see in the data on using a screen for television and using it for social media.  jean twenge  So the impacts of television, is not quite as much for mental health, per se, as it is for things like the feeling of community, materialism, the amount people read, the national discourse and how tolerant it is of more complex arguments. These are all a lot of the things that we lost to television — social skills, I mean you can go on. Robert Putnam’s book “Bowling Alone” basically says, yes, it’s television, that’s why we don’t have all these community groups like we used to. But for mental health, for the moment, yes, if you spend a lot of time watching TV, you are more likely to be depressed. That is still true. It’s just that link is considerably smaller, so spending three hours watching TV is not as linked to depression as spending three hours on social media, for example.  ezra klein  So there’s an observation here, as you just mentioned, that how much people use is very highly correlated to what the effect of their use seems to be. But something you’ll hear about that is that maybe that goes the other way, maybe you watch a lot of TV because you’re depressed, because you don’t have other good options. Maybe you’re on social media all the time because you don’t have other friends. Maybe the causal arrow is going in the other direction, and particularly social media in this case, though TV in another era, and for some people even now, that you’re on there a lot because things are not going well for you already. It’s not that things are not going well for you because you’re on there a lot. How do you think about that?  jean twenge  So there’s two different questions here. So one is that overall pattern of, say, teen depression increasing so much after 2012. So there, it seems pretty clear that it’s technology leading to depression, rather than the other way around, because if it was depression causing technology use, you’d have to say this. You’d have to say, OK, teen depression started to increase for some completely unknown reason nobody’s been able to figure out yet. And that’s why teens started to buy smartphones and spend a lot of time on social media. Like, it just doesn’t work. So it seems pretty clear that at the generational level, we’re not getting reverse causation. Now, at the individual level, sure, that’s a more plausible explanation. But we have a good amount of experimental data now to suggest that at least some, and probably most of the causation is going from the technology use to depression. So a couple of examples, there’s been several studies that have asked people to either give up or cut back on their social media use. Those who gave up social media are happier and less depressed than those who continued their normal use. There’s also a really cool study that takes advantage of, basically, a natural experiment that Facebook rolled out at different times on different college campuses. And they documented that as a campus got Facebook, the mental health among the students on that campus started to suffer. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  So I want to look at some of the other broad theories, because you can buy the smartphone thesis broadly, and I do, and still wonder if there’s not other causal mechanisms happening here. One you will hear a lot is that we’re not seeing a mental health crisis. We’re seeing — let’s call it a reality crisis. One version of this is that teens today are upset and depressed and anxious because of economic prospects, because they’re coming-of-age in an era when capitalism is going awry, because they’re coming-of-age in an era of climate crisis, and wars, and Donald Trump. Tell me how you take that argument, that this is in some ways, a rational response to a declining reality.  jean twenge  So first, I think we have to take a step back and look at the broad picture. Is living right now, in 2023, really worse than it was, say, in March 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic? Is it really worse than, say, the millennials graduating from college during the Great Recession? Is it worse than 1992 or ‘93, during the height of the violent crime wave? Is it worse than in the ‘80s, when we thought Russia would drop the bomb tomorrow and the whole world would end? Is it worse than boomers getting drafted into Vietnam? A lot of people would say, well, when you think about it that way, no, it’s not. And then we can take the specific explanations — and I want to be clear. It is, I completely agree, important to consider these alternative explanations and see if they fit the data. So wars — well, if that were the case, wouldn’t you expect teen depression to have been the highest — well, especially, during World War II? No, it was lower by the measures we have then. And then more recently, then you’d expect teen depression to be the highest when we were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And instead, that’s when we had some of the lowest rates of depression and suicide among teens. Climate change — so one of the things that is in the Gen X chapter of “Generations” is the high school student surveys that ask about concern for the environment. Things like — government should change or ban products to help the environment, they should increase prices and taxes to help the environment, people are going to have to change their way of life to help the environment. So we have data on that between 1976 and 2021. And the peak of those attitudes was in the ‘90s, not recently. So that, I think, argues away from the idea that it would be worries around climate change. Plus, if it was climate change, what you would expect is that you’d see the biggest increases in depression among older adolescents and young adults, where these are issues that they’re talking about at school, they might be reading news. Instead, where we see the biggest increases is among 10 to 14-year-olds, so less likely to fall into that category of placing a lot of importance on issues that affect the nation and the world. All right, so that’s two of them. What were some of the others — economics, median incomes are at an all time highs, adjusted for inflation. The U.S. economy was on a tear between 2011 and 2019, and we see the biggest increase in teen depression. So most of these other things don’t fit the data all that well.  ezra klein  So if we look closer, though, at a kind of an individual issue here, you mentioned gun violence. And there — I think you’ve looked at data on school shooting incidents, times when a gun was brandished or fired on school property, those graphs really do begin to accelerate around your key data of 2012. And yeah, so smartphone use also rises then, but it’s when Sandy Hook happens. And I certainly remember Sandy Hook as a real, horrifyingly watershed moment in this. And you begin having more of these active shooter drills in elementary schools. So I mean Gen Z, kind of this generation that’s having a lot more safety focus and safety issues is coming-of-age routinely often drilling what will happen if somebody is there in their own school with a gun. So I could actually imagine maybe this ricocheting back and forth with social media as these issues are being picked up on smartphones and platforms, and becoming sort of more in the water. But it does feel to me like there is a different political dynamic that younger millennials and certainly Gen Z-ers are swimming in that might make politics more salient. And then, of course, a Trump era that might make politics more salient and fear more salient starting in the smartphone era, in a way that matches the data. I’m curious how you think about that interplay.  jean twenge  I think it’s really clear that it’s not school shootings, because if it were, then we wouldn’t see the increases in depression and self harm in countries where school shootings don’t exist, or are much, much less common than the horrific rate that we experience them in the United States. Yet, we do see that. We see the increases happening around 2012 around the world. So I think that does a pretty good job of ruling out that explanation. Plus, even though maybe if there was a turning point in 2012, well, school shootings were a really big deal in the late ‘90s, too, and teen mental health issues were improving at that time. So I think that also argues against that as an explanation.  ezra klein  While we’re on politics for a minute, one interesting wrinkle in the data here is that liberal teens are quite a bit more unhappy, have more mental health issues than conservative teens. In 2019 to 2021, liberal teens were nearly twice as likely to be depressed as conservative teens. You see this even swamping some of the gender data. So you see liberal boys being more depressed than conservative girls, if I remember this number correctly. So why are liberal teens less happy?  jean twenge  Well, that is a very, very interesting finding. So I dig into that in the book. And I think there’s a couple of possibilities. But the one that I ended up realizing fit the data the best, liberal teens spend more time on social media. And they have increasingly spent less time with each other, face to face. And there’s a bigger change among liberals in spending time with friends face to face. So back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, liberal teens actually spent more time with their friends, face to face, than conservative teens. And right around 2012, that flipped. So there’s a bigger decrease among the liberal girls, for example. So in the end, a good amount of that also is probably due to social media, because some of the other explanations don’t really fit quite as well — because you do still see an increase in depression among conservative teens. It’s just not as large as the increase among liberal teens. So some of the other explanations around politics don’t fit all that well. So here’s two things in that department. One is that if you look at the teens who say that they are interested in government and current affairs, so those are going to be people who are paying attention, you really don’t see a whole lot of difference based on those who are paying attention and those who aren’t. If you break it down by that, and by liberal versus conservative. The other piece is that you see the exact same pattern in loneliness. So loneliness isn’t really something you would expect to be that influenced by political ideology, per se, but it’s probably going to be influenced by how much time you spend with your friends versus on social media. And the pattern for loneliness and the pattern for depression look pretty much exactly the same if you look at it by gender and by political ideology, in terms of it increasing starting around 2010, 2011, and the increase being larger among liberals than among conservatives.  ezra klein  So why would liberal teens be more likely to use social media more than conservative teens? If liberal and conservative are basically picking up some other attribute leading to a disparate use of social media, what do you think is hiding in the correlation there?  jean twenge  Well, liberals, sometimes called progressives, are by definition more comfortable with social change. So liberal teens tend to have liberal parents, conservative teens tend to have conservative parents. Then — this is a guess, but perhaps liberal teens and their parents said, hey, social media, spending time online, that’s just what kids do now. And that’s cool. That’s just the change. That’s just what people do now. And conservative parents might have been more skeptical, and might have had more restrictions on their kids with social media. And that same thing could have interacted with the deface to face social interaction, because once teens start — as a group, anyway — start spending a lot more time online, then the norm shifts to doing that instead of getting together in person.  ezra klein  This gets to a set of broader ideas around parenting, which I associate not only, but substantially, with your co-author on some of this work, Jon Haidt, who’s made the point that we live in a parenting culture that’s increasingly oriented towards safety. And you’ve quite a lot of data about this in the new book, that parents today, much more so than parents a couple of decades ago, are trying to mow any obstacles out of their kids’ way. You have a great line where you talk about how it used to be the 13-year-old was a babysitter, and now a 13-year-old needs a babysitter. What do you see in both the data and the changes around parenting itself? How do you see that playing into this?  jean twenge  So I think it’s important in this case to start with the broader picture, that the theory that I really start with in the book is that technology is at the root of so much generational and cultural change, and that one of the outcomes of technology, because we have better medical care, is longer lives. When people live longer, you tend to get something that psychologists call the slow life strategy, that the entire developmental trajectory slows down from infancy to old age. Kids are less independent. Teenagers are less likely to get their driver’s license, to go out with their friends, to drink alcohol, to have sex, to have a paid job. Young adults take longer to get married and have kids and settle into a career. Middle aged people look and feel younger than their parents and grandparents did at the same age, so 60 is the new 50, this type of idea, because lives last longer, so that trajectory slows down. And that’s not all bad or all good. I mean, let’s focus on teens for a minute. Most parents are pretty thrilled that not as many teens are having sex or drinking alcohol. But it’s not all good, because if they also don’t go out of the house that much without their parents, don’t have a driver’s license, and never had a job, that transition to college or the workplace can be challenging. They just haven’t had as much experience with independence and decision making. So there’s trade offs. The slow strategy is not all good. It’s not all bad. It doesn’t mean kids are more responsible or less mature, it just means they’re taking longer to do these adult activities. But looking more at the edges, we can see some issues that if we have a shift in parenting that’s not just, OK, they’re going to take longer to grow up, but that’s in the mix — and we want to protect them from not just physical dangers, but experiences. Then, we’re starting to run into trouble. This is the observation that Jon Haidt and Lenore Skenazy have made with their organization, Let Grow, that parents who want to give their kids more experience with independence often run afoul of laws and norms that say, oh, a nine-year-old can’t walk a mile by themselves, or Lenore’s nine-year-old, she let take the subway in New York. Her kid loved it, and then she wrote about it and got all kinds of grief from people — that was dangerous, and so on. And this was a good 10, 15 years ago. So this is where you do run into trouble, when kids developing independence can be good and can be safe, but we have a parenting culture now that says you cannot let your kid out of your sight for one second. And that, I think many people have argued, and I would agree, takes things too far, and does a real disservice to children.  ezra klein  Well, there’s a weird disconnect here, between “you can’t let your kid out of your sight,” so there’s a lot less of independence out in the real world, but then this really expansive independence for fairly young kids, in the digital world, in part because it’s just harder over long periods of time to keep all the kind of parental blockers, and not let them be talking to their friends on Facebook Messenger or whatever. And so there is this distinction between the real world, which does have dangers — but I think it’s fair to say, in most of the data, they’re overstated in our culture, and the digital world, which the dangers are, if anything understated, it seems, for teens in our culture. But teens have a lot more freedom to traverse the digital world for hours and hours and hours a day with no supervision, while being out in the real world is much more heavily regulated.  jean twenge  I think that’s exactly right. And in my previous book, “iGen,” which is all about Gen Z, there’s one graph that I made which illustrates this. And again, it’s at the extremes — but that about 2011, the teen suicide rate exceeded the teen homicide rate for — it wasn’t the first time, but it was the first time it did it for years on end, where the two crossed. And that mirrors other trends that we see, that this generation is physically safer. They don’t get in car accidents as much, or fistfights as much, or drink alcohol as much. But perhaps because they are so unregulated in their time online, that’s why we have these record levels of depression and suicide and self-harm.  ezra klein  But there is something narratively weird about this. I mean, I grew up in the ‘90s and to some degree in the early aughts. And I remember the panics of that period, as I became a professional journalist in 2005. And I still remember that there was a lot of debate over teen pregnancy and abstinence only education and teen drug use. And there was a dumb panic over rainbow parties, which you can look it up if you’d like to know what those were, or what they were purported to be, at the very least. And we got all these numbers down. I mean, drug use is down, and age of sex is up, and teen pregnancy is down. And alcohol use is down, and smoking is down. And you would have thought, I think, from the discourse of the time, that that would have led to an overall improvement in teen well-being. And it seems like there’s been a very real “be careful what you wish for” here, that if you go back, I think, to the panics of the “why are the kids not all right” of 1999, a lot of that reversed. And now, the kids are in even worse shape. So what do you make of why so many things that we thought were a big problem for kids have gone down, and yet it turns out those were maybe correlates of things we actually wanted from them in the real world?  jean twenge  Yeah, and this is not at all to discount teen pregnancy and alcohol abuse and physical dangers — homicide, obviously — big problems, not that these are small —  ezra klein  Homicide is bad. Let’s put that on the table.  jean twenge  Yes. Let’s just make sure we’re being clear about this. These physical dangers are definitely bad, but they are correlates of teens getting together with each other in person. And yet, sometimes when teens get together with each other in person, trouble follows. That does happen. But the vast majority of the time when teens get together face to face, that’s good for mental health. They’re spending time together. They’re sharing about their experiences. They’re making sometimes lifelong friendships. At the very least, they’re having companionship through the journey of adolescence and high school, which is not always an easy time — usually is not an easy time. And trying to do that online is a pale shadow. It is not the same. And so yeah, we have a lot more kids that are at home not getting into these other types of teenage trouble. But that’s probably why they’re depressed, because they’re at home, in their bedrooms, on their phones, instead of being with each other in person.  ezra klein  I want to look at another theory here. So Derek Thompson had a piece in The Atlantic where he’s looking at a 2022 paper by Dirk Bethmann and Robert Rudolf that found, quote, higher standardized test scores and student assessments of academic competition were strongly correlated with teen anxiety. If you take two countries that are equivalent in almost every way, same G.D.P., inequality, life expectancy, air pollution, the nation with higher test scores and more student competition will have more anxious and depressed teens. What do you make of that?  jean twenge  Well, to really apply that principle to the stats in teen depression, we’d want to look at something that looked at academic pressure over time. And we can do that in these big surveys. So we can look at time spent on homework, for example. Did time spent on homework suddenly increase around 2012, right as teen depression started to increase, and did it keep increasing? In fact, the opposite is true. Eighth and 10th graders spend less time on homework in recent years, compared to previously. The pattern for eighth graders is particularly linear, and that’s the group where you see the biggest increases in depression and self harm. Other measures of academic pressure — so there’s a question on one of the big teen surveys, how much competition is there for grades at your school? That’s also gone down — goes up and down a little bit, it’s not as linear, but the overall pattern is teens are reporting less academic pressure in recent years. Then you could say, OK, well, let’s look at who’s doing the worst? And this is among individuals, instead of countries. So that’s one difference from that other study. So which group is most likely to be depressed? Is it the high achievers — say, those who have an A average and are planning to go straight to a four year college? Or is it those who do not have a stellar of a record and are not planning to go to a four year college? It’s the low achievers who have higher rates of depression, particularly the low achieving girls. So I think that theory falls apart pretty quickly, at least when you look at the U.S. data over time.  ezra klein  Well, let me try to steel-man at least the back half of that, because I take your point that a lot of things fall apart because they don’t explain the time series change. But they could be part of the background radiation of this, it could be good if you change them. It’s possible that what will reverse this is not exactly what caused it. So I don’t want to — I don’t want to hang literally everything on whether or not it explains 2012. And I think on the flip of that, you could imagine an explanation — and I’d be curious how you think about testing this or absorbing it — we’re in a world where there is a lot of competition, and where particularly post-2008 recession, and a much broader societal sense of economic insecurity and precarity, that yeah, if you’re a teenager who’s not doing great, that it’s actually getting scarier and scarier for you. And that to be in that position — and particularly to be in that position in a place where there’s a lot of pressure on it, right? You’re in a school that does send a lot of kids to four year colleges, to say nothing of really highly competitive ones, and you’re one of the kids not doing well, that the sense that you might just be screwed forever is going to be a lot heavier than it would have been at other times because the literal structure of the American economy is making it more likely now that if you don’t have a four year college education from a pretty good school, you’re at a much higher likelihood of being in real economic despair over time. I mean, it does feel to me when you look at the American economy overall that the sense of — of education is structuring your entire life — is reasonably going up, because it reasonably does, in fact, seem to structure a lot of your future earning potential. And so the fact that you’re not seeing the worst of the effect among the highest achieving kids would I think be natural there.  jean twenge  Yeah, and you can definitely see it that way. And there’s probably multiple confounding factors, too, that the kids who aren’t doing well could have a terrible life at home, not have any friends. That could also lead to depression. So there’s all kinds of possible things going on there. But the general idea is absolutely worth considering, and it is true. You look at median incomes of those who have a college degree, it’s considerably higher than those who don’t. I’m not as convinced, for a couple of reasons, that Gen Z teens are really feeling that, though. I saw a poll the other day. There’s been a decline in the number of young people who think a college education is completely necessary for doing well. That may be because of labor shortages out there right now. It could be because they see other potential opportunities in other types of careers. I also think it is really important to keep in mind what the reality is for college admissions, because I think there’s a really common perception that things are so impossibly competitive now. Well, you know what, that is true for the Ivy Leagues and Ivy adjacent schools. It’s a very small percentage of kids who are aiming to go to those schools. So if we’re talking about changes in averages, it’s not really a group that we’re going to want to focus on. What we’re going to want to focus on is the kids who maybe do OK in high school. Well, I can’t completely speak to other areas of the country, but where I live in California, the high school my daughter goes to — my oldest daughter — if you get a 2.5, you’re pretty much guaranteed admission to Cal State San Marcos, which is a perfectly good, even really good school to get your undergraduate degree. So if you get some mix of Bs and Cs, you can go there. And then let’s say you don’t, you can go to community college. There are opportunities. It’s not that it completely shuts off.  ezra klein  Is there any evidence of downward contagion here? So “Generations” has a lot of data on each of the different generations. And I’m curious if you’re seeing rises in — because I think there is some evidence of this — rises in anxiety and depression among Gen X-ers, among elder millennials — I’m an elder millennial, I have young kids now. I definitely think that I am part of the cultural dynamic where ideas and structures and frameworks of things like anxiety are more easily at hand. And I worry sometimes when I talk to my four-year-old that because I am practiced at recognizing something like anxiety in myself, I am, if anything, too practiced at offering it as an explanation to him, which will make it easier for him to grasp at. Is there any concern or evidence that something happening here is that the parents are in worse mental health or have more of these ideas or just have culturally been taught to be that much more responsive to kids’ feelings, and as such are beginning to create more contagion? And again, recognizing maybe that doesn’t explain the 2012 turn, but if you imagine that you could have a 2012 turn coming from smartphones and then different cultural dynamics amplifying it? If kids are getting a bit more depressed, and then parents who are more depressed are freaking out about their kid’s depression much more quickly and then embedding that idea of that story into them — like, you could see something like a feedback loop kicking off.  jean twenge  Or the alternative explanation would be if they’re more sensitive to it, they might be more likely to get their kids’ mental health treatment, and then the depression should be lower, because mental health treatment does usually work. So yeah, there is a generational story here to mental health, but it’s a little bit of a different one from what you’re telling. So when I first started looking at the data on, say — let’s just say clinical level depression, it was showing up for teens. It began to show up for young adults a couple of years after so 2013, 2014. You’re seeing it up to the age of about 25. For a while, it was not appearing among those ages 26 and over. Then it did. So after about 2015 or 2016, then you also start to see a rise in clinical level depression among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t really appear among those 35 and older, just basically not a whole lot going on in terms of rates of clinical level depression between 2005 and 2021. But there’s a pronounced increase among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t equal the increase among teens and young adults, but it’s still there, and it’s still very striking. This is in the millennial chapter of “Generations.” And this is a little bit of a mystery, because why would it be just these cohorts? Why are we seeing this primarily among those younger than 35? And in another data set, it’s more that we see it more among those 39 and younger. And why does it start to increase the most after 2015? So I go through a few explanations in the book. But when I posted some of this on Substack, I asked people for their ideas, because it’s very hard to figure out exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t look like it’s Trump’s election, because you see the same pattern in, for example, blue state of California versus the red state of Texas. And it happens right before he’s elected, not after. My pet theory was that millennials are disappointed by adulthood, given their childhood of optimism and confidence. And I think that may have some validity here. But if that were true, what you’d expect is pretty much all millennials — say, let’s take the first group born in the early ‘80s — that they would be depressed pretty much as soon as they hit 30. And that’s not really what happens. You see that much more with those born in the late ‘80s and especially the early ‘90s. So that made me think it had something more to do with what was happening in the overall culture around that time. And I think if you really look back on it, that was the time when social media and the culture at large really started to turn much more negative, and the negative news was getting more clicks, and it was spreading more. And misinformation was starting to gain hold. And it just wasn’t — I don’t know, I think if you look at, like, the kind of critical mass of pessimism in the country, the mid 2000s is where that seems to have begun. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  One set of solutions you often hear have to do with individual or even parental restraint around smartphone use, so grayscale your phone, or set limits on the screen time app or utility, or no phones after 7 p.m., that kind of thing. How do you think about that set of individual — either hacks or constraints — as an answer to this?  jean twenge  I’m of two minds about this. I think on the one hand, there are things individuals can do. On the other, it’d be even better if we had more regulation, particularly around social media. So there are things that we can at least try to do, so no phones in the bedroom overnight is my favorite one. And that’s not just for teens, it’s for adults too — tons of sleep lab studies, as we talked about, that you’re not going to sleep as well if that phone is in your bedroom. People have a tendency to, when they wake up in the middle of the night, look at it, and then that whole process starts over again with poor sleep. And many people’s protest to this is, yes, but I have to have my phone in my bedroom overnight because it’s my alarm clock. I have some advice for you. Buy an alarm clock. They’re cheap. You can buy two or three if you’re worried. Then there’s other things to say, but — so I have three kids. We have tried to delay the smartphone as long as possible and to delay social media even further. And I do think that is a good idea. If the kid really needs a phone, get him a flip phone. Get him a pared down smartphone, like a Gabb phone, where you can text, talk, and take pictures, and that’s it. There’s no ability to download social media or access the internet. So there are some things that we can try. The difficulty is parental permission isn’t needed to get a social media account. And kids are supposed to be 13, but age isn’t actually verified. School laptops have YouTube on them, at least ours do. So there’s only so much that individuals can do. Social media is extremely unregulated. And I think the time has come to regulate it more so we can have more of these solutions that are at a group level. So just as one example, if we raised the minimum age for social media to 16 and required age actually being verified and enforced that, social media would be out of middle schools. That’s already a time — developmentally, that’s very difficult, and social media makes it worse. And then kids would not be able to make the argument, which so often happens, but everybody I know has Snapchat, Mom. Then they wouldn’t.  ezra klein  So Republican Senator Josh Hawley has actually called for a ban on social media use for kids under 16. He cited your research, partially, in calling for that ban. It hasn’t gotten, I think, a ton of momentum, but your view is that’s actually worth it, that this is bad enough that we should just lock it out for kids under 16.  jean twenge  Yeah, I do think that. There are safer ways, better ways for kids 15 and under to communicate with each other than social media, which is not designed for children. It’s not even designed for teens. It’s designed for adults. Plus, then there’s the whole element of, why does social media exist? It exists because it makes money. We think it’s free. It’s free in terms of money. But us and our children are paying with our time. We’re paying with our attention, and might even be paying with our mental health.  ezra klein  We’ve also seen some interesting policies now in the United States. So Utah has been, I think, particularly aggressive here. In late March, Governor Spencer Cox, he’s a Republican there, he signed two bills. So when you put them together, Utah now requires parental consent before kids can sign up for sites like TikTok and Instagram. It prohibits kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., requires age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state, tries to prevent tech companies from attracting kids to their apps using addictive features. What did you think of that? And if you’re following it, how is implementation going on that?  jean twenge  Yeah, so I think these are the types of things we need to be doing, Just common sense solutions that — no, we don’t want to eliminate social media. It certainly has some benefits, particularly for adults. But there are some steps that we can take to try to make it safer for kids and teens.  ezra klein  I was genuinely struck when we began looking at who has proposed what here — Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana have sort of similar bills that they’re thinking about to Utah — and so, I should say for this point, does New Jersey. But it really is, I think it is fair to say at this moment, red states and Republican members of Congress who are willing to be — to use the old term, more paternalistic on this, which goes back, I think, a little bit to our conversation about parenting styles, where there’s possibly a tendency for conservative parents to be more willing to say, no, I have a rule here, and you are a kid, and you don’t get to decide. I’m sure you get a lot of incoming from politicians, from governors. I’m curious what differences in style, in kind of quantity of interest you’ve seen among Republicans and Democrats here.  jean twenge  Well, it’s interesting. At least in the Senate, it’s been pretty bipartisan. So Richard Blumenthal, say, he’s done a lot of work on this. There’s some other Democratic politicians who have done the same. For states, it’s true. It seems to have broken down that way more commonly than not. But I mean, how much do we have right now where there is bipartisan support? This is one of the few things that falls under that.  ezra klein  One thing you’re seeing in a bunch of states — California, where I’m from is one — is an approach that’s less about what I would call parental rights, or paternalism, and more about this idea of holding tech companies accountable, focusing on the collection and use of data, on privacy. How do you think about that?  jean twenge  I think it’s long overdue. We have to start thinking a lot more about this business model, where on social media, you’re the product. And your data is the product, and is that really how we want to be doing things? Plus, then there’s all the other issues of how is social media and the internet environment overall affecting politics? How is it affecting the national mood? We were discussing this pessimism which seems to be so pervasive now, which I think is fairly out of step with objective reality, and why is it so negative? It’s all of these things, that’s what gets traction on social media and online, about any kind of political discussion, regardless of any facts about positive things.  ezra klein  Are there other major policies you would want to put into place for mental health? And here, putting social media to the side, let’s say we banned it for everybody under 16, and kind of did everything else on the list that you would be interested in. What other things do you think we could do that would be good for teen mental health?  jean twenge  Well, I mean, that would be a huge step, and who knows if it’ll ever happen. But I have my hopes. I think that would make an enormous difference. You know, I think a lot of the other solutions are less straightforward. But if there are ways to combat the pervasive negativity that we’ve been discussing, I think that would make a big difference, too, because obviously, the mental health of young people is an enormous concern. But in doing further analysis for this new book, the other thing that started to really concern me was the extremely high levels of pessimism among young adults — not just about their own prospects, but about the world. It was really stunning to me. There was a poll that asked about — do you think America is a fair society or an unfair society? And the majority of young adults said unfair. And do we need to make fundamental changes to American government? Again, the majority of young adults said yes. And then there was a question, do you believe that the founders of the United States are better described as heroes or as villains? And four out of 10 Gen Z young adults said villains, and only 10 percent of boomers said villains.  ezra klein  This is a conversation I’ve had at different times with Jon Haidt. And something I sometimes hear in data like that is a way of thinking that, while harder for the individual to bear, may in some ways be better for a society. So to take the other side of that argument, I mean, American society isn’t fair. It’d be, I think, ridiculous to look at American society, with these levels of inequality, these levels of intergenerational racial dynamics, and call the society here fair. How you think of the founders, I think people can differ on that. And I probably wouldn’t call them villains. But I don’t know. I think you could say that there has been in America, like in a lot of countries, a pressure to sign on to various societal myths that make change more difficult, because if you have to agree that everything is good, then why change anything? And so maybe in the same way that trends that looked bad when I was a kid, like teen pregnancy, ended up having correlates that later on we sort of felt a little bit better about, like kids spending time together in person, I wonder if some of the pessimism that you’re talking about there doesn’t — in the more optimistic take — lead to a generation that, when it gets through the crucible of teenagerdom, is actually a little bit more open to changing or addressing pretty long entrenched inequalities that have been hard to change, you know, exactly in part because we’ve been pushed into the idea that to say something like America is not fair is to, in some way, insult America as opposed to observe something true about America.  jean twenge  First of all, that one item is probably a little less distressing than the others, the one about the fundamental changes. It depends on how you interpret that. I think this is the fork in the road. There’s arguably two ways that this could play out. So first, yes, we have a generation of young adults who want to change things. So if they do that by, relatively speaking, working within the system, we could have very positive outcomes here. And so far, there’s some signs of this. So Gen Z young adults are voting at a higher rate than millennials and Gen X-ers did at the same age. So if they are going to the voting booth and trying to change things to make it more fair, that can be a very positive outcome. Because yeah, if you see things as negative, then you take the steps to get things changed. Where I think a lot of people have more concern is if this ends up being more nihilism, just almost negativity for negativity’s sake, and there’s nothing we can do. And there’s some signs of that too, so — say, one of the big surveys of high school seniors has an item, ‘Every time I try to get ahead, something or somebody stops me.’ So that’s even more about individuals rather than politics. But the percentage who agree with that have gone up. So that’s an external locus of control. So whether you’re talking about individual prospects or politics, having that kind of defeatist attitude doesn’t tend to bode well. It is linked to all kinds of bad outcomes — poor performance at work and school being one example. And you can see that in the political arena, too. Everybody just throws up their hands, says, oh, nothing we can really do. It’s just the way it is. Things are just terrible and they’re getting worse. That may not be good.  ezra klein  But one thing I noticed there that I think is interesting, and I wonder if it points towards any other policies, is that when we started talking about social media, we talked a lot about time displacement more than negativity, right, that people aren’t seeing friends as much in person. Their social connections are weakening. They’re not sleeping as much. Sort of here at the end, we’re talking more about the stew of negativity. And I agree on the stew of negativity. I think it’s bad. But I’m curious on those other things. I mean, if we think those are powerful, it does feel to me like maybe there is more we can do on them. I don’t exactly know what it would be like, what a national program to help people sleep better would actually look like. But I wonder if you’re beginning to see this creep up the age scale if it doesn’t have some of the same effects. I mean, we’ve covered loneliness among adults on other episodes of the show. And that seems to be pretty bad. I mean, is that where you would begin to look?  jean twenge  Yes, depression is starting to creep up the age scale. So one thing I did in the book is look at time spent in person in a survey of adults, because I started looking at this in teens. And there has been a decline in in-person socializing among millennials, so in this case, looked at 27 to 41-year-olds. And there’s a little bit of a decline among those over the age of 50, for example, but not as much. So older generations, even though they also use social media, seem to have not cut back as much on their in-person socializing as young adults and teens have. So that might be one of the reasons why we’re not seeing as many increases in mental health issues among those ages 40 and over, or 50 and over, depending on the measure. But as an overall issue, yes, you know, loneliness is huge. So the surgeon general recently released a report on loneliness, with a number of solutions. And I think that would be a place to go, to start thinking about this. But it’s very difficult, because there’s not a whole lot of low hanging fruit, I think, in this area, in the way that there is around social media and teens. It’s a lot harder to solve loneliness in the society overall.  ezra klein  I think that’s a good place to end. So always our final question, what are three books that have influenced you, that you’d recommend to the audience?  jean twenge  All right, so my first two get to some of the issues that we’ve been talking about. They both have “problem” in their title. The first is “The Problem With Everything” by Meghan Daum, so I quote that a lot in “Generations.” She’s a Gen X-er like myself, and her observations about the changes in culture, particularly online culture, starting in the mid 2010s was very insightful and helped me codify some things that I had been noticing, in terms of the split between Gen X-ers and millennials. Particularly, the Gen X-ers pride themselves on being tough and resilient, and that is not as prized by later generations. Then, the second is called “What’s Our Problem” by Tim Urban. This is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in a very long time. It has a really amazing structure for understanding some of the polarization and division that we are really observing right now in American politics and culture. So — it has the really interesting rubric that’s not just right and left in politics, that there’s upper, in terms of talking about ideas, and lower, in terms of just kind of beating people over the head. That was a very fascinating way to think about the structure of American politics. And it goes much broader than that, into all the issues. So the third is for fun. It’s a fiction book called “Nine Ladies,” and it is “Pride and Prejudice” meets “Outlander.” And great plot and great consideration of what would happen if a 1987 born Elizabeth Bennet ended up in Mr. Darcy’s time, and then the author takes it from there.  ezra klein  Jean Twenge, your new book is called “Generations.” Thank you very much.  jean twenge  Thank you.

Get the latest Renfrewshire stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter  A Scots man who has turned his life around following two suicide attempts says he is now determined to help others overcome crippling mental health problems.  Martin Park from Paisley endured a 13-year battle with depression and anxiety before discovering the healing affects of Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).  The 46-year-old credits the personal development approach with giving him his life back and has recently trained to become an NLP practitioner in a bid to support others.  Martin, a carer at Kyle Court Care Home, has shared his story with the Express as part of his efforts to support other people in crisis this Mental Health Awareness Week. He told the Express: “This Mental Health Awareness Week I am really trying to get the message out there that things can get better, don’t suffer in silence.  “However bad things seem, there is help out there.”  (Image: Supplied)  Martin first began experiencing mental health problems in 2005 when his life crashed around him in a collision of despairing circumstances.  All within a short space of time he was made redundant, lost his beloved grandmother and was told he and his wife would not have biological children.  Struggling with the magnitude of the challenges in his life, he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  “My mental health went into major decline,” he said. “I bottled everything up inside. I didn’t speak to anyone, not even my wife knew how bad things had become.  “I had several suicide attempts and I always say that someone must have been looking over me as none of them were successful.  “I had stays in Leverndale Hospital. I was at my lowest point.” Receiving medical support, Martin started to recover and in 2009, he and his wife Christine adopted their eldest son Matty, with Taylor following in 2013.  Despite the absolute joy of welcoming new children to their family, Martin’s demons returned and his mental health plummeted for a second time.  (Image: Supplied)  However, a chance meeting with a fellow parent at his son’s football match proved to be Martin’s ultimate saviour as he introduced him to NLP.  “It was a miracle meeting Paul Elliott that day. After a few sessions with him I have never looked back,” he said. “NLP is like cognitive behavioural therapy but it focuses on the conscious and unconscious mind. The neuro element refers to the idea of thinking positively from the inside out – how you think about yourself and the world around you.  “The linguistics is about the language we use to talk about ourselves and others and the programming is how we align ourselves with the two.  “Some of the counselling I have had in the past didn’t really resonate with me but this just suited me so much better.”  The approach has had such a profound impact on Martin that he embarked on his own training to become a fully-qualified NLP practitioner and has completed a mental health first aid course.  In May 2022, he has used his new qualifications and lived experience to launch his own business, NLP with Parky.

"suicide","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Cheyenne"", ""Wyoming"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:45:00","CHEYENNE, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - Jaidyn Cowley a junior at Wyoming Connection Academy has become an advocate for mental health after experiencing mental healht struggles herself.  Jaidyn recently delivered a suicide awareness speech at a veteran’s organization banquet after experiencing the death of a friend to suicide and connecting with Wyoming veterans to hear their perspectives on mental health. Through the banquet, Jayden raised $1500, which she in turn donated to Grace for 2 Brothers, an organization that supports both teenagers and veterans.  Her speech is as follows  “I thought the hardest parts of growing up would be learning to ride a bike, brushing my own teeth and doing my hair. Now as a 16 almost 17 years old I realize there is way more to it then my child self wants to hear. Suicide is a big part of being not only a teenager but also an adult. I have lost multiple people to suicide friends, family and others. As of a year ago I was struggling with depression, never getting out of bed and never taking care of myself, I lost a lot and didn’t know how to process it. I realized I needed help and I began therapy. It helped me immensely. As someone who has personally suffered through these thoughts and heartaches alone I would like to bring more awareness to the situation.  In 2022 the Veterans Administration released the National Veteran Suicide Prevention annual report and the data shown was around 6,000 or more veteran deaths by suicide per year. Veterans are 2 times more likely to die by suicide then non-veteran adults. Big factors of suicide can be financial problems, relationship problems, family, work or trauma. Men have a big stereotype when it comes to this subject. People assume that men can’t show feelings, they are big boys and can handle things themselves. Not saying that women don’t struggle with this too, but people expect women to show emotion and not men. Men need to know that you don’t have to be the big guy, you can have feelings and you can share them. You are not alone. Stress can play a big role in this too. Overworking and overthinking are stressful. Focusing on your mental health is exhausting enough but sometimes we still have to get out of bed and take care of the things that we have to do, like a job, kids or school. Mental health and physical health are big things to focus on, just because your body isn’t showing it doesn’t mean your mind isn’t thinking about it.  Did you know that 22 vets take their lives each day? Here’s an example the Wyoming National Guard gave me: Say your feelings are in an iceberg, what you can see on top may be baggy eyes from not sleeping, bad body language or bad hygiene. You don’t see what’s under the ice, under the ice there are all the feelings and emotions that are trapped and only you know what they are, only you can see them and feel them. Eventually, the ice will start to melt and more and more will begin to show.. Ever thought of tools to help or maybe even a battle buddy? A battle buddy can be there to prevent you when you most need it, say you’re having bad thoughts and you happen to have someone to call or someone to talk to so they can distract you. The longer your mind is taken away from the thought the more likely you are to not hurt yourself or others within that time period. Your mind gets different things to focus on and your brain moves to a different subject. Trauma, depression, and stress can be blind to you and especially to others.  Mission 22 provides support to veterans and their families. Mission 22 is a non-profit organization that involves outreach, events and programs for long-term healing, wealth and growth. Mission 22 helps veterans living with physical, mental and emotional trauma. The compact act will help with suicidal crisis, even if you are not within the VA. The VA will pay for therapy, transportation to a clinic or hospital or anything else within those needs. Go to the Mission 22 website or call one of the numbers I will give you in a minute!  I don’t want you guys to sit through the rest of this banquet and think to yourselves, “well why are you giving a speech about suicide awareness if we’re here for hunting?” Hunting with Hero’s gives people an amazing experience with safety, fun and laughter. All veterans matter and  hunting is a great way to learn new things, experience new things and do it with friends and family. Hunting with Heroes offers you opportunities no matter the situation you may be in.  There is always someone willing to help, and no one is ever alone. Someone in this world appreciates you and your life more than you know. Pay attention to the warning signs, and remember to always check on your friends or loved ones. If you or someone needs help call 1-800-273-8255 for the veterans crisis line. Call 988 for suicide and crisis lifeline. If you would like to talk to a veteran directly put a 1 in front of the 988 # and a veteran will assist you. You can call or text these numbers for help.  I want to give a big thank you to the Wyoming Primary Prevention workforce and the National Guard, the VA and my family and friends for helping me make all of this come together.”  Jaidyn let us know in an interview with her that her goals are to create spaces, platforms and voices for individuals who may be struggling. She is active on social media sharing content that inspires others. She also said she thinks its extremely important to treat everyone with love and respect because you don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors.  She plans to continue to help people long term the best that she can.  Copyright 2023 KGWN.

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Pilibhit"", ""UttarPradesh"", ""India""}","2023-05-19T22:08:45","A 44-YEAR-OLD Dalit farmer in Pilibhit district died by suicide on Tuesday night after the police allegedly refused to take action in a case related to the alleged abduction and rape of his 15-year-old daughter. The girl (15) was allegedly abducted on May 9 by three men and taken to a place where she was allegedly raped by one of them.  She had returned the next day, after her father submitted a complaint at the local police station, but no FIR was registered, the family has alleged.  Speaking to mediapersons after his father’s suicide, the farmer’s son told mediapersons, “Three-four youths kidnapped my sister, and they kept her for one night… We went to get a case registered, but the police didn’t take action. No one heard our pleas. We had submitted a complaint on May 9 night. My father killed himself on May 17.”  The latest complaint submitted by the girl’s brother says, “On May 9, three men abducted my sister. They took her to a relative’s house and locked her in a room and one of them raped her. A relative of the main accused then dropped her at our village and put pressure on us to not lodge a case. The accused also said that if we pursue the case, they will get us framed in a false case. On May 16, they even filed a false complaint against my father in which they claimed that the youth (main accused) had consumed poison. Troubled by this, my father killed himself on May 17. My father was forced to commit suicide by the four people.”  A total of four people — the three youths who allegedly abducted the girl — and a relative of the main accused have been named in the FIR. The case, lodged on Wednesday evening, against the four has been lodged under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape), 306 (abetment of suicide), 342 (wrongful confinement), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), and under relevant sections of the POCSO Act and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The accused belong to the OBC community.  Asked about allegations levelled by family members that the farmer died by suicide over “inaction” from police, Pilibhit Superintendent of Police Atul Sharma said, “We got information about a suicide on May 9. The local police reached the spot and conducted an investigation. It was found that a week or 10 days days ago, the man’s minor daughter had disappeared and the family had informed the local police. Within 24 hours, the girl and the youth she had gone with were brought to the police station by a relative of the girl. We have been informed that both sides reached a compromise. We have now been told that the two sides had an argument later. That may have been the reason the man ended his life. All reasons are being taken into consideration.”  He said that a complaint was submitted by the family after the suicide and a case has been lodged. “Regarding allegations that a case was not lodged earlier over the disappearance of the girl, I have told the Additional SP to investigate the issue, and he has been told to submit a report within 24 hours. Any officer found guilty of laxity… They will face strict action from me,” added Sharma.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2x1Y2tub3cvZGFsaXQtZmFybWVyLWRpZXMtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1raW4tYWxsZWdlLWluYWN0aW9uLWJ5LXBvbGljZS1pbi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcmFwZS04NjE5MTM5L9IBiwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2x1Y2tub3cvZGFsaXQtZmFybWVyLWRpZXMtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1raW4tYWxsZWdlLWluYWN0aW9uLWJ5LXBvbGljZS1pbi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcmFwZS04NjE5MTM5L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T11:19:42","MGNREGS & social protection schemes are the way out, paper notes  Climate change is making agriculture an extremely risky, potentially dangerous and loss-making endeavour for farmers, increasing their risk of death by suicide. Representative photo: iStock.  Farmer suicides were consistently higher in years with a rainfall deficit, a recent paper has found, establishing a clear link between climate change and suicides among India’s agricultural workforce.  The paper Urgent preventative action for climate-related suicides in rural India, published by the International Institute for Environment and Development in May 2023, analysed the association between how far rainfall deviated from normal levels and the number of farmers dying by suicide.  Climate change has increased the frequency and coverage of drought in India. In 2020-2022, nearly two-thirds of the country was drought-prone, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. Badly impacted states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which reported 62 per cent, 44 per cent and 76 per cent of land as drought-prone, respectively, also reported high suicide rates among farmers.  Also read: Nearly 600 farmer suicides in 8 months: Is Marathwada facing agri-distress  Researchers Ritu Bharadwaj, N Karthikeyan and Ira Deulgaonkar examined year-on-year data from Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana to understand the linkage. Data covering 2014-15 to 2020-21 showed a negative correlation for all five states — indicating that the suicide rate is consistently higher in years with a rainfall deficit.  For example, in a year when rainfall variation from normal was five per cent, the average number of farmers dying by suicide was 810. “Based on the predicted values of our regression modelling for a rainfall deficit of 25 per cent, the number of farmers dying by suicide in a year would increase to 1,188 individuals,” the document noted.  In states reporting the highest suicide rates, farmers are more heavily engaged in cotton cultivation, which requires significant investment in seed, pesticide and insecticide, forcing farmers to borrow money from formal and informal sources. If drought or erratic rainfall cause the cotton crop to fail, farmers cannot make repayments.  This dominance of cash crops has contributed to the agrarian crisis. It has been linked to an increased risk of suicide among small-scale farmers. In 2021 and 2022, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, hundreds of farmers died by suicide after a pest called thrips parvispinus destroyed their chilli crop.  The change in climatic conditions during the cropping season might be responsible for the spread of the pest, Union minister for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament in February.  Also read: Excessive July rains destroyed 800,000 hectares of crops in Maharashtra  Farmers are among the most at-risk groups in India for death by suicide, accounting for 15.08 per cent of the country’s recorded suicides in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. While an estimated 75.5 per cent of the world’s suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries, India alone accounts for 26.6 per cent of all instances globally. The suicide rate in rural areas is almost double that of urban areas in India.  “Climate change is making agriculture an extremely risky, potentially dangerous and loss-making endeavour for farmers, increasing their risk of death by suicide,” the document said. This is a serious matter of concern, as in 2022, India reported the highest number of suicides since records began, it added.  However, the research also demonstrated that social protection programmes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) could effectively limit climate vulnerability in economies that largely depend on agriculture or seasonal work. MGNREGS aims to provide 100 days of guaranteed employment to every rural household each year.  In states where MGNREGS provided employment, the rate of farmer suicides was reduced, data from the five states indicated. When the number of work days taken up from MGNREGS increases from 50 million-150 million, the number of farmers dying by suicide drops from 1,800 people per year to 398 people per year, the analysis showed.  Such negative correlations between the number of days and the number of deaths by suicide were found in — Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana.  “This could be because wage employment helps diversify livelihood options, allowing households to maintain their income and consumption even in a crisis,” the paper noted.  In addition, if planned properly, water conservation and land development assets created through the MGNREGS employment scheme can deliver long-term drought-proofing and give farmers a chance to practice less resource-intensive cropping options, it added.  The findings also pointed to four preventative actions that could support farmers in coping with common risk factors by improving local climate resilience and mental health services. First was that the governments should consider social protection as a core strategy to protect farmers from the risk factors that can lead to suicidal ideation and from climate events that can precipitate this state.  “Governments must have suicide prevention in mind when designing social protection policies, including comprehensive risk analyses, anticipatory support via early warning systems, pre-agreed allocation and releases of finances at specific trigger points and other measures,” the paper said.

Police said that Jayakrishna’s wife T Durga Bhavani (26) was at their native place in Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh when the incident happened.During preliminary probe, police found that Jayakrishna’s friend A Chinni alias Chinna (23), a gym trainer from Chandanagar , was having an affair with Durga Bhavani since 2018.“After Jayakrishna said that he wanted to shift the family to his native place, Durga hatched a plan with Chinna to eliminate her husband to continue their affair,” said Jagadgirigutta inspector K Kranthi Kumar.Police said Durga alerted Chinna when Jayakrishna reached the city. Meanwhile, an unsuspecting Jayakrishna also called Chinna for help as his father had gone to a relative’s house.“Chinna made Jayakrishna consume six beers in three hours. After a drunk Jayakrishna fell asleep, Chinna doused him in petrol and set him on fire,” the inspector said.When police questioned Chinna, he told them that he had left the flat as Jayakrishna was drunk. He also claimed that the victim had financial problems which might have made him take extreme step.However, when police verified CCTV footage near the victim’s house, they found Chinna buying a matchbox and petrol from a fuel pump.

On Thursday, Sneha Chaurasia (21) was shot dead outside the dining hall allegedly by her classmate Anuj Singh who died by suicide later. A senior police officer said the duo were in a relationship and Anuj was angry that Sneha ended it and was with someone else.  In a 23-minute video recorded purportedly before the incident, Anuj had said she had filed complaints against him with college authorities stating that he was harassing her. SHO of Dadri police station Sujit Kumar Upadhyay said the woman had sent an email to the university in March stating that Anuj was allegedly harassing her. The university had called the duo for a counselling session after which they allegedly seemed to have reconciled, he said.  Police said Sneha had not spoken about this to her parents.  Police said they are also probing how Anuj came to possess a country-made pistol — the murder weapon — and smuggled it inside the university. “There is serious negligence on the part of the varsity,” said a police officer.  Police said the university gave differing statements during the investigation. “They initially said it was a case of dog bite, and refused to cooperate with the probe at first,” the officer said.  However, the university spokesperson denied the allegations. “The victim was first spotted lying on the ground by some of the students. Since none of them knew what was happening, they didn’t realise that she had been shot. Within a few minutes, a doctor at the site (campus health centre) identified bullet wounds as the cause of injury. We had narrated this to the police clearly. At no point did the university authorities try to mislead or misinform any officials regarding the cause of the death,” he said.  Advertisement  Sneha was later taken to a private hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.  Asked why Anuj was not kept under the watch of authorities after he allegedly shot Sneha, the spokesperson said they got an email from him titled ‘Suicide Note’ at 1.20 pm. “On receiving the note, the administrative head immediately initiated a hostel-wide concerted effort to locate Anuj. All possible resources were mobilised and he was found lying unconscious within 10 minutes from the time of being first reported,” he said.  The spokesperson also said a high-profile committee has been formed to probe the incident and how the student got the gun and brought it to campus.  Advertisement  Police said an FIR has not been registered yet since a complaint was not filed. “We will record statements of witnesses and file an FIR as and when we get the complaint,” said police.  Police said Anuj’s phone has been recovered but they have not managed to unlock it.  Meanwhile, a day after the incident, the campus wore a deserted look. Arham, a first-year engineering student, said: “The convocation has been cancelled, everyone has been asked to return home.” An official from the college administration said the convocation has been postponed and the date is yet to be decided.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpL211cmRlci1zdWljaWRlLWF0LXNoaXYtbmFkYXItdW5pdmVyc2l0eS13b21hbi1jb21wbGFpbmVkLWluLW1hcmNoLW9mLWhhcmFzc21lbnQtYnktYWNjdXNlZC1jb2xsZWdlLWNvdW5zZWxsZWQtdGhlbS1wb2xpY2UtODYxOTA5OC_SAbYBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9kZWxoaS9tdXJkZXItc3VpY2lkZS1hdC1zaGl2LW5hZGFyLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktd29tYW4tY29tcGxhaW5lZC1pbi1tYXJjaC1vZi1oYXJhc3NtZW50LWJ5LWFjY3VzZWQtY29sbGVnZS1jb3Vuc2VsbGVkLXRoZW0tcG9saWNlLTg2MTkwOTgvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2020-02-28","Not Discerned","{""Hove"", ""BrightonAndHove"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T00:20:55","Michelle O'Neill, who was a 54-year-old domestic abuse support worker from Eltham (Image: Hodge Jones & Allen)  A coroner’s report has found that a woman from Eltham committed suicide after subsequent failings from Oxleas NHS Trust regarding a lack of adequate mental healthcare – meaning she was “passed from pillar to post” and “denied any meaningful assistance”.  Michelle O'Neill, who was a 54-year-old domestic abuse support worker from Eltham, died by suicide on February 28, 2020.  HM Assistant Coroner Michael Spencer ruled that Oxleas NHS Trust's failures to provide Michelle with appropriate mental healthcare coordination played a significant role in her death.  The Coroner found a lack of long-term care planning and care coordination, leading Michelle to be ""passed from pillar to post"" within the Trust without any individual assuming responsibility for her well-being in the medium to long term.  Michelle had her first mental health crisis in March 2019 around a year before her death.  Various life circumstances, including allegations of domestic abuse against a former partner and the subsequent financial strain resulting from the abuse, as well as an ongoing investigation by the Metropolitan Police, took a severe toll on Michelle's mental well-being.  Despite these challenges, the Trust failed to implement a comprehensive long-term care plan or provide the appropriate therapeutic intervention necessary to support her through these difficult times.  Michelle's mental state deteriorated significantly, leading to her voluntary admission to the Millbrook Ward at Queen Mary's Hospital in May 2019.  She was discharged on June 14, 2019 and Michelle’s sister, Deborah, testified that the family had to constantly keep a watchful eye on her, but they were unable to keep her safe.  Over the subsequent four months, Michelle made multiple suicide attempts and as a result of one attempt, she was hospitalised for a month.  Despite the escalating severity of her mental health, Michelle was discharged from the ADAPT team, a community service intended to provide long-term therapy, on three occasions without ever receiving the necessary assessment or therapy.  Story continues  She was also discharged from other community services, including the Home Treatment Team and Greenwich Time To Talk counselling service, without the provision of counselling, psychologist visits, or medical assessments.  In January 2020, Michelle's general practitioner referred her back to the Primary Care Plus Team, expressing concerns that her current medications were insufficient to manage her symptoms – she was noted to be “very, very manic”.  Expert evidence presented during the inquest indicated that Michelle should have been provided with an urgent appointment and assessment at this point, and Michelle herself requested that her next appointment be brought forward.  However, the Trust postponed her appointment missing the opportunity to evaluate and mitigate Michelle's risk to herself.  Michelle's final disappearance occurred on February 16, 2020, when she went missing and travelled to Hove, where she made a suicide attempt.  Despite the Metropolitan Police notifying Oxleas of the incident and healthcare professionals classifying her as ""high risk pending further assessment,"" the urgent contact made by a nurse through voicemail was never retrieved.  The nurse, assuming Michelle was safe due to being with her family, made no further attempts to contact her.  On the morning of February 28, 2020, Michelle's body was discovered on Camber Beach.  The coroner described the service Michelle received from Oxleas NHS Trust in the year leading up to her death as ""disjointed and reactive” and said that ""proper long-term care coordination, with appropriate therapeutic intervention, would have made a difference to the outcome for Michelle.""  Michelle’s son Connar Higgins, her twin sister Janet O’Neill and her elder sister Deborah O’Neill, said: “Michelle had helped so many others throughout her life, but when she asked for help herself she was consistently denied any meaningful assistance, which added to her suffering.  “It has taken far too long to reach this point but we are rightfully glad that the Assistant Coroner has made critical findings against Oxleas NHS Trust.  “We urge anyone in a similar situation to seek legal advice and fight for justice. Thank you to our legal representatives for their help in obtaining justice for Michelle O'Neill, a wonderful mother, daughter, sister and friend.”  Have you got a story for us?

Hayley Chapman, Solicitor at Hodge Jones & Allen, said: “It is dismaying to see how a woman in Michelle’s position kept asking for help, but was repeatedly discharged without receiving any therapy, care coordination or proper recognition of the risk she posed to herself.  “It is right that the Coroner has recognised the seriousness of the Trust’s failures in Michelle’s case. “Michelle’s family have fought for three years to get to this point, and we hope that during this time lessons have been learned so that no other family has to suffer like they have.”  Hayley Chapman and Alice Hardy of Hodge Jones & Allen, legal representatives for Michelle O'Neill's family, were present throughout the inquest.

She said talk of homicide rattled the normally quite community nestled among the trees at the base of Strawberry Hill.  The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Acorn she heard six-to-seven gunshots from a sidewalk leading to the tennis courts at the development in the 29600 block of Strawberry Hill Drive around 9:45 p.m. on the 12th.  At first thinking the gunshots might have been kids with firecrackers, the woman did nothing, but eventually came outside and peaked over a brick wall separating her home from the community walking path. She said saw a man lying on the ground with a wound to the head and a black handgun near his feet.  Lt. Daniel Vizcarra, an investigator for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau, earlier told The Acorn the matter was being classified only as a male death and could not rule out homicide. The investigator also said no weapon was found at the scene. The lieutenant would not say if suspects are being sought.  But the resident wants to reassure the community that, in her opinion, there is no a killer on the prowl.  “The people in the community are already shaken up about it,” she said. “I think the dialogue was focused in the wrong area.”  Asked why she believes the man died by suicide when there was more than one shot fired, she said victims will sometimes pull the trigger several times before finally accomplishing what they intend to to.  She did say she saw a vehicle parked near the community area shortly after the gunshots were fired, and said that later the vehicle was gone, leading her and law enforcement to believe there might have been foul play.  The L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner is continuing an investigation and hasn’t made a final ruling on the death.  Over half of all suicide deaths in the United States occur with a firearm, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports.  Multiple, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are rare. And in a small percentage of the suicide attempts in which one or more shots are fired, the result is not fatal, the organization said.

Even after nine years of marriage, he would send me messages of affection and joy nearly every day.  Opinions in your inbox:Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns  Jan. 6 Capitol riot changed everything for my husband  All that came to an end following his shift on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Howie was assigned to exterior patrol for the Senate office buildings during the height of the violent protests at the U.S. Capitol.  When Howie came home that night after a 15-hour shift, he recounted an upsetting interaction with a protester he approached, thinking he needed assistance, only to be given a Nazi salute and shouted at in German. Howie was disgusted by the attack on an institution that meant so much to him, but this particular exchange, in the shadow of the Capitol, obviously bothered him.  Following his 15-hour shift, Howie got two hours of sleep before returning to work.  The next day, Jan. 7, after more than 11 hours into his shift, Howie’s police cruiser was involved in a collision that caused him to briefly lose consciousness. The required paperwork forced him to extend his shift to 15 hours, all while functioning on only two hours of sleep.  By Jan. 8, some of his colleagues noticed that he seemed tired and quieter than usual.  When he returned home on Jan. 9, after yet another 12-hour shift, he was distant. Normally ravenous after a shift, he barely touched his dinner.  He was scheduled to return the next day for another 12-hour shift, but he never made it. That night, he died by suicide using his service weapon.  Howie’s story isn’t unique. Law enforcement is a dangerous profession. Job-related stress, trauma, physical demands and long hours have real psychological consequences.  Policing mental health:Police can't handle mental health crises on their own. Reform is critical for public safety.  'Where has this training beenall my life?' How healing trauma could actually reform policing  Police face significantly higher risk of suicide  Police officers face a 54% greater risk of suicide than the general population. Last year, 180 officers took their own lives, nearly three times the number shot and killed in the line of duty.  Repeated studies by the Ruderman Family Foundation found that police officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in all line-of-duty causes combined. Nevertheless, police departments are reluctant to talk about officer suicides, and only a few of them have suicide-prevention programs.  While the stresses are relentless, cops are supposed to be “tough.” The perceived stigma surrounding mental health problems, and the fear of being labeled “unfit for duty,” keeps many officers from seeking help.  Howie’s was the first death claim made pursuant to the newly enacted Public Safety Officer Support Act, which finally recognizes that in many cases, like Howie’s, law enforcement suicides are indeed service-connected and should be seen as what they are – deaths in the line of duty.  My husband died defending democracy:My husband's suicide after Jan. 6 riots was a line-of-duty death. He deserves recognition.  Taking action after Jan. 6 deaths:As police memorial adds names, union urges inclusion of officers who died by suicide  The Labor Department's Federal Employees' Compensation Program also recognized Howie’s death as being work-related, the first such suicide-related claim approved. Earlier this year, the U.S. Capitol Police also officially recognized his death as being in the line of duty.  Nevertheless, the stigma surrounding police officer suicides is intractable – and dangerous.  Since 1984, for instance, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has honored the names of fallen officers, but the memorial still does not include the names of officers, like Howie, who died by suicide in the line of duty. It’s time to change the policy.  One of the pillars of the Memorial Fund is officer safety and wellness. We must ask whether this policy reflects the safety and wellness of those officers who fall victim to psychological stress.  The Memorial Fund is dedicated to honoring fallen officers and to making it safer for those who continue to serve. It is time the memorial honor those who served and sacrificed alone and in silence.

Though he knows the family of Alexander Bello-Ortiz is devastated, he says they're wrong that the Embry-Riddle student's death was anything but suicide. Bello-Ortiz was found dead in his off-campus home in September 2020. Police say he took his own life using a rifle. This past March, Bello-Ortiz's family, with attorneys, held a press conference at the police station, claiming the police investigation fell short, demanding justice. They believe the young student was murdered by someone known to him and that others helped cover it up. “I'm very confident that my people made the right decision and that the investigation was conducted thoroughly,” Young said. The family claims police disregarded evidence, including inconsistent statements and Ring doorbell audio from the scene that captured voices, sounds of a struggle, then a gunshot. After closing the case once, police did reopen it to look into that.“There's nothing incriminating on the audio or video,” Det. Dave Dinardi said. Dinardi with Det.

Police say there is no statute of limitations when it comes to a death investigation. They say should the family or attorneys for the family come to them with new information or evidence, they would certainly look at it, but they say what they've seen so far does not suggest homicide.“If we have any form of evidence that led us to believe that this was an actual homicide, we would not be closing this investigation,” Young said. WESH 2 reached out to the family and attorneys but have not heard back. The family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against those people they believe are responsible for Bello-Ortiz's death.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc2guY29tL2FydGljbGUvZGF5dG9uYS1iZWFjaC1zdHVkZW50LXN1aWNpZGUvNDM5MzQyMjLSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXNoLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9kYXl0b25hLWJlYWNoLXN0dWRlbnQtc3VpY2lkZS80MzkzNDIyMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T18:02:19","The content of this article may be triggering for some. Reader’s discretion is advised.  In the mid-1990s, model and actress Karen Duffy had a contract with Revlon, a spot on People magazine’s list of the most beautiful people in the world and a date with actor George Clooney to the Emmy Awards. She also had a persistent, piercing headache that prompted her to see her physician.  Duffy was diagnosed with sarcoidosis of the central nervous system, an inflammatory disease in which the immune system creates lesions. Since then, Duffy has had these lesions form on her brain, central nervous system and lungs. In her book on dealing with chronic pain (CP), she writes of how she initially hoped that treatment would bring her body and life back to normal. The pain, however, has been endless and something she has had to confront continuously.  Sadly, many CP patients do not feel they can live with their ongoing agony. According to a 2009 study in the journal Pain Medicine, CP patients have a higher rate of suicide compared with people who have short-term pain or those who are pain-free. Clinicians struggle to classify CP; some scientists say pain management has been overlooked for too long.  Chronic Pain Examples  Experts typically consider CP to be pain lasting more than three months, or past the expected healing time. There are two types — primary or secondary pain. Primary is when the pain is the main or only concern. Examples include migraines, lower back pain and irritable bowel syndrome.  Secondary is when the pain is the result of a disease or condition. CP can be post-surgical, cancer-related or due to conditions like temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ). Many CP sufferers do not fit neatly into one category, which can make treatment more challenging.  As many as 1 in 5 Americans live with CP. Back, hip, knee and foot pain are the most common sources of CP. Globally, as much as 30 percent of people have CP, with back and neck pain being the most commonly cited sources of pain.  Some CP sufferers turn to massage or physical therapy for relief. But for many people, the pain is unmanageable and interferes with their quality of life.  Read More: Redefining Suicide in the U.S.  Living With Chronic Pain  Researchers are learning more about what it means to live with CP. A 2015 literature review in The British Journal of Clinical Psychology found that CP is associated with depression, anxiety and anger. CP patients also feared pain that was specifically related to their condition.  In their daily lives, people with CP are more likely to miss work. Others struggle to sleep and then have to battle to make it through their workday. The constant pain and exhaustion make it difficult for some people to carry out simple daily tasks like carrying a laundry basket up a flight of stairs or sweeping the kitchen floor.  In this 2022 study, CP patients described themselves as living a life they no longer recognize. Their lives feel fragmented into who they were before and who they were after the pain set in. Once vibrant people find themselves fatigued after work and desperate to go to bed. Others describe how they can no longer work and feel depressed by their empty days. Many mourn their lost joys, like the physical activities they used to do.  ""So, everything — my whole life changed to just being able to walk and ride a bicycle for a little bit. That’s about it. So, all my other sports and activities are gone out the window,"" said one of the study participants.  CP also disrupts patients’ social lives. Pain or fatigue forces people to cancel plans or decline invitations. As a result, many CP patients have smaller social networks and have to cope with social isolation.  Many CP patients admit that, as a result of their struggles, they have considered completing suicide as a way to end their suffering.  Read More: Chronic Pain Makes You Think Differently  Chronic Pain and Suicidal Ideation  CP patients are about five times more likely than people with no pain or acute pain to have suicidal ideation (SI) — a desire to die. Some studies have found that between 15 to 23 percent of CP patients have attempted suicide.  Although researchers are still trying to understand SI and CP, there seems to be a pattern in the type and intensity of the pain. Back pain, for example, is more associated with an increased risk for suicide than other CP-like neuropathic pain.  Understanding Risk Factors  Researchers want to better understand risk factors so they can develop targeted interventions. Two major risk factors involve whether the patient is depressed and has a tendency to catastrophize (meaning they see their situation as severe and unfixable).  An increasing concern among clinicians is whether restrictions on opioid prescriptions will harm chronic pain patients who depend on pharmaceuticals for relief. A 2017 study in General Hospital Psychiatry found that abruptly stopping opioid prescriptions increased the risk for SI.  In late 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance that acknowledged many pain patients could take opioids safely. The Food and Drug Administration has also warned physicians that cutting a patient off from their prescription can cause severe withdrawal symptoms.  While some advocates argue that safe opioid use must be protected, others say that pain management needs to be better researched so that clinicians are better able to identify sources of pain and offer treatment options that provide patients with both relief and hope.

But what you might not know - is that every year - more and more construction workers are dying by suicide.  ""The construction industry is one of the top five industries for suicide-related deaths,"" said John Huggett the vice president of central operations for the Boldt Company.  According to the Center for Disease Control, suicide rates within the construction industry is four times higher than the national average.  ""They have hundreds of decisions that they make every day that put either themselves at risk or their fellow coworkers,"" said Huggett. ""All of these demands create a significant amount of pressure.""  That stark reality is what pushed the Boldt Company, a Wisconsin-based construction firm, to change the narrative.  ""We started realizing throughout our organization that many of our employees were really struggling with mental health,"" said Huggett.  In 2021 they partnered with the QPR Institute, a suicide awareness and prevention program that teaches people how to become gatekeepers that can recognize when someone is in a mental health crisis and get them help.  ""Just getting people to open up is half the battle,"" said Cade Fitzgerald, a construction worker for the company.  Fitzgerald, who's passionate about mental health help and knows firsthand how it can save lives, jumped at the opportunity to become a gatekeeper.  ""Just last week a foreman came up to me and he was concerned about one of his own workers. I met with that individual and we talked about what was going on,"" said Fitzgerald. ""When you get them to open up and talk about what's going on, it makes it easier to tackle the problems.""  Since launching the program, more than 100 employees have volunteered to become gatekeepers within the Boldt company, which the firm sees as a positive sign.  ""We utilize a sticker that goes on the employee's office door or on the hardhat and that sticker says it's okay to ask for help,"" said Huggett.  Getting them one step closer to achieving their goal of breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the industry  If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

"suicide","2019-05-04","23:30:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:01:06","The 31 year old Google software engineer who took his own life on May 4 by jumping from the 14th floor of the tech giant’s New York City HQ in Chelsea was described by one college friend as brilliant mind who graduated from Carnegie Mellon but was prone to deep and debilitating depression.  Police this week identified the suicide victim as Kevin Rawlings a senior engineer at Google. He was a computer science major with a degree from the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University who spent seven and a half years working for Google over three different employement stints.  College fraternity brother Jesse Salazar said Rawlings was an outgoing, fun loving guy until a close family member fell ill in Rawling’s junior year, sending him spiraling into deep depression.  “He had a 4.0 straight through until then,” said Salazar. “He stopped going to classes, started drinking heavily, and not coming out of his room.”  He said frat brothers had petitioned professors to at least let him try to pass the final exams and he said they managed to get him to study intensely for a few days before he took the exams. “He got above a 3.9--a 3.98 or 3.99,” Salazar recalled. “He was brilliant.” He said his friend went on to graduate with a near perfect 4.0 and seemed to have gotten over the paralyzing depression for awhile.  But in 2019, his older brother Robert passed away suddenly at the age of 34 and then COVID-19 hit.  Salazar also said he was difficult to keep in contact with him in recent years and he had not learned about his friend’s passing until contacted by this reporter.  ”We had wild, spontaneous fun in his college years,” recalled Salazar, “He was very outgoing.”  ”I don’t know what to think about what happened there,” said Salazar. “I do know one thing, it would have had nothing to do with the workload at Google. He eats problem solving for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Google was like his safe place if that makes any sense.”  Rawlings had worked at Google for three separate stretches and in his last most recent stretch was there from August 2022 until he took his own life around 11:30 pm on May 4, by jumping off the 14th floor of Google’s HQ in Chelsea on Eighth Ave and 15th Street.  Police had discovered Rawlings unconscious in the street outside Google’s Chelsea Headquarters after responding to numerous 911 calls. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Prior to returning to Google in August, 2022, he had worked at Hudson River Trading for a year from Feb. 2021 until Feb. 2022. Executives there did not return messages seeking comment. He had spent two earlier stints at Google, from Jan. 2020 until Jan. 2021 and a three year stretch from November 2013 until December 2016, sandwiched around a year spent working at Mountain View, CA-based Waymo, which was the self driving car division at Google which it eventually spun off.  During his college years, he had interned for three years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD and in 2008 created a tool for real-time 3D visualization and measurement of nanostructures. It earned him the Issac Newton Award for Outstanding Projects from the Washington Academy of Sciences, according to Rawlings Linked in page.  “Growing up in the suburbs of Maryland, Kevin excelled at sports, including baseball and swimming,” according to an obituary posted on Legacy.com by his family. “He was an enthusiastic runner and weight-lifter, always trying to outdo his personal best records. Kevin enjoyed playing Texas Hold’em with friends, and recently started playing pickleball and kickball.”  The obituary said he is survived by his parents, Mark and Barbara Rawlings of Lake Frederick, VA, his paternal grandmother, Norma Rawlings of Ellicott City, MD, his sister Jennifer Wernly (Mark) of Norfolk, VA, and his three nieces, Anna, Eleanor, and Kara.  “Kevin was a wonderful son, sibling, and Uncle, and we will forever miss him dearly,” the obituary stated. Plans for a remembrance service were still being formulated at the time of publication.  He was the second Google worker to take his own life in NYC this year although the two do not appear to be connected.  On Feb. 16th, the NYPD discovered 33 year old Jacob Pratt dead after apparently hanging himself in his Chelsea apartment on the corner of W. 26th St. and Sixth Ave.  Straus News has reached out to Google for comment, but had not heard back at the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cnRvd25ueS5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0taWRlbnRpZmllZC1yZW1lbWJlcmVkLWFzLWJyaWxsaWFudC1lbmdpbmVlci1YQTI1MzQxMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Om loved camping and kayaking with his cousins. ""He taught himself to play the piano, played the bass clarinet and drums, and was a gifted saxophone player. Sadly, Om had his saxophone in hand the day he was senselessly murdered,"" the description continues.  Citing court documents, KSL reports Om's parents were in the middle of a lengthy custody battle when he was killed. His mother, Leah Moses, said Gandhi was abusive.  ""My son Om's death was preventable,"" Moses said in a statement shared by the National Safe Parents Organization, per the outlet. ""The family court system professionals ignored my pleas for help to keep my son safe.""  ""My son's father persuaded everyone I was the problem, when in fact I was just trying to protect my child. I never want this to happen to another family, to another child. If the courts would listen to and believe survivors, this nightmare could stop,"" Moses' statement said.

"suicide","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T04:26:19","New Research Examines Firearm Culture in Families of Youth Who Died by Firearm-Suicide  San Francisco — A new study, released today at the American Psychiatric Association’s Annual Meeting, examined perspectives on firearms among the families of youth who completed suicide by firearm, and found that in many cases, youth who died by gun-related suicide had been introduced to these weapons through culturally rooted familial traditions. The researchers also examined family members’ perspectives on suicide prevention interventions, including the State of Maryland’s Extreme Risk Protective Order Law, passed in 2018.  The study involved 2.5-hour semi-structured psychological autopsy interviews with the loved ones of nine youths, aged 17-21, who died from firearm-related suicide. Next of kin were approached by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to request consent for contact by the research team. Clinicians on the research team conducted interviews and a team of two researchers analyzed the interviews and identified and reached consensus on interview themes.  Most families had some degree of familial engagement with firearms. In more than two-thirds of the families, the youth used family-owned firearms when completing suicide. Over three-quarters of the youth had received mental health care prior to their deaths, with many receiving care in the weeks prior to their passing. In many cases, parents shared that they had not considered their family-owned firearms to be sources of danger. Several parents noted that if a clinician had expressed concern about firearm risk, they may have acted to reduce the risk. Several also shared that they would have considered using Maryland’s Extreme Risk Protective Order Law if it had existed at the time and they were made aware of it.  Suicide represents the second leading cause of death among youth, with half of those deaths involving firearms. This study furthers understanding of diverse culturally rooted familial firearm narratives and suggests that these narratives influence parents’ thinking about firearm risk, including when their children show warning signs of suicide. The authors conclude that “successful suicide prevention interventions must work to help families rescript firearms from tools seen as markers of familial cohesion and conveyors of intergenerational history to instruments that pose a threat to youth with suicide risk factors.” The findings are part of continuing efforts to interview the next-of-kin, family, and friends of youth who died by firearm suicide, with ongoing results and analysis anticipated.  The study authors included Matthew Kelly, Ph.D., M.P.H., Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Aubrey DeVinney, B.A., Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Holly Wilcox, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Ling Li, M.D., Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Baltimore, MD; and Paul Nestadt, M.D., Johns Hopkins Medicine.

(KOIN) – In a case that has little-to-no precedent in Oregon, a local man was charged with manslaughter in Wasco County for allegedly assisting a woman to commit suicide in The Dalles.  According to the county district attorney, 29-year-old Alexandra Cagle died in March from carbon monoxide poisoning after Joseph Newman, 60, allegedly helped her buy a gas-powered water pump and showed her how to start it in a U-Haul pickup truck they had rented.  Not long before her death, the DA says Cagle sent Newman an article about an infamous case in Massachusetts where a teenager encouraged her boyfriend to use a generator in his truck to create carbon monoxide poisoning.  Katie Early, Cagle’s sister, told KOIN 6 News she suffered from bipolar disorder.  “It really makes me sick because I don’t understand how you can treat another human being that way,” Early said. “She had a diagnosed mental illness.”  Newman was charged with manslaughter in the second degree.  District Attorney Matt Ellis said he was originally hesitant to take the case to the grand jury, but eventually felt he “owed it to the victim’s family to at least put this in front of the grand jury and let them decide.”  The relationship between Cagle and Newman is unclear. Her family says she was in a relationship with another man who helped her try to overcome her mental health struggles. Cagle’s sister says she only knew Newman for three months or fewer, and she may have been staying at his house after they first met at bar.  Ellis said he looked for precedent cases, too, and didn’t see many cases since the ‘70s on the theory of manslaughter in the second degree.  “It’s one of those areas where…this person’s behavior is quite disturbing and abhorrent that – to be in this relationship with somebody who’s suicidal – to give them the means to do something like this,” Ellis said. “It’s a very gray area of our legal system.”  Newman was assigned court-appointed Defense Attorney Sean Pank, who said Newman spent 20 years in the Air Force and is otherwise a lifelong resident of The Dalles. Pank also touched on how unusual the case is, calling it a “novel theory as far as manslaughter in the second degree.”  According to the county district attorney, 29-year-old Alexandra Cagle died in March from carbon monoxide poisoning after Joseph Newman, 60, allegedly helped her buy a gas-powered water pump and showed her how to start it in a U-Haul pickup truck they had rented.  “I have really tried to set aside my expectations and my wants and put my trust and my faith in the judicial system,” Early said. “Alex has always been very eccentric. She was loving, she was over the top, just loved people. And when she loved you, you were in her circle. She gave all of herself to you.”  Stay with KOIN 6 as this story develops.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2luLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3JlYWxseS1tYWtlcy1tZS1zaWNrLW9yZWdvbi1tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW1hbnNsYXVnaHRlci1mb3ItYWxsZWdlZGx5LWFzc2lzdGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kcy1zdWljaWRlL9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2luLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3JlYWxseS1tYWtlcy1tZS1zaWNrLW9yZWdvbi1tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW1hbnNsYXVnaHRlci1mb3ItYWxsZWdlZGx5LWFzc2lzdGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kcy1zdWljaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-09-24","22:00:00","{""WestChester"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:00:00","    A Prayer Against Suicide  By Emma Danzey  ""Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.""- Luke 12:7  We sat there in the women's retreat for college students, and after doing an activity to reveal our struggles, many began to share vulnerably that they have dealt with suicidal thoughts. My heart sank. I did not know. Within each young woman's personal life stories, somewhere along the way, life got so difficult for them, so overwhelmingly depressing that they had the thought to end their precious lives. Suicide is glamorized in culture. When celebrities take their lives, it trends. When tv shows come out on Netflix about suicide as a viable option for teenagers, it popularizes the horrific act. Today, we will take the time to pray against this horrible decision and those it affects.  Let's Pray:  Jesus,  By Your strong hand and powerful arm, nothing is too hard for You. You tell us all that we are made in Your image. You say that You created us and called us very good. Today we cry out on behalf of humanity in a sin-filled world. God, we ask that You protect the minds of those who are dealing with thoughts of depression and suicide. Life is so valuable, and we only get one here. Help them see the beautiful plan through Jesus You have for their lives. Father, help them to know that their lives are worth living because You gave Your life for them to have hope. Remind them that You are their living hope and that nothing in all creation can separate them from Your love.  Lord, we pray against the enemy's attacks and ask that You surround those who love You with Your armor. For those who have not accepted You as Savior and who deal with suicidal thoughts, open their eyes to the truth of Your gospel. For those who have fought many years and are weary from the constant battle, renew their hope in You today. Remind them that this is the day You have made, and they can rejoice and be glad. Give them the ability to see past their sadness and hopelessness. Reveal Your strength and goodness in their lives. You say that we are all more valuable than the ravens and the lilies and how well you care for them. We pray that the joy of having You as their Savior will be greater than the trials and suffering they face.  God, we pray a special prayer for the loved ones of those who struggle. Will you please help them to know that you care for them too? Would you provide them with support from the church body? Give them grace for the day and confidence in You. Father, remind them they are not alone, and You see them. Help them not to carry this burden alone but to allow you to come in and give them your yoke because it is easy and light. Remind those with thoughts of fear and worry that You are the Good Shepherd. You tell us that we lack nothing. You make us lie down in green pastures; You lead us beside quiet waters; You refresh our souls. We claim this truth today. We pray those who have kept quiet in shame will be broken free from this and share their challenges. God, prevent the enemy from silencing them in their pain. We pray for healthy boundaries within relationships. We ask for Your Spirit-led wisdom. We pray for those who have already lost loved ones due to suicide. Give them comfort and a voice to make an impact to help others. God, thank You for making us all in Your perfect image. Thank You for giving us a purpose and different skill sets in this life. We pray against the trauma and the oppression which can cause such devastation. We thank You for giving victory and that even in our losses and loneliness, we can find great comfort in You and your Church. Amen.

"suicide","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Chico"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T11:06:13","CHICO — When someone you love is showing signs of suicide, it can be hard to find the right words to say.  For church congregations, the topic may be difficult to bring up and stigma may prevent any discussion at all.  But a workshop to address suicide in church congregations aims to make that change.  Chico Police Department Chaplain Eileen Brown will be hosting Soul Shop, a suicide prevention workshop 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, May 20 at the Center for Spiritual Living located at 14 Hillary Lane in Chico.  The workshop aims to teach church leaders, or anyone interested, on how churches can help prevent suicide, said Brown.  “It’s teaching them to look for that and merely coming up and saying, “How are you doing? What’s going on in your life? Do you need help right now? Can we talk?’” Brown said. “It’s as simple as that, but people are afraid to do that.”  Brown said the workshop is spiritually based and encourages congregations to look for signs of disconnect and of avoidance; people going through a divorce or other characteristics shown by someone possibly thinking about suicide.  The workshop will also cover a history of suicide, instances of suicide mentioned in the Bible and how to integrate suicide prevention into church life and ministry.  Brown is a minister for the Chico Center for Spiritual Living, served 16 years as a Chico police chaplain and has been called to assist families dealing with suicide in more than 15 instances — including after the suicide of a 15-year-old daughter and 90-year-old grandfather.  She draws on her own experience at 13 when she was first exposed to suicide of a person who was a family friend.  “I didn’t know what I was supposed to do with death; I barely understood it. I reflect back on that because people don’t know what to do when somebody takes their own life,” she said.  When suicide is brought up, Brown says, what often happens in churches is people don’t know how to reach out and may ignore issues because of that inability of knowing what to say.  “They don’t know what to say; they don’t know how to approach it. Typically what happens is people don’t say anything at all,” Brown said. “They won’t mention your spouse, your child, your parent — whoever it was that took their own life — they won’t mention that person ever again because they think it will be too painful for you.”  Brown said the stigma that prevents people from talking about suicide may be attributed to outdated cultural and religious beliefs.  She said there is very little training for ministers for suicide prevention and how to work with survivors of suicide — and her workshop is the only one of its kind between Sacramento and south Oregon.  While some churches may not know how to deal with suicide, Brown says congregations and churches have the ability to lift up a person dealing with suicide or with the death of a family member.

Congregations can do that. They can be the one that shows up at the door — ‘Come on let’s have a cup of coffee. It’s time to talk,’” Brown said. “‘Tell me about … share with me … and all we have to do is listen.”  Registration for the workshop is $10 and registration information can be found at bit.ly/3zyNApS or by calling 895-8395.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50LXdvcmtzaG9wLWFpbWVkLXRvLWVkdWNhdGUtY2h1cmNoLWNvbmdyZWdhdGlvbnPSAWZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljb2VyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3N1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudC13b3Jrc2hvcC1haW1lZC10by1lZHVjYXRlLWNodXJjaC1jb25ncmVnYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T04:56:23","May 19, 2023 Tweet  The Conversation: Thanks to easy access, guns help drive suicide  More than half of all firearm deaths in the United States in 2021 were attributable to suicide, according to February 2023 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Suicide deaths involving firearms — the most common means of suicide in the U.S. — have increased 28% since 2012. Groups particularly at risk include men and veterans, who are more likely to have access to and experience with firearms.  Research also suggests alcohol use is a significant risk factor for gun-related suicides, as opposed to suicides involving less lethal means. This is particularly true for youthful and middle-aged adults.  Access to firearms is a key risk factor for suicide, due to their lethality. Studies show that suicide attempts involving firearms prove successful 90% of the time.  Suicide is often an impulsive act, and when a person has access to swift and lethal means such as a firearm, there is limited opportunity to intervene or allow for a suicidal impulse to pass.  It is a common myth that once a person has made up their mind to die by suicide, it isn’t possible to prevent them from doing so. In fact, most individuals who survive an attempt do not attempt suicide again, and those who survive an initial attempt using one method are unlikely to switch to a different method.  These findings underscore the importance of restriction of access to firearms as a critical suicide prevention strategy.  Research indicates that storing a firearm safely reduces the risk of the owner — as well as others, including any children living in the home — dying by suicide.  Firearm safety measures include gun safes, lockboxes, storage separate from ammunition and either voluntarily or involuntarily removal of firearms from the home when a person displays a mental health condition or suicide warning signs.  Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted so-called red flag laws. These allow law enforcement, family members and sometimes school administrators or health care professionals to petition the court to remove a firearm from the home of a person at risk of harming themselves or others.  In addition to these measures, policymakers and care providers can address other risk factors for suicide as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy. This includes screening and identifying people who are at high risk, treating underlying mental health conditions, improving access to mental health care and encouraging stronger family and community connections.  Prevention priorities also include reducing risk factors such as exposure to violence, financial strain and chronic illness.  Another strategy is training friends, teachers, clergy, coaches and other community members in assessing suicide risk and referring individuals to resources. This has been shown to increase both the likelihood that a trained helper offers needed assistance, as well as the likelihood that the person who is suffering seeks help.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T01:08:53","SALT LAKE CITY – After the Utah murder-suicide involving a doctor and his 16-year-old son, the boy’s mother and advocates are calling for changes to the state’s family court system to prevent similar tragedies in the future.  Parth Gandhi, 49, killed his son Om before taking his own life on May 13, Salt Lake City police said. They have not released any information about a possible motive.  The boy’s mother had raised concerns about the safety of her son, court records show. She’d long sought primary custody of the boy in the family court case that began more than a decade earlier with the couple’s divorce.  She’d also advocated for change at Utah’s Capitol, urging lawmakers to follow Pennsylvania in passing reform to help keep children safe as custody disputes play out in the legal system, Danielle Pollak said. She is the policy manager at the National Family Violence Law Center at George Washington University.  “It’s so tragic that only months later, her child was murdered,” Pollack said. She helped Moses and other parents get in touch with Utah lawmakers about potential reforms. “He should have been safely with his mom, who was calling out for help and protection.”  The Pennsylvania measure, known as “Kayden’s law,” directs judges to consider domestic violence allegations in family court cases. It was named for a 7-year-old child killed by her father, who then took his own life. It also became the model for a 2022 federal law.  Utah state Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, said he spoke with Moses and others who urged him to sponsor a bill in the 2023 Legislature. He called the tragedy “heart-wrenching.”  The proposal wasn’t ready in time to advance, he said, but he’s planning to bring it back next year. It would require certain training for judges and commissioners on domestic violence, specify credentials for expert witnesses, and restrict the use of reunification therapy that’s sometimes ordered in custody battles.  Asked whether the changes could have prevented Om’s death, Weiler said, “If this had passed two or three years ago, then maybe it would have had more of an effect. But I will say this as well: As tragic as the situation is, it’s impossible for a court commissioner or a district court judge to predict the future.”  More training on the dynamics of the family in the home and the effects of trauma on children can only help, he added.  “Not all of our judges have experience with domestic violence or the same amount of training,” Weiler said. “We’ve appointed several judges who were corporate attorneys, so they never really dealt with these issues at all until the day after they took the bench, and, you know, that’s quite a jump.”  Colorado lawmakers passed a similar measure this week, sending it to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk. California was also considering the move, while a Montana proposal failed this year.  In pictures from a rally on Utah’s Capitol steps in February, Moses is seen holding a sign reading “Children’s rights are human rights.”  Now she says she doesn’t want other families to endure anything like hers has.  “My son Om’s death was preventable,” she said in a statement. “The family court system professionals ignored my pleas for help to keep my son safe.”  A spokesperson for Utah’s court system declined to comment.  At a December court hearing, Moses’ attorney had raised concerns about the safety of her son, who was in his father’s custody, according to audio recordings released to KSL through a public records request.  “Your honor, we would prefer to have a change in custody just to make sure that Om is safe and in an environment that is safe for him,” her attorney Alan Dunaway said in Salt Lake City’s 3rd District Court.  Commissioner Joanna Sagers temporarily ordered the boy to stay with his mother. She allowed him to return to his father after the boy’s guardian ad litem – an attorney appointed to represent the child’s best interest – said the evidence didn’t indicate a change in custody was needed.  Sagers noted in the hearing that a custody evaluation recommended the boy speak with Utah’s Division of Child and Family Services, as well as a therapist.  Parth Gandhi’s most recent attorney, Jessica Couser, told KSL the decade-long case involved capable players in Utah’s legal system before the family’s “immeasurable loss” last weekend.  “I was only involved in this case for a short time, but, as is common in many lengthy custody cases, there were many competent and experienced professionals involved with this family over the years,” Couser said, “all of whom worked toward the common goal of protecting the Gandhi children.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzU1MTkxMy9tdXJkZXItc3VpY2lkZS1zcGFya3MtY2FsbHMtZm9yLXJlZm9ybS10by11dGFocy1mYW1pbHktY291cnQtc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2018-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T01:47:00","Enrique Echeburúa (San Sebastian, Spain, 72 years old), Professor Emeritus of Clinical Psychology at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), says that when a suicide occurs, there are other victims beyond the deceased, and they do not receive adequate support. “The first thing [we need to do] is make it easier for the family that has lost a child, or the person who has lost their partner, to unburden them, to be able to talk about it,” he explains. “Silence is the worst thing, because many people don’t talk to them, even their social circle of neighbors and friends, because they don’t know how to approach [them], which leads to social isolation,” Echeburúa continues in a video call conversation.  The psychologist just published a book entitled Death by Suicide. In just over 150 pages, Echeburúa summarizes the fundamental aspects of a particularly human and painful phenomenon. “We have a very high cognitive capacity that can make us experience suffering and disappointments very intensely, and it makes us aware that we can put an end to our lives. People who attempt suicide want to stop suffering, not stop living,” he says. In the book, he presents suicide as a public health problem and explains it so we can better understand it and combat the stigma that has made it difficult to take adequate prevention measures and increased the suffering of survivors.  Question: Can suicide be addressed as if it were a disease?  Answer. Suicide is not a mental disorder like depression or addiction. In a high percentage—70% to 90%—of cases, there is an underlying mental disorder but there are 10% to 20%, who are people who may reach a point where they make an existential calculation, see that their life no longer makes sense, that they do not have a life project, and they feel isolated and experience a certain tiredness of living. These people may be influenced by external factors, such as a financial setback. At a given moment, shame or feeling socially ostracized can also lead them to an impulsive act of desperation, because death is seen as the only way to escape suffering.  Q. At the moment, there’s a lot of concern about suicides among young people and adolescents in particular. Has the situation worsened?  A. In Spain, most deaths by suicide do not occur in young people. The highest incidence is in adulthood, between 30 and 59 years of age, and a second peak occurs in those over 65 years of age, who may account for approximately 25 to 30% [of the cases]. Teenagers and young adults, between 15 and 30 years of age, may account for about 13%. [Suicide] is much less common than in the elderly, but we are much more sensitive to suicide by a young person. Another important issue is that, in Spain, the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents has decreased dramatically in recent years, and those deaths affected mostly young people. Now, suicide seems much more relevant as [a cause of] unnatural death in this [age] group.  Q. There is also more concern about mental disorders other than suicide among teenagers.  A. There are other phenomena [that are] linked to suicide but are not suicide, such as self-harm in adolescent girls and suicidal ideation. There are many people who have suicidal ideation that, if not treated properly, can eventually translate into a fatal suicide attempt. In Spain, since the pandemic, there has been a clear increase in the number of people with suicidal ideation and teenagers who self-harm. On the other hand, with respect to the number of deaths by suicide, there hasn’t been enough time for us to be able to draw conclusions. In principle, suicide is relatively stable numerically. The most relevant fact is not the increase, but the fact that the numbers have not decreased, when [deaths] have been reduced in other areas, such as traffic accidents, homicides and femicides. It is also true that there is a much greater sensitivity to this phenomenon now, which is clearly a positive thing, because it can lead us to invest more resources [in stopping it].  Q. Why hasn’t the number of deaths by suicide decreased?  A. There is a lack of understanding, and suicide prevention programs, which are [just] starting to develop now, have not been done in a meaningful way. The situation is much better than it was five years ago. Suicide prevention programs are included in [Spain’s] National Mental Health Strategy, which has made this problem a priority issue. [Spain’s] autonomous communities also have suicide prevention plans at the school level. We are training the police, firefighters and professionals in [matters related to] this type of behavior. These [initiatives] will likely yield results in the medium term.  Psychologist Enrique Echeburúa recently published the book 'Death by Suicide'. Javier Hernandez Juantegui  Q. Is there anything that could be done to prevent suicide that is not being done yet?  A. If we’re talking about adolescents, for example, much more needs to be done. Many teenagers are very sensitive to emotional upheaval, which is experienced far more intensely in adolescence than in adult life; serious disappointments—in romantic relationships, with parents, with friends, school performance, being bullied for being different—can lead them to attempt suicide in a fit of impulsivity. The family and the role of the school play a very important role for teenagers. In the family, parents may not detect the risk of suicide, but they may see that their child has depression, or an anxiety problem, or stops eating or becomes addicted to social media. These are risk factors, and it is a good idea to get those problems checked out, not necessarily [because of] suicide. In the most serious cases, you can also involve the school, or educational psychologists who may work at the school, or a primary care physician to refer [the teenager] to a mental health center. And there are also hotlines that have been set up by the government, the ANAR Foundation, the Hope Hotline, the hotline set up by the Ministry of Health. All of this makes it easier to deal with crisis situations and makes it less likely for a fatal suicide attempt to occur. Then, we must also realize that sometimes suicide occurs impulsively and there is no [unusual] behavior to detect. But… controlling access to drugs, places like high bridges and access to firearms [can help prevent it].  Q. And are there general suicide prevention measures for people of all ages?  A. Additional risk factors should be monitored, such as having a family member who died by suicide, having attempted suicide [before], being male, being over 60 years old, living alone or having a chronic or debilitating disease. We should pay attention to these risk factors in order to provide extra medical, psychological and social support. As we have said, it is also important to monitor serious mental disorders, depression, psychosis…alcoholism or an eating disorder.  From the educational point of view, both in a family and at school, it is important to create what we call protective factors—[ways] to make these people resilient in the face of disappointments, trials and tribulations or setbacks that they may experience in their lives. [Such strategies are] based on building self-esteem. For example: do not ridicule them if they are not at the head of the class. In general, it is a matter of ensuring that they have emotional stability, that they are taught to solve problems and to manage emotions and stressful situations, to foster social relationships, to share their sorrows and joys with the people around them. All of that is very important protection for a person.  Q. Can we improve our knowledge about suicide to better address it?  A. There is something that is not usually done…called a “psychological autopsy.” Essentially, it was created at the request of insurance companies to determine whether a person’s cause of death was an accident or a suicide, because sometimes insurance policies do not cover suicides. Therefore, they were interested in determining the cause of death. Then, they wanted to see which circumstances in each specific case could have led to that person’s loss of life. And this was a study that was carried out with the [help of the deceased person’s] relatives, with the people who had been around that person; [the study took place] a few months after the death, when people were ready to provide information. Thus, we wanted to know more about the variables that lead to suicide to establish better prevention programs. This [study] is not done systematically, because it is very complicated to do so, but it would shed light on how to conduct better prevention campaigns and more specific treatments for different age groups.

(WMTV) - A group of southwestern Wisconsin women organized Lancaster’s first ever suicide prevention and awareness walk/run to honor their family members who have passed away.  The first ever You Matter Mental Health Awareness 5K will be held in Lancaster at the Grant County Fairgrounds Saturday, May 20, 2023 at 8 a.m.  Two of the organizers lost children to suicide in 2021 and the other’s brother-in-law died by suicide 21 years ago.  Mothers Tammy Crary and Denise Janssen want to spare others the same pain they’re still going through, so they’ll make mental health resources available at the race.  Southwest Wisconsin mothers honor children who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Tammy Crary)  “There’s anger because she should still be here today, there is an incredible amount of sadness,” Crary of Bloomington said. “I came across this saying that said, ‘I never wanted to leave you, I just didn’t know how to stay.’ And that fits her to a t because I know she never wanted to leave me.”  Crary’s daughter Harmonie Kay took her own life in September of 2021.  Kay was 16-years-old and would’ve graduated high school on Friday.  Southwest Wisconsin mothers honor children who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Denise Janssen)  Lancaster mother Janssen helped organize the 5K to honor her 18-year-old son Braeden Bausch who took his own life in December of 2021.  “I will miss him forever,” Janssen said. “I never knew that he struggled with adoption and being given up by his biological parents. We didn’t talk about it. It’s not something that we ever talked.”  Janssen said support groups and counselors helped her try to understand why her son passed away.  Janssen hopes people feel comfortable speaking to one another about suicide and reducing the stigma that surrounds mental health.  “It’s something I don’t think people take seriously enough, it’s here and it’s not going away,” Janssen said. “Don’t be afraid to talk and communicate what you’re feeling.”  Southwest Wisconsin families honor brother who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Missy Sperle)  Missy Sperle helped organize the race to honor her brother-in-law Jason Kammer’s memory.  She said he died by suicide 21 years ago and that Saturday’s race will mean a lot to his children whose lives were forever changed.  There will be 15 to 20 resource tables at the 5K including NAMI, Wisconsin AFP, hospitals and drug prevention and rehabilitation organizations.  The race/walk costs $30 for anyone six years of age and older. Check-in is at 8 a.m. at the Grant County Fairgrounds in Lancaster. People have until midnight to register online at the You Matter Mental Health Awareness 5K website.  You can register in person at the doors at 8 a.m.  The money raised will go toward scholarship money for Grant County high school students and to the Braeden Bausch Foundation.

"suicide","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Williston"", ""NorthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T06:00:00","Farming can be one of the most stressful occupations in the nation. Each season of the year brings a different set of worries.  This spring provides a perfect example of the challenges faced by farmers and ranchers. Because of the large amount of snow during the winter along with how long it took to melt, farmers were late getting into the fields.  Farmers are at the mercy of nature, so they can only wait until fields are dry enough to work. The late start will only add to the stress as the summer progresses.  If it’s not a late start because of a long winter there’s always the threat of drought, of hail ruining crops, of disease or insects attacking. There’s also the increasing costs of seed, fertilizer and gas.  Farmers are independent operators who are dependent on many things out of their control. The amount of pressure on farmers is immense, making them susceptible to suicide. Many farmers are stoic and bottle up their feelings.  North Dakota ranks 14th for the highest suicide rates in the nation. And farmers are dying by suicide at a higher rate than any other occupational group, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  That doesn’t bode well for North Dakota, where agriculture is one of the pillars of the state’s economy along with energy and tourism.  Farming and ranching is a lifestyle as much as it is a profession. When faced with the threat of losing a farm or ranch it’s more than the loss of a job — it’s the loss of everything.  This past legislative session lawmakers passed House Bill 1390, which creates a suicide fatality review commission to study prevention and to develop resources for people in need. Those in agriculture who need mental health help can call 1-800-273-8255.  Minnesota and South Dakota have a program that provides suicide prevention training to clergy. The states are focusing on clergy because they have close ties to farmers. For many in rural America, the church is the keystone of their community.  Clergy have the trust of farmers and ranchers, and if they detect signs of potential suicide it’s likely those in need of help will be willing to discuss it with them.  Those in agriculture love the land and the outdoors, but the nature of the business means they often work alone, or with just a small number of others. Many farmers and ranchers are used to keeping things to themselves.  Bob Worth, a third-generation farmer in Lake Benton, Minnesota, summed it up this way for The Associated Press:  “You’d be surprised how many people are suffering with depression. Farmers have been a group of people who keep problems to themselves, proud and private.”  Hopefully, the state’s new review commission can find ways to prevent suicide. The public needs to be aware of the signs of depression and potential suicide. It’s a difficult issue to discuss, but often what’s important is to listen to someone’s difficulties.  North Dakota ranks too high in suicides and needs to make a priority out of reducing them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL2Jpc21hcmNrdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9lZGl0b3JpYWwvdHJpYnVuZS1lZGl0b3JpYWwtZm9jdXMtbmVlZGVkLW9uLXByZXZlbnRpbmctZmFybS1zdWljaWRlcy9hcnRpY2xlXzdmNWUwODQ4LWY2NTAtMTFlZC05YTg4LTZmYTdmYzdmMDU1YS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-05-05","Not Discerned","{""LakeBenton"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T06:34:22","(EDITOR’S NOTE: This story includes discussion of suicide. The national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.)  LAKE BENTON, Minn. (AP) — With traces of winter’s unusually heavy snow still lingering, farmers were out dawn to dusk in early May, planting corn and soybeans across southwestern Minnesota fields many have owned for generations.  The threat of losing beloved family farms is a growing worry, affecting many farmers’ mental health and raising concerns of another uptick in suicides like during the 1980s farm crisis. Much of the stress stems from being dependent on factors largely outside their control – from the increasingly unpredictable weather to growing costs of equipment to global market swings that can wipe out profits.  “You’d be surprised how many people are suffering with depression. Farmers have been a group of people who keep problems to themselves,” said Bob Worth, a third-generation crop farmer near the hamlet of Lake Benton, who credits his wife with saving his life during a bout with depression in the 1980s. “The more you talk about this, the more you realize it can be fixed.”  States such as Minnesota and South Dakota are offering suicide prevention training to clergy – a crucial, trusted presence in rural America.  In Pipestone, the bigger town down the dirt road from Worth’s farm – with 4,200 residents and a dozen churches – pastors from three Lutheran parishes are taking the four-week suicide prevention program that Minnesota’s departments of agriculture and health launched this spring.  “I want to learn to help. This could be anybody,” said the Rev. Robert Moeller, recalling his first realization of the scourge of suicide among farmers, when a customer in the feed business he once worked at killed himself.  While rising levels of stress and anxiety are affecting Americans from students to service members, the dynamics are different in the farmland, where churches remain essential social gathering points.  “Every farm family I know has a relationship with a house of worship,” said Meg Moynihan, a dairy farmer in southern Minnesota who works on clergy-focused training programs as a senior advisor to the state’s agriculture  department.  The evident satisfaction that farmers take in growing crops and raising livestock to feed the country makes the fear of being unable to keep going a key factor in mental health distress.  “There’s a sense of threat to one’s identity and generational legacy across time,” said Sean Brotherson, professor and extension family science specialist at North Dakota State University. “People treat the farm as a member of the family – and the longest-living member of the family.”  Under financial pressure, Keith and Theresia Gillie started talking about finding jobs away from his homestead in northwestern Minnesota.  “I never realized that in the midst of us quitting farming, that was his identity,” said Gillie, who found her husband of more than 30 years dead on a gravel road.  Male agricultural workers’ suicide rates are more than two times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are several issues that play a role, including increased isolation and exacerbated family tensions during the pandemic, the difficulty in rural communities to find in-person mental health counseling or to access broadband for tele-health, as well as the disruptions brought by climate change-driven unpredictable weather patterns, inflation and international trade disputes.  As the average age for farmers inches toward 60, the pressure of passing on a life-defining legacy to new generations is a growing problem, said Monica McConkey, a rural mental health specialist contracted by Minnesota’s agriculture department.  Driving his tractor and planter, some $750,000 in machinery, outside Flandreau, South Dakota, Todd Sanderson, 61, said he hopes a nephew will take over eventually.  “That’s what’s keeping me up at night, the transition,” he said. “The more I get stressed, the more I get quiet.”  Breaking farmers out of that proud reserve is a big challenge even for clergy, said the Rev. Alan Blankenfeld, the rural ministry liaison for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America’s South Dakota synod.  “They’ll share on their terms. Our place is not counseling, but we can walk with them,” he added.  Back in Pipestone, the Rev. Ann Zastrow of First Lutheran Church, who’s taking Minnesota’s online prevention course, plans to remind those struggling with mental health that “God is still in the picture.”  In many farm families, faith and struggle have long coexisted. First Lutheran’s council president, who raises lambs from 500 ewes outside town, said he still remembers when his mother asked him to take guns out of the house because she was worried about his father.  “I remember the look on (my father’s) face when they sold his cows,” Craig Thies said as newborn lambs tottered around him. “Realistically, they’re like your children. But somebody is eating tonight because of you.”  Seeing themselves as part of a crucial creation plan cements farmers’ faith, which in turn makes the clergy potential lifesavers when given the right tools.  “One place we struggle within the church is if we treat suicide as shameful, then they won’t share they’re not okay,” said the Rev. Kelly Ahola, a Lutheran pastor in the Red River Valley between Minnesota and North Dakota.  For one of 80 clergy taking the spring training course, the Rev. Jillene Gallatin, the call to prevention is excruciatingly personal. It was her pastor who drove her to the hospital when, at 15, she tried to kill herself a year after her mother took her own life. And it was in her church that she met comfort instead of the deafening silence and averted eyes elsewhere in her community.  “That’s a gift we can bring as church, being a safe spot,” Gallatin said in the sanctuary of Grace Lutheran Church in Waseca, about an hour south of Minneapolis.  Later that spring day, she visited a church member’s dairy farm that’s been in the family since the 1870s.  There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when the relatives discussed the option of stopping the milking operation, Jason Eldeen recalled.  But they persevered, which makes them among the 1.3% of U.S. workers with direct on-farm employment, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2023 data.  “How lucky we are that we get to farm,” he said, as some of the cows reached out to lick his and Gallatin’s hands in the spring sunshine.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbGlnaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvc2F2aW5nLXRoZS1mYXJtZXItaGVhcnRsYW5kLWNsZXJneS10cmFpbi10by1wcmV2ZW50LWFncmljdWx0dXJlLXdvcmtlcnMtc3VpY2lkZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""Tupelo"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:28:05","Farmers stress over the uncertainty in weather, commodity prices, finances, and more. These are all factors that can elevate the risk of suicide.  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) article published in 2020, Suicide Rates by Industry and Occupation — National Violent Death Reporting System, 32 States, 2016, reports the suicide rate among males who work in farming and ranching was 43.2 per 100,000 among farmers and ranchers in 2016, compared to 27.4 per 100,000 among male working aged adults across all occupations.  Suicide rates among working-age people (ages 16–64) have increased by 40 percent over the last two decades, according to the CDC. Farming has the ninth-highest suicide rate among all major industries included in National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) data linking suicides with occupation. Medical doctors, dentists, and police officers top this list.  Experts say there are two main occupational factors that increase a person’s risk of suicide: job factors (like job stress, low job security, low pay), and increased access to lethal means (like medication and firearms).  James Barham, director of counseling at Living Well Professional Counseling says depression and anxiety are certainly the main diagnoses that we see in rural Mississippi Delta farming communities, but also throughout our state.  To combat this silent crisis, Barham uses the acronym F.A.R.M.:  F: Faith, family, and friends  A: Adjustments  R: Rythm  M: Mending your fences  Saying this helps take care of relationships so that you are not putting things off emotionally. Barham likewise advises farmers and others struggling with their mental health to not allow their anger to carry into tomorrow and to make sure to take care of the “homefront” — and what matters most.  If you, or someone you know, is considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 .  We can all help prevent suicide.

A 21-year-old student of Shiv Nadar University was shot dead, allegedly by her classmate who later shot himself, inside the university campus in Greater Noida on Thursday afternoon, police said.  The woman has been identified as Sneha Chaurasiya, and the man as Anuj Singh. Both were B.A.(Sociology) students, in their final year. While Sneha was from Kanpur, Anuj’s family lives in Amroha.  Police said they received a call from the university at 1.30-2 pm about a firing incident. “We received information that a student, named Anuj, had fired at his classmate outside the dining hall on the campus,” said a senior police officer.  According to police, after shooting Sneha, Anuj went to his hostel room and shot himself. A country-made pistol was reportedly recovered from his room. Police said they were still investigating the source of the weapon.  Late at night, police said that Anuj purportedly sent a video clip to the university authorities at around 1.20 pm, in which he said that he was in a relationship with Sneha but they were no longer together. In the 22-minute video, he said he was “broken inside” and “could not trust anyone”. He also said that he had been “diagnosed with third stage brain cancer” but had not told his parents. He spoke about punishing the woman and sought the forgiveness of his and her parents.  Police have recovered CCTV footage which shows the two students talking outside the dining hall. Anuj is seen holding a bag, from which he later pulls out a pistol and fires at Sneha. She tries to resist but is shot again and collapses. Police said Sneha was shot at least twice – in the chest and abdomen – and died on the spot.  “They were friends, students often saw them talking to each other. The two first had a conversation, and the accused later pulled out a pistol and fired at the woman,” said the officer, adding that the woman was taken to a private hospital, where she was declared dead.

We are questioning their classmates and teachers,” said DCP (Greater Noida) Saad Miya Khan.  While the college is shut for summer break, some students have reportedly stayed back for the convocation. “The convocation is scheduled to be held on May 26. Many students who will graduate this year have stayed back. The two students had met outside the hostel dining hall, which was shut, on Thursday afternoon. No one else was in the vicinity at the time. The police have recovered the CCTV footage and are analysing it,” said a university official.  He added that students are not frisked when entering the university.

The matter is currently under investigation by the authorities, and we are closely monitoring the situation. All other residents of the campus are safe. Our utmost priority is the safety and well-being of our students, employees, and the entire community. We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.

"suicide","2017-08-10","Not Discerned","{""Mayflower"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:09:07","While it’s bad enough the debunked dossier the FBI used to spy on the Trump campaign was paid for by the Clinton campaign and authored by a foreign FBI informant and his carousing researcher, the newly released report of Special Counsel John Durham strongly suggests a top Justice Department official and his wife had an early hand in shaping the political rumor sheet. According to the 306-page report, former Justice Department prosecutor Bruce Ohr’s wife Nellie Ohr first plowed the ground for the dossier with a series of research reports she wrote for Fusion GPS, the D.C.-based opposition research firm the Clinton campaign commissioned to dig up dirt on Trump and Russia. Obtained by Durham, her reports zeroed in on Sergei Millian and his connections to Russia and Trump, falsely portraying him as a key intermediary between the Kremlin and the Republican candidate. They would later provide the foundation for the dossier’s many fictions. ""Fusion GPS records demonstrate that Nellie Ohr first identified Millian,” Durham states in his report. ""All told, Ohr prepared at least 12 reports that discussed Sergei Millian."" She wrote her first Millian report in April 2016, the month before Fusion GPS hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to put his imprimatur as a supposed former “spy” and ""Russian insider"" on the dossier. ""This report was prepared just ten days after Fusion GPS was retained by [Clinton campaign law firm] Perkins Coie to conduct opposition research on Trump,” the Durham Report states, ""and prior to Steele being retained by Fusion GPS."" Durham suggests Nellie Ohr planted the seeds of sourcing for the most explosive allegations leveled by the dossier against Trump, including the oft-cited notion that he and his campaign were engaged in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin. The dossier attributed this, falsely, to Millian. Durham found that the Belarusian-American realtor was never a source for the dossier and was simply invented as one, along with the allegations attributed to him. In fact, Durham says that Millian initially wasn’t even on the radar of Steele and his dossier “collector"" Igor Danchenko, a former Brookings Institution analyst who's admitted much of the information he provided Steele was alcohol-lubricated gossip. Millian was called to their attention by Nellie Ohr, who the prosecutor said “implicated"" Millian through her own reports. Durham suggests Steele and Danchenko merely followed her leads. Meanwhile, the prosecutor added, Bruce Ohr, an anti-Trump Democrat, pushed his wife’s reports that cited Millian — 12 in all — onto the Crossfire Hurricane team at FBI headquarters that was investigating Trump and his campaign for possible espionage. Agents used her reports as a source of corroboration for the Steele reports they received in the summer and fall of 2016, even though it was circular reporting. ""The reports prepared by Ohr and others at Fusion GPS were ultimately provided to Crossfire Hurricane investigators by Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr,” according to the Durham Report. Durham notes that Danchenko was tracking leads on Millian from Nellie Ohr within “approximately one week” of Fusion GPS retaining Steele to compile the dossier. He concludes that this “strongly supports the inference that Fusion GPS directed Steele to pursue Millian.” In other words, Steele was not the catalyst behind the dossier’s central claims. Rather, it was Clinton's contractor Fusion GPS -- but more specifically, the wife of a senior DOJ official who worked for Fusion. So the FBI wasn’t really investigating ""Crown reporting,” as officials referred to Steele’s dossier, implying it was British intelligence. More accurately, it was investigating information from inside its own department that was laundered through Steele and his dossier. On page 97 of their book, ""Crime in Progress,"" Fusion GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch maintained that it was Steele who identified Millian as ""one of the key intermediaries between Trump and the Russians.” Durham’s report shatters their claim. The special counsel also found that Simpson worked with Bruce Ohr to pressure the FBI to investigate the dossier allegations. On Aug. 22, 2016, Simpson asked Ohr to call him. About an hour later, Ohr emailed the FBI agent handling Steele as an informant to, as he said, ""check in.” Ohr and the agent, Michael Gaeta, spoke over the phone on Aug. 24. During their call, Ohr inquired if the FBI was going to do anything with the dossier reports that Steele had passed along to Gaeta in July. In response, Gaeta “told Ohr that a group at FBI headquarters was working on them,” according to the Durham report. This undercuts the official FBI timeline of when HQ first received the dossier. For years, the bureau has insisted it did not receive the reports until a month later — Sept. 19, 2016. The Ohrs also appear to have directly influenced the dossier and the FBI’s investigation. Both Bruce and Nellie Ohr, who previously worked for the CIA, met with Steele in Washington at a critical time. Emails reveal that on July 30, 2016 -- the day before the FBI formally opened its overarching case against Trump, codenamed “Crossfire Hurricane"" -- the couple sat down with Steele and an unidentified “associate” of his at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C. to compare notes — Nellie and Steele literally passed pieces of papers back and forth — regarding their research into “suspicions that Russian government figures were supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump.” After their breakfast, Bruce Ohr reportedly contacted then-deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe to relay their concerns. Fusion GPS also pitched the press the false narrative that Millian was a key intermediary between Trump and Russia. For example, on June 27, 2016, Fritsch sent an email to Franklin Foer, a reporter at Slate magazine, stating ""this dude is key” and claiming ""he is clearly kgb.” The next month, Simpson reached out to ABC News producer Matthew Mosk about Millian. Mosk emailed Simpson and reported back that he was ""making arrangements to interview Millian on camera"" and that he and Simpson ""should chat."" On July 29, 2016, Millian ultimately was interviewed by Brian Ross, formerly of ABC News, who asked Millian whether he was a Russian spy. On Sept. 13, 2016, Mosk emailed Simpson and asked, ""What's the most official thing we have showing Millian tied to Trump? That would make it hard for the Trump org to disavow Millian?"" Ross later left ABC after being suspended for erroneous reporting on Russiagate, while Mosk has moved to CBS News. Throughout the summer and fall of 2016, Fusion GPS also promoted to the Washington media the false allegation the Trump campaign maintained a secret hotline to Moscow through Russia-based Alfa Bank. In an attempt to tie Millian to the Alfa Bank allegations, Durham found that Fusion GPS sought the assistance of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who in turn contacted D.C. tech executive Rodney Joffe to determine if Millian had any ties to Alfa Bank. On Aug. 20, 2016, Joffe emailed federal computer contractors at Georgia Tech a document titled ""birdsnest-1.pdf' that contained ""known associates"" of Trump. Included in the attached document was a description of Millian along with his past mailing addresses; various email addresses; websites; and IP addresses that were associated with him. Joffe, who was recently fired as an FBI informant, described Millian as ""the most likely intermediary"" between Trump and Russia. On Sept. 27, 2016, Simpson and Fritsch emailed IP ""look-up"" information for one of Millian’s websites to then-New York Times reporter Eric Lichtblau, whom Fusion was pressuring to write a story about the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations. In the email, Fritsch pointed out that ""Alfa"" was the website service provider for Millian's website. However, Durham determined that the relevant IP information did not indicate that ""Alfa Bank"" was the service provider, but rather Alfa Telecom — a Lebanese-based telecom company, which appears to have no affiliation with Alfa Bank. Fusion GPS and Steele also provided the substance of the Alfa Bank allegations to Bruce Ohr, the DOJ official, who passed the false tip on to the FBI. The Crossfire Hurricane team used Ohr as a conduit to continue to receive information from Steele about Trump throughout 2017, even after the FBI had to terminate Steele as an informant for leaking information about its investigation to the media.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBpb25lZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZXMvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC93aWxsLXBvdWx0ZXItaGFkLXN1aWNpZGFsLXRob3VnaHRzL2FydGljbGVfMzIyNTVlNjgtZTE5Zi01M2ZhLWE1YWUtZWEwYTliMGRiZDk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The three youths were identified as Amanullah Khan(20), Muhammad Faizal(21) and Muhammad Asif Iqbal(20). They live in the Wattganj locality of Kolkata. They were very much active on the Social media platform Instagram. They allegedly duped a Chennai girl Mahalakshmi promising to give high returns on her investments.  As per information, a month ago of her suicide, the resident of the Seven Walls area, Mahalakshmi, received a message on her Instagram about an investment plan. The statement said an investment of Rs. 750 would get a return of Rs. 23,500. Believing this, she sent them a total of Rs. 37,500.  After several days, when she did not receive any returns or replies, she demanded her principal amount. This time too, she did not get any answers. Saddened by this, on April 2, Mahalakshmi allegedly died by suicide at her house.  According to the police, after investigating the mobile phone of the girl, they came to know about the Instagram conning. Later, the special investigation team went to West Bengal and traced the location of the accused and arrested them.  The arrested three are college graduates and have been duping people on Instagram, promising to give high returns.

"suicide","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:48:22","Carissa Peckrul  On Mental Health Action Day, AmeriCorps alumna Carissa shares how national service empowered her to become a social worker.  It’s been four years since I sat across from my professor during my final semester of undergrad. The countdown had begun—I had a year to figure out my next move as a young woman entering the world with a psychology degree. While inquiring about opportunities, my professor mentioned AmeriCorps as a path. Interested, yet hesitant, I wondered what national service had to do with improving the mental health crisis.  Four months later, I boarded a plane to Chicago to learn how to teach mental health first aid as part of the Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program. I remember practicing the training content in front of my hotel mirror for hours. However, sitting in a room of professionals with a variety of qualifications, my voice shook when I introduced myself. I thought, “Can I really do this?”  During my time with the program, I quickly realized the transformative power of national service. I confidently trained groups of people and was enlightened by every class. I learned quickly the value of personal stories, the turmoil of mental health challenges, and the hope for recovery. It was no longer about an experience, but a lifestyle of conversing, listening, and offering support.  One encounter really stood out to me, and it remains my driving force to persevere in this field, even when there may be easier roads to venture down. A woman approached me after a training session and thanked me for teaching her the skills to ask someone if they may be thinking about suicide. This woman believed that this skill she implemented on her own may have saved her family member's life. My voice shook again in my response to her, but not because of nervousness, but because I realized the impact I have as a social worker. This was a direct result of the lessons I learned through my service with AmeriCorps.  Since my service term ended, the Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program has grown exponentially. With more members than ever serving across the country, the program is leading the charge to establish the critical role national service plays in responding to our nation’s mental health crisis. With the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline shifting to the 3-digit number 988, Healthy Minds Alliance now supports crisis call centers nationwide. The 988 Lifeline helps thousands of people overcome suicidal crisis or mental-health related distress every day. These AmeriCorps members are trained and supported in answering calls, texts and chats that come into local crisis call centers, recruit other volunteers for the crisis call center, and reach out to the local community to build awareness around 988. This new program model is made possible by Public Health AmeriCorps funding, a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and AmeriCorps.  The Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program is developing the next generation of mental health workers, which is critical to addressing this crisis. These AmeriCorps members have grit, determination, and hope for a better future. They show up every day, boldly taking action and saving lives. They are superheroes in every sense of the word.  If you are interested in serving to improve the mental health crisis head to AmeriCorps.gov/Serve to find your opportunity to make an impact.  If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljb3Jwcy5nb3YvYmxvZ3MvMjAyMy0wNS0xOC9hbWVyaWNvcnBzLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWNyaXNpc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Wilmington"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:50:03","WilmU’s Prevention Science offers solutions to societal problems  Kristen Wilson wanted to figure out how to combat the increasing mental health struggles seen in students as the COVID-19 pandemic stretched on. In her last semester in the Wilmington University Prevention Science program, Wilson has whittled that topic down to focus on community college students for her doctoral dissertation. Prevention science uses statistics and studies to create programs that will reduce risk factors in a community and help them protect people by helping them avoid elements that contribute to the problem. It’s a field that’s drawn much more interest since the pandemic began. Rather than reacting to or providing treatment in the aftermath of an issue, such as homlessness, preventive science can offer solutions to make those things more avoidable in the first place. Instructors said WilmU’s Prevention Science program is one of a kind because it’s exclusively offered online and can be completed in just two-and-a-half years. “It’s not your traditional PhD program because it’s more action research,” said Dr. Edward Guthrie, dean of the university’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. “You can look at a problem and in a shorter period of time have the skill set to empirically look at it, evaluate it, work with the community, build that coalition, and then make recommendations and implement them to help resolve that issue or work on it.” Dr. Debra Berke, director of psychology/organizational dynamics programs, likes to call it a “weed and seed” approach. Although the weed and seed approach originated as a Department of Justice program focused on crime control and prevention, Berke said, some general strategies can be adopted for other community-based prevention such as substance abuse prevention, suicide prevention, teen pregnancy prevention, and youth violence prevention. “We want to weed out those bad things in our society that aren’t promoting healthy growth and development, and we want to seed in positive predictive factors like knowledge and skills and attitudes, values, beliefs, policies and procedures, those kinds of things,” Berke said. Both Wilson and Berke described prevention science as a soft science. “I don’t mean that in a negative way,” Wilson said. “There are a lot of industries who are not familiar with this, or they’re uncomfortable talking about these sorts of things because culture change is scary. So our goal is to take some of this and translate it into a way that other industries can understand it and respond to it.” Another unique factor of the Wilmington University program, Berke said, is it’s a doctor of social science, not a PhD program. The program is meant for professionals, and the coursework is structured in a manner to fit into the schedules of students, who are often working full-time jobs while working on the degree. The program started in 2018 with the goal of preparing students to help bring prosperity, knowledge and nobility to the communities they live in. But the university sees “community” as something much more meaningful than just a set geographical location. “Community can include a neighborhood, a larger urban area, a particular demographic (i.e. looking at alcohol exposure with adolescents), a rural area, or a discipline/profession,” Guthrie said. “There are a number of communities and populations that experience challenges.” “WilmU’s Prevention Science Program gives you those enhanced durable skills, problem solving, critical thinking, collaboration and interpersonal communication,” Guthrie said, “but at a different level so that you can help build community coalitions to help work on community and neighborhood problems.” Examples of Prevention Science One example of the kind of work in the program is a student who worked on a project that looked at challenging childhood experiences such as poverty, domestic violence, abuse and homelessness, and how that can help programs that reintroduce incarcerated people into society be as successful as possible. One of the research points in this case was looking at which programs lower or increase the recidivism rate. The student evaluated how the state could adjust those programs to lower the rate. She said that one recent graduate has started an executive position in a community organization that positively impacts individuals re-integrating with family, friends and the community after incarceration, with one goal of preventing recidivism. Another graduate began a position with a federal organization that tracks and analyzes conditions that have resulted in childhood deaths to develop prevention interventions. Wilson, who’s also the director of social services at Rowan College of South Jersey, said a colleague of hers in the WilmU program is writing a dissertation about substance abuse prevention and how organizations who deal with that were impacted by the pandemic. Another example of what goes on in the classroom, Guthrie said, is looking at the opioid crisis and analyzing how it’s affecting various neighborhoods in the state differently. Say you’re in a rural area, like parts of Sussex County, Guthrie said, what services or resources are available for opioid prevention and education, and how can people get access to them? In this example, students research how many prescriptions for opioids are given and whether information/educational materials are given to the patient outlining the potential for addiction or abuse. Once that research is conducted, students in the program focus on how those resources could be improved to help more people addicted to prescription opioids. Those who study prevention science classes start with introductions into what the science is and how to build a foundation of research. They then work on applied research methods, choosing an area of interest to study using different approaches such as qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative approach focuses on personal accounts and documentation that show how an individual or group acts. A quantitative approach, on the other hand, relies on measurable data to form conclusions. During guided study classes, students work on their own project and learn independently with feedback from a mentor. They also study inquiry research, which gives the student the chance to research a topic they’ve chosen, create theories about how to help and present an argument to address that real-world issue. Students will […]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdG93bnNxdWFyZWRlbGF3YXJlLmNvbS9zdGF0ZS1wb2xpY2UtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZy1hdHRlbXB0ZWQtYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS0zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 07:00:00","Teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, and, when boys become men, they are three times more likely than women to die by suicide.  After years on the frontline of teaching and observing, first-hand, a decline in teenage mental health, a teacher has warned that we need to deal better with male anger, friendships, and attitudes towards sex in order to combat the male suicide crisis.  Official statistics for England, Scotland, and Wales show that in 2020, 264 people aged 10–19 died by suicide – 72% of these were boys. In England, suicide is the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45. They are three times more likely than women to die by suicide.  While statistics surrounding male suicide paint a bleak picture of the future of boys in our schools, teacher Matt Pinkett thinks all is not lost.  What can be done?  Pinkett has gathered evidence from teachers and school staff, wellbeing experts and therapists to create a powerful guide to helping boys, in Boys Do Cry, released next month.  The practical and engaging guide, backed up by the latest research from the fields of psychology and education, suggests that teachers must stop stigmatising anger and instead help angry boys understand the neurological and physiological reasons for their feelings.  Pinkett says: “Anger isn’t an inherently bad thing and telling boys it is just leads to shame and hiding away. Instead, how about we teach them that anger is a feeling as natural as joy or sadness, and give them ways to manage it and the words to talk about it?”  He also suggests that teachers need to make loving, male relationships the norm, and to assume that every social interaction that takes place in a classroom is being watched and internalised.  He advises male teachers to compliment male colleagues openly, to talk lovingly about other people, and praise and salute male emotional vulnerability wherever and whenever possible.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work,” Pinkett explains, “but the fact is that we are in front of these children for massive chunks of their life. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing.”  Talking isn’t enough  In Boys Do Cry, Pinkett advocates the benefits of the ‘bromance’, suggesting that teachers and schools harness this relatively recent phenomenon of male-to-male relationships. He argues that in teaching boys about bromances, teachers can equip young men with the skills to actively listen and display compassion and affection towards each other.  He suggests teachers can help facilitate emotional connection between boys and help build friendships that are supportive.  He explains: “The problem isn’t encouraging young men to talk – it’s teaching their peers to listen. Research suggests boys don’t listen as well as girls. There is so much conversation about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through listening effectively?”  Demonstrated through research and case studies, Pinkett argues that boys crave emotional intimacy and the freedom to express themselves without being mocked, but that toxic ideas about masculinity are preventing these fruitful peer relationships.  “We need to teach boys to be kind, and that it is OK to be vulnerable and emotionally articulate,” he says.  Benefit to society  With his research-backed tools and tips, Pinkett hopes the book will give teachers confidence to engage with really difficult topics – to the benefit of all.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to get rid of those harmful and outdated expectations of what it means to be a man, all of society will be better off,” Pinkett says. “It is only through education of young people that the scourge of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Boys Do Cry examines key research on factors impacting boys’ mental health, including topics such as body image, pornography and self-harm, and provides teachers with practical strategies to start enacting positive change.  With his extensive research, he has created advice on intervening when a child may be in danger, to tips on how to set up group working so friendships can be made while learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists,” Pinkett adds, “It’s just about being brave enough to intervene and give boys a chance to learn another way of being.”  Further information:  Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in Schools  By Matt Pinkett  Published 17 May 2023  180 Pages  Paperback: 9781032168692 | $22.95 USD | £16.99  Hardback: 9781032168685 | $155 USD | £120    About the author:  Matt Pinkett is an English teacher in Surrey with a personal and professional interest in gender and masculinity in schools.

Thirteen years. Almost 365 days a year. Countless hours on set, filming anywhere between 50 and 60 scenes a day. I can’t keep track of the birthdays, anniversaries and holidays I missed, all because of “Days of Our Lives.” When I look back, “Days of Our Lives” was the days of my life.  And it was worth it, because I got to do what I loved, every single day: act. Although it was a demanding and grueling job, I did amazing things while playing Gabi Hernandez — things I never would’ve been able to do on any other set, like being kidnapped eight times or causing a gas explosion that might destroy the entire town or doing my own stunts and getting tackled or blowing up a person’s wedding.  That’s what made walking away earlier this year such a difficult decision.  When I told my mom, sister and husband — who I call my “tripod” — I was thinking of leaving the show, they understood. They’d seen me come home from work crying because I couldn’t shake off something bad that had happened to Gabi. They’d seen me memorizing 60 pages a day and feeling like my head was going to explode. Their support is monumental and it’s what makes me feel safe enough to take this risk.  I did it for me and the dreams that surpassed “Days of Our Lives.” I did for my family: past, present and future. I did it for my dad, in honor of the person he thought I could be — but never could see me become.  Soon into my time on “Days of Our Lives,” I got the news no one ever wants to receive. I was in the parking lot of a dollar store with my mom, who was on the phone, when she started screaming. On the other line, she learned my dad, her ex-husband, had died by suicide.  Story continues  We were shocked and devastated. My dad had been a living whirlwind and human wild card. When he was on dates with my mom, women would leave him their numbers. He was an exuberant man; everyone wanted his attention. At that point, I didn’t realize his smile masked what I now think was a lifetime of depression.  When he died, I handled it the best way I could as a 19-year-old, which was … not to tell anybody. A couple of days later I returned to set and life moved on. I buried my grief, I buried my anger. I buried my sadness. I put on a smile for a long time.  My instinct was silence. Things got better, for me, when I started talking about my dad’s death. In fact, I talk about it all the time now! Some people get weird with me because I don’t have to be very close to someone to tell them about my father’s death, but not making it taboo is therapeutic for me.  Other things that helped: Therapy. My husband, who encouraged me to think beyond guilt and my last phone call with my dad, and the memories I cherished. “Days” was impactful, too: When my character became a mom, I took a parenting class to prepare for the role, where I reflected on how the parenting done to me has molded me into the adult I became. Meeting other families impacted by suicide through my work with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has helped me move forward as well.  I think losing my dad made me a more empathetic person. His suicide changed the way that I interact with people. I want them to know that I care. I want them to know they are wanted, important, needed.  I had always spoken to my dad about my dreams. He knew my ultimate goal is to create amazing stories and cultivate characters — to be on the big screen. That was part of why I walked away. He didn’t stay to see his dreams realized — the depression took over. I need to reach mine for him, and me, and our family.  “Days” was undeniably a dream job. But I hope it’s the first of many dream jobs. I want to leave a legacy for my family, honoring the sacrifices that my Cuban immigrant parents made for me so that I could pursue those dreams.  Now, in Florida, when I look at the water, I think of my dad. I feel his embrace. And I know: He would be so proud of me.

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 10:43:05","Cumberland County will provide adequate mental health treatment and access to medication for incarcerated people struggling with opioid withdrawal under a proposed consent decree after the Department of Justice investigated the jail following the suicides of seven inmates.  The agreement stems from allegations that between 2014 and 2020, jail officials treated inmates experiencing withdrawal and at risk of self-harm or suicide with “deliberate indifference,” federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The Justice Department alleged jail officials violated the Eighth and 14th Amendments of the Constitution by denying mental health treatment and medical assistance.  “The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country, and under our Constitution, jails and prisons must provide adequate medical care to incarcerated individuals,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. “Today’s proposed consent decree is a significant step toward improving the care of individuals incarcerated in Cumberland County who are struggling with serious mental health disorders, and toward protecting the civil rights that are guaranteed by our Constitution.”  The proposed consent decree, filed in federal court in Camden, still must be approved by a court, federal officials told reporters Wednesday.  The jail, located in Bridgeton, houses about 300 people. Jail officials should have been using medication-assisted treatment and therapies to treat opioid withdrawal, but instead routinely used treatment generally used for people experiencing alcohol withdrawal, federal officials said.  Philip Sellinger, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said each of the seven inmates who died by suicide exhibited signs of withdrawal from opioids at the time of their deaths, but jail officials refused to provide medication-assisted treatment.  “This was policy and practice. You can’t pick and choose whose rights matter — everyone’s do,” he told reporters Wednesday. “People don’t leave their rights at the jailhouse door.”  The agreement will require the jail to increase mental health staffing and implement assessments for mental health, opioid withdrawal, and suicide risk. It also calls for an independent monitor to ensure compliance and issue public reports, said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.  The federal probe at the jail began in 2018 following the deaths of six inmates in three years. Another suicide occurred one month after federal officials began investigating, according to a 2021 report from the Department of Justice.  In that report, federal officials informed the county of the allegations and gave written notice of what officials should do to resolve them. The Justice Department said the county “fully cooperated” with the investigation.  “This consent decree marks a significant milestone in the Justice Department’s efforts to combat discrimination against those with opioid use disorder and to protect the civil rights of people in our jails and prisons,” Clarke said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3amVyc2V5bW9uaXRvci5jb20vYnJpZWZzL2N1bWJlcmxhbmQtamFpbC10by1pbXByb3ZlLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtc2VydmljZXMtZm9sbG93aW5nLWlubWF0ZS1kZWF0aHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thirteen U.S. service members were killed and 45 were wounded, and as many as 170 Afghan civilians were killed and dozens more wounded in the Aug. 26 suicide bombing attack.  Former Marine Sgt.

Andrew Harnik / AP file  During a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on March 8, former Marine Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, a sniper who was wounded at Abbey Gate, testified he and his teammates believed they had spotted the suicide bomber earlier that day. But Vargas-Andrews said the snipers watched the possible attacker disappear into the crowd because their leaders did not know who could authorize shooting him.  Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday asking for details about the process that ultimately lead to the Marines allegedly being told not to engage the suspect.  Rogers and McCaul asked for the response to the Marine sniper team’s request to engage the target and information about the decision-making process. In the letter they also asked the Pentagon to provide intelligence known about a possible attacker before the bombing, and the rules of engagement troops were under at the time at the airport gate. They requested video from that day, including from service members personal devices, and all chat room logs or messages from the Defense Department relating to targeting threats during the months of August and September.  McCaul and Rogers also asked for transcripts of all interviews used in the Biden administration’s Defense Department Afghanistan After Action Review, and footnotes from the report that they say were omitted from the copies provided to Congress.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL25hdGlvbmFsLXNlY3VyaXR5L3JlcHVibGljYW5zLWFzay1taWxsZXktYXVzdGluLWluZm8ta2FidWwtYm9tYmluZy1raWxsZWQtYW1lcmljYW5zLXJjbmE4NTExNdIBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4NTExNQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This came after the news Lola only had weeks left to live due to the fact her treatment had stopped working.  With the tumour spreading, Lola’s life was thrown into a different perspective once more as she told Jay that she wasn’t sure how many more good days she’ll have.  With that, they took off to the beach, ready for a very memorable day.  And what a day it was.  The couple enjoyed food and drink looking at the sea, reminiscing about when they first met, Lola stole a necklace from a shop for Lexi’s (Isabella Brown) 16th birthday and smiled as she told Jay that he’s the love of her life, who’s also secretly picked up some very impressive singing and guitar skills.  One thing that was hanging over Lola like a dark cloud was the fact she needed to tell Jay that she had asked Billy (Perry Fenwick) to help end her life when the time comes.  Of course, Jay was completely horrified when Lola broke the news.  Jay told Lola that he hates the world for taking her from him (Picture: BBC)  He pointed out that Lola has other options when it comes to her final days, but she argued that she wants to be Lola right until the end – not someone managed and completely controlled by medication, doctors and nurses.  Ultimately, this was the chance for Jay to tell Lola how angry he is at the world, he hated that someone ‘up there’ is taking Lola from him, and he despised that they won’t live the future he spends time imagining. He doesn’t want Lola to go – ever.  After time to calm down, Jay told Lola that if she wants to do it, then he should be there to help – not Billy.  Jay told Lola that he should help her die instead of Billy (Picture: BBC)  The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a police officer, who had discovered Lola stole the necklace from the shop.  As Jay took the fall for her, Lola’s mind started to change.  Back at the hospital, Lola explained to Jay that he could end up behind bars if he was to help her die, which would leave Lexi without him – someone she’ll definitely need when Lola isn’t around.  Lola decided that because of Lexi and the example she is continuing to set for her, she will be brave and die naturally.  She’s ready.

Rising to prominence with her role in the hit TV series Fresh Off the Boat, Wu has demonstrated her versatility and garnered critical acclaim for her compelling portrayals on screen. The actress previously opened up about a tough phase in her life.  During an episode of Red Table Talk last year, Constance Wu shared her feelings of “betrayal” by the Asian American community at a December 2019 event hosted by Simu Liu. At the Unforgettable Gala, which occurred shortly after her tweets expressing disappointment and a subsequent suicide attempt, Liu made a joke about her social media behavior, despite prior assurances not to address the topic.

With deep affection for her co-stars, Wu wanted the event to be solely about their accomplishments. She clarified that she didn’t want anyone to make light of the situation since she was still emotionally vulnerable and unprepared to be subjected to mockery.  “They wanted me to come ’cause they wanted to celebrate the show and the kids on the show,” Wu explained. “At that time, there was so much controversy around me that I was like, ‘If I go, people are just gonna want to talk about the tweets, and like, I love my kids on the show so much. I want this to be a moment for them to celebrate.’ I told them, ‘I don’t want anybody to make fun of it, ’cause I’m still in a very raw place about it. I’m not ready to be mocked for it.'”  In her conversation with Jada Pinkett Smith, Willow Smith, and Adrienne Banfield-Norris on Red Table Talk, Wu revealed that the gala organizers were unaware of her suicide attempt. Nevertheless, they assured her that she would not become a target of mockery or ridicule during the event.  “They sat me in the front row and had all these cameras on me and within ten minutes, the show’s host made a crack at me,” she recalled.

The audience’s reaction was marked by raised eyebrows and audible “oooooohs,” indicating a mixed response to the remark. Following the event, Constance Wu said that Simu Liu privately apologized to her.  Later, Constance Wu took to her Instagram Stories to rectify her earlier statement, acknowledging that she had mistakenly identified the hosting organization of the gala. In the episode, she initially mentioned the Coalition of Asian Pacifics (CAPE) as the host, but it was, in fact, Character Media who led the event.  In the interview, Constance Wu delved into various sensitive topics, including her complicated relationship with her mother, her decision not to disclose her experience of rape at the age of 22, and the instances of sexual harassment she encountered on the set of Fresh Off the Boat.

This year she takes up a new role as a lived experience advisor for the NHS and is working on her latest idea – to launch an awareness and fundraising walk in Carlisle called Stride Against Suicide, which she plans to walk 5k around Bitts Park raising funds for Papyrus, Samaritans and Every Life Matters.  Lisa has achieved a remarkable personal turnaround over the past five years.  Diagnosed as bipolar, she struggled with her mental health from her late teens including periods of depression, eating disorder and a suicide attempt.  Lisa also survived the suicide of her only sibling, her brother Stephen in 2015.  At The Cumberland, Lisa is an operations team leader in the premises department but alongside that, she is also one of the building society’s Mental Health and Wellbeing Champions.  She works with 18 other volunteer colleagues to raise awareness and to  help anyone within the business who may be having difficulties.  Pictured Lisa Birdsall (Image: INTROPR)  “I’m hugely proud of what we have done as a team. And I’m proud of The  Cumberland for their forward thinking and a really quite pioneering approach.  “I have suffered, myself, with my mental health and I understand just how vital it is to have that support and for it to be recognized that people’s mental health is important,"" she said.  Outside work Lisa is even more busy. She takes part in a scheme called Suicide Safer Communities which aims to raise awareness and understanding across Cumbria as well as being a volunteer by Carleton Clinic mental health service in Carlisle.  Ahead of Stride Against Suicide, Lisa said: ""I’m in the planning stage, and would like it to happen in Carlisle. I’m thinking Bitts Park for a walk of five kilometers.  “It is so important to have that education out there and have people with real stories to tell and stories that show it’s a journey you can go on, but things will get better.  “Obviously losing my brother the way that I did plays huge role in why I do what I do. I want to make the issue of mental health more normal and less shameful and hidden.  ""It's always on my mind – what more can we do to help,"" she said.

The musician cum entrepreneur, who struggled to have a child for eight years after tying the knot in 2016, said she went through a series of complications that nearly caused her life and marriage.    Touching on the depressing ordeal, Mimi said, but for her busy schedules which she used as a façade, she would’ve committed suicide or even run mad.    She said people who did not know about her condition, peddled rumours that she was unserious about having a baby.    “When you are married and not giving birth, people have their own assumptions because you are lively and bubbly. Your problems don’t show on you so people think you’re alright. I was working on Golden Movie Awards and doing other things so people think I am not serious with giving birth.    “I have heard a lot about such stories but you don’t know what I went through. People don’t know that keeping myself busy with work was just a veil. I could’ve committed suicide or even gone mad. It is not a small thing,” she stated in an interview with Zionfelix.    Establishing the root cause of her childbearing complications, Mimi said she suffers a type of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) that makes it extremely difficult to ovulate unless her ovaries are poked.    “I have gotten pregnant three times, I had a chemical pregnancy. As for the miscarriage, I could go as long as five and four months to lose the pregnancy. A lot I can’t even share. I am that type of woman who ovulates twice a year or three times a year.    ""So, if I miss those times, I miss out on having a baby for the entire year. It’s called PCOS. Naturally, I could have eggs but I won’t ovulate. Unless they burst the eggs before I could ovulate and I did this process three times. The third time, I had to travel out to save my baby,” she added.    In March 2022, Mimi and her husband, Nana Michaels, welcomed a baby girl in Spain.

She posted it to Twitter and has seen a flood of responses in support.  She said: ""We always talk about how we can prevent and stop suicide but that might not always help. Until it happens we don't take it seriously enough, there is still so much stigma around it.  ""Why? Because people who want to talk and open up and say how they feel think they are going to get shut down just because of what they have said. No wonder it gets to the point where they try to take their own life and then people wonder ‘oh why did that happen?’ because you didn’t listen to them at their lowest when they needed that support.""

""It's stupid that we get told off for how we feel because you might go up to your friend or a family member and say I feel low, depressed, sad, then they go and turn around and say ‘what do you have to be sad about?’. You don't know what the individual might feel or be going through because they struggle to open up because they are anxious too.""  She also broaches the difficult subjects of self-harm and suicide.  She adds: ""The fact there is still so much stigma around mental health and we don't talk about the bits around it is awful. We should talk more about it.  ""As someone who experienced all of this, I know what it's like.

""I'm someone who has dealt with suicide ideation since I was a teenager,"" Lisa Leseur told a group of UM administrators, faculty members and students.  Leseur is the programs coordinator for the Miami-Dade chapter of NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She visits local schools and businesses to train employees and students on QPR, Question, Persuade and Refer. Three skills needed if someone encouters a friend, co-worker or fellow student with suicidal thoughts. QPR is the mental health equivalent of CPR, and like CPR, QPR is aimed at saving lives.  ""If you understand the signs and talk to someone and engage them in coversation you could get them to professional help and possibly save their life,"" Leseur said.  UM students who took the course said it'll help them deal with the stresses of college life and offer help to their fellow students who may be in a mental health crisis.  ""I see a lot of academic stress on students,"" said Kemeria Baroso, a UM nursing student. ""I took the QPR training to help out my peers.""

"suicide","2023-12-01","22:00:00","{""Surat"", ""Gujarat"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:57:41","Cerbera odollam, commonly known as the Suicide Tree, is a plant species native to several countries in Southeast Asia, including India. The name ""Suicide Tree"" is derived from its dark reputation for being associated with intentional self-harm and suicides. Here's why Cerbera odollam earned this grim title:    1. Toxicity  Cerbera odollam contains potent cardiac glycosides, specifically cerberin and odollin, which are highly toxic to humans and animals. These compounds interfere with the normal functioning of the heart by inhibiting the sodium-potassium pump, leading to cardiac arrest and death. All parts of the tree, including the seeds, bark, leaves, and sap, contain these toxic compounds.  2. Ease of Access  The tree's widespread distribution in tropical regions and its accessibility in public areas, such as parks and residential areas, make it easily available to individuals in distress. This accessibility has contributed to its unfortunate association with suicidal acts.  3. Misconceptions  The toxic properties of Cerbera odollam were misunderstood by some individuals, leading to the misconception that it could be used for a relatively painless suicide method. This misconception spread through word-of-mouth and media reports, further enhancing the tree's reputation as a suicide aid.  Pixabay/Representational Image  4. Lethality  Ingesting even a small amount of Cerbera odollam seeds or other parts can be fatal. The seeds resemble small mangoes and are easily mistaken for edible fruits. This resemblance has tragically led to instances where people unknowingly consume the seeds, resulting in severe poisoning and death.  5. Lack of Antidote  Currently, there is no specific antidote or effective treatment for Cerbera odollam poisoning. The toxicity of the tree's compounds and the absence of a readily available antidote make it particularly dangerous. Prompt medical intervention, including gastric lavage, activated charcoal administration, and supportive care, is crucial in cases of ingestion.  Pixabay/Representational Image  6. Cultural Factors  Cerbera odollam's association with suicides is also influenced by cultural factors in some regions. In certain cases, stories or legends related to self-harm or suicides have been associated with the tree, reinforcing its reputation as a ""suicide tree.""  It is important to note that discussions surrounding the Suicide Tree should be approached with sensitivity and responsibility. Focusing solely on the negative aspects can perpetuate the association with suicide and potentially trigger vulnerable individuals. It is crucial to promote mental health awareness, provide support systems, and discourage the romanticization or glamorization of harmful acts.  Efforts are being made to raise awareness about the dangers of Cerbera odollam and to promote its conservation. Public education campaigns, signage, and initiatives to remove the trees from public spaces have been undertaken in some areas to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion or intentional harm.  It is essential to prioritize mental health support, suicide prevention strategies, and open conversations about mental well-being to address the root causes of suicide and provide appropriate care for individuals in need.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9nYXJkZW5pbmcvY2VyYmVyYS1vZG9sbGFtLXdoeS1pdC1pcy1jYWxsZWQtYS1zdWljaWRlLXRyZWUtNjAzMDQ1Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2dhcmRlbmluZy9jZXJiZXJhLW9kb2xsYW0td2h5LWl0LWlzLWNhbGxlZC1hLXN1aWNpZGUtdHJlZS02MDMwNDUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-01","10:00:00","{""Thiruvananthapuram"", ""Kerala"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:11:43","Had the state been supportive enough, a 17-year-old boy with mental illness would not have committed suicide inside the Social Justice Department's Observation Home at Poojappura in Thiruvananthapuram on May 13.    The boy, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, should have ideally been admitted and given prolonged treatment in the Mental Health Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. Instead, he had to be shifted back to the Observation Home after a brief stay at the Mental Health Centre. Eventually, the boy used a moment of isolation in the Home to take his life. He hung himself from one of the windows of the Home.  He was brought to the Observation Home last December by the Railway Police after he was implicated in a theft. Observation Home is a place where children in conflict with the law are placed before the juvenile court passes judgement.  At the Observation Home, the boy exhibited signs of serious mental illness, especially violent behaviour. The boy's was a fit case to be admitted.  The doctors at the Mental Health Centre, however, were faced with a dilemma. They realised that the boy could not be admitted.  The boy's parents were not with him. According to human rights lawyer J Sandhya, the boy's mother was grappling with multiple issues, including her husband's illness, that she could not be with her boy.  The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, states that if a minor has to be admitted then an attendant should be with the minor for the entire duration of the admission in the Mental Health Centre.  Nonetheless, if the parents are not fit to function as full-time attendants, the Mental Healthcare Act provides a solution. It states that the Mental Health Review Board should appoint a ""suitable individual"" who is willing to act as the ""nominated representative"" of the minor.  Even if a ""suitable individual"" is hard to appoint, the Act has a plan B. It states that the Mental Health Review Board should then appoint the director in the Department of Social Welfare or her nominee as the ""nominated representative"".  It is the duty of the Mental Health Review Board to find the right care giver for the minor. The Review Board, envisaged for all districts, should have as its members a district judge, a representative of the district collector, a psychiatrist, a medical practitioner and a representative of an NGO working in the field of mental health.  Tragedy is, this Mental Health Review Board, though constituted following a High Court diktat, is still not functional. No supporting staff or other necessary infrastructure have been provided to these boards. The board exists only on paper.  In other words, the state just abandoned the boy. Since there was no full-time attendant for the boy, it was not possible to admit the boy. If admission was not possible, there was just one option left for the Mental Health Centre: Shut the boy inside a solitary cell.  But this was deemed too cruel and primitive and shifting him back to the Observation Home after a short stay at the Centre was considered a better option. ""Even the doctors knew that it would have done the boy a world of good if he was given sustained treatment at the mental Health Centre. But without an attendant to serve him, it would have been unlawful for the hospital to keep the boy in the hospital,"" a senior doctor at the Mental Health Centre told Onmanorama on the condition of anonymity.  There is a feeling that the government could still have provided support. ""The Woman and Child Department, which takes care of the affairs of minor children, should have taken up the responsibility of providing the boy a bystander or caretaker,"" advocate Sandhya said. ""But we have still not worked out a rehabilitation plan for mentally ill children without parental support,"" she said.  In this case, it was also found that the boy who was first lodged in the Observation Home last December was kept in the Home for more than four months. The Juvenile Justice Act says that trials of children charged with criminal offences should not extend beyond four months.  It is said that the living conditions in Observation Homes are worse than in the Poojappura Central Jail opposite it. The convicts in the Central Jail, even those implicated in serious crimes like murder and rape, are allowed to spend at least a couple of hours outside. But the under-18 inmates of the Observation Home, most of them hauled up for minor offences like theft, are shut inside the airless house 24x7. More than enough to test any minor's sanity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubWFub3JhbWEuY29tL25ld3Mva2VyYWxhLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvc3VpY2lkZS1pbi1wb29qYXB1cmEtb2JzZXJ2YXRpb24taG9tZS1iaXBvbGFyLWRpc29yZGVyLXBhdGllbnRzLWhhbmdlZC5odG1s0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25tYW5vcmFtYS5jb20vbmV3cy9rZXJhbGEvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9zdWljaWRlLWluLXBvb2phcHVyYS1vYnNlcnZhdGlvbi1ob21lLWJpcG9sYXItZGlzb3JkZXItcGF0aWVudHMtaGFuZ2VkLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Known for their bone-crushing sound and unrelenting energy, the band has once again unleashed their trademark intensity. In this review, we delve into the depths of their music, exploring the raw power and darkness that permeate their latest release.  Remember… You Must Die opens with an ominous, atmospheric intro that sets the tone for what lies ahead. As the first crushing riffs hit, listeners are instantly submerged in a sonic onslaught. The guitar work is relentless, churning out heavy, distorted chords and blistering solos that showcase the band’s technical prowess. The drumming is thunderous, driving the music forward with its relentless speed and precision. The vocal performance by Eddie Hermida is nothing short of fierce. His guttural growls and piercing screams cut through the mix, adding an extra layer of aggression to the music. The lyrics explore dark themes of mortality, existentialism and the human condition, reflecting the album’s title.  Suicide Silence has always been unapologetic about exploring these darker aspects of life, and Remember… You Must Die is no exception. One standout track on the album is “Capable of Violence.” The song kicks off with a crushing breakdown, instantly inciting chaos and unleashing a mosh pit-inducing frenzy. The relentless energy and razor-sharp guitar riffs, coupled with the gut-wrenching vocals, create an atmosphere of controlled chaos that will captivate fans of the genre. The track is a prime example of Suicide Silence’s ability to seamlessly combine heaviness and melody, keeping the listener engaged from start to finish.  Another highlight is the chaos charged “Alter Of Self.” The song showcases the band’s ability to craft dynamic compositions that incorporate moments of introspection and vocal style. The chunky guitar passages and haunting raw vocals add depth to the overall sound, complementing the brutality that permeates the album. This track serves as a testament to Suicide Silence’s evolution as musicians, expanding their sonic palette while retaining their trademark aggression.  In Remember… You Must Die, Suicide Silence has delivered an album that caters to their devoted fan base while also pushing the boundaries of their sound. The production is top-notch, capturing the raw energy and intensity of the band’s live performances. While the album maintains the band’s signature deathcore sound, there are moments where they experiment with different elements, showcasing their growth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbXVzaWMubXhkd24uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvcmV2aWV3cy9hbGJ1bS1yZXZpZXctc3VpY2lkZS1zaWxlbmNlLXJlbWVtYmVyLXlvdS1tdXN0LWRpZS_SAWJodHRwczovL211c2ljLm14ZHduLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L3Jldmlld3MvYWxidW0tcmV2aWV3LXN1aWNpZGUtc2lsZW5jZS1yZW1lbWJlci15b3UtbXVzdC1kaWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The opposition party also said demonetisation has come a full circle and added that the Rs 2,000 note was a ""band-aid to cover up the foolish decision of demonetising"" Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  A party MP said it was the beginning of a second demonetisation ""disaster"", in an apparent reference to the demonetisation exercise of November 8, 2016, when the legal tender status of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes was withdrawn by the Modi government.  ""Typical of our self-styled Vishwaguru. First Act, Second Think (FAST). 2000 rupee notes introduced with such fanfare after that singularly disastrous 'Tughlaqi firman' of Nov 8 2016 are now being withdrawn,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Twitter, targeting the prime minister.  Senior Congress leader and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram said a few weeks after demonetisation, the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were forced to re-introduce the Rs 500 note and he will not be surprised if the Centre re-introduces the Rs 1,000 note as well.  ""The Rs 2000 note is hardly a popular medium of exchange. We said this in November 2016 and we have been proved correct. The Rs 2,000 note was a band-aid to cover up the foolish decision of demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes which were popular and widely exchanged currencies,"" he said on Twitter.  The Congress leader said that ""a few weeks after demonetisation, the government/RBI were forced to re-introduce the Rs 500 note"". ""I shall not be surprised if the government/RBI re-introduced the Rs 1,000 note as well. Demonetisation has come full circle,"" he said.  ""Rs 2,000 note was never a 'clean' note. It was not used by the vast majority of the people. It was used only by people to keep their black money, temporarily,"" the former finance minister said.  Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the ""ghost"" of November 8, 2016, has come back to haunt the nation once again.  ""The greatly propagated move of demonetisation continues to be a monumental disaster for this nation. The PM sermoned the nation on the benefits of the new 2,000 notes, today when the printing is stopped what happened to all those promises,"" he asked.  ""The government must explain its motive for such a step. The government continues its anti-people and anti-poor agenda. Hope the media questions the government on such a drastic measure and not attribute it to 'chip shortage' in the world,"" Khera said in a tweet.  Congress MP Manickam Tagore tweeted, ""Second Demo disaster starts .. M = Madness.""  The RBI on Friday announced withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency notes from circulation, and existing notes in circulation can either be deposited in bank accounts or exchanged by September 30.  The Rs 2,000 denomination bank note was introduced in November 2016, primarily to meet the currency requirement of the economy in an expeditious manner after the withdrawal of legal tender status of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes that were in circulation at that time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC52YXJ0aGFiaGFyYXRpLmluL2thcmF2YWxpL2JhbnR3YWwteW91dGgtY29tbWl0cy1zdWljaWRlLWJ5LWp1bXBpbmctaW50by1uZXRocmF2YXRoaS1yaXZlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-14","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:36:26","The second season of the Irish crime drama aired last Sunday with dramatic scenes gluing fans to their seats.  Bren (Francis Magee) waits as Michael returns from the job in the Kin finale  A suicide prevention charity has defended RTÉ’s decision to include a warning before the season finale of Kin after viewers complained that it “spoiled” the twist ending.  The second season of the Irish crime drama aired last Sunday with dramatic scenes gluing fans to their seats.  The explosive episode saw the terrifying Bren Kinsella (Francis Magee) being shot between the eyes by his own brother Frank, played by Aidan Gillen.  And in the final seconds of the finale, Frank puts a gun to his own temple and pulls the trigger in a shocking turn.  However, RTÉ showed a warning before the episode, cautioning viewers about the use of strong language, scenes of violence, and “scenes involving suicide”.  But several viewers were left fuming as they thought the warning ruined the dramatic ending.  One person tweeted: “Loved season 2 of Kin but who in RTÉ thought it was ok to give that warning at the start of the episode and not think that it would be a massive spoiler.”  Another told Newstalk that such caution warnings paint viewers out to be “victims” - especially on a show about gangland and crime.  “The idea that people turn up hiding behind the couch eating popcorn through the splayed hands and fingers, so worried about what they might see, is just ludicrous,” he said.  He also argued that you can't “protect people” from negative experiences and “if they realise it's part of real life, they tend to be stronger for the experience"".  However, suicide prevention and awareness charity Samaritans believe that content warnings are necessary and urge broadcasters to include them where relevant.  Sarah O’Toole, Executive Director for Samaritans Ireland, said that warnings are helpful to viewers who may have lost a loved one to suicide.  “While we do appreciate some people may feel these trigger warnings are spoilers, it is important to alert viewers to any suicide and self-harm content as it allows them to make the choice of whether or not it is suitable for them to watch,” she told sundayworld.com.  “This is particularly important for some viewers who may have been affected by the issues, for example those who have been bereaved by suicide or someone watching who has experience of suicidal feelings or past attempts.  “Our guidelines are there for everyone in the media (news journalists and documentary makers, as well as those working on television dramas or films) to ensure a programme does not negatively impact on someone who may be vulnerable”.  “We would like to remind anyone impacted by this storyline, or anyone struggling to cope, to reach out for support to Samaritans on freephone 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.ie.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheXdvcmxkLmNvbS9zaG93Yml6L2lyaXNoLXNob3diaXovc2FtYXJpdGFucy1kZWZlbmQtc3VpY2lkZS13YXJuaW5nLXRoYXQtc3BvaWxlZC1raW4tZmluYWxlL2ExMzk2MTg4NTAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For some, Blank’s death triggered feelings about dancer and reality TV star Stephen ‘Twitch’ Boss, who died by suicide on Dec. 13, 2022. He was 40 years old.  Researchers are sounding the alarm about rising suicide rates among black men in America in part due to the unique challenges they face, like structural racism, stereotypes and access to proper healthcare.  “Black men today are an endangered species. Black men today suffer more than any man in the country. The unemployment rate, black men suffer from a rise in mental health issues, black men suffer from police brutality, black men suffer from the breakup of homes and single parenting,” community activist Robert Muhammad said.  A recent study in the journal JAMA found that from 2000 to 2020, Black males had the highest increase in suicide attempts compared to any other race in the group, rising nearly 80%.  Among children ages 5-12, Black youth were two times more likely to die by suicide than their White counterparts.  Dr. Arthur Evans, CEO of the American Psychological Association, told Spectrum News one way psychologists are addressing these grim statistics is by creating space for Black men to open up and express themselves.  “One of the challenges that happens is that often African American men in particular don’t talk about how they’re feeling, don’t talk about what they’re experiencing. And one of the things that we know helps people is that we talk about these issues, we share what we are experiencing, we get feedback from, from other people,” Dr. Evans added.  Spectrum News also spoke with a group of Black men about what it means to be a Black man in America.  Because many suicidal acts are impulsive, suicide prevention hotlines can play a crucial role in de-escalating crises and saving lives.

Manchester school superintendent Jenn Gillis sent an email to district families Wednesday night that said in part: ""It is with deep sadness that we inform you that one of our students has died unexpectedly.""  Gillis wrote that ""This loss may raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire school community, especially our students.""  For that reason, counselors from other Manchester schools and the state Disaster Behavior Health Response Team spent Thursday at the school ""directly impacted"" by the death, district spokesman Andrew Toland said.  ""Our focus in the coming days and weeks is to be supportive of our students, families and staff,"" said Toland.  According to multiple sources, the student is believed to have been trying to take their own life.  Suicide is a growing risk for teenagers, and help is available for anyone with troubling thoughts. The quickest way to get help is to call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. The Crisis Text Line is also available: text ""Hello"" to 741741.  The death took place at the Huse Road overpass, which bridges the I-293 highway just east of the Mall of New Hampshire. The bridge has chain-link fencing to prevent people from falling off.  It is a little more than a mile from Southside Middle School.  Emergency dispatch logs showed the person jumped just minutes before 3 p.m. and fell on the eastbound lanes.  The death caused a huge traffic backup in both directions. Within 20 minutes, New Hampshire State Police had opened the high-speed lane for traffic.  But traffic remained snarled for hours. It took authorities about two hours to reopen the entire highway.  State police did not release more information about the incident.  Story continues  Word of the death quickly spread throughout Manchester.  At Amoskeag Health's annual breakfast Thursday, board Chairman Christian Scott asked for a moment of silence for a 14-year-old who had died by suicide.  Manchester school officials said parents may have to face the sensitive job of discussing death with their children. They recommended the website FriendsofAine.com as one resource.

When he first told her, Davis said, “I was devastated. I thought it was the most horrible thing ever.”  Davis spoke in length about the evolution her family underwent during an appearance on a KSAT 12 newscast two years ago, in hopes of helping other families.  She had testified before the Texas Legislature warning about the potential consequences of anti-trans legislation.  But Davis said the problem was, “Belief is belief. Truth is truth. We have to separate those two.”  Now, Davis is speaking out following the passage of SB14, the Children’s Gender Protection Act, sponsored by State Sen. Donna Campbell, a New Braunfels physician.  After it’s signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, the law will ban puberty blockers and hormone treatments for trans youth under the age of 18.  In a statement posted in full below, Campbell said, “Our children need counseling and love, not blades and drugs.”  However, Davis said instead of protecting children, she predicts the suicide rate among trans youth will go even higher.  As it is, Davis said her son who came out as trans when he was about 15, had been suicidal before he began his transition.  “Why would you want to live in a society that tells you that you’re an abomination and that you’re trash and not worth anything every single day of your life?” Davis asks.  She said thankfully, there are groups in San Antonio, such as Fiesta Youth, PFLAG and The Trevor Project that focus on the issues confronting trans youth and their families.  Following is Sen. Campbell’s full statement:  Our children need counseling and love, not blades and drugs. This bill is the compassionate solution to protect vulnerable children from these medically unnecessary and irreversible gender modification treatments. As a medical doctor, I am pleased that the Legislature has recognized the reality of the science of adolescent care and stepped in to protect young Texans.” “I am grateful to the House author of this bill and my fellow physician, Representative Tom Oliverson. He has been an indispensable partner throughout this process. My sincere thanks also go out to Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for making my bill his priority during this session, as well as my Senate and House colleagues who have supported SB 14 and fought to protect Texas children.

"suicide","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""WestDesMoines"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:00:00","Actions include $200 million to scale up 988 suicide and crisis lifeline and new resources for school-based mental health services  This Mental Health Awareness Month, we honor all those experiencing mental health challenges and celebrate the mental health professionals, families, and caregivers who support them. It is clear that our country is facing an unprecedented mental health crisis impacting people of all ages. In 2021, two in five American adults reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression and forty-four percent of high school students reported struggling with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, and gun violence. The Biden-Harris Administration is firmly committed to addressing this crisis.  As part of his Unity Agenda, President Biden released a comprehensive national strategy to transform how mental health is understood, accessed, treated, and integrated in and out of health care settings. Across the federal government, thanks to the President’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the Administration has already invested unprecedented levels of funding to expand access to mental health services. The President’s FY24 budget goes further, proposing tens of billions more to transform behavioral health services for all Americans.    Today, which is recognized as Mental Health Day of Action, and throughout Mental Health Awareness Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing additional critical actions to advance the President’s mental health strategy across its three key objectives: strengthening the mental health workforce and system capacity, connecting more Americans to care, and creating a continuum of support.    Strengthen the Mental Health Workforce and System Capacity  Addressing the mental health crisis requires that we confront the severe shortage of mental health professionals and strengthen the capacity of the behavioral health care system. As a result, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions this month to:  Increase the size and diversity of the behavioral health workforce. Thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the Department of Education (ED) has awarded more than $280 million in funding to bolster the pipeline of mental health professionals serving in schools and expand school-based mental health services and supports. Earlier this week, ED announced $95 million of this total was awarded in grants across 35 states to increase access to school-based mental health services and strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in high-needs school districts. Grantees from ED’s mental health programs project that these funds will create more than 14,000 new mental health professionals in U.S. schools – including school psychologists, counselors, social workers. This month, ED also announced new funding for a center that will provide technical assistance to grantees working to address the critical need in prekindergarten-12 schools for school-based mental health service providers. This summer, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) will announce a new Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) funding opportunity for approximately $8.4 million to support 16 awards to recruit and train providers to provide behavioral support to children and adolescents.  Expand access to peer support. A peer worker is someone with lived experience with a mental health and/or substance use condition, and who works with other people with similar conditions in a wide range of non-clinical activities including advocacy, navigation and linkage to resources, sharing of experience, social support, and more. In the coming weeks, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will release the National Model Standards for Peer Support Certification. The new standards are designed to improve consistency across peer certifications and promote quality of the growing number of peer workers across the nation.  Enhance crisis response. To ensure those in crisis have access to services, SAMHSA announced the availability of more than $200 million for states, territories, call centers, and Tribal organizations to continue strengthening 988 operations. Through the SAMHSA supported 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, the network receives approximately 100,000 calls, chats, and texts each week. Later this month, SAMHSA will also announce more than $9 million in awards in cooperative agreements for community crisis response partnerships. This funding will support mobile crisis response teams to ensure adults and youth experiencing mental health crises in high-need communities receive faster access to trained mental health professionals.  Expand proven models of care. To build capacity to meet the mental health needs of Americans, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded 15 one-year state planning grants to help states develop the necessary capacity to compete to participate in the Certified Community Behavioral Health Center (CCBHC) Medicaid Demonstration. CCBHCs provide 24/7, comprehensive behavioral health care – including crisis care – to the most vulnerable Americans regardless of their ability to pay. Thanks to BSCA, we are working to expand these clinics and help more states enter the program.  Connect More Americans to Care  Even when services are available, barriers like cost, cultural bias, and inconvenience often prevent people from accessing the care they need. On average, it takes 11 years after the onset of mental health symptoms for someone to seek treatment. To help remove these barriers, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to:  Make it easier to find help. It is simply too hard to know where to start when you or a loved one experiences a mental health challenge. That’s why HHS launched FindSupport.Gov, a brand-new, easy-to-access, free-of-charge, and user-friendly online resource for all Americans to learn how to get support for mental health, drug, and alcohol issues.  Provide mental health services in schools. To help address student mental health needs, today, CMS released an updated Medicaid School Claiming and Administrative Guide and ED released a proposed rule that would revise processes on Medicaid billing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, both of which are intended to make it easier for schools to provide health services to students with Medicaid. In addition, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) initiated a Behavioral Health and Wellness Program to provide indigenous focused, evidence-based, and trauma-informed behavioral health and wellness services and resources, including an expanded tele-behavioral health BIE specific 24/7 crisis hotline, to students and staff at all BIE-funded schools, colleges, universities, dormitories, and programs.  Support mental health of workers. Work related stress and burnout can lead to mental health challenges for America’s working families. To help address workplace mental health, earlier this month, the Department of Labor (DOL) launched a Mental Health at Work Initiative to promote key resources in support employees and employers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also rolled out the Workplace Stress Toolkit to provide guidance and tips for employers, training resources, and outreach materials to reduce stress and burnout among workers.  Reduce stigma for service members and veterans. Service members and veterans are at increased risk for mental health challenges. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a new policy that makes it easier for Service members to seek support by self-initiating a referral for a mental health evaluation through a commanding officer or supervisor. This policy, based on the Brandon Act, allows Service members to seek confidential help, reducing stigma associated with mental health issues. This month, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is also leveraging its Today I Am Campaign, to showcase veterans’ stories of getting help to inspire other veterans to proactively seek support and resources.  Deliver mental health services to caregivers. To help address the stress of family caregiving, this month, VA launched a pilot program to provide mental health services to caregivers enrolled in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. This new program will address the unique mental health needs of veteran caregivers by providing evidence-based services centered around couples, family therapy, and the individual needs of the caregiver.  Reduce disparities in maternal mental health. Too often, postpartum depression and anxiety go undiagnosed. This month, HRSA will announce awards for more than $65 million to 25 HRSA-funded health centers to implement innovative approaches to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce disparities for women from underserved backgrounds by supporting health centers to partner with patients and the community to develop and pilot innovative, patient-centered, scalable models of care delivery that address the clinical and health-related social needs of health center patients at highest risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. HRSA also just marked the one-year anniversary of the maternal mental health hotline. The 24/7 hotline, 1-833-TLC-MAMA, provides support before, during and after pregnancy and is currently staffed by more than three dozen call-takers, including nurses, doulas, and lactation consultants. During the first year, the hotline received more than 12,000 calls and texts.  Promote behavioral health equity. Earlier this month, SAMHSA launched a Behavioral Health Equity Challenge which will provide up to ten awards to community-based organizations for innovative outreach and engagement strategies that help members of underserved racial and ethnic communities engage in culturally and linguistically responsive services across the continuum of care for behavioral health, including mental health promotion, substance misuse prevention, and treatments and supports that foster recovery.  Create Healthy and Supportive Environments  In addition to investments in the health care system, we must also build environments that promote wellness and recovery and prevent mental health challenges from occurring in the first place. This month, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to:  Improve youth resilience. Unlike ever before, our kids are facing the consequences of multiple crises at once, from COVID-19 to gun violence among other key issues. HHS announced the new Children and Youth Resilience Prize Challenge, which will award $1 million to innovative community-led solutions to promote resilience in children and adolescents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters.  Promote the importance of social connection. Social isolation and loneliness are far too common. People from all walks of life have been forced to grapple with increase social isolation and loneliness, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the U.S. Surgeon General released a new Advisory on Addressing Loneliness and Promoting Social Connection. And, CDC also launched a new website for adults, which provides key suggestions on how to combat loneliness by improving social connectedness.  Invest in early childhood mental health. Like with physical health, it is important for us to start taking care of the mental health of our children as early in their lives as possible. Later this month, SAMHSA will award $9.7 million in grants through the infant and early childhood mental health program to improve outcomes for children from birth up to 12 years of age via improved interventions and treatment services.  Improve suicide prevention efforts. Beyond scaling up 988, the Administration is also taking additional actions to better prevent suicide. The Indian Health Service (IHS) will implement a system-wide suicide prevention training for all staff to increase recognition and response to suicide within American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Later this month, SAMHSA will award $6 million in suicide prevention grants across multiple programs to support states and tribes with implementing youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies in schools, institutions of higher education, juvenile justice systems, substance use and mental health programs, foster care systems, and other child and youth-serving organizations.  Launch public call-to-action to support research. This month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy called on non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, academic institutions, companies, and other research funders to share their actions and collaborations to help advance national mental health research priorities. This builds on the first-of-its-kind White House Report on Mental Health Research Priorities, which outlined a set of critical and timely needs and opportunities in mental health research.  Improve employee wellness. Americans spend much of their lives working, so it is critical that we foster healthy mental health practices even at work. Later this month, the Administration’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will release an Employee Wellness Program Guidance for agencies on best practices for providing wellness services to federal employees. The Administration also launched an interagency Mental Health and Well-being Community of Practice to continue to identify best practices and develop a government-wide toolkit for agencies containing metrics, data, insights, and options for agencies to use to understand and promote employee well-being and mental health.  Expand access to recovery. Treatment works and recovery is possible, and the Administration is committed to supporting all living in recovery. In the coming weeks, SAMHSA will announce $5.4 million in grant awards for building communities of recovery to support mobilization and connection of community-based resources to increase access to and quality of long-term recovery support for people with substance use disorders and co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWJpZGVuLWhhcnJpcy1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWFjdGlvbnMtdG8tdGFja2xlLW5hdGlvbnMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1jcmlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""March"", ""Cambridgeshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:16:00","GUEST COMMENTARY - An acquaintance recently contacted me with a rumor that 2 students attending the high school I graduated from, Harvard-Westlake (HW), had recently committed suicide, and asking me if I had heard about that. So, I spent several hours on google and here is what I found out. Yes, that's true. One was a boy and one was a girl. Both were enrolled at the Upper School (HW has two campuses because it was a merger of Harvard and Westlake in order to become a coed school). Both suicides involved the use of guns. One occurred in March and the other in April. There was also a suicide of a good looking, academically accomplished, and athletic HW Alum in October, a Senior at Brown. And, finally, I already knew about the suicide of HW Alum Steve Bing in the middle of 2020, during the Covid Depression/Loneliness Era, a time of increasing suicide.  I graduated from Harvard Boys School or Harvard HS, one year before it became coed by merging with one of our sister schools, Westlake. I have been active in local politics and have run for office...hence my continuing frustration with the dominance of the LA Times in Los Angeles. LA Weekly used to be a strong news source...no more. The Daily News is a shell of what it once was, publishing a lot of CNS (City News Service) wire reports, although there has been recent improvement. Recently, the Times won the Pulitzer Prize, and I was left wondering: How long did the Times sit on the story/scandal?  Why didn't the Pulitzer go to Jon Peltz? Would the Times have released the audio if Peltz had not? Would the Times have run the story when they did if they didn't know that others were gonna publish on the same day?  Harvard-Westlake is the most prestigious school in the City of LA, btw, so sitting on the story of the suicides is not right. It's also not good for preventing other suicides. If you hide suicide, if you shame it, if you leave it to whispering and rumors, that's not healthy. What is best is to openly discuss it.  Perhaps if the March suicide had been reported and discussed openly (or even the 2 previous suicides by the accomplished Alums of the school), the April suicide could have been prevented. It is not healthy to shame Depression. Julia Wick, who worked on the HW Chronicle (the school's paper), just won a Pulitzer at the LA Times. The HW Chronicle did not mention suicide when discussing the deaths of these students/alums. Is that what we're teaching our future journalists? To hide the truth. Coincidentally, the Owner of the LA Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, is a HW Parent. His son Luke graduated from HW in 2014. It is wrong to suppress the news.  It has been reported that Dr Soon-Shiong's daughter, Nika, influenced the paper's endorsements (and its reporting) during the last LA City Election cycle. I remember a particularly unethical endorsement of Lindsey Horvath by the Times Editorial Board, which did not mention that she was buddies with Nika, that she had put Nika on the WeHo Public Safety Commission, or that Nika and Horvath both supported defunding law enforcement. That last very important position was not mentioned in the endorsement because it would have lost Horvath votes. The Times also endorsed Katy Yaroslavsky, who is now working under the radar to dismantle no camping zones in the City of LA's 5th Council District and throughout the Very Large City of LA (which has 15 council districts, each one of which is the size of a city)...she just voted against new no camping zones in Bob Blumenfield's Woodland Hills hood. She'll keep no camping zones for schools; she's not that stupid. But she's endangering us by attempting to get rid of all the non-school no camping zones that have been created...for good public safety reasons. Seemingly on a quest to repay a favor to Nika.  (Yuval Kremer is a former ballot candidate for Mayor of LA (not a fan of HW Alum and former Mayor Garcetti) and LA County Supervisor (ran against Sheila Kuehl, Katy's former boss. The opinions expressed by Yuval Kremer are his and not those of CityWatchLA.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHl3YXRjaGxhLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvY3cvdm9pY2VzLzI2OTYyLXN0dWRlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtYXQtaGFydmFyZC13ZXN0bGFrZS1uby1jb3ZlcmFnZS1pbi1hLW9uZS1uZXdzcGFwZXItdG93btIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thomas Hartwell, former Kane County circuit clerk, was found dead in his Palatine office Wednesday as a result of an apparent suicide, officials said. Hartwell had been facing several felony charges related to misusing county founds and receiving kickbacks. (Thomas M. “Tom” Hartwell campaign)  Former Kane County Circuit Clerk Thomas Hartwell, indicted last month on charges of misusing public money and receiving kickbacks, was found dead Wednesday morning in an apparent suicide, officials said.  Hartwell, 63, was discovered at his Palatine law firm office, according to the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office.  Advertisement  Kane County Sheriff Ron Hain said deputies were called to Hartwell’s home in unincorporated Elgin about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday by a family member who said Hartwell had been missing for about 24 hours.  At the deputies’ request, Palatine police checked the Collins, Radja & Hartwell law office, 330 W. Colfax St., where they discovered Hartwell had taken his own life, Hain said.  Advertisement  An autopsy has not been conducted yet and the cause of death has not been released. Palatine police said the investigation is ongoing.  In late April, Hartwell was indicted on felony theft and official misconduct charges in connection with the alleged misuse of nearly $120,000 in public funds while in he was in office, court records show.  He also was charged with several counts of committing wire fraud, money laundering, misapplying funds as a government employee and income tax fraud, according to court records.  The charges came after a two-year investigation by Illinois State Police and the Illinois Department of Revenue, officials said.  Hartwell was released from jail on a signature bond, and was next due in court May 26.  Hartwell’s brother, Todd, posted on note on Facebook about his brother’s death, encouraging people to “send prayers to his fiancé Liz and his two boys, David and Dan.”  “Tom was a man who followed Jesus Christ,” Todd Hartwell wrote. “A man of towering intellect and logic. Passionate about the things that matter and a mentor to many.”  The criminal investigation into possible wrongdoing started in January 2021, when Kane County State’s Attorney Jamie Mosser said she notified state police about what appeared to be Hartwell’s misappropriation of county funds.  Advertisement  It’s alleged that between December 2018 and November 2020, Hartwell may have steered $119,575 in public money to two companies run by Robert Gutierrez, of St. Charles, prosecutors said. Gutierrez, who served as president of the companies, allegedly gave Hartwell $15,000 in kickbacks.  Hartwell was also accused of failing to report income on his 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax returns, officials said.  It is unclear how the criminal case will proceed with Hartwell’s death. Gutierrez was indicted in April for theft by deception of greater than $100,000 and providing kickbacks, officials said.  Hartwell served as the circuit court clerk from 2012 to 2020, when he lost a reelection bid to current Circuit Clerk Theresa Barreiro. He ran unsuccessfully to be a circuit court judge in 2017.  Hartwell, a Republican, served as a Kane County Board member from 1996 to 2000 and was a former chairman of the Kane County Republican Party.  He was also a volunteer for numerous youth sports leagues and served as the former chairman of the board of the Elgin Recreation Center and Aurora Recreation Center. The youth programs were aimed at helping keep children from joining gangs.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Daily Press.  Newport News Shipbuilding workers and Navy sailors walk past the USS George Washington as it rests pier side the morning of Oct. 11, 2019. The aircraft carrier is about halfway through Refueling and Complex Overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. (Jonathon Gruenke / Daily Press)  After months spent investigating a series of suicides of Hampton Roads-based sailors last year, the Navy has concluded that it failed its own personnel on an individual and systemic level.  The Navy released Thursday the findings of a comprehensive investigation into command climate and sailor quality of life and details 48 recommendations. It is meant to address what Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea called “years worth of systemic shortcomings.”  Advertisement  “The tragedy of the suicides in the Norfolk area shows that the Navy can and must do a better job of caring for sailors and their families,” Honea said in a virtual media roundtable Thursday morning.  The investigation focused on the USS George Washington, which came under scrutiny after three sailors died by suicide within a week last year while the carrier was undergoing an extended overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. An initial investigation found “life stressors” contributed to the life-ending decisions of the three sailors, but concluded the deaths were otherwise not connected.  Advertisement  Less than eight months later, the Norfolk-based Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center reported four suicides within 28 days. A separate Navy investigation also released Thursday found those deaths were not connected.  But the investigations into both commands reflected a failure in maintaining a suitable Navy standard.  “In both cases there was an organizational drift — a slow erosion over time — conditions that were clearly not right became acceptable,” reads a memorandum signed by Adm. Michael Gilday, chief of naval operations, and Carlos Del Toro, secretary of the Navy.  [ Military given deadline to implement Brandon Act, aiming to help service members seek mental health care ]  The investigation into the Washington was launched with the purpose of evaluating the challenges unique to a shipyard environment. During the investigation into potential connections between the Washington suicides, sailors reported constant noise and cold temperatures aboard a shell of a ship that was periodically without hot water and power.  “The events of the past year have caused me to reflect on the ideas of ‘habitability’ versus ‘suitability.’ Our shipyard ships may be habitable and able to sustain life (a minimum standard), but not suitable from a quality of life standport (an acceptable standard),” Rear Adm. John Meier wrote in his endorsement of the investigation’s findings.  The Washington entered dry-dock in 2017 for its midlife refuel and complex overhaul. That process typically takes four years. But the pandemic lengthened it by two years.  Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces, said throughout the investigation, it was “pointedly obvious the Navy had failed the George Washington.” Since entering its maintenance period, the Washington has experienced nine suicides among its crew dating back to 2017.  The investigation recommends the Navy create a split-tour program that ensures first-term sailors are not assigned to dry-docked aircraft carriers for more than two years.  Advertisement  “We definitely want a sailor who joined the Navy to go to sea, to get that opportunity to see the ocean, get into a port call, experience why that person joined and not spend that entire tour in a maintenance facility,” Caudle said.  Meier also touched on this issue, writing in his endorsement letter: “These shipyard sailors hoped for more, to be part of something bigger than themselves, and be part of a team … Sailors joined the Navy ‘to see the world,’ accelerate their lives, or to be ‘forged by the sea,’ but not to see the shipyard or drive a bus.”  It is also recommended every sailor assigned to a ship in an industrial environment receives allowance for off-ship and off-base housing — a benefit that is not currently available to junior sailors.  “When not underway, no sailor should be required to live on a ship or barge, with the exception of the duty section,” Caudle said.  The investigation also recommends working with local government and industry to improve parking for sailors assigned to public and private shipyards.  At one point, the Navy partnered with Newport News Shipbuilding to secure 2,100 parking spaces across four Hampton Roads locations for Washington sailors. But the investigation found local infrastructure is still “insufficient” to support the crews of multiple aircraft carriers in overhaul and new construction in the shipyard.  Advertisement  “There remains inadequate parking, transportation, access to food and nutritional options, training space, physical fitness facilities and housing options available to support the number of sailors assigned to ships and submarines in the shipyard. This directly contributed to poor Sailor QoS and morale,” Caudle wrote in his endorsement of the findings.  Three of the parking locations are considered “too far to walk” and require a shuttle ride to the shipyard. Travel time from two locations, one in Chesapeake and one in Suffolk, averages more than 50 minutes one way.  A former executive officer of the Washington, who was not named, told investigators: “I said this was unacceptable but eventually saw the writing on the wall and stopped fighting because the discussion was going nowhere … I believe all RCOH carriers experience the same parking issues. This is a solvable problem and it’s really about money. It’s an issue of the burden we put on sailors versus the cost we are willing to pay for that parking.”  Daywatch Weekdays Start your morning with today's local news By submitting your email to receive this newsletter, you agree to our Subscriber Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy >  The Navy plans to establish a single, accountable senior civilian for the development of a long-term quality of service plan that is specific to Newport News Shipbuilding in an effort to improve the overall quality of life for shipyard-bound sailors.  “I am never going to try to give you a reason why it takes a large mishap incident, a 9-11 event, to make the Navy — my organization, which I love — wake up and attack a problem that we should have seen coming,” Caudle said.  In conjunction with the Washington quality of service investigation, the Navy released a “new course for Navy quality of service” memorandum.  Advertisement  According to the memo, the Navy will work for the next 90 days to identify a definitive timeline on when all recommendations would be implemented. But some long-term solutions will require congressional funding or authorization.  “The conditions experienced by those assigned to the USS George Washington and MARMC are not the result of any act or inaction by any single leader. Collectively, Navy senior leadership, officer and civilian, let our standards slip — and in doing so we let our people down,” the memorandum reads.

He then committed suicide by stabbing himself with “a broken beer bottle in his neck and all over his body.”    There were no traces of anyone else in the room, local police said, adding that the conclusion was based on forensic investigations of the bodies and the crime scene.    The police said the incident was caused by “internal reasons” leading to a dispute, although an investigation into the exact motive is still ongoing.  The couple arrived in Bali on April 27 and had a dispute before arriving at the InterContinental hotel. They were found covered in blood and naked after drinking five bottles of beer ordered from room service, investigators said.    Back home, the investigation results have prompted more questions than answers for Chinese netizens. In response to a trending Weibo hashtag, which has received over 57 million views, a verified Weibo influencer questioned why the man crawled out into the corridor after stabbing himself.    In a Weibo poll, some 72% of more than 1,400 respondents questioned the investigation result, with only 13% of respondents saying that it is credible. In another Weibo poll that happened before the investigation result was announced, over half of the 36,000 respondents said they will not go to Bali again, while more than 6,000 respondents said that they had plans to go but not anymore.    Some netizens are calling for further investigation and even involvement from Chinese police.    With Chinese tourists’ enthusiasm for traveling to Southeast Asia already hit by dark rumors swirling online in recent months, the latest incident is likely to hit demand further. Li, a worker from Beijing, told local media Jiemian News that his wife’s company had organized a trip to Bali next month, but is now considering canceling or postponing.    Flight prices from Shanghai to Bali slumped more than 40% from an average of $575 in early April to around $383 over the past month, according to Google Flights data.    And it is not just Bali that could be affected. Zhang Yu, a tourist guide in Chiang Mai, Thailand, told Jiemian News that local travel agencies have seen their orders being canceled recently for safety reasons.    It comes after a Chinese businessman’s brutal death in Thailand on Tuesday jumped to the top of social media discussions. Local media reported that he was found with more than 20 knife wounds in a resort hotel room. Three suspects have been arrested.  Three Chinese tourists in Thailand were also robbed in violent fashion earlier this month.    Chinese tourists are a major source of income for both Thailand and Indonesia, which saw their local tourism industries suffer as a result of China’s COVID-19 restrictions on international tourism.  Following the lifting of these restrictions, more than 500,000 Chinese tourists visited Thailand in the first quarter of this year. However, April’s total of 237,000 travelers was “below expectations,” Thailand’s tourism bureau said recently.  Editor: Vincent Chow.

"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""Edinburgh"", ""Edinburgh"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:20:41","Scottish faith leaders urge Parliament not to legalize assisted suicide  Scottish faith leaders are making a joint plea to MSPs to reject the legalization of assisted suicide in Scotland.  The Moderator of the Church of Scotland General Assembly, the Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields, the Vice President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Scotland, Bishop John Keenan, and the Imam of Dundee Central Mosque, Imam Shaykh Hamza Khandwalla, held a meeting with MSPs at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday to express their opposition.  During their meeting, hosted by the Logos Scotland think-tank, they signed a statement voicing their ""deep concern"" over the proposals and urged MSPs to vote them down.  The statement says that assisted suicide undermines human dignity and puts pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.  ""Our faith traditions are united in the principle that assisted dying in itself inevitably undermines the dignity of the human person, and to allow it would mean that our society as a whole loses its common humanity,"" the statement says.  ""The Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques remain firm in their opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia.""  The latest campaign for the legalization of assisted suicide is being led by Liam McArthur, Lib Dem MSP for Orkney, whose Member's Bill would allow competent terminally ill adults to request assistance to end their life.  The faith leaders add in their joint statement, ""The ways in which similar laws in other countries are being applied, and the effect that its introduction would have on some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the disabled and the elderly, would be extremely detrimental.""  The statement ends with a call to MSPs ""to consider carefully the implications of this bill, to express their concerns, and to vote against it.""  Bishop Keenan said: ""Assisted suicide attacks human dignity and results in human life being increasingly valued on the basis of its efficiency and utility. Implicit in legal assisted suicide is that an individual can lose their value and worth.  ""Evidence from countries where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal shows that vulnerable people feel pressured to end their lives through fear of being a burden. In such situations, the option of assisted suicide is less about having a 'right' to die and more about feeling the full weight and expectation of a duty to die.  ""When vulnerable people, including the elderly and poor, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.""  The Rev. Greenshields said: ""Our opposition to assisted dying is based on our Christian faith, and involves concerns around the principle of assisted dying, around the application of the law in practice, the perception of the value of human lives, and also the effect which any change is likely to have on the provision of care — in particular, on palliative care.""

"suicide","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:15:00","While falls cause more worksite deaths than any other type of accident, prompting the Dept. of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to launch a new fall prevention program, there is growing recognition that there is another invisible jobsite danger in mental health disorders.  “Devastatingly, more construction workers die annually from suicide than from every other workplace-related fatality combined, making suicide rates in construction the second highest of any U.S. industry group,” wrote John F. Fish, chairman and CEO of Boston-based Suffolk Construction in a May 2 letter to the OSHA, urging it to include suicide awareness and prevention training as a core requirement in the OSHA 10 and OSHA 30 curricula.  Fish co-signed the letter with retired Brigadier General Jack Hammond, executive director of Home Base, a private clinic in Charlestown, Mass. that provides clinical treatment, wellness and other services for veterans and first responders.  An OSHA spokesperson says the agency ""recognizes that mental health stressors exist at work"" and noted that OSHA is ""currently exploring how we may better incorporate information to increase awareness and help employers recognize signs and symptoms of mental health concerns. Our goal is to better protect workers through education and outreach training programs.""      Sobering Statistics  Suicide rates were highest among males in construction at 53.2 suicides per 100,000 workers in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  A Construction Industry Rehabilitation Plan (CIRP) study found that 83% of construction workers have struggled with mental health issues although only a third said they would communicate this to their employers.  “Construction workers are four times more likely to commit suicide than any other occupation,” said Tim Stroud, Suffolk national chief operating officer, who recently hosted Suffolk's Mental Health Fireside Chat during Safety Week. While the industry doesn’t talk much about mental health, it is “a major issue in the industry,” he says.  Suffolk says it hopes to lay the foundation for providing workers with practical information about mental health awareness and strategies and approaches for managing it, he says.  Speaking during the fireside chat, Dr. Louis Chow, senior director at Home Base Training Institute and Network Development, says “one of the realities of the industry is that it is predominantly male, middle-aged and white … and easily associated with mental health outcomes including, unfortunately, completed suicides.” The focus needs to shift from remaining silent “to knowing when, where, and from whom to get help,” he says.      App-based Wellness  Firms across the country are coming up with new ways to battle the industry's mental health issues.  For example, Counslr.com on May 12 announced a partnership with Tri-Star Construction Corp. to provide Tri-Star workers with access to its platform providing unlimited access to mental health support with licensed counselors via its mobile app.  “When an organization partners with Counslr, their employees gain access to an unlimited number of live texting sessions with licensed counselors for one fixed price, all from within the Counslr mobile app,"" says Josh Liss, Counslr, CEO. “Licensed mental health professionals are on-call around the clock, so covered employees can hold a session any time or day, either on-demand or by scheduled appointment,” he says.  Douglas Dupas, vice president and director of operations at Tri-Star, says despite working in a ""stressful"" industry, they can better serve their clients, which include architects, subcontractors and vendors, ""by having access to licensed mental health professionals.""  He says that's ""key to helping us maintain our high standard of service. One of our core values is dedicated teamwork and having such a helpful resource like Counslr at our disposal helps the entire team stay on top of their game.”      Behavioral Changes  Lyra Health, a Burlingame, Calif.-based provider of global workforce mental health benefits, provides benefit-based wellness support to Suffolk workers.  Suffolk relies on Lyra wellness webinars to help employees learn observational skills that can help prevent suicide. Employees are encouraged to look for signs of change in teammates in four broad categories. The first involves changes in mood or behavior; the second, statements about their health and wellness such as not eating or sleeping; the third, any change in cognition, such as having trouble concentrating; and the fourth, any indication they are thinking about harming themselves.  ""It is valuable for everyone to be able to notice signs of distress in coworkers,"" says Dr. Joe Grasso, senior director at Lyra. ""The goal is not to turn everyone into therapists, but to recognize basic broad, high level signs that someone could be in a state of mental health distress, so they can check in and be referred for appropriate resources.""  Employees also learn about strategies for managing daily stress. This could include having a worker notice when they get stressed by monitoring tension in their body or deciding if they want to work on their stress by asking the question: Is stress serving or blocking you? Deep breathing and body scans are other strategies Suffolk offers in its mental health toolbox.  Lyra offers a range of care options. including in-person video conferencing, text messaging through a Lyra mobile app; and 24/7 access to their in-house concierge, a Suffolk spokesperson says. Typically, ""the first interaction will be with a care advocate who can transfer a member to a licensed care navigator if that member needs to speak with a licensed clinician to help with their search for care or provide in-the-moment support,"" he says.  Suffolk pays Lyra to have employees receive 16 free sessions per year, but the fee per session is not a fixed rate since every provider has different contracted rates based on factors such as experience, location, and specialties.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTY0NjQtY29udHJhY3RvcnMtYm9vc3Qtd2VsbG5lc3MtcHJvZ3JhbXMtdG8tcHJldmVudC1zdWljaWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Catoosa County Sheriff Gary Sisk says the woman was armed and suicidal, and raised a firearm in her driveway, which forced deputies to fire their service weapon ""four to five times.""  The incident happened at a home on Foster Lane a little before 6 p.m.  Sheriff Sisk says deputies responded to a call that a woman was armed with a handgun and threatening to kill herself.  While on the way to the scene, deputies were told shots were being fired inside of the home.  Arriving deputies found the woman in the driveway of the residence, holding the handgun in her hand, according to Sheriff Sisk.  A release says  Deputies took cover, observed the woman raise her gun toward them, and fired their service weapons four to five times.    The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) later described the situation this way:  The deputies gave verbal commands for [the woman] to drop her weapon. She refused to comply. [The woman] advanced toward the deputies with the handgun pointed directly at them. The deputies fired multiple times. [The woman] was hit.  (Though the GBI identified the woman, it is NewsChannel 9's longstanding practice to not identify people who are suicidal or have died by suicide).  Those deputies immediately ran to the woman to provide first aid, and an ambulance later rushed the woman to Erlanger hospital.  The GBI says the woman is now in critical but stable condition.  No one else was hurt.  All of the deputies involved are now in administrative leave with pay, as is standard procedure for incidents like this.  The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is now investigating the incident.

"suicide","2023-04-26","22:00:00","{""Lenexa"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:00:00","LENEXA, Kan. — The mother of Mikey Williamson, one of the victims in a high-profile double murder-suicide in February 2022 in Lenexa, is sharing her son’s story with KSHB 41.  She’s never spoken publicly about the incident until now.  “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t relive that in some way, but also I do a lot of things to heal,” said Melanie Williamson, Mikey's mother.  Police said an ex-boyfriend of Mikey’s friend, Sara Beck, tracked her with a GPS device. The KSHB 41 I-Team previously spoke with Sara’s father, Desmond Theel, about the case.  “As a father, it’s kind of hard not to look inward, look at myself, and ask myself, 'What did I do wrong?'” Theel said.  Since the double murder-suicide, state lawmakers in Kansas have taken action to strengthen stalking laws, with Gov. Laura Kelly signing a bill into law in late April.  The change comes after a series of reports from the I-Team about the case.  “With all of the technology now, it’s a stalker’s dream to be able to pinpoint the location of their intended victims, so I’m very glad we got this done,” Kelly said.  REMEMBERING MIKEY  Melanie Williamson  Melanie Williamson cherishes the tokens left for her son at his gravesite. It brings her joy when she visits him with family friends.  “It’s just important to know that they’re remembered and to see how loved they are or he is,” she said.  In February 2022, Mikey and his friend Sara were victims of a double murder-suicide. They worked together and knew each other for only a few weeks.  Melanie said they both enjoyed outdoor activities — Mikey loved fishing and Sara rode horses.  “She seemed like a really nice girl. I would’ve liked to gotten to know her,” she said.  WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT  KSHB 41  Lenexa police said Sara’s ex-boyfriend tracked her with a GPS device to Melanie’s house, where Mikey lived.  Police said the ex-boyfriend shot Sara and Mikey before taking his own life.  “I mean it was horrifying,"" Melanie said. ""I mean we woke up to gunshots, and then he was in the room right next to us.""  That night, Melanie said Mikey was out with his friends. When he got home, Mikey shut his parents’ bedroom door to let them know they could go to sleep.  Melanie later made the horrifying discovery.  “I immediately went into shock, and I think I stayed there for a good three to four months, truthfully,” she said.  FINDING JOY  KSHB 41  Time has helped Melanie heal. Still, she says she will never forget her son who was only 20 years old.  “He had a lot more to do,"" she said. ""It’s just horrible that it happened this way, but I have to be grateful for the good things.""  Melanie has fond memories of Mikey fishing at a nearby pond with his friends. Those memories are why the family chose a particular spot in the cemetery and etched a fisherman next to his name.  “There’s a lot of joy that lives alongside the grief, and you have to fight for that but it’s there,” she said.  Melanie’s focus is now all about finding joy, looking for glimpses in pictures she took of her son.  “He was so full of life and happiness,” she said.  CHANGE IN KANSAS LAW  KSHB 41  In late April, Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill into law that will strengthen stalking laws in Kansas.  “I just think that everything we can do to keep people safe, we should be doing,” Melanie said.  The bill makes clear tracking devices or tracking device data will be part of the stalking criteria. It also helps protect those who have restraining orders or protection orders by clarifying the law about tracking devices.  Kansas now joins more than 20 other states with laws on the books about the devices.  “I hope it’s enough,” Melanie said.  In Missouri, a similar bill was filed in the legislature. It would ban someone from putting a tracking device on someone’s car without the owner’s consent.  It did not make it through the legislature this session.  —","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2hiLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvaS1ob3BlLWl0cy1lbm91Z2gtbW90aGVyLW9mLWxlbmV4YS1kb3VibGUtbXVyZGVyLXN1aWNpZGUtdmljdGltLXNwZWFrcy1hcy1rYW5zYXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtc3RhbGtpbmctbGF30gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzaGIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy9pLWhvcGUtaXRzLWVub3VnaC1tb3RoZXItb2YtbGVuZXhhLWRvdWJsZS1tdXJkZXItc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0tc3BlYWtzLWFzLWthbnNhcy1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1zdGFsa2luZy1sYXc_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2021-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:25:28","(The Hill) — America faces a large and growing public health problem: suicide by men.  More than 38,000 men died by suicide in 2021, the highest number and rate of deaths in 20 years. Men die of suicide at four times the rate of women.  As a societal issue, male suicide has been somewhat overshadowed by the very real mental health crisis afflicting American women and girls.  Thirty-seven percent of women have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of men, and those rates are rising, according to Gallup survey data released Wednesday.  Paradoxically, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to die by suicide. The main reason is firearms.  A person who attempts suicide with a gun is many times more likely to die than someone who uses another method, such as pills or self-inflicted cuts. Firearms figure in only 5 percent of suicide attempts but in over half of deaths.  America may lead the developed world in suicide attempts, according to a 2008 study of suicidal ideation in 17 countries.  Many who attempt suicide are conflicted and irresolute. Too often, a gun makes the decision final.  “Even at the moment when the person has decided to make the attempt, there’s a lot of ambivalence,” said Elly Stout, a suicide prevention specialist at the nonprofit Education Development Center. “If you take a bunch of pills, there is a moment where you can change your mind.”  Between 2015 and 2020, federal data shows, 122,178 men died of suicide by firearm, compared to 19,297 women. Together, those deaths represented about 2.5 million years of lost human life.  The second most common method of suicide, suffocation, claimed 59,382 men and 17,088 women in that half-decade span. Suffocation typically means death by hanging, or by covering the head to cut off the supply of air.  Drug poisoning, which was the third most common, was the only significant suicide method more prevalent among women (16,678 deaths) than men (12,641).  The rise in male suicides mirrors the rise of guns in America. The nation purchased nearly 60 million firearms between 2020 and 2022, part of a larger cycle of panic-buying amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  More Americans died of gun violence in 2020 and 2021 than in any prior year on record. The majority of those deaths were suicides.  “Our suicide rates are very much tied to firearms,” said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina.  By age and gender, the demographic group most likely to die of suicide is elderly men. Men older than 75 died in suicides at a rate of 42.2 per 100,000 Americans in 2021, the highest quotient for men or women of any age.  “Some of that is kind of related to our stereotypes of masculinity,” said Julie Cerel, a suicide researcher at the University of Kentucky. “If you’re no longer in your prime, what’s the point of it all? People who are widowed, people who are no longer able to provide.”  Yet, over the past 20 years, suicides among elderly men are relatively flat.  More alarming, perhaps, is the swift rise in suicides among the young. The suicide rate for boys and young men in the 15-24 age group rose by nearly half between 2001 and 2021, from 16.5 per 100,000 people to 23.8.  The suicide rate for girls and women in the same age group more than doubled in the same span, to 6.1 per 100,000.  Suicides among girls ages 10-14, almost unknown 20 years ago, rose to 2.3 per 100,000 in 2021.  Girls and women, too, are dying by self-inflicted gunshot wounds in greater numbers than in years past.  “It used to be that firearms were rarely used by women,” Cerel said. “The myth used to be that women wouldn’t use methods of taking their life that would change how they look, essentially, and that doesn’t seem to be the case.”  The easy availability of firearms is an obvious factor in the prevalence of suicide among men. Other reasons speak to the essence of American masculinity.  Society encourages girls to open up about their mental health and to seek therapy for depression, a skill set discouraged in boys.  “Boys and men haven’t been socialized to talk about mental health concerns. They’ve historically been thought of as weaknesses,” Cerel said. “The expectation for males in this country is, they’re strong, they’re independent, they take care of themselves, they don’t need help.”  Women are twice as likely as men to seek mental health treatment, according to federal data.  And why are young people becoming more prone to suicide? One factor may be a sense of belonging, which, in recent years, seems to be slipping away.  Men, in particular, have struggled in recent years to make friends and form relationships.  “I think we don’t have as much of a sense of connectedness in our communities,” said Nadine Kaslow, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Emory University School of Medicine.  “When I was growing up, everybody in the neighborhood knew everybody,” Kaslow said. “That’s changed. It’s this sense of isolation and loneliness.”  Much was made of the nation’s collective ennui during the pandemic. Yet, suicide rates actually ticked down in 2020. Why? Because everyone was home.  “During the summer, during holiday breaks, during the pandemic, those rates actually went down,” Cerel said.  It’s true: People are actually less prone to suicide during the holidays. Suicide rates rise in spring and summer, “when people get away from each other and go out in the world,” Cerel said.  Solitude and suicide travel hand in hand. Humans don’t want to die where loved ones will find them, both because of the trauma such a discovery will inflict and because a loved one might try to save them.  Some of Cerel’s research focuses on exploding the myth that only a few loved ones suffer when someone dies by suicide.  A longstanding theory held that every suicide left roughly six people behind. Cerel found the number closer to 135, a massive circle of friends and loved ones who may need mental health support to endure the loss. Tragically, suicide can beget more suicide.  “For many people, losing someone to suicide opens the door to suicidality where it hadn’t been open before,” she said.  Social media plays an ambiguous role in suicide. Many reports have suggested a link between TikTok and Instagram and worsening mental health. But researchers see potential benefits in those platforms.  “Social media is a place where people who are marginalized can get help,” Cerel said. “And you can find online social support when you don’t have it at home.”  Our nation’s mental health investment stands in dire need, suicide experts say.  All Americans could benefit from an annual mental health checkup, on top of the standard physical checkup, Prinstein said.  Sadly, the mental health checkup isn’t really a thing, partly because of enduring stigmas around mental health.  Psychotherapists are spread thin. The nation spends hundreds of times more money training its medical workforce than preparing mental health providers, Prinstein said.  As a result, rural Americans may find themselves an hour’s drive from the nearest therapist, a scenario hard to imagine in medicine.  “There’s not as much access as we need,” Kaslow said.

Gwendolyn Bass-Kemp, 71, was killed in the May 11 murder-suicide that ended with a house fire allegedly orchestrated by her boyfriend, 71-year-old Richard McDonald.  Almost a week after the tragedy, the family broke their silence Wednesday by way of a poignant statement, expressing their grief and shock over the devastating loss of their cherished mother.  NBC6's Kim Wynne has more on the scene that resulted in two people dead.  Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.  ""We were robbed of our precious mother in the most egregious and heinous way imaginable,"" the family’s statement read, in part. ""Never did we think that a man we treated like family and with such kindness, would commit such a senseless, cold and calculated act with the intent to cause pain and suffering to us all.""  The gruesome incident unfolded in what neighbors said a normally quiet neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale on Northwest 27th Terrace.  According to police, McDonald fatally shot Bass-Kemp before setting their home on fire. The incident escalated into a tense stand-off with SWAT, ending with McDonald taking his own life.  Bass-Kemp had worked for Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue since 2005 as a billing specialist.  NBC6's Ryan Nelson has the latest after a long-time employee of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue was killed in what police are calling a murder-suicide.  The family recounted Bass-Kemp's aspirations to retire and move closer to her other children, a plan they believe might have upset McDonald.  ""Our mother was just weeks away from officially retiring and relocating out-of-state to be closer to her other children and grandchildren. She had planned to ultimately leave the relationship and likely expressed this to [him], which upset him,"" the family's statement read. ""Because she was the sole financial provider, this would have left him displaced, and we believe that he just simply could not fathom her leaving, and him being left to fend for himself.""  Bass-Kemp's family plans to honor her legacy by raising awareness about the danger of domestic violence, vowing to illuminate this issue that has now tragically affected their family.  They intend to commemorate and celebrate Bass-Kemp's life within the South Florida community, continuing the legacy established by her father, Dr. James Bass.  The family concluded their statement by expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received in the aftermath of this tragedy and requested respect for their privacy.  ""We want to extend our thanks to everyone for the outpouring of love we have been receiving, and many thanks you to those who are supporting our family,"" the statement read.

(KOIN) – A man was arrested Thursday for allegedly helping his girlfriend die by suicide in The Dalles in March – using an idea from an infamous Massachusetts case that made national headlines.  Joseph Newman, 60, will face charges for manslaughter in the second degree after investigators say he bought a gas powered water pump, fueled it up and showed Alexander Cagle, 29, how to start it.  Cagle then took the U-Haul truck they had rented together to a parking lot, where she started the machine and died, according to the Wasco County District Attorney’s office.  District Attorney Matt Ellis said he was originally hesitant to take it to the grand jury, but eventually felt he “owed it to the victim’s family to at least put this in front of the grand jury and let them decide. Ellis said he looked for precedent cases, too, and “didn’t see much case law that came after the seventies on this particular theory of manslaughter in the second degree.”  Ellis said Cagle suffered from mental health issues and had previously spent some time in the Unity Hospital in Portland, where Newman picked her up. According to Ellis, Cagle sent Newman an article about the infamous Michelle Carter case in Massachusetts and said she wanted to do something similar.  Carter had been convicted for texting and encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to use a generator in his truck to create carbon monoxide poisoning.  “It’s one of those areas where…this person’s behavior is quite disturbing and an abhorrent that – to be in this relationship with somebody who’s suicidal – to give them the means to do something like this,” Ellis said. “It’s a very gray area of our legal system.”  Stay with KOIN 6 as this story develops.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL25ld3Mvb3JlZ29uL2RhLW1hbi1mYWNlcy1hcnJlc3Qtd2FycmFudC1mb3ItaGVscGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kLWNvbW1pdC1zdWljaWRlLWluLXRoZS1kYWxsZXMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29pbi5jb20vbmV3cy9vcmVnb24vZGEtbWFuLWZhY2VzLWFycmVzdC13YXJyYW50LWZvci1oZWxwaW5nLWdpcmxmcmllbmQtY29tbWl0LXN1aWNpZGUtaW4tdGhlLWRhbGxlcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police this week identified the suicide victim as Kevin Rawlings a senior engineer at Google. He was a computer science major with a degree from the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University who spent seven and a half years working for Google over three different employement stints.  College fraternity brother Jesse Salazar said Rawlings was an outgoing, fun loving guy until a close family member fell ill in Rawling’s junior year, sending him spiraling into deep depression.  “He had a 4.0 straight through until then,” said Salazar. “He stopped going to classes, started drinking heavily, and not coming out of his room.”  He said frat brothers had petitioned professors to at least let him try to pass the final exams and he said they managed to get him to study intensely for a few days before he took the exams. “He got above a 3.9--a 3.98 or 3.99,” Salazar recalled. “He was brilliant.” He said his friend went on to graduate with a near perfect 4.0 and seemed to have gotten over the paralyzing depression for awhile.  But in 2019, his older brother Robert passed away suddenly at the age of 34 and then COVID-19 hit.  Salazar also said he was difficult to keep in contact with him in recent years and he had not learned about his friend’s passing until contacted by this reporter.  ”We had wild, spontaneous fun in his college years,” recalled Salazar, “He was very outgoing.”  ”I don’t know what to think about what happened there,” said Salazar. “I do know one thing, it would have had nothing to do with the workload at Google. He eats problem solving for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Google was like his safe place if that makes any sense.”  Rawlings had worked at Google for three separate stretches and in his last most recent stretch was there from August 2022 until he took his own life around 11:30 pm on May 4, by jumping off the 14th floor of Google’s HQ in Chelsea on Eighth Ave and 15th Street.  Police had discovered Rawlings unconscious in the street outside Google’s Chelsea Headquarters after responding to numerous 911 calls. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Prior to returning to Google in August, 2022, he had worked at Hudson River Trading for a year from Feb. 2021 until Feb. 2022. Executives there did not return messages seeking comment. He had spent two earlier stints at Google, from Jan. 2020 until Jan. 2021 and a three year stretch from November 2013 until December 2016, sandwiched around a year spent working at Mountain View, CA-based Waymo, which was the self driving car division at Google which it eventually spun off.  During his college years, he had interned for three years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD and in 2008 created a tool for real-time 3D visualization and measurement of nanostructures. It earned him the Issac Newton Award for Outstanding Projects from the Washington Academy of Sciences, according to Rawlings Linked in page.  “Growing up in the suburbs of Maryland, Kevin excelled at sports, including baseball and swimming,” according to an obituary posted on Legacy.com by his family. “He was an enthusiastic runner and weight-lifter, always trying to outdo his personal best records. Kevin enjoyed playing Texas Hold’em with friends, and recently started playing pickleball and kickball.”  The obituary said he is survived by his parents, Mark and Barbara Rawlings of Lake Frederick, VA, his paternal grandmother, Norma Rawlings of Ellicott City, MD, his sister Jennifer Wernly (Mark) of Norfolk, VA, and his three nieces, Anna, Eleanor, and Kara.  “Kevin was a wonderful son, sibling, and Uncle, and we will forever miss him dearly,” the obituary stated. Plans for a remembrance service were still being formulated at the time of publication.  He was the second Google worker to take his own life in NYC this year although the two do not appear to be connected.  On Feb. 16th, the NYPD discovered 33 year old Jacob Pratt dead after apparently hanging himself in his Chelsea apartment on the corner of W. 26th St. and Sixth Ave.  Straus News has reached out to Google for comment, but had not heard back at the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0c2lkZXNwaXJpdC5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0taWRlbnRpZmllZC1tYXJrcy0ybmQtd29ya2VyLWF0LXRlY2gtZ2lhbnQtdG8tdGFrZS1vd24tbGlmZS1pbi1jaGVsc2VhLXRoaXMteWVhci1YQTI1MzQxMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2022-07-27","00:00:00","{""Huson"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:19:39","Brandon Guffey's 17-year-old son Gavin died by suicide after he said Gavin fell victim to a sexual extortion scheme online, and now he's fighting to protect other kids from this crime.  Sexual extortion, or ""sextortion,"" is a form of blackmail where victims are lured into sending explicit images online and then threatened to do something they don't want to do, like send more photos or money.  ""I tell people all the time, Gavin was not depressed,"" Guffey told ABC News. ""He was, in my opinion, living his best life before he took his own.""  Now, the Republican state lawmaker from Rock Hill, South Carolina, is pushing through a piece of legislation (H 3583) that would criminalize sextortion in the state. It passed the state house and senate and will head to the governor's desk soon.  Under the proposed law, perpetrators who extort minors or at-risk adults could face up to 20 years in prison. According to Guffey, elevating these crimes to felonies will also give law enforcement the ability to cross state lines to chase down alleged perpetrators.  An increase in reported cases  Thorn, an organization dedicated to ending the sexual exploitation of children, started tracking this type of online grooming pre-pandemic and said it saw a ""dramatic increase in reports"" during the pandemic and in recent months.  Between 2019 and 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of reports made to its organization involving the sextortion of children or teens more than doubled.  ""I don't know that we necessarily armed our children with the tools that they needed to be safe in the face of this type of extortion or built our platforms in a way that would create a safe environment,"" Thorn's CEO Julie Cordua told ABC News.  In early 2023, the FBI issued a national public safety alert regarding an ""explosion in incidents of children and teens being coerced."" According to the FBI, law enforcement agencies saw 3,000 minor victims targeted in 2022, with the majority of them being boys.  In most reported cases, experts said the first contact is made through social media where young male victims are led to believe they are exchanging messages with a girl their own age.  Guffey told ABC News that Gavin received an Instagram message on July 27, 2022, from an account posing as a teenage girl, just around midnight. About an hour and a half after that first contact, Gavin took his own life.  Gavin Guffey, 17, from Rock Hill, S.C., seen here in an undated file photo was a one-of-a-kind guy his dad told ABC News. Courtesy Guffey family  ""I refused to believe it at first. There's no way that he could have been under that much stress that quickly that it would have caused this decision,"" Guffey said  In the weeks following Gavin's funeral, Guffey said various family members received dozens of threatening Instagram messages demanding money to keep the explicit images private. That's when Guffey connected the dots and uncovered what had pushed his son to suicide.  ""Did I tell you your son begged for his life,"" read one of the Instagram messages, according to Guffey.  Gavin's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, and Homeland Security.  ""We support legislation that empowers law enforcement to pursue those who commit the heinous act of sextortion and applaud Representative Guffey’s efforts on this bill. No family should ever have to experience a tragedy like this,"" a Meta spokesperson told ABC News. ""We want teens to have a safe experience on our apps, and we’ve built technology and tools to help protect our users from criminals and scammers of this kind.""  ""We encourage teens and adults to report suspicious or harmful content, activity or accounts in our apps if they feel unsafe, and we take action and will reach out to law enforcement in cases of imminent harm. Teens can also use NCMEC’s Take It Down, a new tool we supported that helps prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future,"" Meta's statement continued.  Experts said the number of young victims impacted is likely much larger than reported because many do not come forward.  ""I believe we've got to start wearing our shame as adults if we want our kids to understand that it's okay,"" to ask for help, said Guffey, who decided with his wife to share Gavin's story in order to raise public awareness.  And that's exactly what happened when Christina and Jason Scheffer, from Huson, Montana, heard about Gavin's case.  Waylon Scheffer is shown in this undated photo is described by his family as a true Montana boy who loved fishing and hunting. Kelsey Farago Photography  Their son, Waylon Scheffer, was just 16 years old when they say scammers drove him to take his own life on Dec. 14, 2022. The Scheffers said talking with Guffey helped them understand the intricacies of how scammers used social media to prey on their own teenage son.  ""I got your nude,"" reads one of the threatening messages sent to Waylon and reviewed by ABC News. ""I will start sending your nude and put it on the newspaper, and make sure I make life miserable for you.""  Waylon's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement.  Waylon and Gavin are among the more than a dozen American teenage boys who have lost their lives after being threatened and extorted online this past year, said the FBI.  ""The best advice that I give that I think to give parents is to not allow your children to have any of their devices in private rooms such as bathrooms and bedrooms,"" Guffey said.  Out of the darkness  ""The greatest harm will be if the perpetrator wins because the child is ashamed and afraid,"" Cordua said. She told ABC News that creating a blame-free space will help your child feel safe enough to come forward if something goes wrong.  ""Talk about this stuff,"" agreed Jason Scheffer, who had spoken to his son on multiple occasions about these types of scams.  And since Waylon's passing, Scheffer said his school will introduce a phone safety training class for both parents and students.  As part of Guffey's bill, school districts will also be required to educate students about sextortion on an annual basis.  ""This is the best part of the bill, in my opinion, because the hardest thing to do is to raise awareness to get parents and students talking about this,"" said Guffey.  What about the platforms  Experts said disappearing messages on WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat create a false sense of security. Because of these features, a teen may feel more comfortable sharing an explicit image, but experts said scammers often record the conversation.  Snapchat and Instagram notify users if another user takes screenshots or screen-recording their chat, but this doesn't stop perpetrators from finding workarounds.  ""Any form of sexual exploitation is abhorrent and illegal and we have dedicated teams that work closely with authorities, experts, and industry partners to combat it,"" a Snapchat spokesperson told ABC News.  ""We have extra protections in place on Snapchat for under 18s that make it harder for them to be discovered and contacted by people they don't know,"" the spokesperson added.  Gavin Guffey pictured with his dad Brandon, his mom, and his two younger brothers is seen here in an undated file photo. Courtesy Guffey family  Cordua said that platforms are sitting on troves of data that could help inform how to add more protections for all users. For example, if an account is flagged by multiple users, especially young users, that should raise a flag on the platform side.  ""There's a pattern in this data, and so platforms have the ability to see what is happening and identify where the risk factors are on their platform,"" she added. Cordua said they could consider adding a few more ""road bumps"" that would help pull young people out of conversations with adults.  Parents said they want to see the platforms do more to protect their children from online predators. ""I firmly believe they are letting this terrorism happen across their platform,"" said Jason Scheffer. ""They're not doing anything about it.""

"suicide","2023-04-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 04:20:00","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Alaska is number one in the country for youth suicide, according to numbers compiled by Alaska Public Health Analytics and Providence Hospital, and Alaska Natives are at highest risk according to a recent CDC study.  That study shows Alaska Natives and American Indians suffer more depression and cases of mental illness than any other group. Alaska Natives have long dealt with generational trauma, trauma that can begin before a person is even born and can be made worse through cultural influences or long periods of exposure to difficult home situations. Experts point out that difficult family situations are not unique to Alaska Native youth.  The Farrally family says they know this all too well, as raising their daughter hasn’t been easy.  “The anxiety, depression and then just the anger that she just doesn’t know how to control or deal with,” said Sonia Farrally, when speaking about her adopted daughter, Twilla. “She has scars up and down her arm from cutting.”  Farrally has been battling her daughter’s mental illness for years. Twilla was actually her niece and she adopted the child when she was just a baby. Born to alcoholic parents, Twilla was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome.  “Body weight, height, all the things doctors look at for her growth, she was below the chart lines,” Farrally said. “She wasn’t even on the graph.”  Twilla’s odds were stacked against her from the start. As she grew, even the simplest things seemed like major obstacles.  “Try to get her to take a shower, she would go two or three weeks,” Farrally said. “Or try to get a change of clothes and she’d wear the same clothes for two to three weeks.”  Twilla’s biological family lived in the village of Crooked Creek. Farrally, half Alaska Native herself, says she turned to Native hospitals for help with Twilla, but had little luck.  “She is Alaska Native and then we still can’t get into any of those programs that are Alaska Native based,” Farrally said. “The waitlist, because you just don’t have enough people.”  A study recently released by the Centers for Disease Control found the need is there. In 2021, Alaska Native and American Indian high school students registered the worst on key mental health markers including seriously considering suicide, making a suicide plan and attempting suicide.  By junior high, Twilla’s therapists feared for her safety as well. Farrally says Twilla kept most of her rage bottled up, choosing to hurt herself instead.  “She would find anything and everything to use to cut and she would, she would slice on her right arm mostly, and sometimes on one of her thighs,” Farrally said.  By 2020, Twilla was in her teens, had been kicked out of high school and was sent to a mental health facility in Texas for 11 months.  “One of the hardest things I’ve ever done,” Farrally said. “You don’t ever want to leave your kid behind at a facility you don’t know, and a state you don’t know.”  When Twilla returned home her parents say she also returned to her old ways. During a violent episode, she threw a hammer at her father.  “She needs to learn her actions are having a major consequence,” Farrally said.  Twilla was sent to a juvenile detention facility. On April 27, 2023, she spent her 18th birthday there. Her parents don’t know what will happen to her next.  “It does hurt,” Farrally said. “I mean the only thing we know; we can say is that she’s in a safe place, she can’t hurt herself.”  Experts say trauma and mental health issues, such as those suffered by Twilla, are common in Alaska Native communities.  “In terms of substance abuse and mental health, it’s going to be a multi-factorial story and trauma’s certainly a piece of it, the response to trauma, the desire to numb,” psychiatrist Lisa Alexia said.  Alexia previously worked with the Southcentral Foundation for over 10 years. She’s now in private practice. She has experience helping children throughout Southcentral and Western Alaska villages.  “Schools theoretically teach skills to help you survive in an urban setting but they don’t do that adequately in most village schools,” Alexia said.  Alexia says children in Alaska, and particularly in western villages, are also uniquely affected by the changes in sunlight through the seasons and school days that fail to match the body’s natural rhythms.  “Alaskan students and Alaskan youth are the most sleep deprived in the nation,” Alexia said. “This is an artificial structure that we’ve imposed, it’s an unconsented public health experiment and we have enough evidence to say sleep deprivation causes mental health issues, it increases risks of suicide.”  Every child with mental illness struggles with their own form of darkness. Twilla’s parents hope she’ll see the light before it’s too late.  “There is hope,” Farrally said. “That’s all we can keep hoping for is to give her everything that she needs and know that we love her unconditionally.”  Farrelly said though Twilla is still in a juvenile detention center, she is doing better. Presbyterian Hospitality House has completed Twilla’s intake process and she has been accepted. She is now at the top of the waitlist and hopes to have a bed available sometime in June.

"suicide","2019-04-16","10:00:00","{""Farmington"", ""NewMexico"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:05:23","Gunman removed body armor before gunbattle, said ‘shoot me,’ chief says  ×  At a news conference Thursday, Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe revealed that the investigation suggests suspected gunman Beau Wilson intended to commit suicide by cop at the conclusion of his rampage Monday morning on a neighborhood street.  Wilson began shooting at his father’s home in the 100 block of Dustin Avenue, using an AR-15 rifle and firing from outside the while moving around the property, police said.  The three victims killed were shot with the rifle in front of the shooter’s house. The first, Shirley Voita, was driving south on Dustin Avenue when she was shot. She exited her car, and Ring doorbell footage released by the police showed the vehicle continue to roll down the street with the driver’s side door open.  Hebbe said that citizens “who came out and were providing blankets and doing everything that they could for Shirley, who was lying in the street while officers were off dealing with the suspect.”  Footage also shows Ivie and Schofield’s car traveling north on Dustin Avenue, then slowing almost directly in front the shooter’s house and pulling to the curb.  Hebbe said they believe they might have seen Voita in the road and stopped. The shooter shot into their vehicle from in front of the car, killing both women.  The Ring footage perspective was from a home on the opposite side of the street from the shooter’s residence and several houses south.  The AR-15 was abandoned at the residence, and the shooter continued south on Dustin Avenue, shooting indiscriminately with a .22-caliber and a 9 mm handgun.  Along the way, the shooter discarded the .22-caliber handgun and removed his body armor.  New Mexico State Police officer Andreas Stamatiadas was traveling north on Dustin Avenue, opposite the approach of Farmington police officers. The shooter opened fire on the patrol vehicle, shooting Stamatiadas. He continue driving north and ultimately drove himself to the hospital for treatment.  ×  Four Farmington officers confronted the shooter at 713 N. Dustin Ave., where he was shot and killed.  All four officers fired on the shooter, with Sgt. Rachel Discenza being shot in the pelvic region. She fell to her knees after being shot, but still attempted to stand and continue toward the shooter before before falling again. Officers on scene rendered initial aid.  Watching the video, Hebbe said he knew there were a lot of shots being fired from reports, but actually hearing it “sounded like you were watching Afghanistan or Iraq, like you’re watching the sound of combat,” and he was “not prepared for that.”  When asked whether the shooter intended to commit suicide by cop, Hebbe said that while “it’s very difficult to be inside somebody’s mind,” the shooter had opportunities to leave the area and avoid police officers and did not take them. He instead appeared to take a stand with the 9 mm handgun.  That, along with the fact that he removed his body armor and at one point video footage captures him yelling, “Come kill me,” Hebbe said, “It is my belief that ultimately, in his head, he has made a decision that he is going to stand and fight it out until he’s killed.”  This story will continue to be updated with more news and videos from the scene.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mYXJtaW5ndG9uLWd1bm1hbi1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXN1Z2dlc3RzLXN1aWNpZGUtYnktY29wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2012-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:00:57","It begins with Donna Summer onstage, moaning through the breathy “Love to Love You Baby” and ends with her wiping tears from her eyes, decades later, during a poignant performance of “If There is Music There.”  The juxtaposition between orgasmic writhing and introspective balladry is indicative of Summer’s oft-contradictory life, explored in “Love to Love You, Donna Summer.”  The HBO documentary, co-directed by Summer’s daughter Brooklyn Sudano and Oscar winner Roger Ross Williams (“Music By Prudence”), arrives Saturday as a hopscotching overview of the woman dubbed the First Lady of Love.  But, as Summer says in a voice over, “I have a secret life. What you see is not what I am.”  So dim the lights and glimpse what the film reveals about Summer’s life:  Donna Summer had a complicated history: 'She just tried to keep her sanity'  The Summer documentary coincides with the 11-year anniversary of her death from lung cancer at age 63.  Throughout her career, which included pop-disco baubles “Bad Girls,” “Last Dance” and “On the Radio,” Summer was rightfully heralded as a trailblazer. The first artist to use a drum machine on a song (“I Feel Love”). The first Black female performer to have a video on MTV. The topic of a Broadway musical (“Summer: The Donna Summer Musical”). And, posthumously, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.  But Summer’s history is a complicated one that includes abuse, her struggles to adapt to motherhood, her music – which defined an era as she grappled with its sexual content – and her conflicted relationship with the gay community that revered her.  Along with Brooklyn and her father Bruce Sudano – whom Summer married in 1980 – other family members provide insight, including Brooklyn’s sister Amanda; Summer's daughter Mimi Dohler with first husband Helmuth Sommer; and Summer’s siblings Mary Ellen Bernard, Dara Bernard and Ric Gaines. (Summer, who was born LaDonna Gaines, took an Anglicized version of Sommer’s name as her stage moniker.)  Mary Ellen recalls how Summer “knew fame came with the territory…she just tried to keep her sanity,” while Amanda says Summer tried to shield her daughters from fame.  “We were never allowed in her room. We would find things (out about her) by reading newspaper articles,” she says.  Donna Summer almost died by suicide  In a sad, chilling voice over, Summer discusses in an interview her near-death by suicide in 1976. A combination of exhaustion, a broken marriage and disillusionment about the music industry and the fame she tried to duck, caused Summer to “break down” in a Central Park-area hotel in New York.  “I said, ‘I’m getting out of here.’ I put my foot out the window,” she says. But her foot got caught in the curtain and at the same moment she freed herself to step out again, a housekeeper opened the hotel door.  “Another 10 seconds and I would have been gone,” Summer says.  Donna Summer suffered abuse from minister, boyfriend  Summer’s brother, Gaines, confirms her allegations that a trusted minister sexually abused Summer as a teenager. The traumatic incident, Summer notes, “is something I have to always incorporate into my reality.”  Gaines has more forceful words for the minister: “He did the Devil’s work better than most.”  It was not the only abuse Summer would endure.  Boyfriend Peter Mühldorfer, an artist Summer met in Germany, was an abusive alcoholic who was jealous of Summer’s fame.  Summer’s manager, Susan Munao, recalls a middle-of-the-night phone call telling her that Mühldorfer had beaten Summer until she was unconscious.  “She was becoming a star and he could not handle it,” Munao says.  Mühldorfer admits in the film, “I hit her and I never could forgive myself.”  How Donna Summer angered her gay fans  Following a thriving career that populated dance floors across the country with pulsing hits such as “Hot Stuff,” “McArthur Park” and her iconic pairing with Barbra Streisand, “No More Tears (Enough is Enough),” Summer returned to her religious roots.  “That little church girl was foundational to who she was,” Bruce Sudano says.  After Summer allegedly made the comments during a concert that “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” and inferred that AIDS was “God’s punishment” on gay people, a community that had a kinship with the singer felt betrayed.  One of Summer’s bodyguards remembers angry fans disrupting a show of Summer’s art in Chicago, followed by a stream of concert cancellations.  Summer later denied making the comments, but for many, it was an empty gesture.  Donna Summer didn't want to 'give death power'  Bruce Sudano reflects on Summer's death, how she ""carried so much for so long"" until her body could no longer endure the lung cancer sapping her strength.  But Summer never talked about dying, Sudano says. ""There was a certain amount of non-acceptance ... She didn't want to give death power.'

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:32:46","Summary: Researchers have identified a potential marker in the brain that might indicate an increased risk of suicide.  They observed that veterans with a history of suicide attempts demonstrated distinct functional connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential thought-processing networks. This connectivity pattern was present both before and after a suicide attempt, making it a potentially crucial indicator of suicide-specific risk.  Further, the study suggests that suicide attempts could lead to brain changes, potentially escalating future suicide risk.  Key Facts:  The researchers found distinct brain connectivity patterns in veterans with a history of suicide attempts, specifically in networks involved in cognitive control and self-referential thought processing. This connectivity pattern was present both before and after a suicide attempt, suggesting it could serve as a novel marker for suicide risk. The study also found that a suicide attempt could lead to changes in the brain, specifically in the right amygdala, potentially increasing future suicide risk.  Source: Boston University  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  But new research has uncovered a clue, or marker, in the brain that could be used to identify people at a higher risk of ending their life.  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt. Credit: Neuroscience News  In a paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author on the paper.  “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma.  Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  Researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts.  They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders ​​(TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath.  Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  Jagger-Rickels says the findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says.  “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System.  “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  Funding: This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health.

Journal of Affective Disorders  Abstract  Aberrant connectivity in the right amygdala and right middle temporal gyrus before and after a suicide attempt: Examining markers of suicide risk  Functional neuroimaging has the potential to help identify those at risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, as well as inform neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to suicide.  Based on whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity, our previous work identified right amygdala and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) connectivity patterns that differentiated Veterans with a history of a suicide attempt (SA) from a Veteran control group.  In this study, we aimed to replicate and extend our previous findings by examining whether this aberrant connectivity was present prior to and after a SA. In a trauma-exposed Veteran sample (92 % male, mean age = 34), we characterized if the right amygdala and right MTG connectivity differed between a psychiatric control sample (n = 56) and an independent sample of Veterans with a history of SA (n = 17), using fMRI data before and after the SA.  Right MTG and amygdala connectivity differed between Veterans with and without a history of SA (replication), while MTG connectivity also distinguished Veterans prior to engaging in a SA (extension). In a second study, neither MTG or amygdala connectivity differed between those with current suicidal ideation (n = 27) relative to matched psychiatric controls (n = 27).  These results indicate a potential stable marker of suicide risk (right MTG connectivity) as well as a potential marker of acute risk of or recent SA (right amygdala connectivity) that are independent of current ideation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV1cm9zY2llbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vYnJhaW4tY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXN1aWNpZGUtcmlzay0yMzI3Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-10-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:45:00","A health system in Michigan says it has reduced its patient suicide rate by more than 70%, and that its high-risk patients have the “lowest documented rate” in the country.  Henry Ford Behavioral Health in Southeast Michigan made significant progress through a collaborative care model its team developed called “Zero Suicide.” They’ve even had some years with no patient suicides.  The model trains and calls for primary care physicians to screen all patients for risk of suicide at every visit. If the caregiver finds indicators of risk, they can assess the level of risk and come up with a pathway to treatment in partnership with behavioral health specialists.  “We believe that we have an opportunity to prevent every single suicide,” said Dr. Brian Ahmedani, director of research for behavioral health sciences at Henry Ford and a member of the founding team for the Zero Suicide model.  Ahmedani said 83% of people who die by suicide have a health care visit in the weeks and months leading up to their death. That provides an opportunity for caregivers to notice warning signs and intervene.  In recent months, the team behind the Zero Suicide model has teamed up with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to create a collaborative known as the Michigan Mental Health Innovation Network for Clinical Design -- or MI Mind.  The idea behind MI Mind is to train providers throughout the state, and beyond, on Zero Suicide and the techniques to assess and treat suicide risk factors.  “We realized that many people who are dying by suicide don’t ever get to behavioral health services, so we expanded our program to include the entire health care system,” Ahmedani said.  The care model begins with screening every patient that walks in the door for suicide risk factors. Clinicians are trained to not only ask every patient if they’ve had suicidal thoughts, but also to look out for warning signs that may indicate increased risk.  If there are indicators of suicide risk present, caregivers will then use a more extensive assessment and come up with a treatment pathway using interventions that have been shown to reduce rates. Some such interventions include:  Psychiatric evaluation  Advise to remove weapons and stockpiled pills.  Involving family  Promoting self-management  Community referral/support  Initiating an appropriate referral for follow-up therapy, where the timeline is based on the patient’s severity of risk.  “What we’re doing is pairing several evidence-based interventions that all have been associated with reduction in suicide attempts in either clinical trials or big research studies,” Ahmedani said.  “We use a safety plan and people who get a safety plan are about 20% less likely to attempt suicide than people who don’t get a safety plan. It’s a brief, about 15-minute intervention that you can do with a patient.”  In 2021, Michigan had 1,485 suicide deaths. Its 14.3 suicide deaths per capita ranked 34th nationally. Across the country, there were 48,183 such deaths, or about one every 11 minutes, according to the CDC.  It’s an alarming rate, and yet those numbers could have been worse. An estimated 12.3 million adults thought about suicide, and of them 3.5 million made a plan and 1.7 million made an attempt.  Contributing factors to suicide include mental health conditions, relationship problems or losses, substance use disorder, general health problems, and housing, legal, job or financial stress.  The Zero Suicide model was developed in 2001 at Henry Ford Health and showed immediate progress. The health system measures suicide rates within one year of a patient visit, and said it began experiencing 70% to 80% declines in the years that followed.  The system’s progress has continued for the better part of two decades, with typical rates for the system’s high-risk patients coming in line with the general population’s rates.  In its first year, MI Mind is partnering with five Michigan primary care and behavioral health practices. They include Oakland Southfield Physicians, Med Net One in Rochester, Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit, Trinity Health IHA Medical Group in Ann Arbor, and Answer Health in Grand Rapids.  Ahmedani, who is the program director for MI MInd, said the collaborative will add another two systems this year with the end goal of including all provider organizations throughout the state.

Suicide is a leading cause of death, but it is preventable. The Overnight is the largest single annual fundraising event held by AFSP and a powerful opportunity for suicide prevention advocates to raise awareness for suicide prevention and connect with a community that understands.  ""The Overnight is an opportunity like no other to support suicide prevention and healing after loss,"" said AFSP Chief Executive Officer Bob Gebbia. ""We hope you'll join us in this unforgettable experience as we walk to advance the life-saving work of our organization and honor those who've struggled. Walking from dusk to dawn with more than 1,500 participants, you will be reminded that you're not alone.""  Walkers come together from across the country for The Overnight and there is also an option to participate virtually. Each Walker raises a minimum of $1,000 to participate, and students and military members raise $700. There is also an option to participate virtually and the minimum to participate virtually is $500. 1.7 million dollars has been raised thus far.  Proceeds help AFSP save lives and bring hope to those affected by suicide by funding the creation of evidence-informed programs, advocacy efforts, and ground-breaking research. AFSP is the largest private funder of suicide prevention in the country. Last year's event raised three million dollars and brought thousands together with the shared goal to #StopSuicide.

The state's Suicide Demographics and Trends 2021 report, published Friday, shows there were 1,766 suicides in 2021, an 8% increase from the previous year, according to the state health department.  That number remains below the 10-year high of 1,836 deaths in 2018.  Here are five key findings from the report:  Each day, five Ohioans die by suicide, and one youth dies every 34 hours.  In 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans ages 10-34 and the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio overall.  White people had the largest increase in suicide rates from 2020 to 2021 at 7%.  Adults ages 25-44 had the highest suicide rate in 2021, an increase of 13% from the year before, compared with 5% increases for other age groups.  Men 75 and older and women 45-54 had the highest rates of suicides in 2021.

Summit County suicide data  The Summit County Suicide Prevention Coalition, which was created in December 2005, works to reduce the number of deaths by suicide in Summit County, especially in the identified high-risk populations of youth, middle-aged men (ages 25-44) and older adults.  The coalition said that 2022 was Summit County’s worst year for Black suicide deaths, with the Black male suicide rate in Summit County at 31.6%.  For subscribers:'You all matter': Streetsboro parents who lost son to sextortion fight to save other youth  According to the suicide deaths data dashboard from the Summit County Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services Board and the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office, suicide deaths by year in the county were 91 in 2017, 88 in 2018, 91 in 2019, 91 in 2020, 93 in 2021, 80 in 2022 and 33 so far in 2023 (as of May 11).  The Summit County suicide death rate per 100,000 was 15 in 2017, 13.5 in 2018, 15.3 in 2019, 13.7 in 2020, 15 in 2021 and 13.7 in 2022.  The Black suicide death rate per 100,000 nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022, from 7.9 to 14.7 The increase was largely driven by the male rate, which more than doubled from 12.1 to 26.7.  The Black suicide death rate per 100,000 in recent years was 11.5 in 2017 (19.8 for Black males), 9.1 in 2018 (14.7 for Black males), 5.7 in 2019 (9.8 for Black males), 11.3 in 2020 (21.9 for Black males), 7.9 in 2021 (12.1 for Black males) and 14.7 in 2022 (26.7 for Black males). The Black female suicide death rate per 100,000 has remained relatively low throughout the same time period.

What is Ohio doing to prevent suicides?  RecoveryOhio and the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services partnered with The Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation in 2021 to create The Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio.  Since then, the state has done the following to address the issue:  Gov. Mike DeWine included the following in his 2024-25 budget proposal.  $8 million a year for the next two years to continue and expand prevention programs and strategies.  $100 million to create a State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network to develop, evaluate and implement strategies.  $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce, integrating behavioral and primary health and developing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities.  The Summit County Suicide Prevention Coalition offers free training and consultation for community groups to raise awareness of suicide as a public health issue and to educate the public about how to recognize and respond to someone who needs help.

Suicide risk factors and warning signs  According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, there are several risk factors and warning signs for suicide.  The organization says that risk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that someone will consider, attempt or die by suicide. They can't cause or predict a suicide attempt, but they're important to be aware of, the lifeline said. They include:  Mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and certain personality disorders  Alcohol and other substance use disorders  Hopelessness  Impulsive and/or aggressive tendencies  History of trauma or abuse  Major physical illnesses  Previous suicide attempt(s)  Family history of suicide  Job or financial loss  Loss of relationship(s)  Easy access to lethal means  Local clusters of suicide  Lack of social support and sense of isolation  Stigma associated with asking for help  Lack of healthcare, especially mental health and substance abuse treatment  Cultural and religious beliefs, such as the belief that suicide is a noble resolution of a personal dilemma  Exposure to others who have died by suicide (in real life or via the media and Internet)  The lifeline said that some warning signs may help you determine if a loved one is at risk for suicide, especially if the behavior is new, has increased or seems related to a painful event, loss or change. If you or someone you know exhibits any of these warning signs, listed below, seek help by calling the lifeline, the organization said.  Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves  Looking for a way to kill themselves, like searching online or buying a gun  Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live  Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain  Talking about being a burden to others  Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs  Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly  Sleeping too little or too much  Withdrawing or isolating themselves  Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge  Extreme mood swings  Contact Columbus Dispatch reporter at Nathaniel Shuda at nshuda@dispatch.com and on Twitter @NathanielShuda.

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Fairview"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:00:00","America faces a large and growing public health problem: suicide by men.  More than 38,000 men died by suicide in 2021, the highest number and rate of deaths in 20 years. Men die of suicide at four times the rate of women.  As a societal issue, male suicide has been somewhat overshadowed by the very real mental health crisis afflicting American women and girls.  Thirty-seven percent of women have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of men, and those rates are rising, according to Gallup survey data released Wednesday.  Paradoxically, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to die by suicide. The main reason is firearms.  A person who attempts suicide with a gun is many times more likely to die than someone who uses another method, such as pills or self-inflicted cuts. Firearms figure in only 5 percent of suicide attempts but in over half of deaths.  America may lead the developed world in suicide attempts, according to a 2008 study of suicidal ideation in 17 countries.  Many who attempt suicide are conflicted and irresolute. Too often, a gun makes the decision final.  “Even at the moment when the person has decided to make the attempt, there’s a lot of ambivalence,” said Elly Stout, a suicide prevention specialist at the nonprofit Education Development Center. “If you take a bunch of pills, there is a moment where you can change your mind.”  Between 2015 and 2020, federal data shows, 122,178 men died of suicide by firearm, compared to 19,297 women. Together, those deaths represented about 2.5 million years of lost human life.  The second most common method of suicide, suffocation, claimed 59,382 men and 17,088 women in that half-decade span. Suffocation typically means death by hanging, or by covering the head to cut off the supply of air.  Drug poisoning, which was the third most common, was the only significant suicide method more prevalent among women (16,678 deaths) than men (12,641).  The rise in male suicides mirrors the rise of guns in America. The nation purchased nearly 60 million firearms between 2020 and 2022, part of a larger cycle of panic-buying amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  More Americans died of gun violence in 2020 and 2021 than in any prior year on record. The majority of those deaths were suicides.  “Our suicide rates are very much tied to firearms,” said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina.  By age and gender, the demographic group most likely to die of suicide is elderly men. Men older than 75 died in suicides at a rate of 42.2 per 100,000 Americans in 2021, the highest quotient for men or women of any age.  “Some of that is kind of related to our stereotypes of masculinity,” said Julie Cerel, a suicide researcher at the University of Kentucky. “If you’re no longer in your prime, what’s the point of it all? People who are widowed, people who are no longer able to provide.”  Yet, over the past 20 years, suicides among elderly men are relatively flat.  More alarming, perhaps, is the swift rise in suicides among the young. The suicide rate for boys and young men in the 15-24 age group rose by nearly half between 2001 and 2021, from 16.5 per 100,000 people to 23.8.  The suicide rate for girls and women in the same age group more than doubled in the same span, to 6.1 per 100,000.  Suicides among girls ages 10-14, almost unknown 20 years ago, rose to 2.3 per 100,000 in 2021.  Girls and women, too, are dying by self-inflicted gunshot wounds in greater numbers than in years past.  “It used to be that firearms were rarely used by women,” Cerel said. “The myth used to be that women wouldn’t use methods of taking their life that would change how they look, essentially, and that doesn’t seem to be the case.”  The easy availability of firearms is an obvious factor in the prevalence of suicide among men. Other reasons speak to the essence of American masculinity.  Society encourages girls to open up about their mental health and to seek therapy for depression, a skill set discouraged in boys.  “Boys and men haven’t been socialized to talk about mental health concerns. They’ve historically been thought of as weaknesses,” Cerel said. “The expectation for males in this country is, they’re strong, they’re independent, they take care of themselves, they don’t need help.”  Women are twice as likely as men to seek mental health treatment, according to federal data.  And why are young people becoming more prone to suicide? One factor may be a sense of belonging, which, in recent years, seems to be slipping away.  Men, in particular, have struggled in recent years to make friends and form relationships.  “I think we don’t have as much of a sense of connectedness in our communities,” said Nadine Kaslow, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Emory University School of Medicine.  “When I was growing up, everybody in the neighborhood knew everybody,” Kaslow said. “That’s changed. It’s this sense of isolation and loneliness.”  Much was made of the nation’s collective ennui during the pandemic. Yet, suicide rates actually ticked down in 2020. Why? Because everyone was home.  “During the summer, during holiday breaks, during the pandemic, those rates actually went down,” Cerel said.  It’s true: People are actually less prone to suicide during the holidays. Suicide rates rise in spring and summer, “when people get away from each other and go out in the world,” Cerel said.  Solitude and suicide travel hand in hand. Humans don’t want to die where loved ones will find them, both because of the trauma such a discovery will inflict and because a loved one might try to save them.  Some of Cerel’s research focuses on exploding the myth that only a few loved ones suffer when someone dies by suicide.  A longstanding theory held that every suicide left roughly six people behind. Cerel found the number closer to 135, a massive circle of friends and loved ones who may need mental health support to endure the loss. Tragically, suicide can beget more suicide.  “For many people, losing someone to suicide opens the door to suicidality where it hadn’t been open before,” she said.  Social media plays an ambiguous role in suicide. Many reports have suggested a link between TikTok and Instagram and worsening mental health. But researchers see potential benefits in those platforms.  “Social media is a place where people who are marginalized can get help,” Cerel said. “And you can find online social support when you don’t have it at home.”  Our nation’s mental health investment stands in dire need, suicide experts say.  All Americans could benefit from an annual mental health checkup, on top of the standard physical checkup, Prinstein said.  Sadly, the mental health checkup isn’t really a thing, partly because of enduring stigmas around mental health.  Psychotherapists are spread thin. The nation spends hundreds of times more money training its medical workforce than preparing mental health providers, Prinstein said.  As a result, rural Americans may find themselves an hour’s drive from the nearest therapist, a scenario hard to imagine in medicine.  “There’s not as much access as we need,” Kaslow said.

""Around that time, Sam came out with his story of his battle with his mental health,"" Noah told WBZ-TV.  ""It's personal,"" said Sam Gerry, of the tournament and its goal to prevent suicide. ""Starting in middle school, but throughout high school, I experienced pretty intense suicidality,"" he said.  Wanting to find a way to help, Noah came up with the kickball idea to help raise awareness and money for suicide prevention programs. He brought the idea to Sam and asked if he wanted to join in.  ""He was on board right away,"" said Noah.  ""Oftentimes, I find that people tend to shy away from really anything regarding suicide and suicide prevention,"" said Sam, recalling that moment when Noah approached him with the idea. ""It was really, really encouraging, not just any random teen but one of my best friends reaching out to express interest.""  In four years, the friends have raised thousands of dollars for local organizations.  Sam got help, and now he wants to help others like him.  ""I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D. of some kind focusing on suicidology,"" he told WBZ.  He is currently a student at Bates College in Maine. He has an internship this summer working on a research project about mental health.  ""It can get pretty dark at times, but it's really fascinating, and I love every second of it,"" he said.  Even with high school long behind them, these two are passionate about supporting the mental health needs of people in their community.  ""It would have been easy to let it fizzle out, especially with COVID happening and when we graduated and left the area,"" Noah said. ""But we stayed strong all the way through and we have gained massive support from everyone.""  Sam knows that awareness is important but isn't going to solve the problem.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 16:26:00","SACRAMENTO — May is Mental Health Awareness Month, a time to break the stigma surrounding mental health.  A recent study from the California Lawyer's Association (CLA) and the District of Columbia Bar (D.C. Bar) revealed eye-opening data surrounding a group often overlooked in these conversations: practicing attorneys. The CLA is using its findings to spark change in the legal profession.  The findings were published in three parts. The most recent, released in February 2023, is titled ""Stressed, Lonely, and Overcommitted: Predictors of Lawyer Suicide Risk.""  A key finding from the study is that lawyers are twice as likely as the general population to experience suicidal ideation. The study assessed the link in factors such as stress, loneliness, work over-commitment and alcohol use with thoughts of suicide.  The number one predictor of suicidal thoughts in lawyers was perceived stress. Lawyers with high stress were found to be 22 times more likely to contemplate suicide than those with low stress.  Oyango Snell, the CEO of the CLA reveals just how devastating these numbers can be.  ""There's a little over 1.3 million attorneys in the U.S. so that's about 130 to 156 thousand people that think about ending their lives,"" Snell said. ""This is a serious issue. No matter how tough you think attorneys should be because it's par for the course or its part of the job, at the end of the day these are human beings.""  The CLA established a Health and Wellness Committee to spearhead change – an effort to not only make an impact, but save lives in this industry.  They launched several online campaigns and free toolkits for those in the legal profession. These resources tackle issues such as stress, anxiety and problematic substance use.  The CLA is continuing the conversation on their social media through ""Level Set Mondays"" – an effort to de-stigmatize the dialogue surrounding mental health in the legal profession.  Snell says community is an essential part of maintaining the well-being of these attorneys. Among their popular challenges are ""wellness walks,"" an opportunity to reap the physical and emotional benefits of walking regularly.  ""The problem that we've been seeing is that a lot of attorneys suffer in silence,"" Snell said. ""They want to be viewed as strong, they want to be viewed as a champion and a winner. The way to go is to have a keen self-awareness and understand when you need to take a step back and really focus on yourself so that you can show up authentically and at your best for others.""

"suicide","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:27:00","After a murder-suicide in Salt Lake City over Mother’s Day weekend, questions are being raised over how an abusive parent could still have access to their children.  According to the Salt Lake City Police Department, the bodies of 49-year-old Parth Gandhi and his 16-year-old son were found inside an office complex near Millcreek Common on May 13.  The son’s name was originally withheld by police, but the family later identified him as Om Moses Gandhi in a GoFundMe campaign .  The police investigation concluded that Gandhi killed his son before then taking his own life.  Om’s mother, Leah Moses, is heavily involved in Utah’s domestic violence and victim advocacy community. She’s on the board of the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition and works as a nurse-midwife who educates patients about domestic violence.  ‘My son Om’s death was preventable,” Moses said in a statement. “The family court professionals ignored my pleas for help to keep my son safe. My son’s father persuaded everyone that I was the problem, when in fact I was just trying to protect my child. I never want this to happen to another family, to another child. If the courts would listen to and believe survivors, this nightmare would stop.”  Court records show more than a decade of disputes between Moses and Gandhi since she first filed for divorce in 2009. Moses had twice filed for protective orders against Gandhi, in 2009 and again in 2011. The two were embroiled in a custody battle over their two children at the time of Om’s death. Records show Gandhi was granted sole custody of Om in February of 2022, while Moses was granted sole custody of their daughter.  A complicated system  Experts say family courts across the country are experiencing similar difficulties.  ”Unfortunately, Utah is doing the same things wrong in these cases as family courts are all around the country and actually all around the globe,” said Danielle Pollack, policy manager at the National Family Violence Law Center . “Court professionals are not adequately trained on the subject matter of child abuse, child sexual abuse, coercive control, trauma on children, perpetrator and victim behavior.”  A similar case occurred in January in Enoch, where a man killed his children, wife and mother-in-law before killing himself. In that case , the wife and family had voiced concerns to law enforcement beforehand.  Experts say family court cases can get messy because parents are often fighting for child custody.  If one parent is alleging abuse and seeking custody, Pollack said the other parent often claims that the allegations are false and that they are trying to “brainwash” their child against them. The defense is known as parental alienation syndrome.  ""Even though it's been rebuked by medical and psychological associations and experts all around the world, it's still used and introduced in these cases,” said Pollack. “When abuse is alleged, the cross claim is frequently alienation. We see this pattern everywhere.""  Critics of the syndrome say it lacks scientific evidence .  That’s not the only complication when it comes to family court. There can often be conflicting advice when an abusive situation is combined with a custody battle.  ""The victim advocate is like, ‘Call the police, report this violation,’’ said Anne Blythe, a longtime friend of Moses and the executive director of BTR.org , which provides counseling for victims of domestic and emotional abuse. “Her civil attorney will likely say, ‘no, no, no, no, no. Do not call the police for a violation, because in this divorce court or in this custody [case], they're just going to use that against you to paint you as high conflict, that you're causing problems.’""  Moving forward  According to Blythe, unless the way the courts function or the law changes, the outlook isn’t good.  ""If someone who is well-resourced and educated about abuse and does everything right cannot protect her kids from abuse, then is there hope? And the answer to that, I would say currently speaking, is minimal,"" she said.  There has been a nationwide push surrounding legislation called the Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act, also known as Kayden’s Law , which was part of the Violence Against Women Act passed by Congress last year.  The law sets aside financial incentives for individual states to adopt their own legislation that would help train family court judges and court professionals and put in place more strict requirements on who can give expert testimony on abuse.  Colorado was the first state to pass such legislation this year.  Moses has been part of the effort to pass similar legislation in Utah for the last year. Those efforts are ongoing and half of the proceeds from the family’s Gofundme campaign will go toward efforts to pass that legislation.  For Pollack, it’s important for people to understand that situations like Moses’ are not outliers.  ""Leah's case is emblematic, it's not exceptional,” she said. “It's what's happening all around the country. She alleged abuse. She had a lot of evidence of abuse. She brought that before the court. He cross-claimed alienation. The court awarded the child to him, the abusive parent, and the child was murdered. This is happening everywhere.""

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:46:09","An uptick of people in Routt and Moffat counties taking advantage of free and confidential counseling sessions funded through Reaching Everyone Preventing Suicide may be helping to lower the number of deaths by suicide in the Yampa Valley this year.  So far in 2023, one person in Moffat County has died by suicide, with none in Routt County, said Anna Allsberry, REPS marketing and communications coordinator. By this time last year, the Yampa Valley already had lost six people to suicide. During 2022, 13 people died from suicide in Routt and Moffat counties, including six people from Routt and seven from Moffat, according to REPS.  During 2021, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported 12 suicides in the Yampa Valley, including eight people in Routt and four in Moffat.  Overall, 1,370 people in Colorado died by suicide during 2021. For context, the three counties in Colorado that have the closest population size to Routt County showed suicide numbers in 2021 of six in Elbert, eight in Montezuma and 14 in Teller.  El Paso County in Colorado topped the suicide list in 2021 with 186 deaths, and multiple smaller population counties such as Jackson County reported no or less than three suicides. Less than three annual suicides in a county are not disclosed for privacy reasons, according to the CDPHE.  REPS continues with efforts to raise funds for free counseling sessions that are available through a variety of local counselors. Thanks to two local anonymous donors, REPS has a $10,000 matching donation challenge to the public during the month of May, which is also national Mental Health Awareness Month.  “I think part of the reason the suicide numbers decreased so much this year so far is because of our confidential and complimentary counseling program that provides five free sessions of counseling,” Allsberry said.  REPS-funded counseling hit a peak of 37 sessions during the month of March alone, compared to 97 sessions throughout 2022.  Get the top stories in your inbox every morning. Sign up here: steamboatpilot.com/newsletter  “The winter was really long and hard for a lot of people. It took a toll on our community and our seasonal employees,” Allsberry said. “It’s a good problem to have because we want people to be reaching out for help. Finding the counselors to meet that need is challenging, but we are happy to do that to make sure that people are getting the help they need and not suffering in silence.”  REPS is kicking off another five-week run of fundraising bingo nights at Otto Pint on Yampa Street in Steamboat to support the counseling fund. The weekly fundraiser, starting at $5 for the first bingo card, takes place 6-9 p.m. on Thursdays from May 25 to June 22.  The national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which started in July 2022, may also be helping to reduce suicide deaths, Allsberry said.  “Even just the awareness aspect that the phone number has changed to be like 911, I think people know that help is available for them,” Allsberry said.  REPS expanded its staffing levels to include a full-time communications coordinator plus five part-time staff that lead programs ranging from support groups to youth ambassadors. The Youth Ambassador Program, or YAP, is open to any middle or high school student interested in helping increase community awareness, build support and break stigmas. The next monthly meeting of YAP is 3-4:30 p.m. Sunday, May 21, at Johnny B. Good’s Diner in downtown Steamboat, and includes free milkshakes.  Earlier this year, REPS split its support group into two more specific monthly groups. The Grief Support Group for people who lost loved ones to suicide meets the second Wednesday evening of each month, and the Coping and Healing Support Group for anyone who has attempted suicide or struggled with suicide ideation, as well as their friends and family members, meets the fourth Wednesday evening of the month.

Rubu Zhao, 52, suffered a skull fracture in the fall Sunday in PACE mental health unit 8B at the George R. Vierno Center, multiple sources told the Daily News. He died Tuesday night at Elmhurst Hospital.  Advertisement  Zhao, a native of China, is the second Rikers detainee known to have died in custody this year. He was arrested in December on charges of murder and illegal weapons possession in Brooklyn and had a May 31 court date. He was accused of killing his girlfriend in their Sunset Park home.  Rikers Island's George R. Vierno Center (James Keivom/New York Daily News)  PACE units are supposed to have a higher degree of security and medical supervision to monitor the people held there than regular jail units.  Advertisement  A DOC source familiar with the incident said Zhao was not on suicide watch, and was allowed to move around within the unit.  The sources said Zhao swung his leg over a banister at a top tier stairwell, plummeted backwards down a set of stairs and landed on his head.  Officers responded immediately and called for medical help, officials said. Zhao was taken to Elmhurst hospital, where he died at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday, they said.  “I am saddened by the circumstances that led to Mr. Zhao’s passing and I offer my condolences to his family,” said Correction Commissioner Louis Molina. “The health and safety of everyone in our custody is a top priority and a full investigation is underway to determine how this unfortunate incident occurred.”  The incident remained under investigation Wednesday.  A copy of the preliminary incident report shows Zhao fell at 2:18 p.m. on Sunday, but the incident wasn’t reported until two days later, at 12:06 a.m. on Tuesday, according to a copy of the Correction Department’s 24-hour report obtained by The News.  The report is a carefully compiled log of major incidents in the jails. The reason for the discrepancy remained unclear Wednesday.  Advocates decried the death. “When is it going to stop? Rubu Zhao should be alive today,” said Victor Pate of the group HALTSolitary. “Relying on jails to address mental health needs is destined to fail. Yet, no one in a position of power has done a damn thing to release people to alleviate this crisis.”  Advertisement  The other detainee to die at Rikers this year was Marvin Pines, who died Feb. 4 after he was found unresponsive in a housing area at the North Infirmary Command.  Five correction officers were suspended in connection with Pines’ death. A preliminary Board of Correction report found that for three hours before Pines’s death, his unit was without an officer touring the floor as required by Correction Department policy.

(FOX 56) — According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 800,000 people die by suicide each year. That’s more than all wars and homicides combined.  With this in mind, The University of Kentucky’s nursing program is stepping up to teach students about the warning signs of suicide and what to do next.  UK is now offering a one-hour online program that teaches people a suicidal prevention tactic called “QPR”, which stands for “question, persuade, refer.”  QPR training teaches how to recognize early signs of suicide and how to respond.  The training program started as a class for just 30 nursing students at a time. It has now grown into an online platform to accommodate a larger demand.  Amanda Lykins, an assistant professor for UK’s undergraduate nursing program and she said, “We know that through this training, one little interaction can save a life.”  Lykins also said the university has seen demand go up for the campus “Mental health crisis hotline.”  “We are seeing an increase in students accessing that throughout the semester,” Lykins said. “We are seeing more and more students who are socially isolated and doesn’t have the ability to be able to cope with those difficult situations.  Lykins said one positive development in the last year is that suicide has dropped from the 10th leading cause of death in the nation to 12th.  “I think that the stigma around mental health and mental illness has definitely improved,” Lykins said. “I feel like we are providing more awareness that it’s ok not to be ok.”  However, even with the lower rates, the WHO reports there is one suicide death every 40 seconds; 15 people every 10 minutes.

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 18:30:05","The quality of life among the working-age population has significantly deteriorated in recent years. Only every other working-age individual now considers their quality of life good, whereas four years ago, over 60 percent of working-age individuals felt the same way. Quality of life refers to a person's perception of their own situation, including their health, well-being, social relationships, and living environment.  These findings emerge from a comprehensive population study called ""Terve Suomi"" conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The survey data was collected between September 2022 and March 2023.  According to the study, one in five working-age individuals, aged 20 to 64, experiences significant psychological strain. Mental strain has increased markedly among both men and women compared to 2018: from 13 percent to 19 percent among men and from 13 percent to 20 percent among women. Psychological strain remains most prevalent among individuals aged 20 to 29, but there has also been an increase among those aged 30 to 49.  ""The results are concerning from the perspective of societal social and economic sustainability. While there have been indications of the declining well-being of the working-age population previously, the crises of recent years have likely further complicated the situation. During the upcoming government term, the well-being of working-age individuals must be placed at the core of decision-making, as an aging Finnish society requires a healthy and functional population,"" says lead researcher Annamari Lundqvist.  Suicidal thoughts have become more prevalent among those under 50 years old. While in 2018, one in ten individuals reported having suicidal thoughts, now the number has risen to one in eight among those under 50.  ""The implementation of suicide prevention programs is now particularly crucial. These programs aim to develop ways for anyone to address concerns and guide healthcare professionals on what to do after identifying suicide risk. Additionally, we encourage individuals to create safety plans in case of suicidal thoughts and promote the use of other effective treatment methods in social and healthcare services,"" explains research professor Timo Partonen.  An increasing number of working-age individuals report utilizing mental health services due to mental health-related problems. Currently, 20 percent of women and 12 percent of men in this age group state that they have used mental health services, compared to 15 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in 2018.  The study also reveals that access to healthcare services has become more challenging. Nearly one in four adults feel that they do not receive sufficient medical services relative to their needs. This means that over 800,000 individuals in Finland perceive medical services as inadequate. The proportion has increased by almost 10 percentage points among both men and women since 2018: from 14 percent to 23 percent among men and from 17 percent to 27 percent among women. These findings reflect the situation prior to the social and healthcare reform.  The most challenging situations regarding access to doctors are found in North Karelia, Central Uusimaa, and Kainuu, where over 30 percent of residents feel they receive insufficient medical services relative to their needs.  ""The new well-being regions face a difficult starting point that they must address. The poor development is likely influenced by several factors, such as the backlog of COVID-19 treatment, the delayed social and healthcare reform, and personnel shortages. Finland also allocates less funding to healthcare compared to Western European countries,"" states senior expert Anna-Mari Aalto.  ""There is no single solution to this complex situation. The new well-being regions now have the opportunity to develop the service structure of their regions and seek solutions to improve service availability,"" Aalto adds.  The survey portion of the ""Terve Suomi"" study invited 61,600 randomly selected individuals aged 20 or older from various parts of Finland to participate. The sample was constructed in a manner that allows for generalization of the results to the whole of Finland and the well-being regions. Of those invited to the study, 46 percent responded to the survey between September 2022 and March 2023.  Data from 2018 and 2020 is based on the FinSote study conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

The Moderator of the Church of Scotland General Assembly, the Rt Rev Iain Greenshields, the Vice President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Scotland, Bishop John Keenan, and the Imam of Dundee Central Mosque, Imam Shaykh Hamza Khandwalla, will hold a meeting with MSPs at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday to express their opposition.  During their meeting, hosted by the Logos Scotland think thank, they will sign a statement voicing their ""deep concern"" over the proposals and urging MSPs to vote them down.  The statement says that assisted suicide undermines human dignity and puts pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.  ""Our faith traditions are united in the principle that assisted dying in itself inevitably undermines the dignity of the human person, and to allow it would mean that our society as a whole loses its common humanity,"" the statement says.  ""The Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques remain firm in their opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia.""  The latest campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide is being led by Liam McArthur, Lib Dem MSP for Orkney, whose Member's Bill would allow competent terminally ill adults to request assistance to end their life.  The faith leaders add in their joint statement, ""The ways in which similar laws in other countries are being applied, and the effect that its introduction would have on some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the disabled and the elderly, would be extremely detrimental.""  The statement ends with a call to MSPs ""to consider carefully the implications of this Bill, to express their concerns, and to vote against it"".  Bishop Keenan said: ""Assisted suicide attacks human dignity and results in human life being increasingly valued on the basis of its efficiency and utility. Implicit in legal assisted suicide is that an individual can lose their value and worth.  ""Evidence from countries where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal shows that vulnerable people feel pressured to end their lives through fear of being a burden. In such situations the option of assisted suicide is less about having a 'right' to die and more about feeling the full weight and expectation of a duty to die.  ""When vulnerable people, including the elderly and poor, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.""  Rev Greenshields said: ""Our opposition to assisted dying is based on our Christian faith, and involves concerns around the principle of assisted dying, around the application of the law in practice, the perception of the value of human lives, and also the effect which any change is likely to have on the provision of care - in particular, on palliative care.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vY2hyaXN0aWFudG9kYXkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZmFpdGgubGVhZGVycy51cmdlLnNjb3R0aXNoLnBhcmxpYW1lbnQubm90LnRvLmxlZ2FsaXNlLmFzc2lzdGVkLnN1aWNpZGUvMTQwMjI5Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Lakhimpur"", ""UttarPradesh"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:17:54","Dramatic twists and turns and a series of accusations adding more suspense to the unfortunate death of Sub-Inspector (SI) Junmoni Rabha, who lost her life in a fatal road accident on Monday night.  The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2xpdmV0di5jb20vbmVpdGhlci1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1ub3ItYS1zdWljaWRlLWp1bm1vbmktcmFiaGEtd2FzLW11cmRlcmVkLWNsYWltcy1wb2xpY2UtaW5mb3JtYW50LWhhc2luYS1iZWd1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The man was a temporary employee at the bank.  The incident happened at around 5.30 pm at the headquarters of the bank near Mascot Hotel.  Sreeranjini (38), widow of Prakash, from Nediyamkode, Dhanuvachapuram, Parassala, threatened to jump off the wall into the nearby 30 foot-deep cemetery compound as the authorities continued to neglect her demand.  Prakash, who had served as a temporary watchman for 14 years at the Karakkonam, Vellarada, Udayankulangara, and Balaramapuram branches under the District Co-operative Bank, committed suicide three years ago. Sreeranjini had applied for compassionate appointment at the bank and visited the bank’s Udayankulangara branch and headquarters numerous times but in vain.  She reached the bank's headquarters on Tuesday as a last-ditch attempt. However, the security pesonnel refused to let her in. An upset Sreeranjini then began to cry uncontrollably, stating that she has no other means to take care of her two children. She waited in front of the bank. Finally, when the employees came out and locked the entrance after the day’s work, she suddenly scaled the high compound wall and threatened to jump.  The shocked employees tried to pacify her, but she ignored their pleas. Finally, police and fire force personnel rushed in and brought her down half an hour later after assuring her of appropriate action.  “There is no means for me to earn a living. Both my children are currently at asylums. I am frequenting the office desperately to get a job for the last one year. Initially, they assured to give me the job without any delay.

Guests who dined at Applebee’s had 20% of the cost of their meal donated back to the American Foundation For Suicide Prevention, resulting in a $700 donation as part of the Applebee’s Dining to Donate program. Other donations were received from raffle ticket sales.  LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT  Performers came together to showcase their talents, while spokespersons from community organizations offered information about resources available for those who are struggling with mental health.  The goal of the evening was to put suicide and mental illness in the spotlight and to encourage conversations about how to come to the aid of those who are who need assistance.  Performers for the evening included local stand-up comedian Jane Joan Costagliola, violinist Comfort Cat, singers Madison Burkhart, Joey Escribano, Thomas DeVito, Christian Gueits, Miss Richmond County Madison Gattullo, Miss Staten Island Outstanding Teen Nadia Anwar, Jenny Pisani, Victoria Billalba, and poets Alana Light, Matt Germoso, Andrew Littlefield and Thomas Fucaloro.

The episode, titled “Egosurfing,” (spoilers ahead) focuses on Akane, an aspiring actress who is part of the reality show Aqua is on. Feeling the pressure to perform better for the audience, Akane strikes her co-star and ends up being bullied online which leads her to become suicidal. The message on HIDIVE states that Oshi no Ko is a work of fiction, but encourages everyone who is struggling with mental health to reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. While TV networks and streaming services in the US are not required by law to include these warnings in their content, they are heavily encouraged due to possible negative consequences the content may have on viewers.  The events in the episode carry a stark similarity to the Hana Kimura case. Kimura was a part of the Terrace House reality TV show in 2020. One of the episodes showed her getting into a fight with another cast member and the altercation was shown to the public. Kimura became a target of online bullying and later committed suicide. The show was canceled. Her mother, Kyoko Kimura, sued Fuji TV and two other producers of the show in December 2022, claiming that the scenes were edited to make her daughter appear in a bad light. She accused them of treating the contestants as dispensable. In a separate case in May 2021, a court ordered a man to pay Kyoko Kimura 1.29 million yen in damages for posting hateful messages about Hana after her death.  Oshi no Ko anime premiered this April with a 90-minute episode. Studio Doga Kobo is animating the series, which is proving to be one of the biggest hits of the season. YOASOBI is singing the opening theme song “Idol” while QUEEN Bee is performing the ending song titled “Mephisto.”  The anime is based on a manga written by Aka Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love Is War) with art by Mengo Yokoyari. The manga began serialization in 2020 in the Weekly Young Jump magazine. The story focuses on the dark side of the entertainment industry. Yen Press licensed it in English.  HIDIVE is simulcasting Oshi no Ko anime with English subtitles every Wednesday. The English dub is slated to premiere on May 24. The platform describes the plot as:  Dr. Goro is reborn as the son of the young starlet Ai Hoshino after her delusional stalker murders him.

What no one knew was that my husband had Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia. He had been admitted to the psychiatric ward twice when he was at the peak of his career. I was working hard to make ends meet as bipolar disorder had made my husband go on an excessive spending spree which had thrown the family finances into jeopardy. But nowhere, in this whole melee was the love lost. One night we all celebrated my birthday. We went to bed past midnight, but the next morning only I got up. He slept forever.”  Kiran calls herself a ‘suicide leftover’. Her husband died in 2019. Her in-laws blamed her for their son’s death. Rage and guilt engulfed her. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment,” recalls Kiran. “I couldn’t remember things. I was directionless. From an overachiever and a super organized multi-tasker, I began shirking work and responsibilities.”  Three years have since passed, but Kiran is still unable to extricate herself from guilt and shame.  Also read: “Bipolar Disorder will change your life but you can navigate around it”: A first-person account  As Priti Sridhar, Executive Director, Mariwala Health Initiative, writes in the research study Suicide Prevention: Changing the Narrative: “For each person that dies by suicide, about 60 others are impacted by the bereavement, and 20 go on to attempt suicide. This is undeniably a public health crisis of epic proportions.” The report is a collaborative effort of the Mariwala Health Initiative and India Development Review, released in 2023.  According to the 2022 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total of 1,64,033 suicides were reported in the country in 2021, an increase of 7.2% in comparison to 2020. The age group of 18 to 30 years and from 30 to 45 years accounted for 34.5% and 31.7% of total suicides, respectively. A significant proportion of these individuals were students. It is estimated that in 2021 about 13,039 students died by suicide.  Why does suicide affect those left behind with guilt? > Because one believes that they failed to listen to the person who died by suicide. > Guilt comes from the mistaken belief that we should have, or could have, prevented the death from happening. >They see suicide as their inadequacy. > Feel embarrassed for the person who died by suicide. The dead is often labelled as weak, failure, and quitter. Such labels further weaken the person suffering from guilt. > Unsolved issues with the dead also give rise to guilt. (Counsellors and therapists recommend that the loved ones of the deceased should accept the truth that some things are beyond their control.)  Kiran (name changed, pixelated) calls herself a ‘suicide leftover. Her husband died in 2019. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment”.  “My sister was three years older than me, studying computer science at a private institute in NOIDA,” says Moushami, who was 18 years old then and considered her elder sister as her best friend. “We had a healthy sibling relationship. We loved doing things together. We fought, bullied each other, and cried together. It was 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic, when my sister suddenly died by suicide. She was 21.”  The elder sister was good at studies and wanted to go abroad to pursue post-graduation. “But one night she put a full stop to everything,” recalls Moushami. “She jumped from the 12th floor of a multi-storey building”.  After her sister’s death, Moushami went into shock. “I was suddenly overtaken by the feeling of betrayal,” she says. “I wanted answers to unanswerable questions: Why did she kill herself? Was life that unbearable? Why did she not even think about me?”  Shame and stigma  Moushami and her family suffered in silence. “Because of shame and stigma, my family never shared the incident with others. We were not even allowed to discuss it at home. I had my solitary conversations. It is just a few months back when I joined college that I opened up. Some friends suggested joining a support group. I felt light after sharing my grief with unknown people in Swayam Hope Café, a support group,” says a teary-eyed Moushami.  Conversations around suicides are laced with stigma and myths. Says Dr Shashi Rai, Consultant Psychiatrist, Director Sambal Drug De-Addiction and Psychiatric Centre Indira Nagar, Lucknow: “There’s a general belief that suicide is the result of mental illness. The fact is there are various socio-economic factors and family expectations inter-connected with suicides.”  Exam pressure, unemployment, discrimination and financial issues are some of the major factors for suicides. The NCRB lists family problems as the primary cause of nearly one-third of suicides in India.  According to experts, death by suicide cannot be seen in isolation. It is complicated, complex, intersectional and inter-sectoral. Says Dr Kalyanasundaram, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Hon. Advisor Richmond Fellowship Society, Bangalore: “People look for easy gratification and quick fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Read more: Loneliness: An urban epidemic that carries the same risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day!  “People look for easy gratification and quick-fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Pic courtesy: Dr Kalyanasundaram  Suicide leaves behind a heavy toll on families and friends. “After my husband’s death by suicide, I found myself friendless,” says Kiran. “Some friends did reach out to me via social media. But I had no one with whom I could chat and have a cup of coffee. To change my environment, I changed my job. But I couldn’t hang out with new colleagues. I felt alienated. My life sucked till I discovered a support group. Finally, somewhere I redeemed myself of guilt.”  Somewhat similar is the experience of Ritu, based in Chandigarh. Her husband died by suicide in 2008. He shot himself. “For a long time, I suffered from guilt, in silence and blamed myself for not understanding his comments about suicide,” says Ritu. “He used to eulogise suicide and often regretted being trapped in a financial mess, having suffered heavy losses in his business. I merely tried to encourage him to see the positive side of life. But now when I remember his statements, I blame myself for not understanding the hidden meaning of his words.”  She feels that she should have forced him to see a therapist when he began to show anxiety symptoms. She was a homemaker when her husband died. Today, she handles the business and simultaneously conducts life coaching workshops. “I encourage my clients to always stand beside their loved ones and never be ashamed to seek counselling sessions.”  Warning Signs of Suicide Often talking or writing about death, dying or suicide.  Making comments about being hopeless, a failure or worthless. Using expressions such as, ‘I am a failure’ or saying, ‘I’m trapped,’ or expressing the feeling of being a ‘burden.’  Increased alcohol and/or drug use.  Withdrawal from friends, family and community.  Frequent mood changes. (Source: National Institute of Mental Health.  Website: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/warning-signs-of-suicide)  Sharing and listening  Suicide is preventable. Talking about suicide often helps a person who is thinking about suicide feel less alone.  “I met her at the World Book Fair while browsing through a book on mental health,” says 30-year-old Varun (name changed). “We both began to chat and in our conversation, we shared how we both had been ideating about life and suicide. Sharing made us feel less alone and more understood. We talk every other day now.”  “Sharing helps people feel less isolated and overwhelmed, it pauses their thoughts about suicide,” Says Dr Rai, “It reduces stress.”  While agreeing that sharing is vital, Dr Kalyanasundaram adds: “Youngsters look for peer validation. They are unable to handle peer and academic pressure. We should have proper mechanisms for help and guidance.”  Top of the list  At present, India is at the top of the list in suicide deaths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one Indian is lost to suicide every three minutes. With 419 suicides per day or 1,53,052 suicides annually, India has the most suicides globally.  Under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), world leaders agreed to decrease suicide deaths by a third by 2030. The question is what are we doing about it? Are we promoting interventions at various socio-cultural levels?  The need of the hour is to change the narratives of suicide. Though the Mental Care Health Act 2017 decriminalises suicide, hardly anything has been done to destigmatise it or encourage more suicide support groups or suicide first aid responders in colleges and workplaces.

"suicide","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:15:01","The state of California will not require doctors who object to assisted suicide to provide life-ending medications to patients or refer such patients to other health providers, a federal judge ordered Wednesday.  In addition, the Golden State will pay $300,000 in legal fees to settle an action brought in 2022 by the Christian Medical & Dental Association and Dr. Leslee Cochrane, a California-licensed hospice physician and CMDA member.  The challenge came after Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021 signed Senate Bill 380, which shortened the time between separate “oral requests” for “aid-in-dying” medication from 15 days to 48 hours. It required all physicians to document such requests, even those who hold moral objections to the practice.  Objecting doctors would have had to “educate” patients about procedures and medicines that would assist in suicide attempts under the existing statute and provide referrals to other providers.  In September, a federal district court in California ruled the state couldn’t force physicians to participate in such actions.  Kevin Theriot, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which sued on behalf of Dr. Cochrane and CMDA, said the 2021 legislation upended previously enacted conscience guarantees.  “They had great protection in the original assisted-suicide statute,” he said in a telephone interview. “And then they recently amended it to take away some of that protection. Most people agree, and in the original legislation [California] agreed the government doesn’t have any business forcing doctors to participate in procedures like taking human life.”  He said a subsequent “legislature didn’t heed that warning and so we had to file a lawsuit to be able to protect the rights of physicians in California.”  Under the settlement order issued by federal Central District Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha, state officials are barred from issuing “any criminal or civil punishment, including professional discipline or licensing sanction for a California-licensed physician’s refusal or failure” to document a request for “medical aid-in-dying,” provide information about such services apart from saying the physician does not provide them, or refer a patient to another provider.  The state can still require objecting physicians to “transfer a patient’s relevant medical record upon request” to another provider.  California is not the only state to reconsider protections for physicians who object to the procedure on conscience grounds. In April, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, enacted legislation protecting doctors’ conscience rights in that state, ending an ADF lawsuit there.  Mr. Theriot said the nonprofit legal organization is “looking at some potential lawsuits that in states that allow assisted suicide right now,” and “will likely be filing one in the coming days.”  The Washington Times has contacted the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta for comment.  • Mark A.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:26:15","Study pinpoints differences in brain connections that could be used in prevention and may lead to new treatments to reduce suicide risk  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan. For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt. But new research has uncovered a clue, or marker, in the brain that could be used to identify people at a higher risk of ending their life.  In a paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history. The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author on the paper. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact. Researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders ​​(TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  Jagger-Rickels says the findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTg5Njgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photo: Xinhua  Local police in Indonesia on Wednesday confirmed the suspicious deaths of two Chinese tourists in a local hotel, which has drawn wide attention on Chinese social media and sparked speculation over the cause of death.According to Denpasar Police, the 25-year-old victim Li Chiming beat, tied up and immersed his girlfriend, 22-year-old, Cheng Jianan, in a bathtub at the Jimbaran Intercontinential Hotel, local news outlet NusaBali reported on Wednesday.Then Li ""committed suicide by injuring himself using broken beer bottles on his neck and all over his body,"" NusaBali quoted local police chief as saying.The conclusion of murder and suicide was based on the results of internal and external examinations by a forensic doctor at Prof IGNG Ngoerah Hospital Denpasar and the results of the Bali Police Forensic Laboratory.The lovers had involved in an argument before arriving at the hotel, they shared five bottles of beer that they ordered from room service, according to investigators.The police questioned witnesses, both hotel guests and hotel employees, and reviewed CCTV footage, cellphones belonging to the two victims as well as checking the scene of the incident, another local outlet in Indonesian language Bali Tribune reported.The shocking case was revealed on May 1 when Li, the male, was found naked covered in blood with wounds all over his body, including two major wounds on his neck and left leg. Cheng was found dead lying in the bathtub in their room 4223, naked with strangle marks.Their belongings were all accounted for and no witnesses or CCTV showed anybody entering room 4223 except the room service person who only stayed very shortly before Li came out of the room for once, according to local police.The Wednesday police press briefing claimed that Cheng had scratch wounds on her forehead, right shoulder, forearm, lower leg and knees. There are line-shaped scratches on her neck and foam in her nose and mouth, leading to the conclusion that Cheng was badly beaten before dying from drowning in the bathtub.Li had more than 20 wounds on the neck, left chest, back of both hands, left wrist, back of both feet and allegedly died of loss of blood caused by injuries to his neck.The investigation results prompted doubt and questioning on Chinese social media as some netizens challenged that Li, if wanted to commit suicide, would not have run into the hotel hallway, which many interpreted as a call for help. People holding a different view said perhaps he injured himself and felt regret before he bled to death.Other questionable points included the fact that Li sustained a large number of wounds prior to suicide. With others contending that if it was indeed a murder suicide, the two had no reason to be naked; using a piece of glass to commit suicide is painful and is not a typical means of taking one's life.Netizens called for more details to be released to further dispel the doubts, including how the victims involved in an argument and proof of the man's homicide and suicide motivation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMzA1LzEyOTA4NzUuc2h0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nancy Paloma Collins, therapist director of Paloma Therapy, points out that 73% of people who identify as transgender have high anxiety, and more than 50% suffer from depression.  In the past year, one in five transgender youth has attempted suicide, according to figures from the Trevor Project.  ""A person who is gay or lesbian, for example, might say, 'I'm going to tell my friends, then my parents, and then I'm going out into the world,'"" Collins said.

So at this time, when mental health has reached a flashpoint nationwide, how are we doing in the Quad Cities?  Angela Ganzer-Bovitz, Director of Behavioral Health Inpatient with Genesis Health System, and Cecilia Bailey, Director at Quad Cities Open Network, talk about the 2021 Quad Cities Health Assessment’s mental health results. The analysis shows that the metro area has significantly higher rates of suicide than do the entire states of Illinois or Iowa (or even the entire U.S.).  An average of 53 Quad Cities’ residents die of suicide every year.  This led to the launching of Zero Suicide Initiative QC. The initiative is a collaboration between the Zero Suicide Institute and the Quad Cities Behavioral Health Coalition in an effort to lower suicide rates and make systemic change within our community.  The project’s mission statement is that “suicide is preventable” and they provide free training for individuals to be a part of the solution. Proper training better equips people to recognize the warning signs of suicide, how to talk to the person in crisis, and how to refer them for ongoing help.  It’s free to participate in the initiative’s Q-P-R training. Just like CPR, QPR is an emergency response to someone in crisis and can save lives.  QPR stands for Question, Persuade, Refer. It’s a one-hour, web-based program. Scan the QR Code included in the video interview or embedded below. Interested individuals can also click here.

"suicide","2015-09-25","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:01:17","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Jeff Van Drew (R-02) has introduced three pieces of legislation to bring awareness to veteran suicide and to ease the burden of costs for veterans’ organizations. The bills are the Andrew Thomas McCaffrey Green Star Veterans Service Act, Green Star Families Act and Veterans’ Telecommunications Protection Act.  “Andrew Thomas McCaffrey was a brave and fearless man who served his country in Afghanistan,” Van Drew said in a statment. “Far too often, our veterans do not receive the care they need when they return from service, and tragically lose their lives to suicide.”  He said the Andrew Thomas McCaffrey Green Stars Veterans Service Act is a tribute to veterans like Andrew McCaffrey and provides a symbol of recognition and support for family members affected by veteran suicide.  “Each year, we lose thousands of veterans to suicide—we must allocate necessary funding and resources to fight for our veterans when they leave service, just as they have fought for all of us.”  The package of bills recognizes dedicated and selfless veterans across America and will bring awareness to the terrible tragedy of suicide.  “In Congress, we must invest in our veterans’ mental health and provide support to those who have lost their loved ones,” he added.  “Recognizing the existence of a problem is the first step towards finding a solution,”said Matt Cahill, founder of Green Star Families of America. “By acknowledging the importance of the Green Star Service Flag, we take the first official step towards addressing the issue of veteran suicide.”  The act introduced in memory of Andrew Thomas McCaffrey directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate a Green Star Flag for next of kin of veterans who die by suicide.

Green Star Families Act establishes a counseling program through the Veterans Affairs Department for families and caregivers of veterans deceased as the result of suicide, at no cost to them.

"suicide","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Henryetta"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:00:00","HENRYETTA, Okla. (KFOR) – It has been just over two weeks since a convicted sex offender is said to have murdered five children and his wife of less than a year. Search warrants are slowly being returned, now giving a possible motive for the killings, but also depicting false information.  According to the Okmulgee County District Court Clerk’s Office, eight search warrants involving Jesse McFadden have been issued, but only three have been returned so far.  The first search warrant was issued at 1:25 p.m. on May 1, the same day seven bodies were discovered on a Henryetta property.  Once the initial search warrant was obtained, law enforcement claims they found the “front door was ajar.”  That returned search warrant shows photographs, a State Farm drive safe token, and miscellaneous receipts were the only pieces of evidence found and seized from Jesse McFadden’s property on May 1.  An Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office Investigator added a white Chevrolet Avalanche was impounded by a Beggs, Oklahoma wrecker service.  The vehicle had a “No-Touch Hold” on it.  Records show law enforcement then seized eight pieces of evidence from the vehicle on May 8 once OSBI had already taken over:  Eight latent print cards from Avalanche processing; five palm and three fingerprint  Four pairs of swabs from exterior door handles, four interior door handles, steering wheel from Avalanche  Route 66 lanyard with two brinks keys on ring  Straw from driver’s side flat lid cup  Straw from passenger side cup dome lid  Purchase receipts x3 from Avalanche processing on May 8  Two McDonald’s McCafe cups  DVD with Avalanche processing photos on May 8  In the same set of search warrants is false information.  “Your affiant was made aware of a missing persons case involving a 14 year old female, named Tiffany Guess,” records show.  Court documents also indicate there was an Amber Alert pushed out for Tiffany Guess and Ivy Webster.  Both of those statements are inaccurate.  There was a “Missing and Endangered” alert for Ivy Webster and Brittany Brewer. Tiffany Guess was not included in the push notification.

Court records also show Tiffany’s father was interviewed on McFadden’s property by Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents about the additional items of interest he found inside the home.  “The subject described the items to be clothing and personal belongings of the deceased victims,” the report shows.  Ivy Webster’s dad, Justin said that’s also not true.  He claims he was the one interviewed on McFadden’s property.  McFadden’s rental property is several acres wide, but three different street numbers have been recorded.  Documents show Tiffany lived at 14317 Holly Road. It shows Ivy was spending the night at 14360 Holly Road. The mailbox outside of McFadden’s property has 14600 as the street number.  The mailbox outside of Jesse McFadden’s rental home. KFOR photo.  “How many times does it take a Sheriff’s office to mess up over and over and over again to where we finally get an investigation into the Sheriff’s office?,” asked Justin. “They failed once again miserably over and over and over again.”  According to records, exigent cellular phone pings showed McFadden’s wife, Holly Guess’ cell phone was actively pinging on or near the property as of May 1 at 12:45 p.m.  Tiffany’s cell phone pinged on or near the property, but then signal was lost.  No other cell phone pinging on or near McFadden’s property has been reported thus far.  The local storage unit Guess appeared to be making monthly payments to was also searched.  Law enforcement was made aware of the storage unit on May 6, according to records.  This is just one day after News 4 aired a story about the potential evidence left behind by law enforcement, including a check made out to the storage facility.  Records show nothing was seized from the unit.  “Based off what we were told is there was really just like, pool supplies and that was all that was in that storage unit, so there was no real concern,” stated Justin.  Justin told KFOR since OSBI took over his daughter’s investigation, there has been a steady stream of information.  “We’re being updated and it’s good communication, and I’m very grateful for it,” said Justin.  Before the OSBI took over, records show the Okmulgee Police Department was the lead on this case and only asked OSBI for “partial assistance.”  News 4 has been made aware of two hard drives, drug paraphernalia, two laptops, two tablets, a check, a 9mm gun, bullet casings, and nine cell phones recovered from McFadden’s property.  The Webster family told KFOR they feel as if the opportunity to grieve over Ivy has been stripped away from them because they’re constantly looking for answers and accepting tips from the public.  “I just feel like I need to keep fighting and keep digging and keep digging to get answers. And that’s my motivation right now and not just answers for us, but answers for other victims that might be out there,” stated Justin.  A possible motive revealed in court records is McFadden telling his mother the evening of April 30 that he was not going back to prison and had decided to kill himself.  Officials were asked during a press conference about McFadden’s possible motive, but they declined to speculate.  News 4 asked the State Medical Examiner’s Office for comment on May 8, but were told, “Our agency does not answer questions regarding cases or scenes.”  We have continued asking questions and filing Open Records Requests with the Okmulgee Sheriff’s Office.  Proof of one home compliance check at McFadden’s property was emailed last week.  Jesse McFadden’s only home compliance check. Photo courtesy: Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office.

We were redirected to the DA’s Office.  News 4 showed up to the DA’s Office Wednesday afternoon, asking why an Open Records Request for a different department would be redirected to their office, but no one was available for comment.  In the meantime, Justin is encouraging everyone to sign their petition demanding a change in current laws when it comes to registered sex offender sentences and probationary requirements.  He is also calling on Governor Kevin Stitt and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to step in.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9oZW5yeWV0dGEtd2FycmFudHMtc2hvdy1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3RpdmUtaW5jb3JyZWN0LWluZm8v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hlbnJ5ZXR0YS13YXJyYW50cy1zaG93LXBvc3NpYmxlLW1vdGl2ZS1pbmNvcnJlY3QtaW5mby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-16","15:00:00","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:30:00","This article discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline available 24/7.  COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Suicide deaths climbed in Ohio in 2021, ending a two-year decline witnessed in years prior, according to new data from the state Department of Health.  As the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio, suicide accounted for the deaths of 1,766 Ohioans in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before, the department said Friday in its 2021 Suicide Demographics and Trends report. That means about five Ohioans – up from four in 2020 – died by suicide every day.  “We’ve got to reduce that number,” said Tony Coder, executive director of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation. “We’ve got to get that down to four, then to three, then to two, then to one every day – and hopefully put me out of business.”  The statewide rise in suicide deaths mirrors trends at both the local and national levels, with Franklin County recording a 10% jump in suicide deaths from 2020 to 2021 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recording a 4.79% rise across the U.S. during the same period.  Between the coronavirus pandemic, financial hardships, and social unrest experienced across the U.S., Coder said 2021 took a toll on the mental health of Ohioans, likely attributing to the rise in suicides.  “Two years ago, it’s kind of hard to remember, but there were some folks that were losing their jobs, businesses were struggling, just the lack of being able to see each other in person was something that really took an impact on folks,” he said.  But with the right help, Coder said suicide is preventable. While Ohio loses five people to suicide every day, another 35 are checking into emergency rooms daily for treatment after a suicide attempt, he said.  “Those are 35 people that are seeking help and getting the care that they need,” Coder said. “That’s where I hope that we can also see, that for all of the hopelessness that this report might show, there’s a lot of hope out there for folks if they get the care that they deserve.”  Demographics  White people had the largest increase, 7%, in the rate of suicide deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Department of Health. The rate among Black Ohioans – though it has steadily increased since 2012 – stayed largely the same in 2021.  Despite making up just under half of Ohio’s population, men accounted for 81% of suicide deaths in 2021, the report found. Those aged 75 and older had the highest suicide rate relative to other age groups. Among women, the rate was highest within the 45 to 54-year-old age bracket.  Suicide continued to be the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans ages 10 to 34 years in 2021, and during that year, 24 children between 10 and 14 years old died by suicide.  As for method, firearms were the No. 1 mechanism for completing a suicide among both men and women, with guns accounting for 991 deaths in Ohio in 2021 – a 10% increase from the year before. Coder said one data point that surprised him was the 22% rise in suicide deaths by drug poisoning.  “We have not seen that type of increase before,” he said.  Rural communities, which historically have lacked access to mental health resources, were hit hardest by suicide in 2021, the report found. Of the 15 counties with the highest rates of suicide death, 14 are considered rural.  “If you get into Jackson, Gallia counties down by the Ohio River, you might have to travel a county or two just to find somebody to seek care from,” Coder said. “It’s literally an access to care issue that needs to be addressed.”  Ohio’s suicide prevention plan  In 2020, the state partnered with Coder’s organization, the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, to create the Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio. Since then, the state has implemented awareness programs like Life Side Ohio for gun owners, a 988 suicide and crisis hotline, and the Ohio School Wellness Initiative to prevent and address suicide in schools.  Gov. Mike DeWine, who has made funding for mental health a priority during his administration, proposed the allocation of millions of dollars in the fiscal year 2024-25 budget, including:  $46.5 million for the continued operation of the 988 hotline  $8 million to continue and expand the state’s 2020 Suicide Prevention Plan  $100 million to create the State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network, or SOAR, to develop and implement mental health and addiction prevention, treatment and recovery  $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce and developing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities  “Most of this funding is sent directly to local communities and will be used to increase the number of Ohioans trained to help people build skills to bounce back from difficult life events and to reduce stigma so people can ask for help without shame,” Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Director Lori Criss said in a statement.  Ultimately, Coder said it’s important that those considering suicide – and those impacted by suicide – recognize that they are not alone and recovery is possible.  “We can get help; we can have hope,” he said. “And that’s what I hope our message is: You don’t feel like you’re on an island, you don’t feel like you’re all alone.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYzRpLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvb2hpby1zdWljaWRlLWRlYXRocy1yb3NlLWluLTIwMjEtYWZ0ZXItdHdvLXllYXItZGVjbGluZS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmM0aS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL29oaW8tc3VpY2lkZS1kZWF0aHMtcm9zZS1pbi0yMDIxLWFmdGVyLXR3by15ZWFyLWRlY2xpbmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Raeford"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:22:55","[Photo: Hoke County Health Department staff hosted the suicide prevention symposium at the Robert A. Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford.]  By Catharin Shepard • Editor • If you’re worried someone is suicidal, the first step to helping may be just to ask the question.  That was a key takeaway from the county’s first suicide prevention symposium, Hoke County Health Department Social Work Supervisor Isley Cotton said.  “Ask the question. You can’t be afraid to ask the question, and you have to be intentional. You can’t dance around it, you can’t use fluffier words,” she said. “If you think a person is having issues with suicidal thoughts, ask them directly, that’s the main thing.”  The Health Department hosted the suicide prevention symposium Friday evening at the Robert A. Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford. The evening featured a panel discussion with a group of mental health professionals, plus testimonials from survivors and people who experienced losing someone to suicide.  Being able to talk about a difficult topic that is often taboo was “refreshing,” Cotton said.  “For me tonight was refreshing because the topic that is so stigmatized in our community, to be able to just talk about suicide in an open, safe space, really was refreshing for me and for the community. There are so many people who came out who would probably not be that comfortable speaking about suicide in other settings,” she said.  Members of the local faith community, elected officials, healthcare providers and many others attended the event, which packed the room for the evening. Vendors set up tables with information about services and mental health treatment options, as well as information about suicide prevention. One vendor came all the way from South Carolina to attend the event.  Raising awareness about suicide prevention was a big goal of the symposium.  “Awareness is the first thing. We want people to know it is okay to not be okay, as so many people said…and for them to know there is help and there is hope,” Cotton said. “I think sometimes we devalue ‘brain pain,’ because it’s not like a body ache.”  Sometimes people can end up in a place where they feel ending their life is the only way to end the pain, but “we heard something different tonight,” Cotton said.  “I just hope that this event fostered a sense of community among everyone, and they know that we’re all here to support each other. We’re in it together, we can’t do it without each other.”  The event grew out of a suicide prevention team established at the Hoke Health Department through grant funding. It was a team effort between the Health Department and several other health agencies.  The Health Department works to address suicide prevention in a number of other ways, too.  “We have a firearm safety team we have started at the Health Department, which we are connected to so many people. And that’s the thing, fostering the connection, so that we all know who is in the room, who does what, and we can make adequate referrals,” Cotton said.  For more information on suicide prevention, contact the Hoke County Health Department at (910) 875-3717.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhva2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9zdWljaWRlLXByZXZlbnRpb24tYWJvdXQtYXNraW5nLXRoZS1xdWVzdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-03-23","Not Discerned","{""Louisville"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:45:58","By Leah Bomar  Crucial Conversations: A Panel Discussion and Forum on LGBTQ+ Suicide Awareness and Prevention brought community leaders and mental healthcare experts together on March 23, 2023, at Story Louisville to assess the problem and the risks within the Louisville Community.  Problems highlighted in Kentucky include high suicide rates, too many people without health insurance, no health literacy, lack of access to programs and providers who can help them, as well as gaps in follow-up mental health care.  “I wish people knew they are making it harder than it has to be. I wish people could see it as a healthcare issue that could save lives,” pleaded Dr. Christopher Peters, medical director of Norton Children’s Behavioral and Mental Health Clinic.  “We are still unraveling how the pandemic is playing out in youth. What happens when we put a pause on a crucial developmental time? They have anxiety, and depression, so access to more treatment is absolutely needed.”  The community is struggling to meet the needs of citizens and Kentucky’s youth are being impacted most.”  “They believe in Frankfurt that acceptance is killing kids, that we are the problem. They want to shove us back into the closet,” said panelist Chris Hartman, Director of the Fairness Campaign. “The bills are geared towards eradicating the LGBTQ presence… The worst bills are concentrated in the Deep Red South. It’s no surprise because they see more queer youth than ever before that they think we are recruiting.”  Panelist Carmellia Jackson Hurley, Executive Director of Louisville Girls Leadership, ensured, “These kids know themselves better than anyone else. I wish people knew the students know themselves better than we ever could. And I wish we could just help and guide them.”  “There’s a belief that the LGBTQ community is indoctrinating our youth,” said Hartman. “No, queer people have always been there… The actions in Frankfurt are teaching children to demonize another community.”  Essentially the laws being passed serve to legalize bullying. Many of the bills are often dubbed “Parents Rights Bills” and are touted as ways to protect children, but whose children are they protecting?  At a student-led rally in Frankfort, a Kentucky student who tried to take their own life publicly pleaded with the crowd and lawmakers to not pass a law that would subject others to more suffering. A 2022 survey conducted by The Trevor Project’s 2022 revealed 50% of LGBTQ teens seriously considered attempting suicide and 18% (twice the rate of non-LGBTQ teens) did attempt suicide.  “People in Frankfurt don’t know any queer people. They are making these laws so they can put a bullet point on their postcard to send out in the fall. They know it will score them cheap, easy points. Is a 3% bump worth a kid’s life? It’s not worth one single life,” said Hartman.  “Queers Gathering joyfully is going to prevent suicides… They want to eliminate the places where we gather joyfully. Events are getting get canceled because of threats of violence… If they’re racist, they are going to be transphobic and homophobic. It goes back to the intersectionality of racism, sexism, homophobia.”  Over the past year, protesters in Kentucky were often met by supporters of the anti-trans bill, like Conservative Family Foundation, who show up and hold their own rallies alongside protests. The Family Foundation and other supporters of the bill say it protects children from “irreparable harm” and safeguards parents’ rights.  “SB 150 will protect the lives of Kentucky children by setting policy in alignment with the truth that every child is created as a male or female and deserves to be loved, treated with dignity, and accepted for who they really are,” Family Foundation leader David Walls said in a statement, calling the override “a win for children and their parents in Kentucky.”  The panel also expressed the need for more spiritual and religious leaders to speak out. These hateful worldviews often have an underpinning of religious views.  “We must make people own up when they are not supportive,” encouraged Hartman. “If that’s how you feel, own it. Say it. Call them out. Don’t allow others to be compliant.”  Other potential solutions to the current disconnect in our city include pooling of resources.  “Louisville is a resource-dense area, but nobody knows. Here in Louisville, people are stuck in their own silos; everyone is doing the same thing. We need to step up and build community, maintain community and put egos aside,” said Jackson-Hurley.  Another step in the right direction is the 911 diversion program where people can call 911 and get someone other than the police with firearms to show up and help.  “We’ve got to make ourselves available and be a lifeline to others when they need it so that they can be there for us when we need it,” Hartman said.  “How can we help folks feel less isolated, rejected? How can we help people who have a mental diagnosis receive help and treatment? How can we keep weapons locked up and put away so those at risk have less access to the things that can kill them?” Peters asked.  Some of the reasons why people commit suicide are because ‘they feel rejected and isolated. Mental illness impacts how they see themselves and the world around them.”  Commuter cities and sprawl cities like Louisville suffer from the dynamic where nobody knows where the resources are.  When asked what can we do to combat this, the panel encouraged the public to share Fairness Campaign posts, articles and other information on social media to amplify what’s going on. Use your point of privilege and create a space of grace.  The panel was hosted by Queer Kentucky, in partnership with the Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness Division of Suicide Prevention, The Big Stomp, The Fairness Campaign, and Louisville Girls Leadership.  The results of this session will be shared with the Suicide Prevention Department of Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness. They will guide Queer Kentucky on implementing two public events addressing this topic.

"suicide","2020-11-07","Not Discerned","{""Manville"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:05:00","When Manville schools shifted to virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 17-year-old Myles Fitzpatrick came out as transgender and began transitioning from female to male, according to a lawsuit filed this month on his family’s behalf.  But when in-person learning resumed the following school year, the lawsuit charges Fitzpatrick was harassed, intimidated and bullied by other students because of his gender identity, and school officials did nothing to help, causing Fitzpatrick’s death by suicide on Nov. 7.  Fitzpatrick’s mother, Danielle Warshefski, is now suing the Manville school district for negligence – alleging officials failed to stop the bullying.  “Fitzpatrick has been severely injured as a result of such harassment and discrimination that he suffered physical and bodily injuries, severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, anguish, personal hardship, social disruption, psychological and emotional harm, and other such damages which ultimately led to plaintiff Fitzpatrick taking his life as a result of such harassment and discrimination,” the lawsuit filed May 2 in Superior Court of Somerset County.  The students harassed Fitzpatrick by calling him “f*****,” referring to him as “she”, attempting to make a mockery of his gender, pushing him into lockers, and telling Fitzpatrick that he would never be a male, the lawsuit said.  R. Daniel Bause, the attorney representing the family, did not return requests for comment. But he told mycentraljersey.com, “In our opinion, the current system let Myles down, and we look forward to proving the allegations contained in the lawsuit to hopefully effectuate positive change in that regard.”  Manville Superintendent Jamil Maroun said in an email that he could not comment on pending litigation.  “Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving for Myles’ family, the students who were his friends, and the staff members who taught him,” he said.  Fitzpatrick, whose family said in his obituary enjoyed exploring the woods, hiking and camping, was one of four students whose deaths by suicide have made headlines in recent months following allegations of bullying at school.  The others include Jack Reid, who died by suicide on April 30, 2022, at The Lawrenceville School after students bullied him and spread false rumors about him across campus. The school has acknowledged that it failed to protect Reid as part of a settlement in the case; Adriana Kuch, who died by suicide on Feb. 3, days after a video of four classmates attacking her spread around Central Regional High School in Bayville; and Felicia LoAlbo-Melendez, who died by suicide on Feb. 6 after bullying at school, less than two weeks after the death of her father.  One member of the LGBTQ community called Fitzpatrick’s death a tragedy.  “We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of Myles,” said Christian Fuscaraino, the executive director of Garden State Equality, which uplifts the diverse voices of LGBTQ+ communities through education and advocacy. “No student should ever have to face bullying or harassment based on their gender identity.

"suicide","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:18:26","Being a star comes with a package deal. The moment you become a star, your life does not remain private anymore. Haesoo, a 29-year-old Korean trot singer, has died by suicide in her dormitory on May 12, leaving behind a suicide note. The news of her passing spread quickly among her fans, fellow musicians, and industry insiders, who expressed their condolences on social media.  Back home, after Deepika Padukone’s confession on her struggle with depression, many came out talking about their mental health issues. Actor Tiger Shroff also underwent severe depression after the release of ‘A Flying Jatt’. Shah Rukh Khan also landed up with depression after his shoulder injury. It was also found out after the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, how he too struggled with mental health problems.  According to WHO, which estimates around 20 percent of youth, who suffer from mental health yet, this is just the recorded ones and if we can think about the ones which have not been recorded where I see the numbers increase. Social norms have created more struggles in balancing the physical and psychological health.  The numbers are increasing with cases such as parental pressures, the social pressures to “fit in”, social media and its demands, addictions and peer pressure, disturbed family environment and many more reasons to trigger mental health.  Padma Rewari, Psychotherapist from Mumbai says, “You are scrutinized for every act, every behaviour and never left to be a normal person. This pressure often leads to anxiety, depression, stress and other mental health issues. The celebrity status also makes them lonely and have the fear of missing out(FOMO) where competition and comparison are their daily challenges.”  The stigma around mental health  Physical health is always taken well in society and people will rush to a doctor and spend money. The myth around mental health and the acceptance around it still needs a makeover.  Say Rewari, “People are still not ready to seek professional help and use it as last resort when things turn chronic and so many times leading to suicide. How often as mental health professions we feel this could have been prevented if only the person got help in the right time. The reasons mental health is still not addressed in the global platform is the stigma attached, lack of efficient resources, myth around medication.”  Investing on mental health are some concerns to ponder on and change the mind-set. One would easily talk about suffering from diabetes but one would never openly share about having OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) or anxiety attacks  Rewari explained that due to the environmental triggers, the mental health issues have risen beyond control. The need of the hour is promoting and providing services. Educating hospitals and promoting mental health professionals in corporates, media where there is lot of pressure. I would also encourage stars and celebrities to have personal counsellors appointed and put therapy sessions on priority.  The mental health awareness has improved way beyond what existed years ago. But there has to be a complete global and consistent support and the support systems reaching each part of the society. Mental health hospitals (more in numbers) for chronic patients, addictions, other mental health disorders that need hospitalization in affordable prices.  The pressure of social media and mental health  Youth today are triggered more by social media. They are impatient, restless and peer pressure adds on to their anxiety levels. They want to achieve success before time and failing to do so they are frustrated and depressed. This often leads to addictions. The pressure is built with in and the competition around them. Life style also has a major contribution to play here.  Rewari explains that celebrities and stars who look and sound extremely happy have committed suicide in the past or have had suicidal tendencies. They often tend to supress their emotional pain, stress and anxiety, depression. It is very difficult to quote underlying issues that would have caused the person to end his or her life. So often they seek the solace by substance abuse, alcohol which gives them temporary relief. For them it is a competitive world which they are aware and the society that weighs their success over their failures. This pressure on public versus private life makes them feel helpless at times, leading to depression and that their value in society has no meaning leads to suicidal tendencies and suicide. Families and friends here must immediately seek professional help instead of waiting.  Mental health is as important as physical health  Garnering celebrity peer support works wonders and people should meet on such platforms to share and care. Like the way, Deepika Padukone started her mental health foundation (LLL) and similarly such platforms should be an investment for stars and celebrities to help society and their fellow members in general. The stigma around mental health needs to change. This can only be done by sensitizing, promoting and making it available.  Effects of mental health Issues:  Feelings of anxiety, concern, rage, despair, numbness, or frustration  Appetite, energy, desire, and interest changes  Having trouble focusing and making judgments  Nightmares or issues falling asleep  Physical symptoms include aches and pains, stomachaches, rashes, or headaches  Chronic health issues and mental health concerns becoming worse  Increased alcohol consumption, use of illicit substances and abuse of prescription medicines.

(KELO) — South Dakota had the fifth highest rate of suicide in the U.S. in 2021, according to the CDC.  The state Department of Health says more than 200 South Dakotans died of suicide that year.  Early numbers show suicides were down in South Dakota last year from that 10-year high.  Joel Kaskinen is trying to save lives through his work.  He’s the community engagement manager at Lost&Found, a suicide prevention organization.  He found himself here after working in higher education in Colorado.  “I lost three students to suicide in one year’s time, and I was a first responder to a student suicide. I was there when it happened, witnessed it, performed first aid,” Kaskinen said.  He decided to turn the pain and trauma into action.  “If I can talk about suicide and mental health awareness every single day, my hope is that I’m reaching at least one person through my daily conversations,” Kaskinen said.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month.  Karla Salem is an integrated health therapist with Sanford Health.  “We all have our time that the life just gets too much for us. There’s too much going on, it’s overwhelming, it’s sad, all of those things, but when you start feeling those things on a more regular chronic basis, when you just don’t find as much joy or happiness, you don’t find relief from your pain, those are kind of the indicators that things are getting kind of bad,” Salem said.  Salem says that’s a good time to reach out for help from a medical provider, family, or friend.  Meanwhile, Kaskinen is doing everything he can to stop more tragedies from happening.  “Suicide is preventable, and if we raise awareness of mental health challenges and the warning signs from people who are facing these challenges of feeling suicidal or having ideations if we can normalize those conversations and realize that everyone is just going through a tough time and there is help there and we can prevent this, that’s our goal,” Kaskinen said.  If you’re struggling with mental health or having thoughts of suicide, call 988.  You can find more resources at the Mental Health Fair this Saturday at Levitt at the Falls.

Trinity Health Michigan is joining a new nationwide network of hospitals collaborating on suicide prevention that will test methods to detect suicide risk in patients and connect them to the care they need.    Research shows nearly half of people who die by suicide interact with the healthcare system in the month before their death, providing a critical opportunity to save lives.    Julie Goldstein Grumet is the director of the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center. She says healthcare providers will use evidence-based methods to detect suicide risk and collect real-time data, as they would with other health concerns. Grumet said “We get our blood pressure and our weight just to kind of check there’s not an underlying issue – and we need to do the same when it comes to suicide. We need to ask at every visit, every person"".    Grumet added when interventions are used properly, hospitals can reduce suicide rates of people in their care by up to 75%. She said it’s always important to ask people directly if they are considering suicide, and advise them to contact the nationwide Suicide and Crisis Hotline at 9-8-8.    Over the next 14 months, participating hospitals will test and refine innovations to improve the care provided to patients at risk of suicide.    Melissa Tolstyka is the director of behavioral health services at Trinity Health in Ann Arbor and says utilizing the best practices will build confidence in hospital staff that they're providing the best care. She said ""You know you can always ask the question, are you feeling suicidal? But when someone responds, yes, what’s that next step? What can you do to put that patient at ease but also what can you do to feel confident that you can have that conversation?”. Tolstyka says data collection will be imperative to the new network's success and will help staff adjust their methods and treatments along the way.    The latest data reveals suicide claimed roughly 48,000 lives in 2021.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndobWkuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS90cmluaXR5LWhlYWx0aC1ob3NwaXRhbHMtc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The bodies of Parth Gandhi, 49, and his son, 16, were found on Saturday morning at the offices of Psychedelic Therapy and Research in Salt Lake City, KSLTV reported.  Gandhi worked at the offices as a neuropsychologist and clinic director with a “focus on psychedelics,” the outlet said.  It is unclear exactly what psychedelic therapy involves, or if the clinic advocates the use of illegal substances.  It is also not yet known if psychedelic drugs or other substances were present in Gandhi’s body or that of his son, who has not been named due to his age.  “Our detectives right now, they’re still developing more information trying to figure out, trying to answer the question of what may have motivated him to do this,” Brent Weisberg of the Salt Lake City Police Department told KSLTV on Monday.  Parth Gandhi, 49, was found dead on Saturday. Parth Gandhi/Facebook  The outlet noted that Gandhi mentioned remedies for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse on social media.  He also posted on Facebook in Dec. 2022 to celebrate his son’s musical abilities.  “Just reeling over it — I’m in utter shock.

Henderson Detention Center located at 18 East Basic Road, Thursday, August 3, 2017. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)  A wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of a man who killed himself at Henderson Detention Center alleged that the jail should not have removed him from suicide watch.  Jason Foy, 38, was found hanging inside his cell on April 25, 2021. He was taken to Henderson Hospital where he later died.  After his arrest on April 23, Foy told the officer taking him to jail that he wanted to kill himself. After being booked, Foy was placed on suicide watch, according to a complaint filed in District Court last month.  ‘I’m sick of this’  “You’re going to have something else on your hands because I’m going to (expletive) hang myself,” backseat video captured Foy saying to a police officer. “I’m sick of this.”  The next morning Foy was cleared by a social worker and removed from suicide watch.  At around 2:40 p.m. on April 25, Foy was found hanging during a cell check.  The Clark County coroner’s office said Foy died by hanging and ruled his death a suicide.  Foy was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and depression and was not provided adequate mental health treatment while in custody, according to the complaint.  Arrest details  According to a Henderson Police Department arrest report, Foy was arrested for misdemeanor assault against his girlfriend, who reported to police that Foy was prone to fits of sudden rage. She said Foy came home drunk and threw a water bottle at her. Foy then threw a door that was off its hinges down a hallway, shattering an overhead light in the process.  Body-camera footage from an officer who responded to the call showed officers asking Foy to tell his side of what happened. Foy said he defused the situation by going into his room to sleep and said telling his side wouldn’t help because he would be going to jail either way.  “I’m not going to have a story because this keeps going on and on,” Foy said. “I’m out on bail right now for the same exact thing.”  A note addressed to his girlfriend was found in Foy’s cell with the words “Waiting to Die,” on it, according to a Henderson police incident report.  Surveillance footage from inside Henderson Detention Center on April 25 shows Foy in a common area by himself standing and then sitting before going into his cell. After some time, an officer walks through looking into the doors of the other cells. The officer stopped at Foy’s door and soon after, several officers and medical personnel run into the room.  According to an incident report, Foy attempted to make five phone calls that were denied before going back into his cell to hang himself.  The report said officers continued to do routine checks of Foy’s cell after he was cleared from suicide watch. Police noted that Foy had been placed on suicide watch at Henderson Detention Center in 2016, 2020 and 2021.  The city of Henderson, the Henderson Police Department, former Police Chief Thedrick Andres and Naphcare, Inc. were named as defendants in the case.  Naphcare contracts with Clark County to provide services to people detained at Henderson Detention Center, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit alleged a deprivation of civil rights, negligence, wrongful death and discrimination based on a disability.  When reached for comment Wednesday, George Hand, an attorney representing Foy, said, “We’re just relying on the facts in the complaint at this time.”  City of Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said the department and city could not comment on pending litigation.  Naphcare could not be reached for comment.  If you’re thinking about suicide, or are worried about a friend or loved one, help is available 24/7 by calling or texting the Lifeline network at 988.

Four people linked to the gunman and suspected of involvement in the attack have so far been arrested, the private Mosaique FM radio reported late Wednesday.  Tunisian officials have denounced the attack as ""criminal"" but refrained from referring to it as a ""terrorist"" operation which would imply anti-Semitic motives.

Following a thorough investigation, which included review of security camera footage, crime scene analysis, and witness interviews, OSI confirmed that on May 8, 2022, off-duty New York City Police Department (NYPD) Officer Sean Armstead shot and killed Edward Wilkins in a parking lot on Route 211 and committed suicide immediately after.  On the night of May 8, 2022, Mr. Wilkins was driving westbound on Route 211 in a black sedan when his car was hit by a Dodge Charger driven by Officer Armstead. When the cars came to a stop, Mr. Wilkins got out of the sedan and began to run away. Officer Armstead got out of his car to chase Mr. Wilkins. He shot Mr. Wilkins multiple times in the parking lot of a Buffalo Wild Wings before shooting himself in the head. Mr. Wilkins and Officer Armstead were both pronounced dead at the scene. Responding officers recovered Officer Armstead’s service weapon at the scene.  A full review of the evidence supports the conclusion that Officer Armstead was responsible for Mr. Wilkins’ death. OSI uncovered no evidence indicating that any other person was involved in the homicide. Therefore, there is no basis on which OSI could seek charges against any living person in this case.  Executive Law Section 70-b directs OSI to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute offenses arising from any incident in which the death of a person is caused by a police officer, whether on or off duty. When OSI does not or, as in this case, cannot seek charges against the officer, Section 70-b requires OSI to issue a public report describing its investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYWcubnkuZ292L3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy9hdHRvcm5leS1nZW5lcmFsLWphbWVzLW9mZmljZS1zcGVjaWFsLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tcmVsZWFzZXMtcmVwb3J0LWRlYXRoLWVkd2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""AnnArbor"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:40:56","Legislation in Michigan to ban mental health professionals from performing conversion therapy on minors under penalty of losing their licenses will be introduced this week.  Conversion therapy, the practice of intervening to alter an individual’s gender expression or sexuality to conform to heterosexuality, involves psychologically damaging processes, bill sponsor Rep. Jason Hoskins (D-Southfield) told the Michigan Advance. On Thursday, Hoskins said he, along with other representatives and members of the state Senate, will introduce bills to protect minors from such practices.  “At the end of the day, this is really torture for kids,” Hoskins said. “You’re growing up, you’re figuring things out and I think children should have that opportunity to do that.”  LGBTQ youth who were put in conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide than their peers who had not been through conversion therapy, according to research from The Trevor Project and published in the American Journal of Public Health.  Many major health organizations oppose conversion therapy.  Since 1998, the American Psychiatric Association has opposed conversion therapy and said in a statement on its website that, “gender diverse patients have been shown to benefit from gender-affirming therapies.”  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said not only is there a lack of evidence conversion therapy works to the desired effect, but, “…there is evidence that such interventions are harmful. As a result, ‘conversion therapies’ should not be part of any behavioral health treatment of children and adolescents.”  Currently, 21 states have a ban on conversion therapy for minors, and Michigan is one of four states that have a ban on using federal or state funds for conversion therapy on minors.  Conversion therapy is an “abusive practice” and must be stopped for the benefit of all Michigan residents, Equality Michigan Executive Director Erin Knott told the Michigan Advance in an emailed statement Wednesday.  “So-called conversion therapy is a dangerous and discredited pseudoscience that frequently leads to depression, decreased self-esteem, substance abuse, and even suicide,” Knott said. “Equality Michigan calls upon the Legislature to protect our youth and their families from this deceitful, denigrating, and lethal tactic, and take the necessary action to ensure Michigan becomes the 22nd state to ban this barbaric practice.”  Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive directive banning state and federal funding for the practice in 2021, calling conversion therapy harmful and a barrier for LGBTQ+ Michiganders from reaching their full potential in the state.  “Since day one, I have made it clear that hate has no home in Michigan,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing her directive in 2021. “The actions we take today will serve as a starting point in protecting our LGBTQ+ youth from the damaging practice of conversion therapy and in ensuring that Michigan is a reflection of true inclusion.”  Similar legislation has been introduced in the past in Michigan but hasn’t made it through the previously Republican-led legislature.  Now, with a Democratic majority in the state legislature that recently passed legislation that was signed into law to expand Michigan’s civil rights laws to include protections for LGBTQ+ rights, Hoskins said public perception of LGBTQ+ individuals is changing and he’s confident the legislation will pass.  “One of the issues with conversion therapy is that it is something that was put in place because there’s an idea that LGBTQ people need to fit in, that there’s something wrong with them, and that unfortunately helps discrimination flourish when you think you have to be fixed,” Hoskins said.  Hoskins said he’s partnering with Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and Rep. Felicia Brabec (D-Pittsfield), who in 2021 introduced a ban on conversion therapy. Those bills were never voted out of committee.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbWljaGlnYW5hZHZhbmNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L21pY2hpZ2FuLWxhd21ha2Vycy10by1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtbGVnaXNsYXRpb24tYmFubmluZy1jb252ZXJzaW9uLXRoZXJhcHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Col. Michael J. Kennedy said as he spoke to a gathered crowd on base.  Monday kicked off National Police Week in Alaska and around the nation. President John F. Kennedy proclaimed May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day in 1962 and the week on which that day falls as Police Week.  The week has been used to honor law enforcement members who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This year, the 673d Security Forces Squadron also chose to remember those who lost their lives to suicide.  “It’s definitely an emotional day. We’ve got to remember all the lives that have been lost in the line of duty. Those who haven’t made it to the end of their watch,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Taylor Davis said. “In the last seven years, we calculated the numbers — there’ve been 1,981 lives taken in the line of duty, or lost by death or suicide.”  Kicking off at noon Monday, service members honored the lives of those fallen by running around the Elmendorf Fitness Track for 24 hours carrying a guidon, a flag bearing the name of the squadron.  Throughout the day, service members will hand off the guidon as it continues to make its way around the entire track — all day, never stopping.  “There as a symbol, have it moving is a dedication to what we are doing here this week,” Davis said.  It’s an opportunity to reflect on the lives lost, Kennedy said. In the past, Kennedy said he has participated in it.  This year, he planned to participate as well and run with his family.  “Obviously, I lost friends in security forces. I lost a lot of law enforcement friends as well,” Kennedy said. “It’s an honor, it’s really humbling. It’s a somber experience.”  As the troops click off laps around the track carrying the guidon, remembering the names of the fallen and their stories, they continue to move forward together and never forget those who lost their lives.  “We remember the courage with which they worked and lived,” Kennedy said. “And may we recommit ourselves to the mission to which they dedicated their lives.”  Copyright 2023 KTUU.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:17:23","(Geber86/E+ via Getty Images)  Lesbian and bisexual women may be less likely to have ideal heart health scores than heterosexual women, according to new research. Gay or bisexual men, however, scored higher than their heterosexual peers, but only if they lived in urban areas.  The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, measured cardiovascular health among lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual adults in France using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, a set of lifestyle behaviors and factors for good cardiovascular health.  The metrics encourage people to be physically active, eat a healthy diet, sleep seven to nine hours each night, manage their weight, avoid tobacco products, and to control blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.  ""Improving these metrics is a great opportunity to prevent heart problems before they happen,"" Omar Deraz, the study's lead author, said in a news release. Deraz is a researcher with Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, and the Paris Cardiovascular Research Center's Integrative Epidemiology of Cardiovascular Disease Team.  The study is the first to measure cardiovascular health disparities using Life's Essential 8 among gay, lesbian and bisexual people, researchers said.  The study included health data from about 169,400 adults in France – including nearly 91,000 women – who participated in the nationwide Constances study. Participants did not have cardiovascular disease and had an average age of 46.  Among the women, 93% identified as heterosexual; about 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 0.61% identified as lesbian. Among the men, 90% identified as heterosexual; 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 3% identified as gay. About 3% of all participants declined to answer questions about their sexual orientation.  After adjusting for variables such as family history of cardiovascular disease, age and social factors, the researchers found that lesbian and bisexual women had lower cardiovascular health scores compared to heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men living in urban areas scored higher than heterosexual men, whereas those living in rural areas had lower cardiovascular health scores and were less likely to reach ideal cardiovascular health.  Compared to their heterosexual peers, lesbian women scored lower for healthy diet and blood pressure. In contrast, bisexual women had higher scores for healthy diet and nicotine exposure.  Previous research shows LGBT adults are less likely to access health care and more likely to delay treatment than heterosexual adults. Deraz said it is essential to recognize and overcome barriers to health care access.  ""Improving cultural competency and awareness of cardiovascular disease risk among sexual minority adults may help to improve conversations between doctors and patients about cardiovascular health,"" he said.  The study's authors said, citing previous evidence, that LGBT populations disproportionately experience depression and attempted suicide. These have been linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Discrimination and violence fueled by bias, and increased societal stressors, also may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors, including increased alcohol use, smoking and a sedentary lifestyle.  In the study, lesbian, gay and bisexual adults overall reported anxiety disorders, depression symptoms or attempted suicide more frequently than heterosexual adults. However, lesbian women less frequently reported anxiety disorders and depression symptoms compared to heterosexual women.  In a 2020 scientific statement, the AHA noted that LGBTQ adults experience significant psychosocial stressors that compromise their cardiovascular health.  Because France is a high-income country that offers universal health care insurance, the researchers cautioned that their findings may not apply to other countries. The study, they said, also is limited by its single focus on assessing cardiovascular health by sexual orientation, and that heart health data was unavailable for those who identified as transgender.  Even so, ""it's important research into a population that is grossly underrepresented in clinical and epidemiological studies,"" said Dr. Connie Tsao, attending staff cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who was not involved in the new study.  ""To fully address discrimination and disparities that impact health, we must better recognize and understand the unique experiences of all individuals and populations, including sexual minorities,"" she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYXJ0Lm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbGVzYmlhbi1hbmQtYmlzZXh1YWwtd29tZW4tbWF5LWhhdmUtd29yc2UtaGVhcnQtaGVhbHRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-16","21:00:00","{""Brownville"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:01:00","PILLAR POINT, New York (WWNY) - Police describe “bullets whizzing past us” and diving “behind the patrol vehicles for cover” during Tuesday night’s standoff with a Pillar Point man.  The suspect, 45-year-old Nathan Krump, is charged with first-degree attempted murder. Following his arraignment Wednesday in Watertown City Court, 7 News obtained multiple pages of police statements.  In those pages, members of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and New York State Police recount their harrowing experience of being shot at, taking cover behind a trooper car that was hit by a bullet, watching a house go up in flames, and tasing the suspect to take him into custody.  Deputy Humberto Perez reported that he was sent to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6:15 p.m. to check on a person who lives there.  “The caller was advising that a Nathan Krump was making suicidal/homicidal posts on Facebook and he believed that suicide by cop may be part of his plan,” Perez said.  After getting to the home, Perez was joined on the scene by Trooper Derrick Leonard.  Perez reported that Krump, while holding a white object, began yelling at him to get off his property “or I’m going to shoot you” and also, “You’re going to get killed.”  (Other police later said the white object appeared to be a rifle with a white stock.)  “Nathan then raised the object at me with one hand and I heard a gunshot,” he said. “I heard Trooper Leonard call out over the air that Nathan had just shot at me.”  Perez said he and Leonard used the trooper’s patrol vehicle for cover while waiting for more police to arrive.  Once other law enforcement officials got there, Perez said, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  In his statement, Trooper Leonard described how he and two other troopers were positioned behind doors of a marked police vehicle.  “I heard several shots fired, at least three of which were fired at our position. Two of the rounds went over our heads and one round struck the windshield” of the police vehicle.  Police said they repeatedly tried to make contact with Krump through the PA system, but he didn’t respond.  The sheriff’s department’s SERT (Special Emergency Response Team) arrived on the scene with its MRAP armored vehicle and began to advance toward the place where Krump was holed up.  Deputy James Randall said he heard several rounds “striking what I believe to be the residence behind me.”  He said he and another deputy went to the neighbor’s home to evacuate the people who live there. While crossing their yard, Randall said, “More shots were fired in our direction.” He reported that he fell and sprained his ankle.  The other deputy, Jeffrey Froelich, said Randall provided cover for him as he helped evacuate a couple and their dog to safety.  During this time, Deputy Froelich reported seeing fire at the home where Krump had been.  “The residence was now fully engulfed and propane tanks attached to the house went up in flames and created a huge fireball,” he said.  Police reported the heavy smoke made it difficult to see  Deputy Matthew Young stated he saw a man, later identified as Krump, driving a tractor toward a state police vehicle. He reported it over the police radio and “the SERT team took the subject into custody...using a taser.”  According to a statement by Detective Jay Morrow of the sheriff’s office, Krump’s tractor hit and injured a deputy.  Young said Krump was escorted in handcuffs to his patrol vehicle.  “I removed the taser probes from his body and collected them as evidence,” he said.  Young stated that emergency medical personnel evaluated Krump and cleared him.  Krump was then taken to the county jail, Young said.  Copyright 2023 WWNY.

Australian Ambassador to the Philippines HK Yu PSM said “Australia recognizes the value of addressing the mental health concerns of the Filipino people that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with DOH, WHO, and other UN agencies through Project BRAVE, to deliver mental health services to communities – especially to women, children and adolescents – through capacity-building and development initiatives.”  Representatives from public and private media organizations, DOH media partners, and regulatory bodies discussed best practices for reporting on suicide incidents, including respecting one’s data privacy, eliminating graphic details and focusing only on factual information, using non-judgmental language, and providing trigger warnings and helpful information with every story. Mental health experts also stressed the importance of taking a suicide-prevention approach to avoid copycat incidents.  Given that suicide remains one of the most pressing health issues in the world, and evidence shows that media portrayal and reportage can contribute to preventing suicide risks, in March 2022, DOH released Administrative Order (AO) 2022-0004 on the Guidelines for Responsible and Ethical Portrayal of Suicide in Media, Audiovisuals, and Films. The AO outlines concrete actions to encourage responsible reporting and portrayal and establish mechanisms to gain feedback to prevent suicide and further harm due to unethical coverage.  Furthermore, the WHO Mental Health Report 2022 states that globally, one in every 100 deaths is by suicide, and it is the leading cause of death among adolescents. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) found that the suicide rate in 2020 increased by 57.3% from the previous year (4,892 individuals), with the highest numbers coming from the 15 to 29 age groups.  “Suicide is preventable with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Our vision is a world where death by suicide is no longer a leading cause of death and where people who are attempting or thinking about suicide feel comfortable seeking help which is provided capably and respectfully to all. We need a Mindful Media environment to reach our goals to prevent suicide and suicide attempts,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.  The DOH, through the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH), has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns. The 1553 hotline is a Luzon-wide, toll-free landline number.

These are important jobs that make good careers in public service. In honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.”  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) spoke on the floor today in honor of Police Week, calling on her colleagues to pass her bill, the Invest to Protect Act, which will set aside crucial funding specifically for small police departments across the country.  As the former top law enforcement official in Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto has been a leading advocate in the Senate for our police officers and is part of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. Last year, she secured historic funding for the Byrne JAG grant program, the leading source of criminal justice funding in the country. Her bipartisan bills to combat the crisis of law enforcement suicide and provide mental health resources to police officers have been signed into law by presidents of both parties. Cortez Masto recently reintroduced the BADGES for Native Communities Act to support the Bureau of Indian Affairs with law enforcement recruitment and retention.  Below are her remarks as prepared for delivery:  M. President, we observe Police Week every year to honor the men and women who risk their lives each day for the safety of our communities. As we go about our daily lives, our police officers are the ones protecting us and our families.  They know that this job puts their lives in danger. And their families know that every day when their loved one leaves for work, they may not come home. It’s a sacrifice for the individual getting up and leaving that house, and it is a sacrifice for the loved ones watching that individual leave.  Why do I know that? Because I’m married 25 years to a federal law enforcement officer now retired. And I remember in the middle of the night when he was on call, and he got that call, and his boots were by the side of the bed, slips his feet into them, and walks out that door.  And every spouse, every loved one who sees them leave has always in the back of their mind, “Are they going to come home?”  And so, this is important that we recognize the men and women who are representing and protecting our communities every single day.  I’ve been honored to work with Nevada’s police officers throughout my career. I have worked with police departments across my state to crack down on crime, prosecute offenders, and keep Nevadans safe. Not only have I worked in my state as a prosecutor, I’ve worked here in the District of Columbia, in the United States Attorney’s Office as a prosecutor.  I’ve witnessed the hard work and dedication of our police officers firsthand, whether you’re a state police officer, a local city or county police officer, or a federal officer. I have worked alongside them. I know what they do day in and day out. And that’s why my role in the Senate will always be to fight for our law enforcement.  It’s been my priority to listen to the needs of police departments throughout Nevada, both big and small, to ensure I’m doing everything I can to get them what they need to protect our communities. That includes securing funding for more resources, improved technology, and better training for our officers.  Last year, alongside Senator Grassley, I was proud to make sure Congress passed the biggest increase in Byrne JAG funding in ten years. And to help put an end to tragic law enforcement suicides, I introduced and passed legislation to increase data collection on suicide and support peer counseling programs that can improve police officers’ mental health.  Now, while these investments are so crucial to ensuring our officers are prepared for the job, far too many smaller police departments just can’t compete with their larger counterparts for resources. I know this from our law enforcement agencies in my rural communities in Nevada. Our law enforcement communities in our rural areas, which are much smaller, have to really fight for resources that they need. Over 90% of police departments nationally, including several in Nevada, have fewer than 200 full-time officers.  That’s why I’ve worked with Senator Grassley to introduce the Invest to Protect Act. This legislation would set aside grant funding specifically for smaller local police departments, including Tribal law enforcement, to ensure they can access the resources they need to keep our families safe.  Police officers in both Northern and Southern Nevada have told me about how hard it is to do their jobs when they’re short on personnel. They’re stretched too thin, and that makes it harder for them to protect our communities and their own lives.  The Invest to Protect Act will help these police departments with recruitment and retention so they have enough officers to serve their communities. These are important jobs that make good careers in public service.  So, in honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3J0ZXptYXN0by5zZW5hdGUuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvZHVyaW5nLXBvbGljZS13ZWVrLWNvcnRlei1tYXN0by1jYWxscy1mb3ItaW5jcmVhc2VkLXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLWxhdy1lbmZvcmNlbWVudC1vbi10aGUtc2VuYXRlLWZsb29y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

ABC11 is helping to decode the difference between mental health and mental illness. As the terms are used more and more, many may still wonder what they mean or what the difference is.  ""Mental health is what we all have,"" said WakeMed psychiatrist Dr. Nerissa Price who describes mental health as a continuum. Something that's always there -- whether it's positive or negative.  ""It has to be really intentionally looked after,"" Dr. Price said. ""You don't just wake up having good mental health.""  Silent Struggle: ABC11 to host town hall aimed at combating youth mental health  Mental health, at its best, you're excelling: joyful, energetic, high-performing at work or school. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may be in crisis: extremely anxious, not sleeping, perhaps thoughts of suicide. Those are serious signs of mental illness.  ""There's a lot of complexity that goes into us developing mental illness that we don't fully understand,"" said Price.  Being aware of the triggers can make a huge difference. Sometimes it's genetics, a family history of mental illness or substance use disorder or unresolved stress: a death, financial problems, divorce.  But 75% of mental illnesses begin before the age of 24 -- triggered by a childhood trauma that's never been confronted.  ""It's so important to reach the child, the teenager, the young person to help them to identify when these symptoms may begin to help get them treatment at those early stages,"" Price said.  SEE ALSO | 'Pivotal moment for action.' Mental health crisis among teens mounts as stakeholders ask for help  Among the coping strategies Dr. Price promotes, resilience is a key component. It's your ability to recover when adverse things happen.  ""Resilience can be taught. Resilience can be learned,"" Price said. ""Just in the same way you can learn to strengthen your physical body, you strengthen your mental body.""  Price agrees it's possible to have good mental health even if suffering from a mental illness.  ""Absolutely,"" she said. ""In fact, there are treatments that are really successful in helping people with mental illness and they work so well and can get people back on track to have the fullness of their life.""

She said don’t underestimate the value of social interactions.  “The social-emotional system is running rampant,"" Oyen said. ""We do a lot of what we call reward seeking, so when you are beyond the age of 10 there’s a dip in your dopamine. Dopamine is the thing that makes you feel good when you get rewards. That’s what’s happening – you get that reward seeking – but what’s so fascinating about adolescents is you mostly feel those things in the presence of peers. There is a lot of perhaps misperception that is happening for our adolescents, and they really are perceiving that they are feeling quite isolated.”  Dr. Wallace Jackman with Avera said there are tangible effects to social media use.  “There’s a direct link between the amount of time folks spend on social media and their distress level, anxiety and depression,"" Jackman said.

On the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, we reaffirm our commitment to this ongoing work and stand with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people around the world.    More than 30 years ago today, thanks to the tireless advocacy of LGBTQI+ activists the World Health Organization took the long overdue step of declassifying ‘homosexuality’ as a mental health disorder. Since then, we’ve seen real progress—including a powerful movement for LGBTQI+ liberation, more protections for LGBTQI+ people, and more spaces that recognize and affirm that our diversity is our strength. But sadly, we continue to see reminders of how much work remains. More than 60 countries still criminalize homosexuality and some are considering even more draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation. Some governments continue to classify LGBTQI+ individuals as having a medical disorder or permit the use of so-called “conversion therapy”—a dangerous and discredited practice that blatantly violates human rights and causes significant harm, including high rates of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors among LGBTQI+ youth. And right here at home, violent attacks on LGBTQI+ individuals and community spaces have risen dramatically, and more than 600 hateful laws have been introduced this year targeting the LGBTQI+ community, particularly youth.    That is why, during my first month in office, I signed a Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World to combat criminalization, protect vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees, and build international coalitions to fight against discrimination. Last June, I signed an Executive Order directing my Administration to work to prevent the use of so-called “conversion therapy” in the United States and around the world. We have also launched a new Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally to ensure that our efforts to confront the scourge of gender-based violence addresses the unique risks and barriers for LGBTQI+ people. And, my Administration continues to engage with governments, faith leaders, families, and communities around the globe to protect and promote respect for human rights—including LGBTQI+ rights.    Here at home, we’ve also worked to advance equality and equity for LGBTQI+ Americans. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ citizens in housing, health care, education, the criminal justice system, and more. We have made strides in ensuring that transgender and non-binary Americans can access accurate federal IDs and vital government services—from emergency homeless shelters to Social Security benefits. The Department of Justice is responding to discriminatory state laws that violate the rights and freedoms of LGBTQI+ youth and their families. And, I am proud to have appointed a historic number of proud LGBTQI+ public servants, including the first openly gay person to serve as a Cabinet Secretary, the first two openly transgender Americans to ever be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and the first openly lesbian American to achieve the rank of Ambassador.    All of us have a responsibility to speak out and stand up against hate and violence in any form. When the rights of any group or individual are under attack, it endangers our own freedom, and the freedom of people everywhere. So today, let us join together across our country—and around the world—to stand with the LGBTQI+ community. Let us renew our work to combat homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia—and put an end to the harmful violence and discrimination that stems from it.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9zdGF0ZW1lbnQtZnJvbS1wcmVzaWRlbnQtam9lLWJpZGVuLW9uLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZGF5LWFnYWluc3QtaG9tb3Bob2JpYS1iaXBob2JpYS1hbmQtdHJhbnNwaG9iaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:46:29","Researchers from the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health released a set of state-based policy recommendations to address the intersection of alcohol use and firearms.  Alcohol plays an outsize role in firearm fatalities. An estimated one in three individuals who committed homicide with a firearm had been heavily drinking when they murdered their victims. More than 30 percent of gun homicide victims had been heavily drinking when they were killed, and a quarter of gun suicide victims had been heavily drinking before dying by suicide.  The report’s recommendations were developed with a steering committee of the Consortium for Risk-Based Firearm Policy, a group of leading experts that advances evidence-based gun violence prevention policies. The Consortium is led by Joshua Horwitz, JD, the Dana Feitler Professor of the Practice in Gun Violence Prevention and Advocacy and co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Bloomberg School.  The report, “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy,” focuses on two policy areas: limiting access to firearms by a person with a documented history of alcohol misuse, such as driving under the influence, and restricting firearms at locations where alcohol is consumed. The authors based their recommendations on the latest available research on alcohol use and firearms as well as comprehensive reviews of state laws.  “The intersection of alcohol misuse and firearms can have devastating consequences,” says Silvia Villarreal, director of research translation at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions the report’s lead author. “These recommendations provide specific guidelines for states to limit access to firearms and address the risk of dangerous behaviors when the two are combined.”  Federal law does not address the risk of alcohol and guns, and many state laws are ambiguous. Some states prohibit possession of guns using unclear criteria such as “habitual drunkard,” or “while intoxicated.” Bringing a gun to a place where alcohol is present is legal in many states but prohibited in others. Some states exempt concealed carry permit holders from laws prohibiting firearm possession in places where alcohol is consumed.  To limit access to firearms by an individual with a history of alcohol misuse, the authors recommend that states focus on individuals with a history of driving under the influence or other documented alcohol misuse. The authors recommend that states pass laws that prohibit the following for at least five years:  The purchase and possession of firearms by an individual convicted of two or more instances within a five-year period of driving under the influence of alcohol or driving while intoxicated.  Obtaining or possessing a concealed carry permit—a license required to carry firearms in public—by individuals convicted of one driving under the influence offense, and/or documented with court records to have a recent history of alcohol misuse.  To limit access to guns when and where alcohol is consumed, the authors recommend that states pass laws prohibiting public carrying or possession of firearms where alcohol is consumed, including bars, restaurants, sporting arenas, and outdoor festivals and other events. Some states already have laws that restrict firearm possession in places such as bars and restaurants; however, concealed carry permit holders are often exempt from these laws.  The report also includes additional policy considerations, including:  Limiting the number of alcohol retailers in a particular area through licensing and zoning regulations.  Limiting the hours and days when alcohol can be served.  Increasing the price of alcohol by raising taxes.  “Firearm policies aimed at reducing harmful outcomes due to gun violence do not operate in a vacuum,” says Horwitz. “We must take into consideration the environment where alcohol is sold and consumed to limit the risk of potential violence.”  The report is aimed at researchers, practitioners, policymakers, law enforcement professionals, and others working to address gun violence.  “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy” was written by Silvia Villarreal, Amy Barnhorst, Richard Bonnie, Kami Chavis, Ari Davis, Shannon Frattaroli, Kelly Roskam, Jeffrey Swanson, and Joshua Horwitz.

Established to recognize students for their positive efforts in raising awareness, affecting change regarding mental health, and breaking down its stigma, Jain was one of five students selected out of 300 applicants. NSHSS, the organization that awarded Jain the scholarship, is an honors and scholarship program co-founded by Claes Nobel and James Lewis.  He received a $2,000 prize.  Jain harnessed artificial intelligence, according to a news release, to detect suicidal messaging in social media posts. The AI would then connect that user in crisis with help. He called his non-profit SuicideWatch.  In 2021, Jain worked with friends to develop an automated system that reads Twitter posts and flags suicidal messages. In 2023, they worked with mental health nonprofits, police departments, and crisis hotlines across the nation to provide help to the suicidal individuals they detect. In total, Jain has connected 600+ social media users with six mental health support partners, including Texas Health and Human Services.  In December, Google executive Kelley Gibson reached out to Jain. As a result, Google is exploring making SuicideWatch an internally funded, tax-free charitable nonprofit, connecting Lavik with research fellows experienced in suicide detection technology.

Shobhit Mahajan, a professor of astrophysics at Delhi, said that a particularly bad appointments backlog at the institution – which is one of India’s largest, with 80 colleges and about 700,000 students in total – has resulted in an acute situation.  “In DU, there were no permanent appointments for over a decade and more in some of its constituent colleges,” he said.  While a particular factor at Delhi, temporary employment is commonplace in India’s public university system, which includes upwards of 50 central universities and hundreds of state institutions, he said.  “In many state universities…there is a problem with permanent appointments since these are usually centralised for the whole state, which means a lot more bureaucracy and procedural issues,” Professor Mahajan said.  For displaced ad hoc lecturers, employment prospects at other public universities are slim, and teachers are “left to fend for themselves”, he said.  Times Higher Education has contacted Delhi University for comment. A registrar at the university previously told Indian media that there was no provision under India’s regulations for the absorption of ad hoc teachers.  Those who are made redundant are unlikely to rebuild careers in academia, although they may go on to teach in smaller private universities or in cram schools that prepare students for India’s hypercompetitive university entrance exams, he noted. “They will, of course, not get paid as much, nor will they have the prestige, but it is possibly better than starving.”  Apoorvanand, a Hindi professor at Delhi University, worried about the rapid review process preceding layoffs.  Describing the current approach at many colleges – in which expert panels take just a few minutes to assess ad hoc faculty – as a “farce”, he said it was common knowledge that the list of permanent appointees was largely predetermined ahead of time.  “If it’s only two to three minutes, it hardly matters who’s asking the questions,” he said, adding, “the list is known to those appearing for interviews”.  While he sympathised with the plight of ad hoc instructors, he cautioned that not all of them had been well suited for their jobs.  In many cases, he said, the “loyalty” of candidates took precedence over who was best qualified for the job, with principals or teachers’ associations pulling for politically like-minded employees to be hired.  He urged greater scrutiny of recruitment decisions. “It’s for the college to explain: why did you continue to employ them for years if they were not very capable? If you found them fit to teach for eight to 10 years, why is it that now you don’t find them fit for a permanent position?”  Professor Apoorvanand said political parties, which have a strong presence on India’s campuses, viewed academic vacancies as a “golden opportunity” to get loyal supporters into teaching posts in many colleges. He warned that, if successful, such a large-scale push could lead to disastrous consequences for the institution.  pola.lem@timeshighereducation.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzaGlnaGVyZWR1Y2F0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbGhpLXN1aWNpZGUtcmFpc2VzLWFsYXJtLW92ZXItbWFzcy1sYXlvZmZzLWFkLWhvYy1mYWN1bHR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","1991-10-05","Not Discerned","{""ElkCity"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:50:00","Brock became a suicide intervention counselor for farmers in the 1980s when she and her husband noticed a need in their community after losing their Lincoln County farm.  During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.  People can visit the dedication display for Mona Lee Brock and learn more about her legacy at the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry building.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtnb3Uub3JnL29rbGFob21hLW5ld3MvMjAyMy0wNS0xNy9va2xhaG9tYS1mYXJtZXJzLWFuZC1yYW5jaGVycy1ob25vci10aGUtbGF0ZS1mYXJtZXItYWR2b2NhdGUtbW9uYS1sZWUtYnJvY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For Alaskans aged 15-34, the most frequent cause of emergency room visits and hospitalizations is motor vehicle crashes. (Dean Swope/KYUK)  Alaska’s death rate from traumatic brain injuries – or TBIs – is the highest in the nation. That’s according to a recent report from the Alaska Health Department.  Dr. Katherine Newell is an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assigned to Alaska. She put together the report.  “The fact that one in four deaths in Alaskans aged under 30 was related to a TBI is a shocking statistic and so many of these deaths are preventable,” said Newell.  Traumatic brain injuries range from a mild bump on the head to a deadly punctured skull. The report looked at rates of emergency room visits, hospitalization, and death for TBIs over five years–from 2016 to 2021.  Suicides and accidental falls caused the most TBI deaths in Alaska. And Newell said there was a lot of variation by age group.  “For older adults aged over 85 years, 72% of TBI-related deaths were due to unintentional fall, whereas in younger adults, the largest proportion of deaths were due to suicide,” said Newell.  According to the report, Alaska Native and American Indian people were disproportionately likely to have serious or deadly traumatic brain injuries — at a rate three times higher than the national average.  Vehicle crashes seriously injured or killed the most young adults. And for people in Northern Alaska, ATV and snow machine accidents were likely to cause serious head injuries.  Over 40% of deaths due to traumatic brain injury were suicide by firearms. In Alaska, suicide rates are higher for young men, age 25-34, and Native Alaskans and American Indian people.  Newell says traumatic brain injuries can have lasting effects, so prevention is the only real cure.  Because the causes of TBIs vary so much, in the report, she suggests a variety of ways to prevent injuries.  “A good strategy is to think about how we are supporting our older community and our elders to prevent slips and falls, especially in the winter months,” said Newell.  The report mentions existing community programs that distribute ice cleats to elders. Other suggested interventions include firearm safety education, healthcare screenings for elders, and free helmet giveaways.  The report also found many people in Alaska had trouble getting care after they experienced a traumatic brain injury, usually due to cost or geography.

"suicide","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Monroe"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:07:38","The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Tuesday that would ban gender affirming healthcare for transgender youth.  House Bill 463, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed on a 71-24 vote. Rep. Joe Stagni, R-Kenner opposed the bill, while several Democratic lawmakers supported it.  The bill was passed with enough votes to withstand a potential veto. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has not said whether he will reject the bill if it ends up on his desk, but he has mentioned the recent onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation would have a negative impact on the already high suicide rate for transgender Louisianians.  When presenting his proposal, Firment pointed out several surrounding states have passed similar bans, arguing that Louisiana needed to do the same or else become a “destination for these type of procedures across the entire South.”  Other gender-affirming healthcare bans have been the subject of federal lawsuits. Similar restrictions in Alabama and Arkansas are currently blocked from taking effect pending a court judgment.  Speaking to colleagues on the floor, Firment shared several pieces of misleading or incorrect information, claiming the treatments are experimental and that minors in Louisiana are being sterilized.  “Why are we aggressively treating a social contagion with experimental treatments?” Firment asked.  The American Academy of Pediatrics supports gender-affirming healthcare, and the American Medical Association does not consider it experimental. Minors also rarely undergo surgical procedures, including top surgery, which adds or removes breast tissue, or bottom surgery, which constructs either a vagina or a penis.  Firment’s claims received bipartisan pushback.  “We want to talk about parental consent, but we want to talk about what other kids and their doctors do,” Stagni said, arguing the bill flies in the face of parental rights.  Rep. Joe Marino, I-Gretna, also took to the floor to give a speech in opposition to the ban.  “If this is really about protecting kids, why are we ignoring lots of things that protect kids?” Marino asked. “Gender-affirming care for transgender kids reduces depression, reduces suicide and other devastating consequences.”  Studies indicate approximately 80% of transgender youth have considered suicide, and 40% report at least one suicide attempt. Research also indicates gender-affirming healthcare leads to improved mental health outcomes.  Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, argued the bill is unconstitutional because it specifically targets transgender minors. The ban has exceptions for puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatments for cisgender youth.  The bill will next be heard in a Senate committee.  Firment’s proposal is the third piece of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation to clear the House.  House Bill 81, by Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, would forbid teachers and other school employees from using transgender minors’ chosen names and pronouns. The bill was advanced from the House last week.  Another proposal, House Bill 466, by Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, was also advanced from the House last week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9sb3Vpc2lhbmEtaG91c2UtcGFzc2VzLWJhbi1vbi1nZW5kZXItYWZmaXJtaW5nLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtZm9yLW1pbm9ycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A CDC report found nearly three in five teen girls in the U.S. felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021, which is an almost 60% increase in the past decade.  The data also revealed 24% of high school girls had seriously considered suicide.  ""I see it everywhere, so no it doesn't surprise me,"" said Zanaya Bailey, a 16-year-old student at Everman High School. ""Because it's everywhere.""  Bailey is a member of her school's Hope Squad, a peer-to-peer suicide prevention program.  ""It's easier to talk to somebody that's your age because they might have gone through what you've gone through or they can relate to it,"" said 16-year-old Kayla Graham, another member of Everman High School's Hope Squad.  Both girls have listened to classmates who were struggling and connected them to trusted adults who could help.  ""Our Hope Squad members are the eyes, ears and maybe even heart of a school,"" said Kristi Wiley, the director of programs for the Jordan Elizabeth Harris Foundation, which has helped set up Hope Squad in 114 schools across 20 districts in North Texas.  Forty more schools plan to implement the program this fall.  Wiley said Hope Squad has saved countless lives.  ""When we can be direct about suicide and say, 'I saw you post this – are you thinking about suicide?' what we know is that it lowers anxiety, opens up communication, and reduces the change of a suicidal act,"" she said.  Initiating conversations about mental health and suicide is hard, but psychologists said they're key to reaching young people dealing with anxiety and depression.  ""People do want to be there for you,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Newton, who also serves as the Chief Medical Officer at SonderMind. ""As lonely as it may feel sometimes, it's not something that will last forever, and someone can help you.""  That support from someone at home or at school can make young girls feel less alone.  ""Now students, they know I can have somebody I can talk to, I have somebody I can go to for this, I don't have to do it alone, there's people I can trust,"" Bailey said. ""We provide that.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an “absolute miracle.”  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  “He drove off. He’s depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. “He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.”  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil’s Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.

Statement from Casey Pick (she/her), Director of Law and Policy for The Trevor Project:  “LGBTQ young people in Florida deserve the same opportunity to lead happy, healthy lives as their peers. As the world recognizes International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, we are outraged to see Florida’s governor continue to cruelly target LGBTQ young people by signing this slate of harmful bills into law.  The Trevor Project’s research found that 45% of young LGBTQ Floridians have seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% have made an attempt. These young people are not inherently prone to suicide, but rather, placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society. These anti-LGBTQ laws target the very things that we know can support and uplift LGBTQ young people – such as affirming environments at school and in the community, education about their identities and history, and best-practice healthcare.  For LGBTQ young people in Florida and across the country who might feel scared or stressed by this news – we see you. The Trevor Project is here to support you 24/7, and we will never stop fighting for your right to be exactly who you are. We will continue working with our partners and allies on the ground to push back against these dangerous policies.”  Relevant Research  The Trevor Project’s 2022 U.S. National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health by State found that 45% of LGBTQ youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% made an attempt. 54% of transgender and nonbinary youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 1 in 5 attempted suicide.  At a national level, The Trevor Project’s data has found that 60% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, and those who have reported higher rates of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who have not.  Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies, and nearly 2 in 3 said that hearing about potential laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school made their mental health a lot worse.  A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who experienced bathroom discrimination had more than 1.5 times the odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not experience bathroom discrimination.  Research has found that learning about LGBTQ people or issues has been associated with significantly lower odds (23%) of a past-year suicide attempt in LGBTQ students.  According to The Trevor Project’s latest polling published in Jan. 2023, 86% of transgender and nonbinary youth say recent debates about state laws restricting the rights of transgender people have negatively impacted their mental health. A majority of those trans youth (55%) said it impacted their mental health “very negatively.”  However, research also shows that transgender and nonbinary youth who have access to gender-affirming spaces report lower rates of attempting suicide.  A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in Transgender Health, also found that transgender and nonbinary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from adults and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year.

(Photo Credit: Troy Darr) VIEW ORIGINAL  SEMBACH, Germany – David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shared his journey from mental “hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  Bartley said his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011.  “That was the day I was going to kill myself,” said Bartley. “That's the day that I call the monster convinced me of two sets of things.  “On the first hand, that I was worthless. I was useless. I was stupid. I was pitiful. I was grotesque. I was ugly. I was an embarrassment and a burden. Nobody said these things to me, and yet I believed those to be true, and if that wasn't enough, the straw that broke my spiritual, my mental and psychological back was on that day what I believed to be true was, if I killed myself, well, there's no way I could be selfish, because everybody would be better off without me.”  Bartley told the Soldiers that his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011, but his story started long before that.  Bartley’s father committed suicide when Bartley was seven years old. His older brother enlisted in the Army and raised him like a father. Bartley’s story might have started on that day.  Or maybe his story started the first time he thought that life was more difficult to live than to die.  David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shares his story from “mental hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. See the one-hour executive presentation at https://youtu.be/zf_9JWhsWr4.  “Please know I did not have a death wish,” said Bartley. “Now that may seem contrary. The three-headed monster is depression. It's trauma. It's suicidal ideation. That was this thing that was convincing me of all these lies that I took as true.  “So how can you say, if you admit you had suicidal ideations, that you didn't have a death wish?  “What I'd say is they're not the same thing. There was a chasm between a death wish and a suicidal ideation. I desperately wanted to live.  “The majority of the people … don't want to die, but what happens is, in that moment when a person is making sure the noose is going to hold tight, when they have calculated that I have to take enough of this to wash down with that, they're there for the sole reason that life has become more difficult to live than it is to die.”  Or maybe his story really started when he was 11-years old, and a youth organization leader repeatedly sexually assaulted him.  But his journey of survival started on Aug. 31, 2011, when convinced that everyone would be better off without him, Bartley drove to the Foresthill Bridge that spans the American River at a height of 730 feet.  He had left a note carefully placed in his vehicle to be easily found. It read:  -------------------------------------------------------------  To my beloved Deanna, my family, and friends,  I've decided that the time has come for me to go. I am choosing to end my life, so I can be free of the pain in my heart and soul, the betrayal of my mind and the depth of self-hatred that I feel most every moment of every day.  I have become the burden I wish I never would and a drag on those around me.  I'm a damaged shell and just a little boy, not yet close to what a man should be.  Everyone, yes, everyone I know will be much better off without me.  I am so incredibly sorry.  David  -------------------------------------------------------------  Bartley told the story of how a sheriff’s deputy found him standing 730 feet over the river thinking about how much he would miss his wife and the life they created together running an animal rescue shelter, A Chance for Bliss, in California.  “The sheriff's deputy approached me from the left-hand side and did the thing that is the foundation of this new set of beliefs for me,” said Bartley. “He created a connection.  “Connection is not just this broad conceptual thing. It is tangible. It is actual. We all know this to be true because when we connect with another person, we are seen, we feel heard, and we feel valued.  “Connection creates hope. Hope is a weapon. It's not just this cute cuddly thing. It is tenacious. It is the single greatest form of ordnance against this monster called suicide because hope saves lives, because in the moment … it can rob the monster of oxygen,” he said.  Bartley told the Soldiers of a series of scientific tests from the 1950s involving drowning rats. Rats placed in a bucket of water would drown in minutes, but rats that had previously been rescued from the bucket would continue to swim for days based on the hope they would be rescued again.  He said he believes the way the Army teaches suicide prevention; indicators of potential suicide behavior, intervention strategies, and services and resources available for people with suicidal ideations, is not as effective as what he came to realize on that day, Aug. 11, 2011.  “Making someone feel valued is the foundation of great leadership,” said Bartley and explained that more importantly making someone feel valued is the Army’s greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  Bartley said when he talks to people about suicide, he likes to describe four things he calls “the why, the feeling, the cause and the healing.”  He said asking why is a waste of time.  “A lot of people kill themselves, and what I like to say with all due respect, we have no idea why. We think we do,” he said. “Kay Redfield Jamison is an extraordinary researcher and has had her own suffering with bipolar (disorder). Here's what she says.  “Each way to suicide is its own: intensely private, unknowable and terrible. Suicide will seem to its perpetrator the last and best of bad possibilities and any attempt by the living to chart this final terrain of life can only be a sketch, maddeningly incomplete.  “We're asking the wrong question,” said Bartley. “If I had time, I would have every one of you take a piece of paper and write the question Why? on it, put a big X through it, and put it in a shredder.  “It is a totally useless question because every why requires justification. We're not going to ever answer the question. What we need to do is determine the foundation that caused somebody to kill themselves.”  Bartley said that why requires a logical answer, and people don’t commit suicide for logical reasons.  “People don't kill themselves because of what they think. What pulls the trigger finger back towards a person is a feeling. It's emotions. People kill themselves because of how they feel not because of what they think.”  Bartley said the starting point for suicidal ideations. The cause is likely some sort of trauma which he describes as “severe lasting emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.”  But the solution, the healing, is not based on the why or the feeling. It’s based on hope. And hope is based on connectedness. And connectedness Bartley said comes from being “seen, heard and valued.”  A search of the internet turns up thousands of self-help pages on improving social connectedness and developing a culture of connection in organizations.  During his presentation, Bartley discussed how he makes connections in his everyday life and how the sheriff’s deputy made a connection on that Aug. 31, 2011, day that literally talked Bartley off the ledge.  “I’m a freak about names,” said Bartley.  Bartley said he uses people names to make connections, and he has an acronym PARA he uses as a memory aid to talk about how he uses people’s names to make connections.  PARA stands for pause, ask, repeat, associate. During his presentation Bartley spoke about people he has connected with recently, Amanda, Steven not Stephen, Sarah, Mikael, and the importance of using people’s names to make a connection.  “When you see somebody with a name tag at the DFAC (Dining Facility) or the commissary,” said Bartley, “when a server comes up and they say ‘Hi, what can I get for you?’ you say wait, what's your name, because when you don't call them by their name, they're basically a thing.”  Bartley describes that as the pause and the ask. Then you repeat the name.  “Hi, Amanda. My name's David. You're new here.”  The associate part of PARA can be as simple as recognizing that someone is new, asking the spelling of the name, or asking where the name comes from.  Bartley talked about a senior officer he met in Alaska named Jody. Jody was not happy about his name growing up until when he was older his father told him he was named for his father’s friend who died fighting in Vietnam.  Bartley said that people suffering from depression, people considering suicide as their best option normally cannot create connectedness with those around them. But those around them are able to create connectedness by making them feel seen, heard and valued.  “Feeling seen, heard and valued creates connectedness,” said Bartley. “Connectedness creates hope,” and hope is the greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  And that, said Bartley, is exactly what happened on Aug. 11, 2001, as Bartley leaned over the rail of the bridge with almost half his weight over the rail. This is what the sheriff’s deputy said to create connectedness and give Bartley hope.  “I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. I get a sense you’re suffering.”  “Would you please tell me, because I would imagine you're feeling depressed, would you please tell me what does it feel like when you're depressed?”  “Wow, man. Thank you for sharing that. It had to be tough. When you feel like that, what's it like on your very, very worst days?”  “Gosh, I was just thinking. That's your worst day. Hey man, well, what's it like on your best day?”  “Wow, that'd be amazing. Wow, thank you. Thanks for sharing. That makes me feel good.”  “Hey, have you ever thought, well, what do you want the rest of your life to be like?”  With that question, Bartley said he felt seen, heard, and valued, and he shifted his weight back to the safe side of the bridge.  Earlier in the presentation Bartley asked the Soldiers in the crowd how many had lost someone to suicide. He also asked how many had seen the indicators of potential suicide behavior.  He said people with suicidal ideations are very good at hiding the indicators. He said the Army should be more focused on creating connections rather than recognizing the indicators of potential suicide behavior as the key to preventing suicide.  “Making the connection opens a door,” said Bartley, “because we’re not going to see the signs.  “This last quote puts this whole thing together so much more beautifully than I can,” said Bartley. “Drew Ramsey is a psychiatrist who specializes in suicide. Forget everything I said. Please take these words because it applies to every single one of us every single day. Here's what he says.  “Someone you see today is thinking about killing themselves. Your smile, your question, your love, you know what, it could save them. You know how I know? They told me it did.”  To see Bartley’s one-hour executive presentation go to the U.S. Army NATO YouTube page at www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf_9JWhsWr4 or click below.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjY2Nzc2L21lbnRhbF9oZWFsdGhfYWR2b2NhdGVfc2hhcmVzX21lc3NhZ2Vfb2ZfaG9wZV93aXRoX25hdG9fc29sZGllcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She has a keychain with various mementos that remind her of important events or people in her life.  In other ways, Maddie has had different experiences than her peers. She's transgender, and was outed by a local television news station while in the carpool line in the first grade. WUNC is not using her last name because she's a minor. Maddie and her family have been forced into advocacy more than they might have liked, but she's not about to back down.  ""I do just want to be a kid. I do just want to be at home watching movies and stuff like that. But also I have to fight,"" she says. ""I have to fight because people are trying to take stuff away from me that doesn't even involve them. Like, you are like a 70-year-old man. You do not need to be taking rights away from somebody who's 15-16 years old.""  Yet that's exactly what is happening around the United States and in North Carolina. According to the Trans Legislation Tracker, the number of trans-related bills introduced nationally in 2023 is nearly four times the amount from 2021. In North Carolina, there have been a dozen bills introduced this year that activists say target transgender people. Earlier this month, one of those bills passed a House health committee at the state legislature with no discussion, leaving some in the audience aghast.  Critics of House Bill 808 protest in the committee room after House Health approves the Youth Health Protection Act without hearing from any members of the public, due to the committee running out of time. The bill was taken up last with about 15 minutes left. #ncga #ncpol pic.twitter.com/OJWdaw8aAk — Avi Bajpai (@avibajpai_) May 2, 2023  Maddie wasn't at the legislature that day, but says she feels the impacts.  ""It hurts to be taken down by people who don't even get it,"" she says.  Some pieces of legislation would restrict health care available to transgender kids. They could even penalize health care providers for certain kinds of care. Any kind of limits on care — like access to hormone therapy or puberty blockers, or limits on insurance coverage for gender-affirming care — would impact Maddie and others in her position.  ""I've said it a million times, I don't know if I would be here if I wasn't like this,"" she says. ""It's life-saving stuff. People are so much happier when they realize who they really are.""  Health experts echo Maddie. Studies show that two-thirds of all transgender people thought about suicide before transitioning.  ""We have a lot of patients who self-harm. Cutting and burning and things like that,"" says Dr. Deanna Adkins, a pediatric endocrinologist who works with transgender youth.  She says there's a misunderstanding over what gender-affirming health care even is. For example, proposed legislation in North Carolina would ban gender transition surgery for anyone under 18. But Adkins says surgeries on minors happen only in the rarest of cases.  ""Someone who is already trying to cut their breasts off, or cut their penis off,"" she says. ""We would much rather have a surgeon, who knows what they're doing in a safe environment, do that, and keep that patient alive.""  Adkins says most gender-affirming care includes a lot of talk therapy, or simply working with parents to help them navigate what their child is going through.  ""Even just using [preferred] name and pronouns can reduce suicidality by half,"" she says.  In some cases, and only after months or years of talk therapy, doctors will prescribe puberty blockers. That's prescription medication to temporarily suppress puberty. Adkins says only later do teens start with hormone therapy, where they receive either testosterone or estrogen.  ""We're not putting them in a — as has been indicated — a pathway the minute they come in and say, 'This is what's going on with me,'"" she says. ""Everyone's pathway is totally different. Some get puberty blockers, some don't. Some stay on, some go off.""  Supporters of stricter rules around gender-affirming care say they want to protect children and keep them from doing something drastic they will regret later in life. As transgender rights have received more political attention lately, there has been an increase in claims that people regret a gender transition and then choose to stop treatment or detransition.  Courtesy Katie Jenifer / Katie Jenifer, right, with daughter Maddie at the N.C. General Assembly  Health experts say it's important to understand any case where a patient is unhappy with their care, but say that focusing too much on detransitioners misunderstands how care is delivered. It's not like getting a tattoo on spring break. Anything that dramatically changes a person's body happens only after years of therapy and with multiple medical providers signing off on treatment.  Maddie's mom, Katie Jenifer, says she thinks the latest rounds of legislation are simply aimed at ""othering"" people.  ""Maddie said something as a joke to me the other day, but it really struck me. She said, 'How am I supposed to live, love, laugh under these conditions?'"" she says. ""How is she supposed to? When she constantly has to worry about what rights they're going to take away next. How are they going to target her next? And for what reason? She's not doing anything or hurting anybody. She's just trying to be a kid.""  The legislature has moved fast on some of these bills, meaning they will likely pass some versions this year. Governor Roy Cooper has signaled he will veto some of these bills, but with strong majorities in both chambers, Republicans have a good chance of overriding those vetoes.

"suicide","2017-10-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:09:00","State lawmakers are again considering a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe lethal medications at the request of terminally ill patients.  The proposal — referred to as medical aid in dying by supporters and assisted suicide by critics — is a perennial and emotionally charged subject of debate in the General Assembly.  In the eight years since state Rep. Paul Baumbach first introduced the proposal, some lawmakers have confronted the difficult end-of-life decisions at the heart of the bill themselves. Two weeks before a Tuesday House committee hearing, state Rep. Kevin Hensley – previously an opponent – helped his terminally ill mother secure a prescription for medication to end her life in California.  But the arguments surrounding the measure remain largely unchanged. For those with terminal illnesses like Dawn Lentz, it offers the option to avoid a prolonged and painful death.  “When it comes down to it, it must be me who will ultimately answer to my creator,"" she told the House Health and Human Development Committee on Tuesday. ""I don’t know if I will use this option, but I do know that I have the right.”  Sue St. Laurent, another supporter of the bill with a terminal illness, says she only remains active because of a $15,000-per-month medication. If the nonprofit assistance that helps her afford the medication were to dry up, St. Laurent says she would want the option to request medication to facilitate a faster death. ""I want the right to make my own decision about my life,"" she said.  Baumbach echoed the same reasoning, underscoring that the bill includes guardrails to prevent patients from being coerced into using the lethal medications. Those guardrails include a requirement that patients go through two waiting periods before receiving their prescription; their attending physician or nurse practitioner must also offer the patient opportunities to rescind their request. The bill would only allow people with a life expectancy of six months or less to request lethal medication.  Opponents include some disability rights groups, who argue that while Baumbach's bill explicitly prohibits requesting lethal medication ""solely because of the individual's age or disability,"" other states that allow medical aid in dying — namely Oregon — have expanded eligibility to include some disabilities; they worry that Delaware could follow the same path.  The bill has also drawn firm opposition from the Delaware Psychiatric Society. Former Psychiatric Society President Neil Kaye argues physicians’ life expectancy estimates for terminally ill patients are too unreliable to use as the basis for life-or-death decisions.  “This bill requires physicians to inform patients of their end-of-life expectancy,"" he said. ""We can’t do that with 50 percent accuracy — that’s like monkeys flipping quarters. How can we be asked to help a patient decide to commit suicide instead of seeking additional treatment and compassionate palliative care?”  Kaye also pointed out that Oregon has repeatedly updated the drug cocktail prescribed to people with terminal illnesses — a process he characterized as ""unmonitored experiments"" by physicians who aren't trained on how to quickly and painlessly facilitate death.  Other critics note that medical aid in dying generally relies on drugs produced by compound pharmacies — meaning they are not tested and approved by the FDA.  While the Delaware Psychiatric Society remains opposed to the bill, many of the state's other medical organizations — including the Delaware Association of Nurses and Delaware Healthcare Association — have changed their position on the subject. The Delaware Medical Society, for instance, shifted from opposing the bill to a policy of ""active neutrality"" to reflect divided opinions among its members.  Meanwhile, Delaware Association of Nurse Practitioners spokesperson Susan Conaty-Buck testified in support of the bill on Tuesday, attempting to assuage concerns that medical professionals might pressure patients to choose lethal medications over longer-term palliative care. ""It's not an opportunity to rush a person to death,"" she said. ""It's an opportunity for me to work with a patient and their family, to respect what they need and what they want.""  The bill would, however, allow healthcare providers to prohibit physicians from prescribing the lethal medications on their premises. If the bill becomes law, Baumbach says he does not anticipate that any Delaware hospital system would immediately allow its physicians to offer medical aid in dying. ""We fully expect hospitals to not allow this on their premises for at least five years,"" he said.  Once private practice physicians have time to demonstrate the safety of the procedure, Baumbach says he expects some hospital systems to come around. While Catholic hospitals cannot provide medical aid in dying in accordance with church doctrine, Delaware's largest Catholic hospital system — St. Francis Health Care — makes up a relatively small share of the state's total hospital beds and is not poised to merge with any competitors.  The bill passed out of committee with less opposition than in previous years, but no version of the bill has ever reached the House floor.

"suicide","2021-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Brighton"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:39:33","Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) have called for the introduction of a specific suicide prevention programme for the nursing workforce across the UK.  In an emergency resolution submitted at the RCN’s annual conference in Brighton, members called on RCN Council to lobby for the implementation of an evidence-based, integrated suicide prevention programme for the profession.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change"" Chantel Rose  Ruth Bailey, a nurse who presented the item, warned that nurses were working in settings where there had been an “explosion of poor mental health”.  Ms Bailey noted that while there were many examples of good practice, such as mental health first aid, access to staff counselling provision was “still inconsistent across the UK” and the incidence of suicide continued to rise.  She said: “We need a consistent and co-ordinated approach of an evidence-based suicide prevention programme, and we need the RCN to lobby for urgent action now.  “It is imperative that the RCN, as the voice of nursing, steps into this space and leads a co-ordinated UK response to this epidemic of distress and that it acts now to prevent further death by suicide in nursing and midwifery.”  Meanwhile, Chantel Rose, a registered mental health nurse, told RCN Congress that her workload was “getting harder and getting more distressing”.  She said: “Sadly I have more fellow nurses on my caseload than ever in my entire life.  “It breaks my heart that I could be next.”  Ms Rose added: “We can pull it back if council make a change – you’re doing it with pay [so] do it with suicide.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change.""  Separately, Eva Omondi, from the RCN Eastern region, said that the support system available for internationally educated nurses who were struggling with their mental health was the “bare minimum”.  She highlighted that during discussions about nurse suicide it was important to think about “the aggravating factors” which were specifically affecting internationally educated nurses.  One of the key factors she mentioned was how some internationally educated nurses have a lack of family in the UK to support them through poor mental health.  Meanwhile, Chloe Roberts, a student nurse and RCN ambassador, told RCN Congress that suicide was sometimes “a taboo topic” that people are afraid to talk about for fear of saying the wrong thing.  Ms Roberts, who lost her best friend to suicide two years ago, explained that she had taken part in suicide prevention training and called for the training to be mandatory for all NHS employees.  She said: “I urge you to support this resolution to help create change in our workforce, to make suicide prevention training course mandatory as congress you never know when this training could help you with the knowledge to save a life.”  The emergency resolution was backed overwhelming by RCN members, which could lead to RCN Council lobbying for a suicide prevention programme for the nursing workforce across the UK.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm51cnNpbmd0aW1lcy5uZXQvbmV3cy9udXJzZS13ZWxsYmVpbmcvbnVyc2VzLXNheS1wcm9mZXNzaW9uLW5lZWRzLXN1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudGlvbi1wcm9ncmFtbWUtMTctMDUtMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:13:00","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - When his grandfather tells the story of Mark Cook, the first thing he’ll mention is how Cook would always say “I love you.”  He’d do it all the time, Tom Abel says. He’d come in and raid the fridge for a soda and ice cream and tell his grandfather he loved him.  Cook would come home at night and say “I love you” before bed.  “What we miss about him is his presence,” Abel said. “His presence filled our households. Every chance he got, he’d be telling us ‘Grandpa, I love you, Grandma, I love you.’”  Abel says his grandson killed himself inside a cell at Lemon Creek Correctional Center.  According to the Department of Corrections, Cook was the third person to die while in custody this year.  Abel says his grandson had gone to a local clinic for treatment on his back — but the treatment didn’t work. It made the pain even worse, and Cook yelled and threatened to sue people. The pain was so intense Cook couldn’t walk and was screaming out in pain.  The next day he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor charges of trespassing and property damage. Abel says Cook was put in solitary confinement because of an issue with another prisoner.  Abel believes that while Cook was in custody, he didn’t get the proper treatment and the pain persisted. He says at one point even using the bathroom for Cook was unbearable.  Then, one day, Cook hung himself. Abel says he put tape over the room’s security camera and that it was 30 minutes before security guards found him.  “He was calling me every day and telling me what he was going through. He was, he was suffering and pain,” Abel said.  According to the Department of Corrections, 18 people died in custody in the year 2022. Of those deaths, seven were ruled suicides.  That’s an increase over the previous years — only two people died by suicide in 2021 and five in 2020, according to DOC.  The DOC says 65% of the inmate population have a mental illness, and 75 people work as contractors providing mental health services statewide to a total prison population of nearly 4,500 people.  “We are the number one mental health providers of the people of Alaska by default,” DOC’s Chief Mental Health Officer Lisa Guzman said.  A former mental health professional who worked with inmates says the DOC’s care of those experiencing a mental crisis within the system is lacking. Her identity is being protected due to concerns of retaliation against her.  “I’m there to help them with the mental health care part — they’re in jail, that’s taking care of the law part, I had nothing to do with their punishment. So I have every obligation to treat them as a patient. So in that sense, since I wasn’t actually able to treat them adequately, it felt really shameful,” she said.  “I often had patients that were suicidal, telling me that, you know, well, I get seen, you know, once a day for a couple of minutes. And I think that was a lot due to staffing,” she said.  DOC admits there isn’t enough staff.  “We have consistently tried to make improvements on services,” Guzman said. “And I think, that despite not having enough staff, despite still having positions open, we’ve continued to provide the essential services we need.”  Megan Edge, director of the ACLU of Alaska Prison Project, said the DOC lacks the ability to take care of inmates’ mental and physical health.  “I’ve heard a lot of nice things come out of the mouths of DOC executives and legislative budget hearings and confirmation hearings. But what I’m seeing actually happen inside of our prisons and jails is not reflective of those nice words. Those words are hollow,” Edge said.  DOC says it is participating in Project 2025, which is a national movement to decrease suicide in the U.S. by 20% by the year 2025.  “Corrections was one of the kind of target populations that was identified because suicide rates are high in corrections nationwide,” Guzman said. “And so we are actively participating in that, we’ve developed kind of a suicide prevention readiness checklists that we’re going to be trying to go to all the facilities and collect data on how we can make improvements and hopefully contribute to that project and decreasing suicide nationally.”  Guzman goes on to say that many of those incarcerated already have mental health issues that haven’t been addressed.  “We are managing a high volume of mentally ill people who are not getting the care they need,” Guzman said. “So as much as you know, they, they come into our system, and we treat them and then we send — we do as much release planning as we can — and we send them back out into the community. And then at times, they’re not getting that follow-up care. And so it’s kind of a — it can become a cycle.”  Edge says what’s happening now is essentially a bandage for a much larger problem.  “When you start to understand why people go in, let’s take, you know, the suicides last year, they’re all fairly young, many of them had complicated mental health issues. One person was experiencing homelessness. Prison is not a solution for public safety. It’s putting a Band-Aid on the symptom. That’s it,” Edge said.  Abel says his grandson, Mark was looking forward to the birth of his second child, who is due in the fall.

"suicide","2018-07-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:40:18","The Justice Department today filed a complaint and proposed consent decree with Cumberland County, New Jersey and the Cumberland County Department of Corrections to resolve allegations that conditions at the Cumberland County Jail violate the Constitution.  The proposed consent decree resolves the department’s claims that the jail fails to provide adequate mental health care to incarcerated individuals at risk of self-harm and suicide, and fails to provide medication-assisted treatment, where clinically indicated, to incarcerated individuals experiencing unmedicated opiate withdrawal. The proposed consent decree requires the jail to provide adequate mental health care and medication-assisted treatment in those circumstances.  “The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country, and under our Constitution, jails and prisons must provide adequate medical care to incarcerated individuals,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Today’s proposed consent decree is a significant step toward improving the care of individuals incarcerated in Cumberland County who are struggling with serious mental health disorders, and toward protecting the civil rights that are guaranteed by our Constitution.”  “This consent decree marks a significant milestone in the Justice Department’s efforts to combat discrimination against those with opioid use disorder and to protect the civil rights of people in our jails and prisons,” said Assistant Attorney General for Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Under this agreement, Cumberland County must provide adequate medical and mental health care, including access to life-saving medications, treatment for opiate withdrawal, and protection for those with a heightened risk of self-harm and suicide. We commend Cumberland County for working collaboratively with us to implement the reforms in this decree to protect the safety and constitutional rights of incarcerated people at Cumberland County Jail.”  “The opioid epidemic is a public health emergency that plagues too many communities across the country,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “Medications are a critically important tool in combatting the opioid crisis, and they save lives. By providing medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated individuals experiencing opiate withdrawal, officials at jails and prisons can take significant steps to both combat the opioid epidemic and protect the constitutional rights of their populations.”  In June 2018, following suicides at the jail by six incarcerated people denied medication-assisted treatment, the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey initiated the investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. That statute authorizes the Justice Department to address a pattern or practice of deprivation of constitutional rights of individuals confined to state or local government-run correctional facilities. In January 2021, the Department found reasonable cause to believe that Cumberland County’s failure to provide medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated people with opioid use disorder, together with its failure to offer adequate mental health and suicide prevention measures, violated the rights of incarcerated individuals. The Department also identified measures necessary to remedy the unlawful conditions.

He’s a horror-movie fan: His office décor includes a poster from “Halloween” and small figurines like Pennywise, Wolf Man and Stripe from “Gremlins.” With his patients (who don’t see him in his office), Bender plays the role of curious, open-minded confidant. By the time he gets to them, some children are, as he put it to me, “so done” — frustrated by school, parents, on-and-off-again friendships, romantic relationships, their lack of control over much of anything, life. “They are mad, so mad,” he says. One threw apple juice in his face; two girls threatened to kill him after they said they found his address on the internet. “I tell kids, please hate me if you need to,” he says. “I prefer you hate me instead of your parents.”  His goal is to understand how it feels to be them, not to tell them what they need to do. “When you can’t make sense of your despair, I can make sense,” says Bender, who has won several teaching and clinical-care awards. “Not ‘expert’ sense, but a realistic sense of what may be going on. I can help them feel contained and engage them. Or not react in the same way as their family. I’m not going to understand everything while they are here. But we can find a closer gray about what the real story is. And, hopefully, help parents do so, too.”  As he talked, more children were waiting at the hospital’s Psychiatric Emergency Services, six floors below. The PES (pronounced Pez) is the first stop when children and adolescents come to Western Psych’s emergency department after passing through security and handing over their phones and bags. To fill out forms, they have to use soft, bendable plastic pens, so they can’t harm themselves or others. (For the same reason, the bathrooms’ metal toilets have nondetachable seats.) TVs play cartoons, cooking shows, Hallmark movies. The only available phone is attached to the wall. Patients often spend hours in one of two pediatric waiting areas, sometimes wearing hospital gowns after having been transferred from another medical center. They sit in the blue-and-orange plastic chairs around a table with board games or in leather chairs that fold out to become single beds. Some patients stay overnight — or several nights — when Bender’s unit cannot accommodate them.  Psychiatrists at PES interview children and their parents (or other caregivers) separately, to figure out if the patients needs to be admitted or if a referral for outpatient care, which can include crisis services, will be enough. Most teenagers who experience suicidal thoughts don’t need to be hospitalized and most don’t kill themselves (about 2,800 did in 2021). Psychiatrists have to weigh the possible protective factor of admitting a child against the reality of limited beds and the fact that hospitalization can make anxiety worse, which can drive adolescents away from mental health care altogether.  Medical professionals use the word “suicidality” to refer to a range of thoughts and actions, from passive death wishes, like the desire to go to bed and not wake up, to more active thoughts and, at the most extreme, suicide attempts and death. Though we know a lot about some causes of suicidality — mood disorders, child abuse, substance use — experts don’t understand why the numbers have been rising, on the whole, over the last decade. Some blame social media, which can both deprive children of sleep — the lack of which is associated with increased suicidal thoughts — and increase loneliness and feelings of being left out (even as it offers helpful communities for children, especially those who feel marginalized). Since 2020, the pandemic has likely been another factor.  Systemic conditions can also fuel anxiety, anger, dread and, in turn, suicidal thoughts and actions among particular groups — Black children facing trauma and persistent racism, for example, or trans children forced to use the wrong bathroom for them at school and made to feel ostracized, unseen and alone. Rates of suicidality in both populations have increased in recent years. “Ignore the social and family context at your peril,” says Brent, who has tracked the rise in adolescent suicide for years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbWFnYXppbmUvc3VpY2lkZS10ZWVucy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-09-08","Not Discerned","{""Fairbanks"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:50:30","Funding for states, territories, and tribes will help build local capacity.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), today announced more than $200 million in new funding for states, territories, and tribes to build local capacity for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and related crisis services.  “Thanks to President Biden, we are finally and seriously saying to Americans struggling with their mental health: Support is Here!” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Support is here in 988, the three-digit Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, and this new funding reflects our commitment to strengthening the crisis care system across our country so Americans can get the care they need.”  The $200.15 million in new funding opportunities for the 988 Lifeline includes:  $177.35 million to states and U.S. territories to: improve local response; enhance recruiting, hiring, and training of 988 workforce; implement additional technology and security measures to support infrastructure and effectively coordinate across the crisis continuum; improve support and service for high-risk and underserved populations, including quality assurance and review of critical incidents; and develop and implement comprehensive communication plans,  $17.8 million to federally recognized Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to: improve response, ensure access to culturally competent 988 crisis center support, improve integration and support and ensure navigation and follow-up care, and  $5 million for 988 Lifeline crisis follow-up programs that will allow call centers to provide systematic follow-up of suicidal persons who reach out to the 988 Lifeline, enhanced coordination of crisis stabilization, including with 911 and emergency service providers, reduction of unnecessary police engagement and improved connections for high-risk populations.  The Biden-Harris Administration has made an unprecedented investment of nearly $1 billion to support the 988 Lifeline, including an initial $432 million to support the transition to 988 in July 2022, to build up crisis center capacity and to provide special services, including a sub-network for Spanish speakers. Additional funding for the 988 Lifeline has been provided by the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the federal FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Prior to this investment, the Lifeline, which existed since 2005 as a 1-800 number, had been long underfunded and under-resourced.  “The timely investments in the 988 Lifeline at the federal, state and local levels are helping ensure that many more people in crisis are getting the help and support they need,” said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Data continues to show an increase in overall calls, texts and chats from the year prior, and at the same time, answer rates are significantly improving, which means that more people are getting help and they are getting help more quickly, which is crucial for someone in crisis.”  Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most 988 Lifeline callers are significantly more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed, and more hopeful.  In 2021, according to SAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 4.8% of adults ages 18 or older (about 12.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide, and among adolescents ages 12 to 17, 12.7% (about 3.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people aged 10–14 and 25–34 years.

"suicide","2023-05-10","10:00:00","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:51:33","By Barby Ingle, PNN Columnist  Trigeminal neuralgia, arachnoiditis, Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) have all been called the “suicide disease” – the worst pain possible. But saying which disease or condition causes the most pain is subjective because people experience pain differently.  According to U.S. News & World Report, passing a kidney stone is one of the most painful medical conditions you can have.  News Medical Life Sciences lists sickle cell disease as one of the 20 most painful chronic conditions, with episodes of pain occurring when sickle-shaped red blood cells block small blood vessels.  McGill University in Canada has a “pain index” based on a questionnaire that asks people to describe what kind of pain they experience. The index consistently lists CRPS as the worst known pain to humans.  Verywell Health reports that fibromyalgia is one of the most common pain conditions, affecting 10 million people in the U.S. and causing widespread body pain, sleep problems, fatigue and distress.  After living with multiple pain conditions for over 20 years and speaking with tens of thousands of other patients, I no longer believe it matters which type of pain a person has or who has the most pain. We all experience pain. How much pain we feel depends on the individual and a host of other factors, such as genetics, life experiences, and whether effective treatment is available and affordable. That is what matters.  When we do not manage pain effectively, suicides go up. We also see drug abuse and misuse rise. According to a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 5% to 7% of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are intentional suicides. Many of those deaths are pain patients.  Since 2011, we have seen a steady decrease in opioid prescribing. Be it acute or chronic, providers are weary of prescribing opioids for pain. It’s not because opioids don’t work. More often than not, the reason they stop prescribing is because they have invested so much into becoming a provider (education, cost, time, family and social connections) that they are now at risk of losing due to laws and medical guidelines based on misleading information about opioids.  We need to get away from the generalities of treating pain and into individualized patient care. It may or may not involve pain medication, surgery, implants, cognitive therapy and other treatments. For those who have the audacity to say that anyone else should remain in pain because you are not comfortable with their form of treatment -- shame on you.  I have chosen not to use opioids for over 10 years because I have other options that work for me. I want all people to get whatever treatment they need to control their pain. It will be different for each of us and whatever condition or comorbidities we live with. We all need and deserve to get the care we choose after careful consideration, research and discussions with our providers. Laws and guidelines should not be used to take away medications that have been available since the beginning of time.  At a recent pain education event I attended, I heard the argument that there were no long-term studies on the use of opioids for pain. But there are millions of patients who have taken opioids safely for years who will tell you otherwise. Opioids actually gave them more life, because they were able to work, exercise and function when their pain was properly managed.  As a pain patient myself, I want the freedom to do what is best for me. I am currently working on getting access to ketamine infusions again after my ketamine clinic closed down. I want that same right in selecting treatment to be available to others. It should be left to patients and their providers to decide on treatment, without interference from others.

"suicide","2020-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:16:05","by  (Credit: Unsplash)  This article was exclusively written for The European Sting by Ms. Sadia Khalid, early-stage researcher (ESRs), medical writer and specialist at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia. She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), cordial partner of The Sting. The opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writers and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.  The COVID-19 pandemic has put significant pressure on healthcare systems and healthcare providers, leading to high levels of stress and burnout among healthcare staff, and has raised concerns about the increased risk of suicide among this group. Burnout can have a significant impact on the well-being of healthcare providers, as well as the quality of care they are able to provide to patients.  The exact number of healthcare staff who have been lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to determine as it varies by country and region. While it is difficult to determine exact numbers, some reports have indicated increased suicide rates among physicians during the pandemic.  A study published in JAMA Network Open in 2021 analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and found that between January and December 2020, 239 physicians died by suicide in the United States. This represents an increase from previous years, although it is important to note that suicide is a complex issue and cannot be attributed solely to the pandemic.  In response to concerns about physician suicide, organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have called for increased resources and support for healthcare providers. This includes initiatives such as providing access to mental health resources and promoting the destigmatization of seeking help for mental health concerns.  To address healthcare mental health and burnout, there are several steps that can be taken.    1: Healthcare organizations should prioritize the well-being of their staff by providing access to mental health resources, promoting self-care, and addressing workload issues. This can include providing time off, implementing workload management strategies, and adjusting staffing levels to reduce stress and burnout.  2: Healthcare organizations should promote a culture of teamwork and collaboration, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and overwhelm among healthcare providers. This can be achieved by creating opportunities for staff to connect with one another, work together on projects, and share ideas and experiences. Encouraging teamwork and collaboration can help healthcare staff feel supported and engaged in their work, reducing the risk of burnout.    3: Develop Support Networks: Healthcare providers benefit from a strong support network, including colleagues, mentors, and peer groups. Developing support networks within healthcare organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare providers. Let’s also raise awareness in public about how important mental health is to the healthcare staff in their community. Compassion for All.    4: Promote a Culture of Self-Care: Healthcare organizations can promote a culture of self-care by providing access to wellness programs, stress-management techniques, and mental health resources. Encouraging healthcare staff to take care of themselves can help prevent burnout and improve the overall well-being of healthcare providers.    5. Implement Work-Life Balance Policies: Healthcare providers often have demanding schedules and work long hours. Policies supporting work-life balance, such as flexible schedules, remote work options, and time off, can help prevent burnout.    6: Address Workload Issues: High workloads and long hours are major contributors to burnout in healthcare providers. Healthcare organizations can address workload issues by adjusting staffing levels, providing time off, and implementing workload management strategies that allow healthcare providers to focus on high-priority tasks.    7: Increase Staffing: One of the most important factors contributing to burnout is understaffing. To prevent burnout, healthcare organizations need to ensure that they have adequate staffing levels to meet patient needs. This can be achieved through a combination of recruitment, retention, and training programs.    8: Provide Mental Health Support: Healthcare providers may experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues because of their work. Providing access to mental health support, such as counseling and therapy services, can help prevent burnout and support the well-being of healthcare providers.    9: Ensure Adequate Resources: Providing healthcare staff with the resources they need to do their jobs effectively can help prevent burnout. This can include access to up-to-date technology and medical equipment, as well as adequate funding and support for research and development.    10: Increase Compensation and Benefits: Healthcare providers are often underpaid for their work. Increasing compensation and benefits can help reduce financial stress and prevent burnout.  11: Provide Professional Development Opportunities: Healthcare organizations should invest in professional development opportunities for their staff. This can help keep healthcare providers engaged and motivated in their work and prevent burnout by providing opportunities for growth and career advancement. This improves the overall quality of care provided to patients.  12: Policymakers should address systemic issues within healthcare systems that contribute to burnout, such as inadequate resources and administrative burdens. This can include implementing policies that provide funding and support for research and development and addressing issues related to healthcare access and affordability. Addressing these issues through policy changes can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare staff.    Implementing these strategies can help prevent burnout and improve the well-being of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a stronger healthcare system. It is important to recognize the impact of burnout on healthcare staff and advocate for policies that promote staff well-being and resilience.Overall, addressing healthcare burnout requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes the well-being of healthcare providers, promotes collaboration and teamwork, invests in professional development, and addresses systemic issues within healthcare systems.  It is important to prioritize the mental health and well-being of healthcare providers and to continue to raise awareness about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This can help reduce stigma and promote access to resources and support for those who may be struggling.

"suicide","2022-10-03","14:00:00","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:01:00","In 2022, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida passed the “Paternal Rights in Education” bill also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill (HB 1557). The bill restricts “teachers and school districts from discussing gender identity and topics surrounding sexuality in the classroom.” The law has been in effect for the 2022-23 school year. Although this measure primarily affects Florida’s LGBTQ community and their freedom of speech, many anti-transgender bills similar to this one are being considered across all states.  Even here in the state of Connecticut, there is a bill proposed regarding a student’s “biological gender.”  Connecticut House Bill 6331 proposes that “public school educators are required to recognize each student by the biological gender of the student.” Even though the bill is unlikely to pass, I believe even the proposal of this bill can lead to an unsafe environment and disparities in health, particularly mental health, and it should be called out.  The author of HB 6331, State Rep. Joe Hoxha, (R-Bristol) does not seem to notice the difference between biological (assigned) sex and gender identity. Biological sex is the sex assigned at birth based on the infant’s anatomical and biological characteristics. Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of being; whether that is male, female, or something else.  There is no such terminology as “biological gender.”  Megan Gaffney  Why would Rep. Hoxha use that term rather than the proper term, biological sex? The wording shows that Rep. Hoxha does not understand the issue, nor has he done enough research to know what term to use when drafting the bill. Was Rep. Hoxha aware that biological gender is not the proper term? Why is he drafting legislation on a subject he hasn’t researched?  Schools need to provide a safe and accepting environment for all students, yet many LGBTQ young people experience bullying, harassment, and other discrimination because of their gender identity. A national survey by GLSEN has found that “75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who can persevere had significantly lower GPAs, were more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and were less likely to plan on continuing their education.”  If school administrators ignore these students by refusing to acknowledge their gender identity and even penalize them for expressing it, they can put kids at risk.  A survey by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community, provided some key findings, showing that approximately 45% of LGBTQ youth have had suicidal ideation within the past year, 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide within the past year, and 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted to receive mental health treatment were not able to receive it in the past year.  Federal and state laws and “the U.S. Constitution prohibits discrimination, bullying, and harassment against students because they’re transgender. This includes Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools.”  There are 16 states, including Connecticut, that have laws that prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals. In New Haven Public Schools “a student has the right to be addressed by a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required, and the student need not change his or her official records.”  But even though here in Connecticut transgender individuals have protection, there have still been debates about transgenders athletes in the news. Four cisgender women, formerly high school athletes in Connecticut, sued the state for its trans-inclusive policies, saying that, “allowing transgender women to compete in high school girls’ sports put them at an athletic disadvantage.” While they lost their case last year, they have sought to revive it.  We should recognize that we are lucky that Connecticut has strong protections for transgender individuals. While this bill is unlikely to pass, Connecticut residents should greet Rep. Hoxha’s proposal of the bill with a resounding “no.”  To repurpose a phrase from our Southern neighbors, “Don’t Florida my Connecticut!” The anti-LGBTQ policies of Florida do not have a place here in Connecticut.

"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:38:56","Younger population experiences increased risk of death from suicide and chronic liver disease.  A new retrospective study with up to 40 years of follow-up shows significant reductions in death rates from all causes and cause-specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants with severe obesity, according to a new study published in Obesity, The Obesity Society’s (TOS) flagship journal.  The study also found evidence suggesting increased risk of death from chronic liver disease, in addition to higher death rates from suicide in younger patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The study’s authors observe that the findings of increased suicide rates among younger patients who have had bariatric surgery may promote more aggressive, pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up.  As a result of the decades-long durability of bariatric surgery in reducing death from all causes and decreasing deaths related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer compared to matched participants, researchers note the findings may not only increase interest in bariatric surgery treatment for patients with severe obesity but, in addition, further stimulate important research related to the discovery of physiologic and biomolecular mechanisms leading to non-surgical treatment that results in weight loss and improved mortality similar to that achieved by bariatric surgery, said Ted D. Adams, Intermountain Surgical Specialties/Digestive Health Clinical Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine and Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Adams is the corresponding author of the study.  Experts explain that multiple association studies connecting bariatric surgery and mortality outcomes have been reported, predominantly retrospective, with wide variation in study design pertaining to participant number, control cohorts, mean follow-up, procedure type, age at surgery, clinical end points such as life expectancy and death rates for all causes and specific causes, and presence or absence of prevalent diabetes. The new study builds upon the groups’ reported mortality outcomes following gastric bypass surgery by extending follow-up to 40 years, tripling the number of surgical patients, and using four, instead of one, bariatric surgery procedures.  Researchers used data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) for the current study. The UPDB includes linked, population-based information from Utah with statewide birth and death certificates, driver licenses and ID cards, and voter registration cards. The UPDB creates and maintains links between the database and the medical records held by the two, largest healthcare providers in Utah.  Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in Utah between 1982 and 2018 were identified from three, large bariatric surgical practices in Salt Lake City, Utah, and from medical records from the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouses in Salt Lake City. Non-surgical participants were selected from Utah driver license records or ID cards. Because driver licenses are generally renewed every five years, multiple records were available for selection for matching to the bariatric surgeries.  Nearly 22,000 participants with bariatric surgery and without were matched (1:1) for age, sex, body mass index and surgery date with a driver license/renewal date. Mortality rates were compared by Cox regression and stratified by sex, surgery type, and age at surgery. Whereas mortality after gastric bypass surgery was previously reported from 1984 to 2002, this study extends mortality follow-up through 2021. The four bariatric surgery procedures included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and bilio-pancreatic diversion with duo-denal switch.  Results revealed that all-cause mortality was 16% lower in patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. Lower mortality was observed for both males and females. Mortality after surgery versus non-surgery decreased by 29%, 43%, and 72% for cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, respectively. Death rates for males and females from chronic liver disease were 83% higher in patients who had surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The hazard ratio for suicide was 2.4 times higher in surgery compared with non-surgery participants, primarily in individuals with ages at surgery between 18 and 34 years.  “This important study adds to the mounting evidence that bariatric surgery, not only improves quality of life for patients, but will also increase their life expectancy. This work will hopefully improve patients’ access to this effective treatment for obesity, which is still limited to only one percent of qualified patients. Also, the study highlights the importance of providing more resources for pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up, especially for younger patients,” said Jihad Kudsi, MD, MBA, MSF, DABOM, FASMBS, FACS, Bariatric Surgery Division, Duly Health and Care, Downers Grove, Ill.

"suicide","1988-09-25","14:00:00","{""Lincoln"", ""Nebraska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:55:00","Brock became a suicide intervention counselor for farmers in the 1980s when she and her husband noticed a need in their community after losing their Lincoln County farm.  During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative / A bronze relief of Mona Lee Brock.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize the need for greater connection to military members and veterans by designating Nov. 12, 2023, as ""National Warrior Call Day."" The duo led a similar resolution in 2022 that passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent. The resolution this year is initially supported by 20 senators.  Led by the Troops First Foundation, Warrior Call is a coast-to-coast push that engages all Americans to build and maintain meaningful relationships with servicemembers and veterans in order to help curtail suicide deaths.  Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it. Tweet this  Simple by design, Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it, because isolation often is a precursor to suicidal ideation. In addition, many veterans may be suffering from undiagnosed brain injuries that can mimic mental illness and other ailments that spur isolation.  ""We thank Sens. Shaheen, Cotton and all cosponsors for their help in elevating this initiative and helping push the message to the grassroots level,"" said Frank Larkin, COO of Troops First and Chair of Warrior Call. ""We are hopeful the resolution will again move through the Senate, that leaders in the U.S. House will join in too, and that ultimately as many people as possible will work this year to help troops and vets through simple yet critical connection. It is not hyperbole to say a single call can turn a life around.""  Sitting on key committees in the Senate, the senators are strong advocates for the troops and veterans.  According to the most recent data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 6,146 veterans died by suicide in 2020. The unadjusted rate of suicide among U.S. veterans was 31.7 suicide deaths per 100,000, compared to 16.1 per 100,000 for civilians. After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide was 57% higher for veterans than for non-veteran adults.  The government, however, may still be drastically underestimating suicide deaths. Many other deaths may not be reported or classified as suicide because the evidence doesn't support a death determination. This is a statistical ""gray zone,"" especially as society wrestles with alcohol and opioid addiction.  ""Warrior Call and other efforts to connect with these brave men and women have never been more important,"" added Larkin. ""Working together, we can save lives.""

Within weeks of her passing the family named their charity ‘We Mind & Kelly Matters,’ emerging from their immense grief, shock, and anger that ‘Kelly mattered’. Following the charity set up, numerous fundraising events began, and the band of resolute fundraisers and followers were aptly named Kelly’s Heroes.  The two largest events, consisted of cycle rides from John O’Groats to Lands’ End in 2020, and again The Loneliest Road Cycle Tour across Europe, and New York to San Francisco in 2022. Teams of cyclists rode as Kelly’s Heroes, who not only raised in excess of £300k, created enormous awareness for mental health whilst breaking down stigma around suicide.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  John Hewitt, Kelly’s dad, and co-founder of the charity explained:  ‘The renaming marks an exciting new chapter for the charity. Having organised the Kelly’s Heroes cycle rides, I’ve trained and ridden with those heroes and the charity evolved, developing expertise and forming its own identity, growing from a foundation of pure grief to a place of hope. The family and also the cyclists have met with some of the recipients of where the funding goes, people who have used the support, accessed bereavement workshops and more, and it quickly became clear to us, that they are all heroes, each and every one of them. We will always want Kelly’s name to be remembered and we think the new name is a fitting tribute to her memory and the tireless work put in by our staff and supporters over the last 4 years’.  Kelly’s Heroes hopes to continue breaking down barriers and open up more conversations around the importance of not only managing your mental health but maintaining and promoting good positive wellbeing. Recognising the importance of early interventions, providing accessible mental health support, as well as offering bespoke training to local schools, businesses, and communities around mental health and suicide prevention. Mental health deserving a space for conversation.  CEO, Sherry Adams added:  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ‘The charity was founded around two purposes, to raise much needed funding, and to enable people in need to get support when they need it. The two are coming together under one name, one identity, all the events and work every fundraiser undertakes, all the donations they all underpin our support services, it became clear we needed just one name. Through changing to solely “Kelly’s Heroes”, it better reflects the ethos of all that we do, and that everyone who either works for the charity, fundraises for the charity, or bravely reaches out for support, they are all Kelly’s Heroes. If you cycle thousands of miles, run a marathon with tired limbs, have a cake sale, or be the one that reaches out and asks for help when you are feeling low, each and every person has mental health, and all of those actions are admirable, brave and determined, defining heroic’.  Rachael Hewitt, Kelly’s mum, and co-founder of the charity said:  ‘We are incredibly proud of what we have been able to achieve in the first four years, and in awe of all those who have reached out and recognised they needed support with their mental health. We are now looking forward to building on our identity as Kelly’s Heroes and aim to support more people and earlier, ideally before any crisis. We want to offer new services, support and activities that help promote and maintain good positive well-being, for adults and young people. Including all those who have found support and are in recovery, the earlier people get support the better for everyone, and our community. It’s our ambition and aspiration to help people live well and stay well, that will be fitting for Kelly’s legacy.’  Kelly’s Heroes will continue to support with free services, including 365 days of online support, every evening from 6-9pm, their ‘Listening Ear’ service offers emotional support to everyone, for anyone struggling to manage good positive wellbeing, to dealing with poor mental health, suicide ideation, and bereavements by suicide.

The training courses available range from Mental Health First Aid through to Safeguarding from Suicide, and are available to schools, colleges, universities, businesses, charities, and everyone in the community. All funds raised by delivering training go directly back to supporting people in need.  Amy Hewitt, Kelly’s sister, and co-founder of the charity added:  ‘Millions of people of all ages from all walks of life are experiencing issues with their mental health and so many struggle to find help, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to take the first step in getting support. With the charity and now the support services being known as Kelly’s Heroes it will broaden the awareness of the charity.

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Today marks the anniversary of the end of the Azovstal siege, sometimes described as “Ukraine’s Dunkirk”.  The three-month battle for Mariupol ended with a last-ditch defence of the city’s steelworks that inspired a wave of international sympathy.  Russia almost completely flattened Mariupol with endless airstrikes and artillery barrages. The destruction of the one of the city's maternity units and Mariupol's theatre, where hundreds of people were taking shelter, shocked the world.  READ MORE: Bombing hospitals, gassing children - the bloody atrocities of ‘Butcher of Mariupol’  But the massive Azovstal iron and steel works remained, described by witnesses as a “fortress within the city”.  Putin ordered his troops to blockade the plant, “so not even a fly can escape”.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  The main Ukrainian unit sealed inside the sprawling steelworks was The Azov Regiment, a force developed from a far-right all-volunteer militia that was often used in Russian propaganda broadcasts as evidence that Ukraine was run by “Nazis”.  They were reinforced by regular Ukrainian marines and foreign volunteers.  Hundreds of civilians had also taken refuge in the factory's miles of tunnels.  (Image: Interior Ministry of the Donetsk)  Conditions inside the dark, freezing and badly-ventilated underground base started as bad, and became truly horrific as stocks of food, water and vital medicines dwindled.  Amputations were carried out with little or no anaesthetic and the defenders ran dangerously low on ammunition.  One defender said: “It feels like I’ve landed in a hellish reality show in which us soldiers fight for our lives and the whole world watches this interesting episode. Pain, suffering, hunger, misery, tears, fears, death. It’s all real.”  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  A desperate helicopter airlift was put in place to resupply the defenders.  Between March 21 and May 11 last year, a total of 15 helicopters and 45 aircrew made nearly 30 rescue missions to Azovstal.  They delivered communications gear from Elon Musk’s Starlink company as well as ammunition and medicine. On the return flights the helicopters were loaded with wounded Ukrainian fighters.  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  Six flights successfully completed the mission and returned. More than 20 did not.  The helicopters were stripped of any non-essential gear to make the deadly journey through a ring of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.  Colonel Hryhorii, a squadron leader in the 12th Brigade of Army Aviation, told The Times: “Everything that was unnecessary was unloaded from the aircraft to make way for the cargo, even the machineguns.  “The pilots saw their task and understood it was dangerous to the point of impossible. But no one refused.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  One of the pilots, who gave his names “Ginger” explained that while the first resupply missions caught the Russians by surprise, subsequent mission were more dangerous: “The next flights looked like impudence on our part,” Ginger said.  “They were waiting for us. Every helicopter was fired upon, many of them taking damage.”On March 31, four Mi-8 helicopters made the trip, escorted by a Hind Mi-24 attack helicopter for cover.  As the Hind took on Russian anti-aircraft emplacements two of the transports here hit with shoulder-mounted ground-to-air missiles: “One was shot down and the other returned with only one engine,” Ginger said. “But he brought 22 wounded back.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  As the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest reached its climax, the frontman for the winning basin – Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra, begged the massive TV audience: “I ask all of you, please help Azovstal, right now!”  Finally, on May 16, President Zelenskyy told the defenders it was time to surrender. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” he said.  Even then, the fighters’ torment was not over.  Oksana, an Azovstal employee, told The Guardian: “No one came out of there unchanged. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.”  (Image: ALESSANDRO GUERRA/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  One of the fighters, Mykhailo Dianov, told Sky News after his release from a Russian POW camp he thought he would never survive: “We thought this every day. At Azovstal we thought it was the end.  “After a month of starvation, when you close your eyes, you forget about your family, everything. The only thing you think about is food.” He lost over six stone during the siege.  In the Russian prisoner-of-war camp, he said, the guards “treated us like animals. It was impossible to eat.”  (Image: President.gov.ua)  As the 2,500 Ukrainian fighters emerged from the ruined steel plant, they were loaded onto buses and shipped off to destinations in Russian -occupied territory. For months their fate remained a mystery.  The Kremlin hinted at trials, and possible death sentences.  But then, in September, Kyiv announced that over 200 POWs had been returned as part of a prisoner swap deal, including Lt Colonel Denys Prokopenko, the Azov Battalion’s commander.  But by the end of the year, some 1,000 Azov soldiers remained prisoners of war. And Ukrainian officials say that the bodies of an unknown number of soldiers still lie buried under the rubble of Azovstal.

"suicide","2021-07-05","14:00:00","{""Songnam"", ""KyonggiDo"", ""SouthKorea""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:55:20","Teens in crisis  Steps required urgently to address suicide, self-isolation among young people    Korea's suicide rate, still the highest among OECD member nations, has declined gradually over the past decade.  A notable exception is the suicide rate among children and adolescents.  According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate among people aged 17 and under was 1.2 per 100,000 in 2000. However, the figure more than doubled to 2.7 in 2021. The comparable rate primarily for middle school students aged 12-14 jumped nearly fivefold, from 1.1 to 5.0 persons.  That, along with Korea's lowest birthrate worldwide, casts doubt on this society's health and sustainability. So many buds wither or are trampled long before they blossom. What has gone wrong?  Suicide by teenagers, and its weaker or preceding stage of reclusion, are due to the avoidance of social activities such as study and play. Another possible cause is society itself teeming with limitless greed and competition. All parents here wish the worldly successes of money and reputation for their children ― and only that. Kids unable or unwilling to go all the way drop out of the rat race.  Korea may not be alone. But nowhere else are these phenomena more severe than here. This country industrialized and democratized itself over the span of just two generations and is the only one among 140 nations that became independent after World War II. It is the fifth hardest-working country in the OECD and perhaps the only one that can make Japan appear lazy. Korea and its establishment deserve praise for that and may as well have pride.  However, according to a survey conducted by the vernacular daily Dong-A Ilbo, 29.4 percent of people in their 20s said they ""don't like being Korean."" As reasons, they pointed to their country being ""too competitive,"" ""complicated,"" and ""exhausting."" Young Koreans think they have nothing to do with their country's or parents' accomplishments. These only pressure and discourage youngsters who will not and cannot repeat what their seniors did. For the poor, the increasingly hierarchical society also appears hopeless.  In this gloomy social atmosphere, various websites and online communities are mushrooming into the dark side of this IT-savvy country.  About a month ago, a girl in middle school jumped to her death from a 19-story building in Seoul's Gangnam District. The suicide was streamed live on Instagram and viewed by dozens of people. The operator of the website believed to be responsible for abetting the suicide has rejected a police request for a voluntary and temporary shutdown, maintaining that other online sites will continue to remain open. The Korea Communications Standards Commission does not enforce its closure, citing ""freedom of expression."" Meanwhile, two more teenagers attempted copycat suicides but failed.  The incident reveals two problems.  First, numerous ugly and wicked adults are bent on abusing and exploiting disoriented teenagers. They approach young victims online disguised as helpers, but abuse them sexually and financially offline, encouraging self-harm and suicide and extorting money. More and more teens fall prey to them amid social ignorance and legal leniency. Second, as one former victim said, there is the problem of having ""no other adults to talk to,"" forcing teenagers to visit these websites and risk danger. Parents and teachers are of no help to these desperate kids, some of whom are already injured, mentally if not physically.  What society should do is clear enough.  In the short term, the government must punish individuals and organizations that abuse children and adolescents. It should force relevant online communities to shut down voluntarily by enacting laws if necessary and prosecuting those responsible. Protecting young lives is far more important than freedom of expression. It should also open many ""anonymous"" ― instead of open and public ― websites through which these youth can communicate freely and frankly.  In the long term, this society and the country should rethink its direction. Korea, where its people, especially younger ones, are almost the unhappiest worldwide, should be where most can live while doing what they want to do without social alienation or economic want.  Aiming to be a wealthier and stronger country is okay. However, what good is this if people are unhappy?

The BJP MP and his father, known Dr Chag for 20 years, had borrowed nearly Rs 1.75 crore from him in instalments since 2008. They had refunded some money but later stopped responding to Dr Chag’s repeated requests to return the money.  Following dishonouring of a cheque of Rs 90 lakh, the MP and his father had abused Dr Chag and threatened to kill his son Hitarth if he still demanded the money back.  This threat allegedly upset the doctor who took the extreme step out of shock and fear, the FIR against the BJP MP and his father stated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vaW5kaWEvYmpwLW1wLWZhdGhlci1ib29rZWQtZm9yLXN1aWNpZGUtb2YtdmVyYXZhbC1kb2N0b3ItMTUwMzE4MTg5MC5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9ianAtbXAtZmF0aGVyLWJvb2tlZC1mb3Itc3VpY2lkZS1vZi12ZXJhdmFsLWRvY3Rvci0xNTAzMTgxODkwLmh0bWwvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Suicide prevention services can also be reached at 888-568-1112 or 800-273-TALK (8255).First responders' jobs are traumatic almost by definition. They run toward the danger. They go into the burning building. They put themselves on the line to help the rest of us. How could that not take an emotional toll on them?Tragically, Bangor experienced a gutting recent reminder of that toll. A young firefighter, Jacob Madden , died by suicide in late April.""Jake was a loving and caring man, who always kept humor at the center of his life. His bright smile and consistent banter brought joy to everyone that he interacted with,"" his obituary reads. ""Jake had an eccentric and quirky personality that was irreplaceable. Those closest to him knew him as nostalgic, sentimental, and a true romantic. Above all, Jake was an extremely proud father and family man.""Bangor firefighter Jared Willey , president of Local 772 of the International Association of Firefighters , spoke with Bangor Daily News reporter Kathleen O'Brien about first responders struggling with mental health and the high risk of dying by suicide. Firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, according to the U. S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .Willey said that mental health support is available, but stigma and a ""suck it up and be a man mentality"" can be barriers to getting help.""We have to talk about mental health and suicide because, if we don't, we're not going to see change,"" Willey said. ""We don't want to lose another firefighter, so we have to make sure everyone feels comfortable enough to sit down and talk about it. If my back hurts because of a fire last week, I'm going to sit with others and complain about it and get it fixed. The same needs to go for mental health.""We could not agree more. That is true this month, with May being Mental Health Awareness Month, and it is true all year long. And this is an instance where everyone can help to be part of the solution. Across society, we need to normalize talking about and addressing mental health challenges. We owe it to the first responders who put their physical and emotional well-being on the line, just as we owe it to our neighbors, friends and family. There is nothing wrong with needing help.Aside from this universal, interpersonal step to help support firefighters and other first responders, there is also a much more bureaucratic step to take. O'Brien explained how the U.S. Fire Administration has only recorded six firefighter suicides since its On-Duty Firefighter Fatality Program's started in the 1970s. Other firefighter groups estimate that there are roughly 100 firefighter suicides each year in the U.S.Clearly, the Fire Administration's reporting system isn't fully tracking this issue, and that is a problem. To better address an issue like this, policymakers and the public need to be fully aware of its scope. That requires having accurate and comprehensive data.As O'Brien reported, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has said the Fire Administrator's system only counts on-duty deaths and relies on voluntary reporting, so the seemingly obvious steps would be to update those elements of the system. The federal government should find a more proactive way of collecting this information from departments across the country, and make sure to include off-duty deaths by suicide — because the trauma doesn't just shut off when a first responder is off the clock.""After that call and when you're left with your own thoughts is when it haunts you,"" Willey told O'Brien about witnessing tragedies on the job. ""Many people have night terrors because when you don't process those traumatic events, your brain re-lives it when you sleep.""First responders need to know that resources exist to help them process that trauma and that there is nothing wrong about needing that help.___","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdnRlY2guY29tL2VtL3ByZXBhcmVkbmVzcy9lZGl0b3JpYWwtd2Utc2hvdWxkLWJlLXRoZXJlLWZvci1maXJzdC1yZXNwb25kZXJz0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292dGVjaC5jb20vZW0vcHJlcGFyZWRuZXNzL2VkaXRvcmlhbC13ZS1zaG91bGQtYmUtdGhlcmUtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXJlc3BvbmRlcnM_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The convict, S. D. Gafoor, complained to Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge court in Rangareddy court complex that at the behest of the prison superintendent an under-trial prisoner assaulted him by fingering his private parts. “I have attempted suicide unable to bear this third degree torture of fingers being forcibly put into my anus. Officers hitting me with lathis. I am unable to practice my religion and having to face daily torture and humiliation,” Gafoor said in his complaint to the IV Additional MSJ.  Mr. Gafoor was serving sentence in the prison and facing a couple of other cases. He was brought to the court by the prison authorities for appearance in other cases on Tuesday. Soon after being presented before the judge, the prisoner started narrating the alleged torture by the prison authorities. Mr. Roy, Krishnamurthy, Venkat Reddy and Satya hand-cuffed and beaten with fiber lathis, he charged. “Venkat Reddy kicked me in my face and my legs. I got bleeding injuries in my mouth,” he told the judge.  With the judge asking him to give a specific complaint, advocate D. Suresh Kumar of Indian Association of Peoples Lawyers (who was present in the court) volunteered to file vakalat to represent Mr. Gafoor. Mr. Kumar informed the court oral statement of the prisoner was sufficient for the judiciary to act upon on the issue. As Mr. Gafoor spoke in Urdu and Hindi, a young lawyer Rizwan present in the court came forward to assist the court.  He translated Mr. Gafoor’s complaint into English and presented it to the court. The prisoner explained to the court that he had slashed his head and neck with a blade on Monday, a day after being tortured by the prison officials.  The prisoner charged that constables of the prison made him consume soap water. According to him, Venkat Reddy and Satya threatened to implicate him in narcotics cases. Mr. Gafoor told the court that magistrates were not visiting the under-trial prisoners who were confined in single cells. They were only visiting the general barrack, he said.  On receiving the written complaint of the prisoner, the judge directed the prison authorities to take him to conduct medical examination of the injuries Mr. Gafoor had sustained. When the government counsel requested the court to hear prison officials’ contentions, the judge said he would listen to them eventually. The matter was posted to May 30 for next hearing.","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sign up for news and features from our diverse communities  A mental health hospital accused of attempting to 'cover-up' failures that contributed to a patient’s suicide has an 'issue with transparency', a senior staff member has admitted. Winbourne Charles, 58, died in his room at Goodmayes Hospital, North East London, on April 10 2021, having spent five months undergoing treatment for depression with psychotic symptoms.  In an inquest last month, a jury ruled that the dad-of-two’s suicide was 'contributed to by neglect' and failure to protect him from an 'obvious risk of self-harm'. Senior coroner for East London Graeme Irvine accused staff at North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT) – which runs the hospital – of attempting to 'cover-up' evidence of failing to regularly check on Winbourne’s welfare.  READ MORE: Met Police officers investigated after man Tasered before falling to his death from fifth floor balcony  Nurses' notes claimed he was alive 2 days after he had died  These included 'factually inaccurate' records of when Ilford staff had observed him and 'governance process failings' that saw its failings left out of three internal reports about the suicide. Two nurses' entries to Winbourne’s observation notes claimed he was alive and 'wake in his bedroom' two days after he died.  NELFT’s integrated care director Bob Edwards told Redbridge Council’s health scrutiny committee that the trust has 'an issue with transparency', despite encouraging staff to speak up. He said: “We absolutely strive to make sure that safety is the highest possible objective.""  He continued: “I think for people in the inpatient services included in this particular case, we could have done very much better, which we accept as an organisation, and we need to make sure we do so in future.”  Where to get help if you're struggling You don't have to suffer in silence if you're struggling with your mental health.

Concerns raised in a 'prevention of future deaths' report issued by the coroner last week include the fact that an investigation signed off by the integrated care director 72 hours after Winbourne’s death did not admit that observations had been missed.  The trust’s final serious incident report, handed to the coroner before the inquest, also failed to address “poor” assessments of Winbourne’s risk of self-harm and “inadequate” information in previous reports.  Witnesses to the inquest reported nurses using the “cut and paste” function to record when they observed patients and senior staff admitted medical notes appeared “dishonest”.  Mr Irvine noted that two staff members declined to answer questions about the accuracy of their notes, instead invoking an inquest rule protecting themselves from self-incrimination.  NELFT is required to respond to the coroner’s prevention of future deaths report by late June. The report has also been sent to the police, the Care Quality Commission, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council.  Don't miss out on the biggest local stories.

Londeka is popularly known for her character as Nkanyezi on Showmax’s drama series, Adulting, produced by Tshedza Pictures.  During an interview with Lungelo KM on Engineer Your Life, the actress revealed that she wanted to kill herself because she felt like there was no purpose to her life.  “I remember that falling pregnant was the only thing that stopped me from killing myself. Before my daughter, Liyana, my life was not worth living.”  Bagging a role in Adulting  The actress said scoring a role in Adulting restored her acting dream she had already gave up on because she felt inadequate and thought she did not deserve a chance in the industry.  She also shared that acting alongside her real-life crush Thembinkosi Mthembu, who plays Bonga on the show, was quite a shock to her, especially after finding out that she would be playing Bonga’s love interest.  “The crush is gone now. We are all good and well. He has and continues to teach me a lot about the industry,” she said, adding that fame has brought a lot of attention to her from other male celebrities.  ALSO READ: REVIEW: ‘Adulting’ gets off to a sexy start  “Having sex on TV“  Londeka shared that her mother is a pastor, and she was nervous about telling her about her role as it included a lot of explicit scenes.  “When I told her that I was going to shoot this, she was excited for me because this is something I have been wanting to do. But I did not give her context to say this is exactly what we are shooting. When the first episode aired, she was excited and told the congregation, and I had to get off my phone for a while. We never spoke about it again,” she said.  Showmax aired the 8th episode of Adulting last Monday, which marked the end of season 1. However, the show topped the trending topics on Twitter yesterday as fans complained that Monday was not the same without the show.  The eight-part drama series tells the story of four varsity friends who are trying to find love and success after varsity.

"suicide","2018-04-03","Not Discerned","{""Darby"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:31:18","On April 3, 2018, Jeffrey Parker called 911 from his Huntsville, Alabama residence and threatened to blow his head off. Huntsville Police Department (HPD) officers Pegues and Beckles were dispatched to the call. Upon arrival, Pegues drew her pistol and made a partial entry through the front door, thereby exposing half her body to the inside. She observed Parker sitting on a couch with what appeared to be a gun at his own head. She told Beckles, still outside, what she saw. Beckles informed police dispatch that Pegues had seen Parker with a gun to his head. [1]  Officer Darby heard Beckles’ radio call about “a guy with a gun … threatening suicide” and responded. Darby arrived and saw that Pegues had her gun drawn but pointed down. He commanded her to point her gun at Parker because he thought that Parker “could kill her.” Pegues moved completely into the residence and briefly raised her gun but almost immediately lowered it. Both Beckles and Darby followed her inside and demanded that Parker drop the weapon.  Pegues also pleaded with Parker to drop the weapon, but he kept it pointed at his head and refused to drop it. Darby, believing that all three officers were in danger of being shot, fired at Parker and killed him.  The Darby murder trial  Darby was charged with murder. After a jury trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Officer Pegues testified at Darby’s trial that prior to Darby’s arrival, she attempted to de-escalate the situation, but that once Darby entered the residence, she “could feel the tension just rising.” She testified that Parker didn’t threaten her or “do anything to make her believe he wanted to do anything other than commit suicide.”  Officer Beckles testified that “at no time during this event did he feel the need to take deadly force action.” He stated that Parker “didn’t make any overt action to” indicate that he was about to point his weapon at the officers. He estimated that Parker was ordered to drop the weapon about seven times but failed to comply.  An HPD detective investigated the shooting incident and testified that he found no evidence that Parker “ever made a hostile determination towards anybody other than himself.”  Officer Darby testified that upon entering the residence he realized that all three officers had no cover between them and Parker. He ordered Parker to drop the gun twice, but Parker refused. Darby shot and killed him. “Darby also presented testimony from three other law enforcement officers (expert witnesses) who each testified that Parker's refusal to put his weapon down constituted an imminent threat to the responding officers' lives.” [2]  After both sides presented their evidence, Darby requested the trial judge to charge the jury as follows: ""The reasonableness of an officer's actions in using deadly force must be objectively reasonable judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, the fact that officers are forced to make split-second decisions, and in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them at the time.”  In support of his requested jury instruction, Darby cited the United States Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [3] The trial judge rejected Darby’s requested instruction. Instead, the judge provided the jury with a general self-defense instruction that is available to all citizens who assert self-defense as a justification for their actions. This permitted the jury to examine Darby’s conduct from the perspective of an ordinary citizen rather than a trained law enforcement officer.  Darby appealed and argued that the trial judge delivered an erroneous self-defense instruction that permitted the jury to ignore, as irrelevant, the expert testimony from several witnesses that reasonable law enforcement officers would believe they were facing an imminent threat to their personal safety.  The decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals [4]  The Alabama Court of Appeals reversed Darby’s conviction and ordered that he receive a new trial. The court ruled that it was not bound to accept Darby’s offered instruction that was based upon the Supreme Court’s opinion in Graham v. Connor. The court explained that Graham does not govern a state court’s application of state criminal statutes because it “involved a civil action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” (The federal civil rights statute). [5] Nonetheless, the court observed that the Alabama legislature passed a self-defense statute designed for Alabama peace officers that states: ""A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes it necessary in order … [t]o defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force."" [6]  The court ruled that the trial judge erred by giving the jury a self-defense instruction designed for ordinary citizens instead of an instruction intended by the Alabama legislature to be used for peace officers in self-defense situations. The court explained, “[T]he Alabama Legislature has made clear that there is a unique standard to be used in judging a police officer's use of deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer. Thus, the proper perspective from which to evaluate a police officer's use of deadly force in such situations is indeed that of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  The court observed that the ordinary citizen self-defense instruction given to the jury permitted the jury to ignore “extensive testimony from multiple witnesses regarding the training a police officer receives with respect to confrontations with an armed person.” The court noted that this testimony “supported a finding that a reasonable police officer in Darby's situation could have concluded that Parker's conduct represented the imminent use of deadly force. In other words, that testimony supported a finding that Darby acted in self-defense or defense of another when he shot Parker.”  Lessons learned  Here’s a summary of the lessons law enforcement officers can take from this case:  Parker called the police himself and threatened suicide. There was no indication that there were other civilians in immediate danger. Once the first officer saw Parker with a gun to his head, her tactical response should have been to back out, take cover, call for help, set up a perimeter, request a mental health professional, and attempt to de-escalate and negotiate a peaceful surrender.  The tactical decision(s) by all three officers to completely enter the room and expose themselves to a person holding a gun was extremely dangerous and unnecessary. This involved an unforced error that dramatically escalated an already dangerous encounter.  Once the officers placed themselves in this precarious predicament, a strong argument can be made that the officers were faced with a significant threat to their personal safety.  An action/reaction study conducted by Dr. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, involved students holding training guns loaded with marking cartridges to their heads while being confronted by officers 10 feet away with training pistols pointed at the students. Each confrontation involved one student and one officer. The confrontation was repeated several times with different students and officers participating each time. Once the officers ordered the students to drop the guns, the students would attempt to shoot the officers as quickly as they could. The average time for the students to fire was .40 of a second. The average officer response time to fire was .40 of a second. The study demonstrates how fast a situation can turn from encountering a potential suicide subject to becoming the victim of a cop killer.  This case demonstrates the sobering reality that in prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter etc., state court judges can, as the court did in the instant matter, reject an officer’s legal defense grounded in the “objective reasonableness” use of force standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [7]  As discussed, the murder conviction reversal was based not upon Graham but rather upon an Alabama statute that treated peace officers differently than ordinary citizens who claimed self-defense for their actions. The court ruled, “[W]here there is evidence to support a defendant police officer's claim that he used deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer, the trial court should instruct the jury to evaluate the defendant's actions from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  Police officials and police attorneys should ensure that officers under their command or counsel are made aware of the state deadly force standard that they would be judged by if charged with murder or manslaughter. Further, if the current state deadly force standard for officers criminally charged, is not favorable to law enforcement, strong consideration should be given to attempting to influence the state legislature to change the law to reflect more favorably upon law enforcement officers.  In 2019, the California legislature passed a new unfavorable deadly force statute for police officers that changed the deadly force standard for police officers from “reasonable” (Supreme Court’s Garner/Graham standard) to “necessary.” [8] Commenting on the new law, a recent University of Toledo Law Review article observed, ”the proposed law was tempered to allay concerns raised by police associations … the bill was watered down in an attempt to ensure its passage.” [9] The proposed law was amended by the California legislature to make it more acceptable for law enforcement due to pressure from police advocacy groups. The result, although unfavorable to police, could have been much worse.  The California law doesn’t define “necessary” but does state that deadly force may be used to “defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” [10] The law also contains language that suggests that imminent means immediate. [11] The California statute also permits examination of an officer’s pre-shooting conduct (which the Supreme Court suggests is not relevant in Graham v. Connor). [12]  The effect of the new California statute on prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter is yet to be seen. Suffice it to say that California’s move away from the Supreme Court’s “reasonableness” standard to an undefined statutory “necessary” standard to govern police use of deadly force is likely to result in more criminal prosecutions and convictions of police officers in that state.  References  1. It would later be determined that Parker was holding ‘a flare gun that had been intentionally painted black,’ but there is no evidence indicating that any of the officers were aware of that fact.  2. Quote is taken from the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals opinion.  3. 490 U.S. 386 (1989}. In Graham, the Supreme Court created an objective reasonableness standard for police use of deadly force grounded in the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that “the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Further, the Court ruled that when police use of force situations are evaluated, the fact that officers are “forced to make split-second judgments” must be considered.  4. Darby v Alabama, (CR-20-0919) (3/24/23).  5. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals determined when reviewing state criminal statutes, it is not bound to follow a constitutionally grounded Fourth Amendment-based opinion of the United States Supreme Court regarding the standard for police use of deadly force. The Alabama court cited a quote from a California case, People v. Perry, 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 465, 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 522, 536 n.10 (2019) as authority for declining to follow Graham v. Connor regarding its application to a state’s criminal statutes. The California court ruled, “Perry contends throughout his briefing that we are bound to apply the standards articulated in Graham in this case.

"suicide","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:59:27","Photo Credit: Israel Police Spox  On Saturday, there was an incident that is depressingly familiar:  A Palestinian man who allegedly attempted to stab Border Police officers at a checkpoint in the northern West Bank was shot dead on Saturday afternoon. A Border Police spokesman said the suspect ran toward the checkpoint near the settlement of Shaked, known as “checkpoint 300,” while brandishing a knife. “Border Police troops operating at the crossing fired at the terrorist and neutralized him,” the spokesman said. The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry identified the man as 33-year-old Ahmed Muhammad Atatreh, and said he had died of his wounds.  “Lone wolf” stabbing and car ramming attempts that result in the death of the attackers happen about once a week; there have been at least 13 of them this year  But the perpetrators of these attacks have different demographics than the Palestinian terrorists killed in arrest raids. They are usually older, often with families of their own, and they are sometimes women.  These incidents happen often enough that the attackers know very well what is going to happen. The soldiers they attack will almost never be injured, and the attackers will probably end up dead.  It doesn’t take much thinking to realize that these aren’t terror attacks. They are suicides.  If you are a troubled Palestinian, with emotional, relationship or money problems, traditional suicide is not an option. It is a major sin in Islam; Muslims who commit suicide are taught that they do not enter Paradise, and a suicide would bring shame on the rest of the family. But martyrdom is the opposite: it is honorable, and brings honor as well as monetary compensation to the families.  There are two guaranteed consequences of these attacks: the attackers will be honored as heroic martyrs, and their families will get a guaranteed income from the Palestinian Authority.  Suicidal Palestinians have an easy decision on how to kill themselves: one path towards shame and hellfire, and the other towards honor, Paradise, and guaranteed family income and security.  Although this is only a theory, it seems to be a compelling one. There are huge disincentives to traditional suicides and giant incentives to “suicide by IDF.” The way to verify it would be if the media would investigate the personal lives of the would-be stabbers and car rammers to see what their family situations were like, what their personalities were, and to dig beyond the relatives claiming that they were angry at Israel to see of there were any other things going on in their lives.  But, of course, no media bother to do that. Even though they have enormous resources at their disposal – look at how they reported on Shireen Abu Akleh’s death – as far a I know, no mainstream media have ever investigated the circumstances of these attackers’ lives.  And the reason for that is just as obvious: they have a narrative of Israeli evil, and they have no desire to disprove what “everybody knows.” Especially when doing so would bring the exact dishonor to the victims that they were trying to avoid.  This is another example of media bias by omission. And the world only sees the simplistic lies of desperate Palestinians driven to act by how terrible their lives are under “occupation.”  {Reposted from EoZ}","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpld2lzaHByZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9lbGRlci1vZi16aXlvbi9zaWxlbmNlLW9uLXBhbGVzdGluaWFuLWVwaWRlbWljLW9mLXN1aWNpZGUtYnktaWRmLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Black"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 18:15:00","Newswise — Black adults – particularly Black women – with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to grow up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  “The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,” said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study. “This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.”  Recent research shows that since 2019 half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death – whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence – increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community. Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don’t own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020. The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  “For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,” said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center. “However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzd2lzZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tY3JpbWUtYW5kLXN1aWNpZGFsLXRob3VnaHRzLWFzc29jaWF0ZWQtd2l0aC1ncmVhdGVyLW9kZHMtb2YtZmlyZWFybS1vd25lcnNoaXAtYW1vbmctYmxhY2stYWR1bHRzP3RhPWhvbWXSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3dpc2UuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2Rpc2NyaW1pbmF0aW9uLWNyaW1lLWFuZC1zdWljaWRhbC10aG91Z2h0cy1hc3NvY2lhdGVkLXdpdGgtZ3JlYXRlci1vZGRzLW9mLWZpcmVhcm0tb3duZXJzaGlwLWFtb25nLWJsYWNrLWFkdWx0cz90YT1ob21l?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This conclusion has been made after the revenue department reached out out nearly five lakh families of farmers in the region as part of a survey conducted in December last year, Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrekar told reporters on Tuesday.  The Marathwada region, which comprises Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad and Parbhani districts, reported 1,023 farmer suicides in 2022.  As many as 10,431 farmers committed suicide in this region since 2001, as per figures provided by the divisional commissioner’s office.  Kendrekar said the administration studied the socio-economic condition of farmers and their families in the eight districts of Marathwada.  “The survey was conducted to find the families where farmers were vulnerable to taking the extreme step due to various conditions. The farmer suicide rate in Marathwada is more (compared to other parts of Maharashtra,” he said.  “Less crop yield, no good returns on crops, climatic conditions, problems due to wild animals and costly farming inputs were some of the main reasons for farmer suicides in the region. We called four such families and had discussions with them,” the official said.  He said the families get aid after they lose their member to suicide.  “To find such suicide vulnerable farmer families, we decided to reach out to the cultivators through a survey comprising 104 questions. It was like a psychological test,” the official said. Through this survey, the farmers families were found that were tired of their (socio-economic) condition, he said.  “The situation is serious. There are families with girls to be married, children who have left their education. If a family has five-seven acre of land and doesn’t have ample water, it yields less crop. They take loans from banks and private money lenders,” he noted.  Kendrekar said farmers need money in this “risky” business of farming.  “Like the Telangana government, I think the farmers should be given an aid of Rs 10,000 per acre before a crop season. They can purchase seeds and make their farms ready for sowing. After this, they can purchase other farming essentials without any debt and interest. We will recommend this to the state government soon,” the official said.  Market reforms are also necessary to prevent farmer suicides, he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vZmFybWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZ2l2ZW4tZmluYW5jaWFsLWFpZC1iZWZvcmUtY3JvcC1zZWFzb25zLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtbWFoYS1vZmZpY2lhbC0yNTkwNjMwL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vZmFybWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZ2l2ZW4tZmluYW5jaWFsLWFpZC1iZWZvcmUtY3JvcC1zZWFzb25zLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtbWFoYS1vZmZpY2lhbC0yNTkwNjMwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

GARNER, N.C. (WTVD) -- Local Emergency Rooms are under pressure to help those facing mental health episodes.  Last year, WakeMed Hospital admitted 4,000 adults and children with suicidal thoughts. That represents a 15 percent increase from the previous year.  Victor Chambers knows people suffering, but they're having difficulty accessing resources.  ""(They're) just mostly peers. I'm still kind of young myself so it's very prevalent in my age range,' said Chambers.  Wake County is committing about $30 million every year to support behavioral health services, but a newly released report shows there are several gaps in getting people the help they need.  The report notes that right now ""there is an overreliance on calling 911 for behavioral health crisis"" and then a ""lack of coordination with the new 988 crisis call line.""  One recommendation is to increase funding to the mental health facility WakeBrook and turn it into a crisis hub.  The report is being released as WakeMed is inching closer to building a new medical health hospital in Garner.  WakeMed Behavorial Health Department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Micah Krempasky said only about half of the people, who are admitted to the ER and need a psychiatric bed, actually get one.  ""We are vastly underserved in the amount of in-patient psychiatric beds available,"" she said. ""There are people that wait days, weeks, months or are actually never able to access that level of care. Instead, we stabilized them in the hospital. We connect them with out-patient services. We do the best that we can.""  WakeMed said there was a 104 percent jump in the number of pediatric patients since 2020.  Hospital leaders are trying to tackle the problem and building a new medical health hospital in Garner. The site is located near the intersection of White Oak Road and Timber Drive.  The facility will eventually have a 150 psychiatric beds and help with a shortage.  ""The need for behavioral health care is far bigger than what WakeMed can handle alone. We have to come together to come up with community solutions for the overwhelming need that is here and that has been under addressed for year,"" said Krempasky.

The deceased 14-year-old girl’s grandfather submitted a complaint to police in which he stated that he had gone to his native place in Hapur and came back on Sunday evening. On his return, he found about 10-12 people standing outside his house and searching for the suspect.  “They were family members of the boy and were searching for him in my house. They went to the terrace of the house which was locked. They put up a ladder from the adjacent house and found the boy. They then took him along. Around 1.25am, I heard some sound and went upstairs to my granddaughter’s room. I found her hanging from the ceiling fan,” the complainant said.  The officers said that the girl was alone at home on Sunday as her mother and brother had gone to a hospital in Delhi while her grandfather was also away.  The grandfather’s complaint further said that he found five used contraceptives from under the bed.  “It is suspected that the boy blackmailed the girl using some videos and she died by suicide,” the complaint said further.  The police said that they seized the contraceptives.  “These have been sent for forensic analysis while investigation is on regarding the said videos. The boy has been detained and the girl’s body was sent for autopsy. The investigation is on in the case,” said Nimish Patil, ACP (Masuri).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL25vaWRhLW5ld3MvMTV5ZWFyb2xkLWJveS1kZXRhaW5lZC1mb3ItcmFwZS1hbmQtYWJldHRpbmctc3VpY2lkZS1vZi1jbGFzc21hdGUtaW4tZ2hhemlhYmFkLWZpci1yZWdpc3RlcmVkLXVuZGVyLWlwYy1hbmQtcG9jc28tYWN0LTEwMTY4NDI2MzEzMjg3OC5odG1s0gG_AWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbm9pZGEtbmV3cy8xNXllYXJvbGQtYm95LWRldGFpbmVkLWZvci1yYXBlLWFuZC1hYmV0dGluZy1zdWljaWRlLW9mLWNsYXNzbWF0ZS1pbi1naGF6aWFiYWQtZmlyLXJlZ2lzdGVyZWQtdW5kZXItaXBjLWFuZC1wb2Nzby1hY3QtMTAxNjg0MjYzMTMyODc4LWFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Health chiefs from countries that have given ill people control over how they die shared a range of experiences in a debate on a potential change to the law in the UK.  Professor Brian Owler, a consultant in New South Wales, said hearing the horrific ways people had taken their own life was a “very powerful argument” in assisted dying being made legal in the Australian state.  He told the story of a woman who went through chemotherapy for Leukaemia and took her own life before the legislation was available.  “The sadness was that her husband who cared for her for I think about 10 years went to work one day and had to come home and find her dead and that was really unfair on her and of course her husband and her whole family,” he told the Commons health select committee.  Image: bbc.co.uk) bbc.co.uk)  “That’s the sort of harm we’re trying to stop with this legislation. It really is about understanding people’s autonomy and respecting their decision and their choice when they are in a situation where they are suffering or when they are dying about the timing and the manner of their death.”  South Australia’s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Kyam Maher said 10% of suicides police attended in the area were of elderly people with terminal illnesses.  He said: “There has to be a better way that someone at the end of their life can die with the same dignity with which they lived their life.”  Dr Chandana Banerjee, a professor in palliative medicine in California, said having the option of assisted dying gives patients “peace of mind”.  “It allows them and their families to really plan for things rather than wait for the disease to get so debilitating that they can’t enjoy their lives for those last six months.”  There are strict rules in most countries that have legalised the practice.  Dr Banerjess said most people still think assisted dying in the US is “for anyone and everybody” but added: “That’s not the case. It really is highly regulated for those who have a prognosis of six months or less.”  Dr Lydia Dugdale, director at the centre for clinical medical ethics at New York’s Columbia University, highlighted the importance of safeguarding with the case of Canada, which has been highly criticised for its right-to-die laws.  Image: Getty Images/Westend61) Getty Images/Westend61)  She gave the example of more than 1,700 euthanasias having been carried out for loneliness in the country.  Dr Dugdale said: “What kind of society do we want to live in where we solve the problem of ageing and lack of access and poverty by Euthanisa?  “That’s what we’re seeing in Canada which has not had it legalised for that long. People can’t pay their rent, they get euthanised. People can’t afford their medicines, they get euthanised. People need a wheelchair lift and the veterans’ affairs office offers them euthanasia.”  Professor Roderick MacLeod, a former senior palliative care consultant in New Zealand, was the voice of general concerns about assisted dying.  Saying he’d like to see the law reversed, he said: “For a long time I’ve spoken about the fact, as a palliative physician, people would ask me quite frequently if there was anything that I could do to end their life and when I was in practice I would say I couldn’t because it was illegal.  “But requests for a hastened death are not uncommon in palliative care because people are essentially saying ‘I don’t want to live like this’ and that is a very reasonable statement to make.  “What I know from my own practice and the practice of my colleagues is after a variable length in the palliative care service those requests for hastened death melt away.”  Last month, crossbench peer and chair of the charity Dignity in Dying, Molly Meacher, told MPs the reality of end of life could include vomiting faeces, endless nausea and bad-smelling decaying tumours.  She has long campaigned for reform to laws in the UK, where assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.  British retiree David Hunter is currently on trial in Cyprus after killing his cancer-stricken wife after she begged him to help end her misery.  He wept as he told the court on Monday: “It was her decision that she wanted to die, not mine - hers. It was her decision that she didn’t want any more treatment.  “She has her own mind and she asked me. I would never in a million years have done it. She wasn’t just my wife - she was my best friend.  “I didn’t just decide to kill her. I loved her so much. I still love her.  “You don’t know what we went through.

The university student named Ho sustained injuries to his head and right leg after he jumped onto the tracks at about 7.40 pm and was hit by the moving train before becoming trapped beneath it.  He was rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital in critical condition.  Police found a suicide note at the scene, and a preliminary investigation revealed Ho had been conned on a social networking app.  Sources said Ho could not repay the debts, and the stress might have led to his suicide attempt.  The service of the East Rail Line was once suspended and resumed at 8.30 pm.  In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy was also defrauded on a social networking app by being blackmailed with indecent clips and photos of himself.  Police said the boy was recently lured into a nude chat, with his mother receiving some of the indecent images taken by the scammer, asking for HK$10,000.  It is unknown whether the mother paid the ransom.  Officers recommended that parents explain more about online pitfalls to their children and remind them not to be naked in front of the camera, click on suspicious links, or download programs from unknown sources.

(WJBF) – The National Institutes of Health reports insomnia as a common sleep disorder, affecting up to half of patients with schizophrenia. Insomnia can also increase the risk of suicide in schizophrenic patients.  Doctors at the Medical College of Georgia at AU are investigating ways to lower this risk and improve patients’ quality of life.  Insomnia disorder affects about 10 percent of adults.  “Insomnia was a risk factor for suicidal thinking, suicidal behavior and suicide death,” said Dr. William Vaughn McCall, Chair of Psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.  During his earlier studies, Dr. McCall says he wanted to see if treating insomnia in people with active suicidal thinking would make a difference.  “It did,” said Dr. McCall. “Treating insomnia appeared to mitigate people’s tendency towards suicidal thinking. And this was the first time that it had been shown.”  Now, he and Dr. Brian Miller, professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, are working to treat this occurrence in patients with schizophrenia- using a drug called clozapine.  “We use it because it dramatically changes people’s lives when it works,” said Dr. Miller.  “I’ve started patients on clozapine who’ve been able to go back to school and finish degrees. And pursue advanced degrees. And get meaningful employment.”  Dr. Vaughn notes that a person’s ability to think clearly is noticeably diminished if they don’t get enough sleep.  “The decision they land upon is ‘I might commit suicide’, which is a decision they might not make if they slept better,” said Dr. McCall.  The doctors are also looking at ways to better recognize signs and symptoms of high alertness, which is often linked to insomnia.  Using a device called a pupillometer, they can measure the rate of pupil responses to determine the patient’s level of physiological excitement.  It has proven to be a helpful instrument in the stages of both diagnosis and treatment.  “We have an additional study with the pupillometer to measure these pupillary responses to light in patients before and after they get treated with clozapine,” said Dr. Miller.  “We think that the autonomic nervous system will tell us things about the patient that they may not be able to even access themselves,” said Dr. McCall.  Drs. Miller and McCall tell us they remain committed to proving their hypotheses and providing better care for patients in need.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqYmYuY29tL25ld3MvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1tYXR0ZXJzLWhvdy1kb2N0b3JzLWFyZS10cmVhdGluZy1zdWljaWRhbC1iZWhhdmlvci1pbi1wYXRpZW50cy13aXRoLXNjaGl6b3BocmVuaWEv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2piZi5jb20vbmV3cy9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLW1hdHRlcnMtaG93LWRvY3RvcnMtYXJlLXRyZWF0aW5nLXN1aWNpZGFsLWJlaGF2aW9yLWluLXBhdGllbnRzLXdpdGgtc2NoaXpvcGhyZW5pYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-09-25","Not Discerned","{""Guildford"", ""Surrey"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:03:15","SURREY, United Kingdom — According to a teacher and author, schools should provide “lessons in bromance” to address the mental health crisis among boys. Matt Pinkett’s new book proposes that classes centered around anger management, friendship, and active listening could potentially reduce male suicide rates.  Pinkett’s book delves into key research that explores factors influencing boys’ mental health, discussing topics such as body image, pornography, and self-harm. Additionally, it offers practical strategies for teachers to initiate positive change. The guide is grounded in evidence gathered from teachers, school staff, well-being experts, and therapists.  Research indicates that teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, a rate that triples when boys transition into adulthood. According to official data used by the U.K.-based researcher, 264 people between 10 and 19 years-old committed suicide in 2020 in England, Scotland, and Wales — with boys constituting 72 percent of these cases. In England specifically, suicide is the leading cause of death among men under 45.  Despite these grim statistics, Pinkett remains optimistic. In his book, “Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in School,” he urges teachers to refrain from stigmatizing anger, suggesting they should instead help boys understand the neurological and physiological roots of their feelings.  “Anger isn’t inherently bad. Telling boys it is only leads to shame and concealment. Instead, we should teach them that anger is as natural as joy or sadness, and equip them with the tools to manage it and the language to express it,” the author says in a media release.  Pinkett also believes that teachers should normalize loving, male relationships. He maintains that every social interaction in the classroom is observed and internalized, hence, male teachers should openly compliment male colleagues, speak affectionately about others, and acknowledge and applaud male emotional vulnerability whenever possible. He advocates for teaching boys about bromances, as this can furnish young men with the skills to listen actively and exhibit compassion and affection towards one another.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work. However, the fact is that we are in front of these children for significant portions of their lives. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing,” says Pinkett, who also co-authored the book, “Boys Don’t Try.”  He further adds that the challenge lies not in encouraging young men to talk, but rather in teaching their peers to listen. Pinkett’s research suggests that boys don’t listen as effectively as girls.  “There is so much discussion about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through effective listening?”  His research proposes that boys yearn for emotional intimacy and the liberty to express themselves without ridicule. However, he identifies toxic masculinity as an obstacle to nurturing these beneficial peer relationships. He believes boys should be taught kindness, vulnerability, and emotional articulation. Pinkett hopes his book will embolden others to tackle difficult topics that will benefit everyone.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to discard harmful and outdated expectations of masculinity, society as a whole will benefit. It is only through education that the blight of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Armed with extensive research, Pinkett offers advice on intervening when a child may be at risk and provides tips on establishing group tasks that foster friendships while facilitating learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists.

"suicide","2023-04-01","10:00:00","{""Springfield"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:59:41","Suicide prevention experts are praising the performance of the 988 lifeline, saying the simple three-digit code is expanding access to crisis services nationwide.  “For people in crisis, 988 is a game changer,” said Angela Cummings, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  Illinois has six crisis call centers statewide. In July 2021, the state was last in the country, with only 19% of crisis calls answered in state.  After the 988 launch in July 2022, that number jumped to 81% and new data just released for April 2023 found 87% of calls were answered in-state, the highest ever.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “You can call it and have your call answered in about 36 seconds is the average now, while it used to be close to 170 seconds. So that's a huge improvement,” Cummings said.  Nationwide, people in crisis contacted the 988 lifeline nearly 368,936 times last month. That’s 160,314 more contacts in April 2023 compared to April 2022.  A year over year comparison for the month of April also found calls answered went up by 52%, chats answered increased by 90% and text responses went up by 1,022%.  “I was thrilled, because a lot of the people who do the texting are younger people, and we want to get to them as soon as possible,” said Cara Levinson.  Levinson is the board chair for the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Levinson lost her daughter, Elana, 18, to suicide in 2007.  “Not that every minute is occupied with missing her but it's, as you can see, it's, it's still, still there,” Levinson said, tears in her eyes.  Levinson said she can’t help but wonder if the outcome would have been different had the 988 lifeline been available to Elana.  “With anyone who dies, there’s always this feeling, especially with suicide, if… only….” Levinson said.  Levinson was recently at an event where people she spoke with weren’t aware calling or texting the three-digit code, 988, provides immediate access to trained counselors.  “I can't tell you how many people did not know of its existence. That’s a problem,” Levinson said.    She’s determined to raise awareness, hoping to spare another family the pain she feels from losing Elana.  “If it can't be there for her, then her death though, has prompted me to do this work,” Levinson said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMTAtbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRoZS05ODgtbGlmZWxpbmUtc3RhbmRzLzMxNDI1OTgv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8xMC1tb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItc3RhcnRpbmctaGVyZXMtd2hlcmUtdGhlLTk4OC1saWZlbGluZS1zdGFuZHMvMzE0MjU5OC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-05-16","01:00:00","{""Charleston"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:00","Jamie Ray Harris had a few explanations for how his 18-year-old girlfriend ended up dead at his home. None convinced North Charleston police not to charge him with murder. On May 16 Harris' plea for bond failed to persuade a judge to grant the request.  Harris, 20, is accused of murder in the July 5, 2021, fatal shooting of Anissa Shank, of Moncks Corner. He has been held in jail nearly two years without bond. After hearing from both sides on the issue of bond May 16, Circuit Judge B. Alex Hyman ruled against Harris.  The day Shank died, North Charleston police responded to a 911 call around 1 a.m. at his residence, 4853 Lecque St. The call was about a suicide. But North Charleston police officers who responded to the call and found Shank dead determined the fatal gunshot wasn't self inflicted. Detectives determined a charge of murder was appropriate for Harris, whom they believed tried to stage Shank's death as a suicide before he fled the scene.  Harris later told police he was ""playing"" with a gun and accidentally shot Shank, 9th Circuit Assistant Solicitor Kelsey Davis said during the May 16 bond hearing.  Her killing devastated an already grief-stricken family. Shank's mother died just three weeks before she was killed, according to Dana Rabon, who identified herself in the courtroom May 16 as the victim's aunt. Rabon implored the judge to deny bond.  Nicholas D'Angelo, of the Charleston County Public Defenders Office, said he is concerned for his client's wellbeing in the county jail. Harris has been held for 802 days awaiting trial. The attorney said he just learned his 22-year-old client had been placed on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center. Harris' mother and his new girlfriend supported him in the courtroom.  The case will likely not be scheduled for trial this year, D'Angelo said. Prosecutors and defense attorneys in Charleston's General Sessions Court are still working to resolve cases that predate Harris' case, which is nearing two years old.  The case backlog has grown to 14,000 pending cases. Last year, the typical case in General Sessions Court lasted 625 days — more than 1½ years — according to a recently released report by the Charleston County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vbmV3cy9ib25kLWRlbmllZC1mb3ItbmMtbWFuLXdoby1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LXRyaWVkLXRvLXN0YWdlLWdpcmxmcmllbmRzLXNsYXlpbmctYXMtc3VpY2lkZS9hcnRpY2xlXzczNTY0ZTAwLWY0MDQtMTFlZC1iNjEzLTdiN2FjMjRhMjc5Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-01","18:30:00","{""Sydney"", ""NewSouthWales"", ""Australia""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:39:45","Glenn Anthony and his wife Maria Anthony, President of Pontoxeniteas NSW, are holding a fundraiser on Saturday, May 27 in Sydney in honour of their brother Terry ‘Tezza’ Anthony, who died by suicide six years ago.  The fundraiser is being held at The Grand Roxy in Brighton-Le-Sands from 6.30pm and will raise money for the Black Dog Institute towards Mental Health Awareness and Suicide Prevention.  The night will be focused on personal stories from the family and other guest speakers, including Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Ahead of the fundraiser, The Greek Herald spoke with Glenn and Katrina to hear all about their personal connection to losing a family member through suicide.  Anna, Glenn and Liza.  Glenn Anthony:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I lost my brother Terry to suicide in 2017. He was suffering from mental health issues and depression for many years. We as a family had lived with this and tried to get help for Terry, but this was very difficult and challenging for my parents, sister and myself. After Terry’s passing, it was extremely difficult to process and all our lives were changed.  Personally, my views on life were altered and nothing seemed important anymore. I shut myself off to everyone and everything, and slipped into a terrible depression. I had many questions but no answers. I spent three years with my bereavement councillor to help me focus and see clearly again.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I do believe it is a taboo topic regardless of which community you come from. There is a stigma attached to suicide which generates thoughts within the community of weakness, blame, shame or even sin. The topic makes people uncomfortable and unsure of how to react.  Since my brother’s suicide, I have been able to understand a bit more about this disease and along with this better understanding, I have felt more comfortable discussing it. It is more frowned upon within the Greek community as it is looked at as a sin and having lack of faith.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we are open and honest about the topic, the more people will feel comfortable talking about it. When we don’t talk about our problems or our depression or dark thoughts, then it builds up and it always feels much worse. The more we talk, the more we raise awareness, people are likely to seek help and advice. Let’s talk, let’s make a difference, let’s save lives together.  What do you hope to achieve with your fundraiser?  The fundraiser is about bringing people together from all communities to raise awareness for mental health and suicide prevention. The Black Dog Institute will be there on the night sharing what they are doing and what programs they have to assist people affected. We hope this night shows people there is a lot of help out there.  People can expect some educational insight as to what is being done, they can expect to hear from people that have been affected by suicide, as well as plenty of good food, wine, music and fun, as this night is also a celebration of life.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  As far as dealing with mental health issues, there are many different organisations to help with advice on recognising mental health, what to do, what to say and how to deal with this debilitating disease.  As far as a message for someone dealing with suicide, I would say to talk about your feelings, be open with your family and friends and don’t shut yourself off. The sooner you understand and accept what has happened, the sooner you can get peace of mind and ease your soul. It’s not easy. It’s a type of bereavement that never leaves you, so you have to find a way to best deal with it as it becomes part of your everyday life.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I knew nothing about mental health. But when I lost my son, George, to suicide in 2012, I was unable to accept the tragedy. I developed post-traumatic stress and depression and became suicidal. In order to help myself, I had to obtain treatment and knowledge from mental health services. Now I use this knowledge to raise awareness and help others.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I think it is a taboo subject in every community. Society in general, is very unaccepting and judgemental. The Greek community I found even more so. I found myself treated like a leper, people were cruel with their judgement and criticisms. Greeks don’t understand mental health is a chemical imbalance in the brain, a physical condition. They treat it as an aberration, a weakness, a lack of faith, and something to be avoided. They consider people be more religious and stronger.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we talk openly about the subject, to bring it out of the shadows, the safer people will be. When they know others understand, and they can put up their hands and ask for help without judgement, they will seek help. This will save lives. My son did not seek help, fearing he would be labelled, and his teammates would think less of him.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  Losing a family member to suicide is devastating. My family unit imploded. We couldn’t deal with the grief, the mental health issues and beating the guilt of the ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybes.’ That ate us up alive.  My message is – you cannot fix them, you cannot take away their pain, but you can be there for them. Show compassion and understanding, be prepared to listen and support without judgement, have empathy, and give of yourself to share their grief.  Is there anything else you’d like to say?  There are many organisations dealing with mental health and there is a lot of assistance out there. There is a life lost to suicide every three hours, the toll is horrific. We need to raise awareness with our youth, teach them to recognise mental health, tell them where to get help, and how to build resistance. With knowledge and these tools, we can make a difference, we can save lives.

"suicide","2021-01-03","Not Discerned","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:12:02","This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain  Black adults—particularly Black women—with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to have grown up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm, and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  ""The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,"" said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study.  ""This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.""  Recent research shows that since 2019, half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death—whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence—increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community.  Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don't own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020.  The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  ""For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.  ""However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.""

Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public “when dysregulated and engaging in aggressive behaviour” in a fast food restaurant, and how the video was shared thousands of times on various social media sites.  Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public (Peter Byrne/PA Wire)  The Tory peer explained how the video was reported by the boy and his mother, but the sites would not take it down, and the teen “became overwhelmed” by the negative comments, eventually trying to end his own life.  Her remarks came as peers called on the Government to create an avenue of redress for individuals unhappy with how a platform has dealt with their complaint.  She said: “This footage was shared out of context across social media with much of the response online labelling Harry as a disruptive teenager who was engaging in unacceptable aggression and vandalising public property.  “This was shared thousands of times over the course of a few weeks.  “When Harry and his mum reported it to the social media platforms, they were informed it didn’t violate community guidelines and that there was a public interest in the footage remaining online.  “The family, quite rightly, felt powerless, Harry became overwhelmed at the negative response to the footage and the comments made about his behaviour.  “Harry became withdrawn and stopped engaging. He then tried to take his own life.  “It was at this point that Harry’s mum reached out to the voluntary-run service Report Harmful Content as she had nowhere else to turn to. Report Harmful Content is run by the charity South West Grid for Learning.  “They were able to mediate between the social media sites involved to further explain the context and demonstrate the real-world harm that this footage, by remaining online, was having on the family and Harry’s mental health.  “Then, and only then, did the social media companies concerned remove the content.”  Lady Newlove gave the troubling account as peers continued their line-by-line scrutiny of the Online Safety Bill.  Peers across the House called for an independent appeals procedure for social media users who have exhausted the internal complaints process of these sites – an ombudsman separate to Ofcom to provide an impartial out-of-court resolution.  This suggestion was rejected by the Government, with technology minister Viscount Camrose saying: “The Government does remain confident that service providers are best placed to deal with individual user complaints as they will be able to take appropriate action promptly.  “This could include removing content, sanctioning offending users, reversing wrongful content removal or changing their systems and processes.”  He added that the Bill includes “super-complaints provisions” that allow for systemic issues to be raised with Ofcom, who will be required to publish a response.  Individuals can also submit complaints to Ofcom but it “will not be able to investigate or arbitrate in individual cases” – instead, these reports will be used to inform its overall enforcement activity.  Liberal Democrat peer Lord Allan of Hallam, who worked as Facebook’s director of policy in Europe for 10 years, highlighted that online providers struggle to deal with the “vast funnel of reports”, most of which are “spurious or vexatious”, and the challenge of separating the “genuinely serious reports” from the “vast amount of noise”.  He argued an independent body is needed to identify circumstances where a platform has correctly enforced its policies, but that in a particular case, like Harry’s, it is “deeply unfair, problematic and harmful for an individual”, and provide an avenue for redress.  Children’s rights campaigner Baroness Kidron said the minister responding to the debate had been given “a sticky wicket here of defending the indefensible”.  The film director and independent crossbencher said: “The Government has chosen to give individuals no recourse under the Bill and that is the current situation as it stands, and there is no concession on that matter.  “I believe I have been in meetings with people when they have been promised such things and I think it’s really important that we state what the situation is.”  Offering a meeting with peers to discuss the matter further, Viscount Camrose said: “We are giving users greater protection through the Bill.”  Labour frontbencher Lord Stevenson of Balmacara told him: “This is a very complicated Bill and you and I are now learning the hard lessons.  “It’s quite clear there’s something here that needs to be resolved and the way the Government is approaching it, it is heading towards a brick wall.”  He added that the Bill is “reinforcing an inequality of arms” between individuals and companies, concluding:  “The Government is in a mess, please sort it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvaG9tZS1uZXdzL2F1dGlzdGljLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1vbmxpbmUtc2FmZXR5LWJpbGwtYjIzNDAwODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2019-10-14","14:00:00","{""Sussex"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:02:14","Moral, ethical and religious opinions were at the heart of a lengthy debate on assisted suicide that had nearly 40 public commentors in the House Health & Human Development Committee Tuesday.  House Bill 140, sponsored by Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, permits a terminally ill adult resident of Delaware to request and self-administer medication to end the individual’s life in a humane and dignified manner.  The bill was introduced last year, but didn’t survive the session.  Under HB 140, both the individual’s attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse and a consulting physician or nurse would have to agree on an individual’s diagnosis and prognosis and believe the individual has decision-making capacity, is making an informed decision, and is acting voluntarily.  Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, who was against the bill, was among those who thought the bill would prematurely end some people’s lives, saying citing religious belief and prayer sometimes prolongs life.  “My father was diagnosed with lung cancer and was given 18 months,” Briggs King said. “He lived 18 years.”  Rep. Mike Smith, R-Pike Creek, questioned a major talking point for proponents of the bill, which was that 70% of Delawareans support assisted suicide, and that is consistent nationally across surveys.  He said the survey question, which asked whether a health care provider honoring a terminally ill patient’s request to end his or her life should be subject to criminal or civil penalties.  “Doctors are not trained in this. Doctors are trained to treat disease,” he said. “They’re not trained to teach you when to die, or how to die.”  Rep. Stell Parker Selby, D-Milton, said she received dozens of emails from Sussex County residents that were in opposition to the bill.  She said when her mother died, she and her family agreed that she wouldn’t go on any machines or have doctors give her anything, and most people in Sussex agree that they want to die without any assistance.  One common form of assisted suicide that was discussed was a powder that is mixed with a small amount of water or other solution that a patient drinks and typically dies within a few hours.  However, the powder often causes nausea and patients can vomit it up causing a delayed reaction.  READ: Food service workers, paraprofessionals could get raises  Doctors from out-of-state testified that they give patients medications to treat nausea before giving them the solution to ensure it works as it’s supposed to, with a painless death a few hours later.  One speaker said 80% of patients who take the solution die within one hour.  Smith and some others pushed the fact that patients must be in the right state of mind while making the decision, and even suggested mandating a psychiatric evaluation prior to making a decision.  “The physicians regularly are assessing the mental capability of their patients,” Baumbach said.  The idea of assisted suicide legislation has been thrown around in the General Assembly for nearly a decade without success.  Personal anecdotes were shared throughout the meeting.  Kevin Hensely, R-Kevin Hensley, R-Middletown, said his mom, who recently died, wanted to go out her way, by her own choice.  “’I’m sorry to lay that all out here,” he said. “But it’s really fresh, and it’s helped me see it from a different perspective.”  Proponents of the bill said someone who is terminally ill and in pain should be the one to make a decision on their life.  Because several committee members left sometime during the meeting, the committee did not have enough voting members to declare if it was released or not.  That will be made clear hours after the meeting on the bill’s tracker site.  Also Tuesday:  House Bill 150, dubbed the Cover All Delaware Children Act and sponsored by Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Greenville, would help Delaware children who are undocumented and do not have access to routine or preventative healthcare, including vaccinations and physicals, because they cannot afford the services.  HB 150 directs the Department of Health and Social Services to develop and operate a limited medical assistance program for children in Delaware who are not otherwise covered, including children who are not documented.  A child resident in the state whose family income is low enough that they would qualify on that basis for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, but is not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, is eligible for coverage and medical care under this Act.  The coverage would be co-extensive with that provided by CHIP and Medicaid, except that it would not include in-patient care at a hospital or other healthcare facility.  HB 150 also requires the state to submit a plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services so that the state can take advantage of the federal CHIP option to include coverage of pregnant women regardless of immigration status.  HB 150 had enough voting members to constitute a quorum, and legislators voted to release the bill, which will now head to the House floor.  Senate Bill 98, sponsored by Sen. Nicole Poore, D-Delaware City, also was released and is on its way to the House floor.  SB 98 would allow dental clinicians possessing a DDS or DMDS to participate in the Health Care Provider Loan Repayment grant program. The bill also extends the time in which providers may apply for a Healthcare Provider Loan Repayment grant from six months to two years following completion of their graduate education.

We urge the Senate to follow through and help state authorities understand the root causes of this problem.  A 2022 state-mandated report on suicide prevention revealed that the number of suicides among Texas children in foster care jumped from one in 2017 to four in 2021. There are about 50,000 youths in the state’s foster care system.  Foster care youth experience higher rates of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Sadly, their suicide rate is three times higher than that of the general youth population in Texas, according to the state’s suicide prevention report. Still, it’s the job of Texas’ child welfare agency to protect children in its care from harm or death.  Understanding why children in foster care attempt suicide can help the state prevent deaths, said Angela Ott, a policy fellow at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health, a nonprofit affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin. Currently, the state is not required to report suicide attempts.  Opinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  House Bill 4065, which was approved 145-0 in the lower chamber, would require the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to maintain records and collect data on suicide attempts of children in foster care. The Senate now has to take up the bill.  The causes of suicide are complex, and they must be addressed as part of the state’s larger effort to support better mental health programming and infrastructure.  The Legislature is looking at increasing funding for mental health programs. Senate Bill 26, which has been forwarded to the House for debate, would fund grants for community-based organizations that work with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The bill would give priority to organizations that work with children considered high risk for mental health issues, according to The Texas Tribune.  Better data collection must inform the strategies that the state adopts to prevent suicides in the foster care system. These are Texas’ most vulnerable children, and they deserve our best effort.

Two days before the murder-suicide, Tavarez-Rodriguez called 911, claiming his wife had ""too much to drink.""  ""This is not an emergency, this is a call for service,"" he said to the 911 operator.  He said on the call that they had gone to the gas station and were eating dinner at home when he decided to call 911.  The only thing Tavarez-Rodriguez told the operator is that his wife was too drunk; he makes no mention of a domestic disturbance.  ""I wouldn’t call it a disturbance; I just want to cover myself,"" Tavarez-Rodriguez said. ""I just want to make sure that everything is settled.""  The operator asked if they had access to any weapons. He said yes, they did have access to weapons, but said the weapons were locked in a safe.  Two days later, the couple was found shot to death in their home.  On April 28, a Fayetteville 911 operator contacted the Verizon security assistance team to request an emergency ping on a phone.  When asked if this involves danger of death, the operator responded, ""Yes.""  The operator said the emergency ping was in regard to ""a subject who may be attempting to harm himself or his wife.""  After Tavarez-Rodriguez failed to report for duty, officers went to his home to check on him.  A call was made on April 28, in which an officer requested to do a wellness check at the couple's home.  ""I didn't want to call it over the radio because it's one of our officers,"" he said.  When the officers arrived, the couple was found dead inside their home.

"suicide","2020-07-10","10:00:00","{""Dover"", ""Delaware"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:07:38","DOVER, Del. – Delaware lawmakers unveiled a bill on Tuesday that would establish a funding source for the state’s 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to improve its continuum of care.  In 2020, Congress passed the 988 National Suicide Designation Act, requiring a new and universal three-digit calling code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to how 911 is used for public safety emergencies. However, state and local governments were responsible for implementing the 988 system, which launched in July of 2022, though Congress allowed states to assess a fee on cell phone bills to recover the costs related to 988 and the associated crisis services.  House Bill 160, sponsored by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Senator Nicole Poore, would implement a 60-cent monthly surcharge on each wireless access line, establish a fund for the surcharge, and create a board composed state agencies and stakeholders to report on the state’s crisis intervention services. It would also institute a one-time, 60-cent fee on prepaid services. Under the bill, the funds collected through the surcharge would specifically be earmarked for operating the 988 system, providing crisis intervention services and staffing associated services. Unspent money would revert to the fund each year and could not be used for general state expenses.  “People in crisis need to know when they call 988 that they are being connected to knowledgeable, caring professionals who will help steer them through incredibly difficult situations. However, 988 calls in Delaware are currently funneled to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, which is chronically understaffed. We need to provide our behavioral health professionals with the tools and resources they need to save lives. Establishing a small monthly surcharge, similar to way we fund 911 emergency services, will strengthen our mental health services in Delaware and ensure that a person reaching out for help receives quality care. HB 160 builds on our ongoing efforts to address the mental health crisis and provide a continuum of care for residents,” said Rep. Longhurst.  “Delaware can’t sit by and hope that the behavioral health crisis that has been affecting our nation for decades will simply go away on its own,” said Sen. Poore, the Senate prime sponsor of HB 160. “That’s why I have joined with Rep. Longhurst and our colleagues in the Delaware General Assembly to make real investments in a system of care capable of helping people who need it most. This legislation builds on that work by giving our new behavioral health crisis and suicide prevention help line the staff and resources it needs to deescalate emergencies, quickly provide families with immediate access to support and services, and most importantly, save lives.”  Currently, Delaware’s crisis lines handle about 25,000 contacts, though state officials say they expect those numbers to increase due to a greater need for behavioral health services, with a possible growth of 60% or more.  HB 160 would allow funds collected to be used for the establishment and operation of the 988 system and center, including staffing, providing crisis intervention services, providing specialized training, raising public awareness, and data collection and analysis.  HB 160 has been assigned to the House Health & Human Development Committee.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtZHQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvZGVsLWxhd21ha2Vycy1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtOTg4LWZ1bmRpbmctYmlsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:37:18","K-pop star Haesoo has reportedly died by suicide. The 29-year-old trot singer was found dead by the police on 12 May, reported Naver. This is the second death of a K-pop star to hit the South Korean entertainment industry in less than a month.  In mid-April, famous K-pop star Moonbin’s death had left fans shocked globally. The 25-year-old member of the boy band Astro appeared to “have taken his own life”, as per the police.  These tragic incidents have once again put the spotlight on the dark side of the K-pop world and the Korean entertainment industry.  Series of cases  26-year-old actor Jung Chae-yull was found dead in her home on 11 April. Another actor Yoo Joo-eun died last year at the age of 27.  Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), passed away in October 2019. The 25-year-old had faced cyberbullying throughout her career. A month later, her close friend and a K-pop star, 28-year-old Goo Hara, was found dead at home.  In a rare admission for a K-pop star, Goo had previously revealed in a video that she was suffering from depression.  In December 2017, the lead singer of the boy band Shinee, Kim Jong-hyun, died in a suspected suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.  In a note shared a day before his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt “broken from inside”.  “The depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,” Kim wrote, adding he “couldn’t defeat it anymore”, reported The Guardian.  The heavy cost of fame  According to experts, a variety of factors contribute to higher pressure on young entertainers in South Korea than pop stars of other countries.  This includes presenting a perfect image in public, a stringent training schedule and a culture of online bullying, noted Variety magazine.  K-pop artist Amber Liu opened up about the intense industry pressure in 2020. She told CBS Mornings, “If you aren’t under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut”. “You’re told what to do, what to say, what to think.”  As per CNN, a K-pop star works for an average of 16 hours or so a day, doing everything from dance practices and singing lessons to language classes and camera training.  K-pop artists have to undergo a rigorous training period, even preparing for 10 years or more sometimes before they can make their debut.  There is also extreme competition in the industry for K-pop stars or “idols” as they are called.  “The control from celebrities’ agencies and fan culture are two main contributors to the massive stress Korean stars face,” Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine, told BBC.  South Korea has “fandoms” or organised groups of admirers who spend time and money to prop up their favourite stars and target their opponents, reported Daily Mail.  The stars, in return, have to maintain their perfectly crafted image.  In South Korea’s conservative society, scrutiny of entertainers starts once they debut, with their every move being closely watched by everyone, especially the fans.  As per Daily Mail, drug use or drunken driving can end careers in the industry.  “Korea has a very strict moral standard for celebrities compared to other countries,” Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-kun told BBC.  “If a star behaves only a little different from what’s perceived ‘decent’, the public would attack them. And it’s hard for a star to ignore this kind of assault because of the high social pressure from strong collectivism.”  “Koreans have a strict moral code for their celebrities,” Jeeheng Lee, a culture expert at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, was quoted as saying by Variety. “Demonising the K-pop industry alone doesn’t solve the problem. Sulli and Hara suffered more from misogynistic attacks than from K-pop fans.”  As The Diplomat said in December 2022, while the Korean Wave overtakes the world, “mistreatment, suicide, slave labour contracts, gruelling training schedules, ‘no dating’ clauses, sexual assault, and sexualisation of minors by K-pop agencies cannot go unnoticed”.  ALSO READ: How toilet paper in Japan is helping suicidal youth  Mental health stigma  South Korea has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, as per Bloomberg.  BBC noted that suicide cases among people in their 20s are increasing in the Asian country.  While the stigma around mental health is not limited to South Korea, the added pressure from the country’s entertainment industry has made matters worse for its young celebrities.  Royce Lee, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, told Variety in 2019: “All cultures have a stigma against mental illness. It’s not uniquely Korean”.  “But when talking about celebrities, the intersection of culture and psychology becomes very important. The idea that one must please everybody is both a very Korean idea and a very common problem with fame. So it is a double whammy.”  According to Paik Jong-woo, a psychiatrist and the director of the Korea Suicide Prevention Center, artists are hesitant to approach mental health professionals due to “fear of public shame” and their hectic schedules, CNN reported in 2019.  Speaking to CBS This Morning, Liu, who was a former bandmate of Sulli, talked about the stigma against mental illnesses in the country. “When (people) hear you’re getting help they’re like, ‘What? Why are you getting help? That’s weird’,” she said in 2020.  “That stigma against mental health is just so strong.”  As per reports, while several agencies have started therapy sessions for trainees and stars, the problem of stigmatisation continues to persist.

"suicide","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:54:00","ASHTABULA, Ohio — So far in 2023, 19 school shootings have taken place across the United States as of May 16, according to EdWeek.A group of students at Braden Middle School in Ashtabula has had enough.  ""As a kid, it’s very disappointing,"" eighth grader Josiah Pope said.  ""I get pretty scared because you don’t know when it can happen,"" eighth grader J.R. Crooks said. ""It can happen at any time to anybody.""  For the past year, students in a class titled ""Youth for the Future"" created a new way to market 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number that replaced the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline last July.  News 5 The students pose with advisers Sally Bradley and Joslin Seeds and their poster after a presentation with area leaders at the Ashtabula County Building Resiliency Together (BRT) Collaborative meeting on May 10.  ""We want to change how people look at [988],"" classroom adviser Joslin Seeds said. ""It isn’t just suicide. It’s everything.""  The goal of the poster, which features a student wearing a hoodie, is to connect with students that the lifeline could also be used for other mental health challenges instead of strictly suicidal thoughts.  The idea, Seeds explained, came from watching school shooting after school shooting and learning that in some cases, the shooter tried to reach out for help.  RELATED: She checked her Instagram. She didn't expect a message from The Covenant School shooter.  ""Young kids shouldn’t be dying,"" Pope added. ""We want to get our program out there to as much people as we can.""  ""I think it might be one of the most important things I’ve done and might be in my life,"" Crooks explained.  In student Haiden Peterson’s case, fear took over his house.  ""When I was in third grade, my mom home-schooled me and the rest of my siblings because she was scared of someone coming into the building and shooting us,"" Haiden explained.  988 launched in July 2022  Last year, 988 was unveiled across the country as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, replacing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  The new number is a chance for anyone across the country to call or text and reach a trained professional who can help those experiencing a mental health or an addiction crisis.  In Ohio, experts were expecting around a 40% increase in calls when the number changed, but tell News 5 they’ve only seen a slight uptick.  Across the state, that averages out to about 8,600 calls per month handled by counselors.  Help Network of Northeast Ohio handles the 988 calls for those living in Mahoning, Trumbull and Ashtabula counties.  ""Today, the effects of the pandemic appear to be more mental health,"" said Vince Brancaccio, CEO of the Help Network of Northeast Ohio. ""We're getting a lot more calls from people traumatized by the pandemic. They're feeling depressed, they're anxious and frightened and calling saying they need mental health.""  It comes at a time when, whether it’s trauma, or the harmful effects of technology and social media, the impacts on our children's mental well-being are everywhere.  ""We have a youth mental health crisis in our country,"" U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during a visit to Cleveland in April. ""We have to make sure counselors are in schools, that there's more mental health care in hospitals and clinics.""

The class, run by Seeds and Sally Bradley, meets every day with its all-male class to deal with the academic, social and emotional needs.  ""We want the kids we see every day to normalize those feelings of depression and anxiety,"" Seeds explained.  Already, the campaign, which has not been finalized, is getting attention.  ""Those young men, their voice is a force to be reckoned with,"" said Joleen Sundquist, Chief Clinical Officer at the Ashtabula-based Community Counseling Center. ""There are thoughts that [988 is] just for people taking their own life. As our 'Youth for the Future' students said, it’s for hurt people who are thinking about hurting people. That could be themselves or someone else.""  The next step will be for the poster to be finalized by the Ashtabula County Mental Health Recovery Services Board. If approved, the poster could end up on billboards, inside grocery stores, schools and more.  The students have their own ideas as well about how to catch the attention of their peers: from Instagram stories and Snapchat to the big screen at a Cleveland Cavaliers game.

"suicide","2022-01-10","Not Discerned","{""Buffalo"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:00","Social media giants are facing new fresh pressure on the lasting impact on “addicted” teens – including protests, lawsuits, and warnings from psychologists on harmful content proliferating online.  Now parents tell The Post how their families have suffered as social media severely impacted their teenage children, even driving them to suicide.  The American Psychological Association released 10 new recommendations last week on protecting teens while they use social apps, underlining the growing concern among parents, experts, and lawmakers about interacting with others through phones and screens for hours unchecked.  The guidance does not suggest specific daily limits for teens. But it urges parents to keep children away from content about “beauty” and “appearance” – saying comments on photos can lead to poor body image, eating disorders, and depression, particularly among girls.  Parents protested at Snap’s headquarters last week, saying their children died as a result of the company’s Snapchat platform. One mom who spoke to The Post, Rosellene Bronstein, said her son took his own life after being bullied on it. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  It also tells parents to make sure children are not stopped by social media from getting eight hours of sleep, to keep them away from screens an hour before bedtime, and to monitor usage for problematic content.  “Within the field, there is pretty clear consensus that it is not how much time kids are on screen that matters as much as what they are doing during that screen time,” the APA’s chief science officer, Mitch Prinstein, who helped develop the advice, told The Post.  Prinstein said teens should focus on homework or reading the news instead of passive scrolling or exposure to potentially destructive content.  “It may be easiest for parents to consider how much their children are balancing social interactions that allow for the development of mature social competence as compared to the amount of social interaction that is via social media,” Prinstein said.  Protests from the parents of dead teenagers are only part of the pressure on social media platforms, with members of both parties in Congress proposing bans on its use for under-13s and new restrictions for other teens. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  Social media giants, including Meta’s Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and smaller platforms including Roblox, Discord, Reddit, and Twitch, are facing not just criticism from parents and psychologists but calls from both parties in the Senate for an all-out ban on their use by under-13s and severe restrictions for 13- to 18-year-olds.  And relatives of the 10 people murdered by a racist gunman in the Buffalo, New York, supermarket shooting last May are now suing Meta, Snapchat’s parent company Snap, Discord, Reddit, 4chan, YouTube’s owner Alphabet and Twitch’s parent company Amazon. They claim the platforms radicalized the teen gunman before the mass shooting.  One school resource officer told The Post he tells parents to keep kids off social media until “at least 13” because of the risk that they will be exploited for nudes or money by extortionists.  Corp. David Gomez, an officer with the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said he operates multiple fake accounts to see what “kind of drug issues” are impacting the area, as well as to search for local runaways. He regularly gets contacted by men and women while portraying both boys and girls, he said.  Corp. David Gomez, of the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said “dangers” await young users of social media sites, including scammers in search of money or sexually explicit content.  “I just regurgitate what the kids say and then I get adult predators who want to meet for sex,” Gomez, 50, said. “As a community, we need to increase our education of parents and kids about social media dangers.”  He also cultivates relationships offline with students, but he realizes authorities are outnumbered.  “This is like emptying the river with one cup at a time,” Gomez said. “Most adults cannot fathom the amount of kids that are becoming victims to these things.”  SNAPCHAT BULLIES TOLD MY SON: ‘GO KILL YOURSELF’  Rosellene Bronstein, 49, of Chicago, traveled to California for a protest outside Snap headquarters in Santa Monica on Friday because she does not want another family to lose a child to suicide – as she did last year.  She joined dozens of parents calling for stricter regulations on social media companies and expressing support for the proposed Kids Online Safety Act. The measure, proposed by a bipartisan group of senators, would require annual independent audits assessing risks to teens and increased parental controls.  Nate with his parents, Rob and Rosellene Bronstein, during a trip in 2020, roughly two years before the bullied teen committed suicide. Social media sites deliberately use algorithms to “create addiction” among young users, his mother told The Post. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “The algorithms are deliberately designed to create addiction to the content our children are exposed to,” she continued. “And couple with our children’s desire to be validated by likes, shares and views, these online environments are extremely harmful to our children’s mental health.”  Bronstein’s son, Nate, took his own life in January 2022 following relentless bullying by more than 20 classmates at the Latin School of Chicago.  Just weeks before hanging himself, the 15-year-old had received a Snapchat message from a basketball teammate urging him to “go kill yourself,” she recalled.  Bronstein said Nate reported the abuse to school officials, but his parents weren’t informed until it was too late. She and her husband Rob Bronstein later filed a $100 million lawsuit against the school, alleging their son was initially targeted by bullies who wrongly believed he was unvaccinated.  “Social media platforms do not care about our children. They only care about profits.” Rosellene Bronstein  They also joined a class-action lawsuit that accuses platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and others of being designed to maximize screen time and encourage addictive behavior, often resulting in emotional, mental or physical harm.  “It’s really up to us parents to come together to create our own societal shift and say, ‘Enough is enough, we’re not going to put our kids on social media,’” Bronstein, whose daughters Mia and Sydney are 19 and 15, told The Post.  Nate Bronstein, 15, was found hanged in his family’s home just one month after he received a Snapchat message urging him to “go kill yourself,” his mother told The Post.  She said parents should consider keeping their teens away from social media altogether if possible, likening abuse of sites like Facebook or TikTok to smoking or doing drugs.  “It’s the same idea, it has to be applied to social media,” Bronstein said. “But parents aren’t there yet. And what really upsets me is that parents have their heads down in the sand, thinking this is not a crisis. That’s the issue.”  She also wants Snapchat to allow parents to monitor all the content its teenage users receive by permitting third-party apps such as Bark to monitor messages, something the platform does not currently allow.  A $100 million lawsuit filed by Robert Bronstein, left, and his wife Rosellene alleges the Latin School of Chicago committed “willful failure” to stop continual bullying of their son Nate. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “If I would’ve been able to use Bark with Snapchat, the minute he would’ve gotten that message, I would’ve gotten like a three-alarm alert on my phone,” she said. “We would have been able to save our son.”  Users must be at least 13 to create a Snapchat account and teens receive an alert if they’ve accepted a friend request from an adult. The app also recently launched its “Family Center,” a tool allowing parents to track friends of their teens without getting access to their messages, a company spokesperson told The Post.  PREDATORS AT PLAY  April Veneigh, 39, wants other parents to know that young adolescents – like her 12-year-old daughter Kaelyn – can be targeted outside traditional social media giants such as Instagram or TikTok.  Kaelyn, then 11, connected with another user on the online gaming platform Roblox early last year. The chat later moved to Discord, a voice-video-text service where most conversations are private.  The other user claimed he was 14, and started to “groom” Kaelyn, now in the sixth grade, by sending explicit videos and requesting nude photos from her, Veneigh told The Post.  April Veneigh, 39, of King City, Oregon, with her two daughters, Kimberly, 16, and Kaelyn, 12. An online predator recently targeted Veneigh’s younger daughter, she told The Post. Courtesy of April Veneigh  “He claimed he was 14, but was very advanced for a 14-year-old,” said Veneigh, of King City, Oregon. “He got her to think we were abusive and that she could only trust him with everything.”  Veneigh said she noticed changes in Kaelyn’s behavior after she connected with the stranger, including severe anxiety and panic attacks.  That led her to contact her cellphone provider, Verizon, which was able to show the files Kaelyn had been sending, leading to the horrifying discovery that she had been groomed into sending naked images.  Veneigh then called cops, who told her the investigation would include FBI officials since the other user was suspected to be in Wisconsin. No arrests have been so far, she said.  “I’m still waiting to hear back from police and what they find,” Veneigh said.  Veneigh said other parents should regularly check with cellphone providers to find out what files are being sent since all data, including sexual content, is backed up. The “cloud doesn’t lie,” she said.  “You don’t know who is really on the other end of that computer. There are too many face filters. People can be older but make themselves look like a child. It’s scary,” Veneigh continued. “You also don’t know who’s going to be grooming your child.”  The mother of two urged other parents to get their kids away from screens with exercise or running errands.  “I’m embarrassed and ashamed this is happening to my family,” Veneigh said. “It’s so depressing.”  HOW TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM LED TO ANOREXIA  Jon Sayah, 61, of Dallas, said his three children use TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat at least four hours per day. “They’re hooked on social media,” he told The Post.  But three years ago, at the peak of the pandemic, his eldest daughter, Lucy, 20, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, an illness he believes was exacerbated by her social media use.  “She is just getting better now,” Jon told The Post. “Social media provided detailed strategies on eating less, strategic foods to eat, behaviors to avoid the professional check-ins, and most important what her friends were doing and what she was missing or not included.”  Jon Sayah, his wife Julie, and their children (from left) Betsy, 18, Lucy, 20, and Dustin, 13. The couple tried to enforce restricted use of social media, but that only caused more friction, Jon told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Lucy, now a sophomore at Northwestern University, said she wishes she had not become so invested in social media. She first logged onto Instagram at 13, later joining TikTok.  “Social media has caused me to constantly compare myself to others online and has greatly contributed to the onset of my anorexia nervosa,” she said, adding she no longer uses others’ posts to gauge herself.  “I would encourage parents, especially of young teens, to set boundaries with their children on social media use and time spent as it can have an extremely negative and maladaptive impact,” Lucy told The Post.  “Social media does not allow children and young teens to live in the present and instead forces them to view false realities of other individuals’ lives, which has the potential to be harmful.”  Dustin, 13, Betsy, 18, and Lucy, 20, would rather be in front of a screen instead of spending time together as a family because “they’re hooked on social media,” their father told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Sayah’s 13-year-old son, Dustin, has already learned plenty on social media about sex and alcohol – topics normally associated with high schoolers, he said.  “Not sure yet what the impact is of growing up too fast,” said Sayah, who said attempts to restrict and lessen social media usage only caused more drama and tension in the family. Algorithms tailored for young users make them especially vulnerable, possibly triggering harmful behavior that seemingly appears “normal and popular,” he said.  “It is dominating their time and allows them to connect without ‘real connections,’” Sayah said. “It is a substitute for so many other activities.  “Conversations in the car, figuring out how to spend downtime, being creative, being uncomfortable trying to make friends or spending time on passions are all sacrificed when they can ‘kill’ several hours on social media a day during any time.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3NvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kcm92ZS1vdXItdGVlbmFnZXJzLXRvLWFub3JleGlhLWFuZC1zdWljaWRlL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3NvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kcm92ZS1vdXItdGVlbmFnZXJzLXRvLWFub3JleGlhLWFuZC1zdWljaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-07-18","Not Discerned","{""RockHill"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:10:00","Sextortionists sent a grieving South Carolina lawmaker a sick message gloating about driving his teenage son to suicide — while threatening to release nude photos and demanding more money.  State Rep. Brandon Guffey, 54, told CNN that he got the Instagram message on the day his son Gavin would have turned 18 — and less than a month after he found him dead last year at their family home in Rock Hill.  “It said, ‘Did I tell you your son begged for his life,’ with a laughing face emoji,” Guffey told the outlet.  The sick, tragic crime was behind Guffey introducing “Gavin’s Law,” which was passed by state senators Thursday and is expected to be signed into law soon.  It threatens scammers who extort a minor or an at-risk adult with up to five years in prison for a first offense.  Guffey said he had no idea his son, a recent high school grad, was being blackmailed when he found him dead in the bathroom last July after hearing the loud thump of his body hitting the floor after he shot himself.  The lawmaker only realized 17-year-old son Gavin was being blackmailed after sextortionists started messaging him, too. Facebook / Gavin âGoopâ Guffey Remembrance  “My initial thought was, this is my fault — I left the gun out,” he said, adding he will never forget the pain of realizing his son died by suicide.  The sick plot emerged in part after the sextortionists started barraging Guffey and his family — including his younger son, Coen, 16 — with Instagram messages demanding more money.  They then realized that Gavin thought he was sharing nude photos with a young woman who first sent him pics — only to be told they’d be released to everyone he knew unless he paid blackmail.  The sextortionists started messaging the family of Gavin (here on his graduation day) after his death. Family Handout  Gavin had used Venmo to send the scammers all the money he had: $25.  “He was telling them he would get them more money, please don’t send these images out,” Guffey told CNN.  “They didn’t care.”  The grieving dad said the scammers used disappearing messages to make “kids feel safe” that their intimate pics would be scrubbed.  “What they don’t realize is, someone has another device recording that device,” he said.  “If you can extort 10 teenage boys that aren’t gonna say anything for $100 each, and do all that with one image that you got from a girl, it’s fairly simple.  “And teenage boys, whenever they see they’re getting that attention (from a girl), they’re not necessarily thinking.”  The FBI said that last year there were at least 7,000 reports of sextortion of minors, with at least 3,000 victims, mostly boys. More than a dozen are known to have died by suicide.  The true number may well be way higher because “the shame, fear, and confusion children feel when they are caught in this cycle often prevents them from asking for help or reporting the abuse,” the FBI says.  When Gavin died, his dad was in the middle of his successful run for state representative — and briefly considered quitting to focus on hunting for his son’s scammers.  “My wife said, ‘Absolutely not. You’re one of the few people that have a voice that can get out there and truly make a difference,’” he recalled.  The lawmaker’s wife persuaded him to use his office to help other young victims. Facebook / Brandon Guffey  He stayed in office, with “Gavin’s Law” his first order of business.  “I feel like he (Gavin) would want me trying to save additional kids from ever having to feel the way that he felt at that time,” he said proudly.  An FBI spokesperson told CNN that no arrests have been made in the Guffey case. The rep declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing investigation.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:27:29","Share this  Article Facebook  Twitter  Email You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license. University Boston University  Researchers have uncovered a marker in the brain that could help identify people at a higher risk of suicide.  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  As reported in the paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says lead author Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, assistant professor of psychiatry a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  The researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  The findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting, Jagger-Rickels says.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  The Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health supported the work.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:30:58","A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  The report, The Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data Summary & Trends Report: 2011–2021, focuses on a decade of research on youth sexual activity, substance use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, violence, poor mental health, unstable housing, school connectedness, and parental monitoring, while also exploring the data by sex, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, and sex of sexual contacts.  CDC data from 2021 showed “significant increases in the percentage of youth who seriously considered suicide, made a suicide plan, and attempted suicide,” and that was true across all demographic categories. It was up to 22% compared to the 2011 report which showed that 15.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 months before the survey. In this latest study, female students were 16% more likely than males to make this consideration, at 30% and 14%, respectively. By race and ethnicity, the youth with the highest rates of ideation were youth identifying as Native American at 27%, followed by youth identifying as multiracial at 24%, youth identifying as white at 23%, youth identifying as Black or Hispanic both at 22%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander at 21%, and youth identifying as Asian at 18%. The rates spiked even higher for youth identifying as LGBTQ+ at 45% compared to 15% among youth identifying as heterosexual. The report noted that nearly 60% of female students and 70% of LGBTQ+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness and that 10% of female students and 20% of LGBTQ+ students had gone as far as attempting suicide.  “As we saw in the 10 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health among students overall continues to worsen, with more than 40% of high school students feeling so sad or helpless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year—a possible indication of the experience of depressive symptoms,” the report stated. That’s 14% higher than 2011.  “Nearly all indicators of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased from 2011 to 2021,” the report noted, although it showed no increase in the number of students treated for suicidal injuries.  Contributors to Instability in Mental Health  While the data showed an overall decrease in bullying and risky behaviors involving sex and substances, and a high level of parental monitoring among most youth, there was plenty of alarming data that could help to account for the continued decline in mental health among female students. For example, in 2021, almost 20% of them reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and 14% had been physically forced to have sex.  Other contributing factors for mental health decline among all students might include unstable housing, not feeling connected at school, and fear of violence. The report notes that a high level of parental monitoring, defined as “parents or other adults in a family most of the time or always knowing where they were going or who they would be with, and school connectedness, which it defines as “the feeling among adolescents that people at their school care about them, their well-being, and their success,” both correlate to decreased sexual risk, substance abuse, experiences with violence, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Overall, only 3% of students had experienced unstable housing, although the rates were disproportionately higher for Black and Native American students, as well as among youth identifying as LGBTQ+ who had any same-sex partners. Overall, 7% of students had been threatened or injured by a weapon at school, down about 3% from 2011 among males and unchanged among females. The percentages decreased among Asian and Hispanic students and there was no change among Blacks and whites. However, LGBTQ+ students were more likely than their peers to be threatened or injured in this scenario. And overall, 9% of students had to go to school in the past 30 days because of fear of violence. The rates in this category were especially high among students identifying as Native Americans at 13%, Black at 12%, Hispanic at 11%, and LGBTQ+ at 14%, and females were 3% more likely to stay home than their male counterparts who reported not going at 7%.  Finally, it’s debatable whether school, the setting where 95% of youth spend their daily lives, was a welcoming and safe environment. While white students felt more connected than any other group at 65%, only 61% of all youth surveyed said they felt close to people at school. Females were even less likely to feel that way at 58% compared to 65% among males. Only 54% of Native American and Black youth felt close to people at school and the numbers were only slightly higher among Hispanic youth at 58%. Meanwhile, only 58% of LGBTQ+ youth felt close to someone at school compared to 65% of their heterosexual counterparts.  Recommendations  “These data make it clear that young people in the U.S. are collectively experiencing a level of distress that calls on us to act,” the report said in its key findings section. “Although the primary goal of school is academic learning, they play a key role in shaping mental, physical, and social growth.”  To address this, the CDC made the following recommendations:  Increase school connectedness across all grades.  Increase access to needed services by improving school-based services and connecting youth and families to community-based sources of care.  Implement greater health education for all grades.  The report also recommended that schools reference the CDC’s What Works in Schools program, an evidence-based approach to the above recommendations that have led to improvements in sexual behavior, substance abuse, violence, and missed school due to safety concerns. It also noted that “schools that implemented policies and practices to support LGBTQ+ youth not only saw improvements in health and well-being for young people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, but also their heterosexual counterparts.”  An Intersectional Perspective  While the ten-year report did not explore the prevalence of these issues at the intersection of race and gender identity, a supplemental study released in April did use unadjusted logistic regression models to explore prevalence across some subgroups from 2019 to 2021. The study, titled Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among High School Students — Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 2021, showed a significant spike in serious consideration of suicide among Black, Hispanic, and white females students. For example, suicide ideation was up 6% among Hispanic females, 6.8% among Black, and 7% among white females, compared to 4.6% among multiracial females, 2.2% among Asian females, and .2% among Native Americans. It also showed a higher increase in suicide attempts requiring medical treatment for multiracial, Black, and Hispanic females, up 3.7%, 1.7%, and 1.1% respectively compared to an increase of .3% among Asian females and .6% among white ones, with no change for Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander females.  While this supplement does not include data on suicidal tendencies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender identity, UnidosUS knows Latinx students identifying as LGBTQ+ already are indeed struggling with mental health and safety issues. According to the 2021 UnidosUS fact sheet Latinx LGBTQ+ Students and Their Experiences, 22% of Latinx students identify as LGBTQ+, 40% have experienced assault and/or harassment due to race or gender orientation, 57% feel unsafe at school due to their gender expression, and 35% are likely to miss school because they feel unsafe there. The fact sheet also notes that 70% of these students experience symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, 64% major depressive disorder, 43% have considered suicide, and 18% have attempted suicide. And a new UnidosUS factsheet on mental health shows that Latino LGBTQ youth are 30% more likely to attempt suicide than non-Latino LGBTQ youth.  “The data shows that youth with intersectional identities, such as students of color who also identify as LGBTQ+ are disproportionately at risk and therefore it is important to recognize their unique experiences in order to equitably address their mental health and offer culturally and linguistically relevant supports and interventions,” says Amalia Chamorro, education policy project director at UnidosUS.  South Florida-based Afro-Latina LGBTQ+ youth human rights advocate Ayari Aguayo says the pandemic contributed to feelings of isolation, as well as exposure to violence and unwanted sexual behavior. She cited societal phenomena such as the hypertextualization of girls of color as contributors to exploitation and low self-esteem, and she fears feelings of sadness and hopelessness are likely to get even worse in a state like Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis has pushed through legislation banning classroom discussions of gender identity and some Black studies curricula, further adding to the fragile mental health of youth who feel further stigmatized.  “It’s all layered with not being in an empowered community, not having the tools, workshops, or the support services,” Aguayo said, adding that during the pandemic, she and her colleagues found they were able to combat these concerns by helping to introduce youth to inspiring characters who had been in similar life situations.  “We brought role models who were courageous and vulnerable, who said, ‘I grew up with abuse and this is how I became resilient, this is what I did to overcome it,’” said Aguayo.  This type of intervention is congruent with CDC study’s goal of maintaining high-quality surveillance systems, conducting, and translating youth supporting scientific research, and helping school systems provide health education for safer, more supportive learning.  In its fact sheets and other policy and advocacy materials, UnidosUS’s policy team encourages schools and districts to fund GSA, ethnic clubs, and staff professional development programs focused on improving mental health and creating diverse and inclusive learning environments. It also urges the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to enforce existing federal laws created to prevent and combat gender and race discrimination. And it also wants to see that same office disaggregate data to reflect multiple identities of students related to race, ethnicity, and gender identity when conducting student-focused research on topics like this one.  A February announcement by the U.S. Department of Education that it had received $188 million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support mental health and student wellness can help schools provide critical and necessary support. UnidosUS supported the passage of this legislation.  “As the President outlined in his State of the Union address, we must do more to tackle our nation’s growing mental health crisis, which is particularly acute among our youth,” Domestic Policy Advisor to the President Susan Rice said in the U.S. Department of Education’s February 16 announcement.  “Mental health and wellness have profound implications for our students, their academic success, and their overall outcomes, and we know that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in that same announcement. “The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act represents an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to supercharge efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizQFodHRwczovL3VuaWRvc3VzLm9yZy9wcm9ncmVzcy1yZXBvcnQvYW1lcmljYXMteW91dGgtaW4tZW1vdGlvbmFsLWNyaXNpcy10aGUtY2Rjcy1sYXRlc3Qtc3R1ZHktb24teW91dGgtcmlzay1iZWhhdmlvci1zaG93cy1oaWdoLWxldmVscy1vZi1zdWljaWRlLWFtb25nLWdpcmxzLWFuZC15b3V0aC1pZGVudGlmeWluZy1hcy1oaXNwYW5pYy1hbmQtb3ItbGdidHEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-10","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:28:58","Image by Sasin Tipchai from Pixabay  There has been much discussion recently about adolescent mental health. Some of this comes in the wake of the alarming CDC report released in February showing unprecedented levels of sadness and suicidality, especially in teen girls. Some say social media is to blame for this recent rise in mental health problems, and I remain skeptical.  But before we try to understand what variables might be causing the problem, we should first clarify whether there is, in fact, a problem, and what exactly the problem is. Some of this depends on how we interpret mental health trend data. Is the American adolescent suicide rate at an all-time high? And how do we compare to the rest of the world?  While it is the case that the suicide rate among American teenagers increased over the last 10 to 15 years, if we pull back the lens a bit, things get more complicated. Across recent history, we can see that overall, the teen suicide rate is about the same now as it was in the 1970s. In fact, the suicide rate amongst teen boys was higher in the 1990s than it is now. Following this, it dropped in the late 90s and early 2000s (no one knows why), before rising again in the 2010s. Look for yourself at the CDC data here.  Still, even if teen suicides are lower than last century, it is still alarming to see them rising in recent years. Something is definitely going on. If, for example, we hypothetically found out that cancer or pregnancy death rates were increasing over the past few years, the notion that they had gone down 30 years ago and were now returning to baseline would be cold comfort. But is the recent increase in youth suicide a worldwide phenomenon? The answer appears to be no. In most other countries throughout the world, the suicide rate among adolescents has not increased over the past 10 to 15 years. A paper published in 2020 by a group of researchers from Britain found that the suicide rate amongst teenagers has risen only in Australia, Canada, the UK, and USA. Whereas in France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, Japan and Korea, the teen suicide rate has fallen.  These researchers characterize the four countries with rising teen suicidality as being unique in several ways. These are “populous high-income predominantly English-speaking nations” which also have high levels of economic inequality. These four countries were all in the top five highest for economic inequality (measured by Gini index) out of all the countries studied. Simply put, the people in these countries are “W.E.I.R.D” relative to the rest of the world. The researchers also point out that social media cannot be an explanatory factor for the rise in teen suicides, since all countries studied throughout the world have the same media access as American teenagers do. If social media was the key variable that explains the rise in teen suicide, we’d be seeing comparable rises in most other countries. But we don’t see that in the data.  The study authors also ran analyses examining whether the places with an increase in teen suicides also had a greater increase in social media usage compared to the other countries. They did not find any statistical difference. They also looked at the proportion of young people who used social media for more than one, three, or six hours per day, and it was also not statistically different across those countries. Simply put, social media usage does not appear to be different across the countries with rising vs. flat suicide rates.  If you’re interested in looking at other countries besides those discussed in this research paper, Our World In Data provides a resource based on data from the World Health Organization. The same decrease in adolescent suicides over the past decade can also be found in countries such as New Zealand, Russia, Argentina, India, and Iran. For other countries such as Israel, Cuba, Norway, and Denmark there is virtually no change across this period.  What do all these countries have in common? This is for future research to discover. Some studies show that cultural factors such as strong social norms are a variable that predicts suicide in various countries, but this does not necessarily explain stability or changes in youth suicides across time. It would also be useful to consider specific subpopulations (e.g., young secular girls/women on the political left), to see if there are trends in suicide-related distress occurring in other countries besides America.  One thing does seem clear. The suicide rate among young people is not increasing throughout most countries around the world over the past decade, or even since the year 2000. Furthermore, we cannot blame social media for the rise in suicide among American teenagers. The data simply do not support this conclusion, for the simple reason that teenagers in other countries also have access to the same media that we do. It would be unwise and incorrect to declare that social media usage plays a role in suicidality.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wc3ljaG9sb2d5dG9kYXkuY29tL3VzL2Jsb2cvdGhlLXJlc2lzdGFuY2UtaHlwb3RoZXNpcy8yMDIzMDUvdGhlLXRlZW4tc3VpY2lkZS1yYXRlLWhhcy1ub3QtaW5jcmVhc2VkLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtdGhlLXdvcmxk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:56:01","SALT LAKE CITY — A tight-knit medical community in Utah is sharing their thoughts and talking about how to move forward after a well-known doctor in their field killed his son, then himself at his clinic.  In a place to promote healing, Dr. Emily Bullock offers the space for people to process at her psychotherapy clinic in Woods Cross, Utah.  “All different kinds of traumatic events that people have gone through, sometimes from long ago, sometimes current, sometimes accidents, sometimes sexual trauma, military trauma, things like that,” Bullock explained.  The kinds of therapy found in her clinic include EMDR, assisted psychotherapy, clinical yoga and ketamine.  “Ketamine is used as a tool to help people in their therapy to be able to accomplish whatever their goal is that they’re working on in their treatment,” she said.  She’s seen clients who utilize ketamine as medicine and has found it brings “a lot of hope and promise” to their lives.  “These psychedelic medicines and ketamine specifically — which is the one that’s FDA approved right now — have been incredibly beneficial and impactful for people in their lives when they’re used as a tool to aid them in their recovery or their mental health journeys,” Bullock said.  Something else has been impacting her this week, as those in the psychedelic medicine community talk, discuss and express emotions following what took place at a different clinic over the weekend.  “When you hear about a tragedy like this, it’s very confusing. It’s very distressing,” Bullock said.  Police said Dr. Parth Gandhi died by suicide after shooting and killing his 16-year-old son inside Salt Lake City Psychedelic Therapy and Research Saturday. It’s unknown if any substances were used prior.  Gandhi was known in the healing world for his work with psychedelics, specifically as they relate to autism, concussions, addiction and depression.  “It’s terribly upsetting for everyone in the psychology community in the medical community, in the psychedelic medicine field,” Bullock expressed.  Dr. Scott Allen, a physician and anesthesiologist who runs a psychedelic medicine clinic, knew Gandhi.  “Dr. Gandhi was a fairly influential educator within the psychedelic movement within Utah and sort of nationally to here,” he said. “He led a fairly large training course that a lot of people attended.”  He indicated how the people who are used to helping others are now working themselves to process this terrible event.  “We’re trying to figure out a way going forward in which we can help support each other,” he said.  Allen said they would host their next professional journal club in a couple of weeks and have been discussing ways to support each other’s thoughts, feelings and emotions as they work to take care of other physicians.  “We’ve been discussing ways that we can offer services to people and have a venue for people to kind of talk about what they’re feeling personally,” he said.  He said this one tragic act does not represent the psychedelic medicine community as a whole.  “Psychedelics, in general, tend to promote a lot of feelings of love, of connectedness, oneness with the universe. That’s usually what people experience is, is more love and more compassion for other people, more empathy. That’s usually what we see,” Allen said. “And so, for somebody involved with the psychedelic community, I think it kind of compounds the shock of it because most of us who have engaged with it, we’re like, ‘Wow, these substances make us so loving towards others.'”  Dr. Bullock, who specializes in working with complex trauma and led the Traumatic Stress Response Team in the U.S. Air Force, explained that in horrible traumas like this, it’s normal to experience a range of different emotions, and she talked about how crucial it is to reach out, get support and speak with others.  “It’s so, so important to be able to get take care of yourself and your basic needs following a tragedy,” she said. “But then also, getting the right kind of help and support immediately and thereafter.”  For anyone wanting to reach out for services, Bullock said the Utah Psychological Association is always available and is currently on standby to be able to refer people affected by last weekend’s events to the appropriate agency.  She said anyone in a dangerous or emergency situation should call 911, and there’s also the 988 mental health emergency line. That line will link people to a crisis response center, and they can deploy a team of mental health experts to intervene. The 24/7, free, confidential domestic violence hotline is also at 1-800-897-LINK.  The Utah Psychological Association released the statement below in response to the situation. It explains their sorrow for Gandhi’s daughters, his son’s mother and others close to them, and how they’re ready to help his clients.

"suicide","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 02:05:06","Question: In your book you argue the suicidal are oppressed by structural suicidism, a hidden oppression.  Alexandre Baril: “I coined the term suicidism to refer to an oppressive system in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence. Our society is replete with horrific stories of suicidal individuals facing inhumane treatment after expressing their suicidal ideations. The intention is to save their lives at all costs and interventions range from being hospitalized and drugged against their will, to being handcuffed and shot by police, to losing their jobs, to having their parental rights revoked, to even being kicked off university campuses. Thus, suicidal people often remain silent and complete their suicide without reaching out to anyone.”  “Worse, I argue that suicide prevention services do more harm than good. Simply put, suicide prevention often increases deaths by suicide rather than prevents them. This is especially true for marginalized suicidal people such as Indigenous, racialized, homeless, poor, queer, trans, disabled, neurodiverse and Mad individuals, for whom suicide intervention often increases the racist, colonialist, classist, sexist, heterosexist (or homophobic), cisgenderist (or transphobic), ableist and sanist violence they experience. My thesis is that suicidal people are oppressed by suicidism and the oppression they experience remains under-theorized.”  Q: Support for suicidal persons is not working. Please explain why that is.  AB: “Suicide statistics remain relatively stable and have not improved significantly over the past decades. Despite decades of multiple strategies and billions of dollars invested in outreach initiatives, studies show that those most determined to die carry out their suicidal plans without reaching out for help. In sum, our prevention strategies do not work.”  “My work found current prevention services generally fail to connect with suicidal people, who do not feel safe asking for help. This silencing effect, due to suicidist consequences (experiencing forms of harm when revealing suicidal plans) leads suicidal people to not feel supported to share their distress.”  Q: You believe that offering assistance in dying to suicidal patients would better prevent unnecessary deaths. How?  AB: “The most radical idea of my book is to theorize suicide as a positive right that would involve supporting suicidal people in their quest for death through assisted suicide. This support would be delivered through a suicide-affirmative approach. This might save more lives than current prevention strategies.”  “This non-stigmatizing approach would provide suicidal people with the chance to speak freely and to benefit from an accompaniment process to reach an informed decision about their desire to live or die. My approach has the potential to drastically reduce rates of suicidality, particularly among marginalized groups, by opening channels of communication with people who are currently too afraid to reach out for help.”  “Even for the small minority of people who would go ahead with an assisted suicide, they would have a less lonely and violent death and a relational process of dying that would also be less traumatic for family and friends.”  Q: Should this idea ever come to fruition, what kind of impact would you expect to see? How would this influence a person’s suicidal ideation?  AB: “My approach is a radical de-stigmatization of suicidality. Slogans such as ‘Speak Up, Reach Out’ or ‘Let’s Talk’ urge suicidal people to share their distress. But suicide prevention services send a paradoxical message since those who open their hearts often experience harm, forced treatments, and rights violation in the name of care and of saving vulnerable people from themselves, all because suicide is never an option.”  “Through my approach, suicide becomes an option, one that should be carefully thought through within an accompanied process during which various options would be seriously considered to help the person make an informed decision. By removing the suicidist violence suicidal people experience when they share their suicidal ideations and plans, and by supporting the assisted suicide of the person if they determine that this is indeed the best option for them, suicidal people would finally feel safe to speak up, reach out for help and talk about their distress. In my approach, the priority is the suicidal person, not life itself. Instead of completing their suicide without speaking with anyone, they would be accompanied as they contemplate making this crucial decision, weighing all the pros and cons, informing their relatives and family members, and preparing for this passage from life to death.”  Q: Are there examples of this model working elsewhere in the world?  AB: “There has never been a model such as this before. Throughout history, some philosophers, bioethicists and thinkers have promoted the right to die by suicide, but it’s always a negative right. Those in favor of a positive right to die limit this exclusively to the context of assisted death in the case of disability/sickness/illness.”  “My work questions why we offer assistance in dying to people who, in the vast majority of cases, don’t want to die and ask for better living conditions. And those who do want to die, such as suicidal people, are denied any assistance and are forced to die alone in atrocious conditions. If such an idea was adopted, it would lead to a completely different social, political, and legal landscape than the one we are used to. This is an out-of-the-box idea, which invites us to radically rethink both our perspectives on suicide and assisted suicide.”  Q: The inspiration comes from the support that transgender persons receive. Please elaborate on this parallel.  AB: “The positive right to assisted suicide for suicidal people may be new, but my suicide-affirmative approach is inspired by trans-affirmative approaches to rethink the care offered to trans people – not based on forms of control and gatekeeping – but to support their autonomy. My suicide-affirmative approach is anchored in self-determination, informed consent, and harm reduction. Instead of trying to cure trans people of their transness or suicidal people of their suicidality, we develop safer spaces in which we can examine their suicidality with them and discuss a variety of options.“  “A shift from prevention to accompaniment would empower suicidal people. Similarly to a trans-affirmative approach, the suicide-affirmative approach offers care and support through an informed consent model, taking for granted that the expert in the decision to transition—in this case, from life to death—is the person making the decision.”  “Regarding the theorization of suicidism and the rights and recognition of suicidal people, we are currently where trans people were regarding trans rights and recognition in the 1930s. Indeed, everything needs to be imagined, theorized, and transformed, as was the case for trans people several decades ago when transitioning was not even an option. My work constitutes a first step in this direction; it allows us to open our hearts and imaginations regarding the possibility of envisioning suicide and assisted suicide from a different point of view, from the standpoint of suicidal people.”  Baril, Alexandre.

The campaign targets 26-70 year-olds and shows the impact of simple, direct dialogue about suicide and how to initiate those conversations when they are more important than ever. In 2021, 48,183 died by suicide , an increase of 4.79% from 2020.  Talk Away the Dark Father showing emotional distress  Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9170651-american-foundation-for-suicide-prevention-talk-away-the-dark-campaign/  Research shows that suicide is preventable. The more we openly, honestly, and directly talk about suicide, the more we can help to prevent it.  The campaign anchor is a public service announcement (PSA) produced by TBWA\Chiat\Day New York through a pro bono partnership with AFSP. It depicts a daughter having brave conversations with her father as she recognizes in him common warning signs of suicide. The PSA ends with the daughter asking her father directly about suicide, bringing him back from the shadows and into the light. Its message is clear: we can't begin to address suicide if we don't take the first step and start the conversation.  ""In the past several years, we have made tremendous progress in our openness surrounding mental health. However, many people are still unsure about what to do when someone they know is struggling with their mental health,"" said AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia. ""Our campaign is a powerful reminder that we all have the ability to help.""  ""I have experienced loss from suicide, so our work on this is incredibly meaningful to me,"" said TBWA\Chiat\Day New York Chief Creative Officer Amy Ferguson. ""To partner with AFSP and put the talent and efforts of our agency to use on such an important issue is so incredibly rewarding.""  AFSP will be hosting a virtual event on its Instagram channel with experts at 4 p.m. ET on May 16 to discuss best practices for having important mental health conversations with loved ones. The PSA will appear nationwide across broadcast, digital, social, and print and it connects with Spanish-speaking communities, offering translated resources.  The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention is dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide. AFSP creates a culture that's smart about mental health through public education and community programs, develops suicide prevention through research and advocacy, and provides support for those affected by suicide.

On Monday, the company said it will soon display messages that people searching about suicide could use to ask for help. Based on specific templates, the prewritten messages will contain different requests to speak or chat with a friend, family member, or other trusted contact.  If you need help, visit: The International Association for Suicide Prevention  The idea behind Google's initiative is that a person thinking of suicide might run an online search looking for answers or guidance or information, especially if they don't know where else to turn. In that case, the person might not even know how to describe what's wrong or why they're having suicidal thoughts. And they may be reluctant or embarrassed to contact a friend or family member directly.  Designed to remove some of the difficulty and stigma involved in reaching out to another person, the messages will offer direct requests such as the following:  Also: Is ChatGPT an effective therapy alternative? 80% of this study's participants thought so  ""I'm struggling right now and just need to talk to someone—can we chat?""  ""This is really hard for me to say but I'm having painful thoughts and it might help to talk. Are you free?""  ""I don't want to die but I don't know how to live. Talking with you may help me feel safe. Are you free right now?""  The person could choose the message that best expresses their feelings and thoughts and then text it directly to a loved one, who hopefully will be able to intervene and provide aid and comfort to that person.  The pre-written messages were developed by Google in partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention. But this isn't the first time Google has made an attempt to help individuals thinking of suicide.  For several years, suicide prevention information has been available at the top of relevant search results. Last year in the US, the company updated this information to display the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of state and local call centers from the US Department of Health.  A 2022 survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 90% of the people polled felt that the US is facing a huge mental health crisis. On its end, Google said that searches for ""mental health crisis"" have risen each year. In this environment, people in crisis need easier access to mental health resources and to friends and family members for support.  Also: Generative AI could lower drug prices. Here's how  ""People often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments,"" Dr. Megan Jones Bell, Director of Consumer and Mental Health at Google, said in a blog post. ""In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on.""  Google has also directed certain resources to teenagers and young adults. For people in the 10-34 age group, suicide is the second leading cause of death, according to the CDC. In response, the company offers crisis support resource panels on YouTube to help young people connect with live crisis professionals for suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. To address that last issue, Google has started to remove content from YouTube that shows or promotes eating disorders such as binging and purging.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N1aWNpZGUtcmVsYXRlZC1nb29nbGUtc2VhcmNoZXMtdG8teWllbGQtbWVzc2FnZS10ZW1wbGF0ZXMtZm9yLXNlZWtpbmctaGVscC_SAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy56ZG5ldC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLWFtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3N1aWNpZGUtcmVsYXRlZC1nb29nbGUtc2VhcmNoZXMtdG8teWllbGQtbWVzc2FnZS10ZW1wbGF0ZXMtZm9yLXNlZWtpbmctaGVscC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Gujarat BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama. (File Photo)  As per the complaint lodged by Chag’s son Hitarth Chag at Veraval police station, his father had lent about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.75 crore to Naran Chudasama who wanted it for his business. On being asked to return the money, Chudasama and his son refused to do so and had threatened to kill the complainant and his father, as per the complaint. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.  The FIR is filed under IPC Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  Dr Chag, 59, who is also a philanthropist in the coastal town of Veraval, was found hanging at his residence with a suicide note beside him on February 12.  The one-line suicide note written in Gujarati blamed Rajesh Chudasama and Naran Chudasama for his death. Hitarth alleged that the names mentioned in the suicide note are Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh-Gir Somnath and Naran Chudasama is his father.  On February 17, Hitarth lodged a complaint with Veraval police, demanding that the MP and his father be held accountable for his father’s suicide.  As the police did not immediately register an FIR against the MP and his father based on Hitarth’s application, he approached the Gujarat high court in March.  In his plea he alleged that police had acted in contempt of the Supreme Court’s Lalita Kumari judgment by refusing to lodge an FIR in the case.

The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said. (Representational Image/Getty Images)  Police said that the student was depressed after learning of her poor performance in the board exams, the result for which was announced on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) GS Sidhu said that the student had left a suicide note saying she was upset over the result and had walked out of her home on Friday. Police did not clarify how far away the drain was from the victim’s house, but said it was in the same neighbourhood.  “We have not found any foul play behind the death so far,” the officer added.  The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said.  DCP Sidhu said that the girl was dejected. Her parents said that around 3.30pm, she quietly walked out of her home and it was only later that they discovered the suicide note written by her, after which they approached the police at around 9.30pm, police said.  “We launched an extensive search operation to find her. We also took all other legal steps to trace her by informing the police control room (PCR) and flashed wireless messages to all the station house officers in Delhi and all the deputy commissioners of police by describing the student. The details of the missing girl were also uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet) but we got no response,” said the officer.  On Sunday morning, police received a call about the partly submerged body of a girl being found in a drain. “The body was taken out from the drain with the help of locals and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. She was soon identified as the missing victim by her father,” said the DCP.  Since there was no indication of foul play, the police initiated proceedings under the CrPC instead of registering an FIR.  This is the third known case of a student dying by suicide in the Capital due to performance issues in the Class 12 board exam since Friday. In the first instance, a 19-year-old woman student died in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri after failing. In the second case, a 16-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar hanged herself to death after scoring 75%, which was lesser than what she had hoped.  A senior official from the Directorate of Education said that the department offers a helpline to students where they can reach out for counselling. “Students can call up the Yuva helpline and get in touch with education and vocational guidance counsellors on the toll-free helpline. The helpline number is promoted among students during exams, it works round the clock from morning to evening,” said the official, requesting anonymity.  Central Board of Secondary Education started the post-result psychological counselling on Friday. The counselling will be conducted till May 27 from 9.30am to 5.30pm. Students who want to attend the counselling can dial the toll-free number 1800-11-8004 and can get centralised access to CBSE tele-counselling helpline, information, and helpful tips for parents and students in case of result-related anxiety or stress.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpLW5ld3MvMTh5ZWFyb2xkLXN0dWRlbnQtZm91bmQtZGVhZC1pbi1kZWxoaS1kcmFpbi1hZnRlci1wb29yLWJvYXJkLWV4YW0tcmVzdWx0cy0xMDE2ODQwODk5NTY1MDAuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpLW5ld3MvMTh5ZWFyb2xkLXN0dWRlbnQtZm91bmQtZGVhZC1pbi1kZWxoaS1kcmFpbi1hZnRlci1wb29yLWJvYXJkLWV4YW0tcmVzdWx0cy0xMDE2ODQwODk5NTY1MDAtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The charity has temporarily removed mascot Pudsey’s eye covering to show “not all of the challenges that children and young people may be facing are visible”, the broadcaster said.  The campaign encourages conversations between children and parents, carers and other trusted adults “to ensure no child faces their emotional and mental health challenges alone”.  Behind The Bandana ambassador Dr Alex George (BBC/PA)  Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, who has campaigned for better mental health after the death of his 19-year-old brother Llyr by suicide in 2020, has been named Behind The Bandana ambassador.  He said: “I know how important early intervention is in helping make a difference to the emotional wellbeing of children and young people and so I am very proud to be the ambassador of such a powerful campaign that really shines a light on the mental health crisis we are facing.  “As highlighted by Pudsey bear himself, mental health issues can be less visible on the outside, but conversations and positive relationships really can help.”  As part of the campaign, Children In Need has released the findings of a new Censuswide survey shedding light on how comfortable children feel when asking for help with their feelings and how often they feel the need to put on their “metaphorical bandana” and hide their emotions.  While nine in 10 parents surveyed said they talk to their child about their mental health at least once a month, more than a quarter of young people surveyed said they had not talked to someone they trust about their mental health in the last six months.  Children In Need’s boss Simon Antrobus said: “This research is a clear indication that our Behind The Bandana campaign is urgently needed.  “What’s also clear is that we can all play a role in addressing early signs of worry and anxiety by showing children and young people that we’re here to listen and to support them.  “By recognising and acknowledging that some feelings of worry and anxiety can be hidden means early conversations, sensitively delivered with kindness and empathy, can make a real difference to a child’s wellbeing and can help prevent mental health problems from becoming embedded.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxkcmVuLXJlbW92ZXMtcHVkc2V5LWJhbmRhbmEtbWVudGFsLTIzMDEwMDYzNS5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9jaGlsZHJlbi1yZW1vdmVzLXB1ZHNleS1iYW5kYW5hLW1lbnRhbC0yMzAxMDA2MzUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney at just 17 to chase a contract in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns throughout a rollercoaster career that almost broke him in more ways than one.  The 28-year-old spent seasons on the sidelines battling a foot injury that left his chances of running again uncertain and his playing career in freefall.  A product of a tough upbringing, Brown struggled when he moved to Australia and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide.  While playing with Cronulla at age 19, Brown says he felt isolated and disconnected from everyone.  Bulldogs backrower Fa'amanu Brown pictured with his mother who passed away in 2020  Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney to play in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns that almost broke him in more ways than one  'I went and signed papers at Cronulla Leagues Club … and I was, like, 'Man, I'm done. I want to go home or else I'm going to commit suicide',' he told ABC News.  And one night when the pressure became unbearable, Brown swam out into the ocean as far he could.  'God, if you're going to take me, take me now because, man, I'm done,' he recalled thinking at the time.  'But, for some reason, I floated on my back, swimming backwards back to the shore … I remember just crying,' he said.  Brown spoke to his mother afterwards and she encouraged him to be strong.  The young footy star started earning big bucks with the Sharks, but without proper guidance Brown soon developed a gambling problem.  'I ended up becoming broke. I went through a gambling phase. There was a point where I had to ask [the club to be paid] in an advance,' he admits.  It was his mother's cancer diagnosis that finally made him pull himself together and became the defining moment of his life.  Brown struggled when he moved to Australia to play footy and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide  Brown (pictured with his partner) started earning a large wage with the Sharks, but without proper guidance the youngster soon developed a gambling problem  'There was a time where Mum was going to be put into a rest home, where people look after them until they pass, or we had an option where me and my brothers look after our mum,' he explained.  Brown thought a care home would be the best idea, but his brothers talked him out of it.  'But my brothers know the Samoan way more than me … My older brothers said: 'Trust me, you'll understand once you start looking after her.'  'This beats my NRL debut, making whatever money … I don't think getting married will top this.'  In a social media post from 2020, the footy star detailed how he was feeling while looking after his dying mother.  Brown says his mother's cancer diagnosis pulled him together and became the defining moment of his life  Brown thought about putting his mum in a care facility for her final days, but was glad he spent the time with her instead  'What I've learnt through my relationship with mum is there's no point in holding grudges towards others,' he wrote.  'Life is too short to darken your heart. Every time you say goodbye to your loved ones that could be the last time you will hear or see them. Now she is sick, I regret so many things.  'I should've would've could've but i know it's made me who i am today. Realise before it's too late.  'Everyday embrace your loved ones. Tell them you love them. Say it sincerely. Record memories.
