"suicide","2019-05-05","13:00:00","{""Naples"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T11:17:00","NAPLES, Fla. — May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Fox 4 talked to a mental health expert about what it's like to live with depression, the warning signs, and how you can intervene to save a life.  “Depression is more of rooted in that feeling of sadness,"" Jessica Liria, the Community Outreach Specialist for the David Lawrence Centers for Behavioral Health in Naples, said.  But more than just feeling sad, it's a feeling of being unable to escape that sadness. Liria said depression can come from trauma in our past.  “Even if it's just grief, or the loss of somebody that they once loved. When we don't allow our body that time to process, our brain and our body, the time to process, we get stuck. We get stuck in this place, and are not able to look towards moving past that,"" she said.  She said what makes depression even trickier, is that many times, it also comes with anxiety; 60 percent of people with anxiety also have depression. She said this means that the trauma from the past that's causing the depression can lead to anxiety about the future.  ""And they're unable to be comfortable in the present,"" Liria said.  She said the most obvious signs that someone you love is dealing with depression are changes in sleep and eating.  ""When somebody is incapable of sleep or getting way too much sleep, they can't get out of bed,"" she said. ""Not wanting to eat at all, eating way too much. Sometimes eating can manifest into a coping skill of its own. And that's what helps people feel better, which, of course, we don't see that as a healthy coping skill.”  Other signs of depression include isolation and lack of interest in things they once enjoyed.  ""We might actually start to see people taking more high risk decisions. So kind of lacking a little bit of care for their lives, or they put themselves in harm's way. That can include substance use,” Liria said.  She said substance use can make depression even worse.  Liria said the biggest warning sign that someone is depressed: thoughts of suicide. The rate of suicide is growing in our country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 48,183 people in the U.S. died from suicide in 2021. That's one death every 11 minutes. It says 1.7 million people attempted suicide.  “It takes someone sometimes, that that caring, compassionate, empathetic person, to say 'I've noticed these things, I have these concerns about these things,'” she said.  If you suspect your loved one is depressed and considering suicide, Liria said to show you care and you're here for them.  “We have to go into it very non-judgmental. We have to go into it respecting that person's experience and what their thoughts are,"" she said. ""Also, be prepared for what they may say. Be calm, cool and collected so that they feel like they can trust you and actually open up. But offer hope, offer help.”  She said to also ask them what will make them feel better, or help them get through this. And don't give up.  ""Have that conversation, but make sure that you're following up with that conversation and checking back in on them, continuing the conversation to maybe dig even deeper than next time,"" Liria said.  If you or someone you love is dealing with depression or thoughts of suicide, call the David Lawrence Centers for Behavioral Health in Naples for free at any time: (239) 455-8500.

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Indianapolis"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T06:52:56","By DONNA SCHAIBLEY  State Representative  According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in five adults and one in six youth experience mental illness each year in the United States, but less than half of them receive treatment.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and this session we prioritized several bills to increase and improve services and treatment across our state and in local communities.  Through the state’s next two-year budget, Indiana will invest in building out a statewide system of certified behavioral health clinics to increase Hoosiers’ availability to quality care. The state’s newly launched 988 National Suicide and Crisis Line will be expanded to connect those struggling or going through a mental health-related crisis to help. Boosting this infrastructure and hotline are the next step toward ensuring struggling Hoosiers have a place to go, someone to call, and someone to respond.  We also increased our investments in Indiana’s veteran suicide prevention efforts. Our state’s veteran suicide rate is higher than the national average, and we need to do everything we can to ensure these Hoosiers who sacrifice their time, safety, and even their lives can receive the help they need.  This session I also supported a new law to help ensure low-risk individuals with mental health conditions receive treatment in hospitals, not jails. Law enforcement will be empowered to apprehend and transport those suffering from a mental illness, or temporary impairment from drugs and alcohol, to the nearest facility providing mental health treatment. This legislation will also ensure an individual is not turned away because of their inability to pay for services and that hospitals receive payment. Sending Hoosiers to these facilities can connect them with the help they need and hopefully keep them out of the criminal justice system.  Help is out there, whether it’s in-person, virtual, or by phone. If you or a loved one are currently facing a crisis, please dial 988 for the National Suicide and Crisis Line or dial 211 to connect with Indiana’s Be Well Crisis Helpline. Both are free and confidential resources to connect with support.  For help navigating state resources, please contact me at (317) 232-9833 or email [email protected].  State Rep. Donna Schaibley (R-Carmel) represents House District 24, which includes portions of Boone and Hamilton counties.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhZHRoZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9ib29zdGluZy1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtYWNjZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pyotr Kucherenko, 46, the deputy minister of science and higher education, fell ill during the flight to Russia with his delegation on Saturday, according to his office.  The plane made an emergency landing in the southern city of Mineralnye Vody, where doctors tried to save his life, the Times of London reported.  The politician is survived by his wife, pop singer Diana Gurtskaya, and their teenage son.  An unnamed source close to the widow told state media that his family believed the death was linked to his heart condition, but that they would await the results of an autopsy, according to the news outlet.  Roman Super, an independent journalist who fled Russia shortly after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022, said on his Telegram channel that he had spoken with Kucherenko “just days” before fleeing.  Pyotr Kucherenko, 46, the Russian deputy minister of science and higher education, has died after a flight from Cuba. Scientific Russia  He said the pol feared for his safety and urged him to also leave the country.    “‘Save yourself and your family. Leave as soon as possible. You cannot imagine the degree of brutalization of our state. In a year you won’t recognize Russia at all. By leaving you are doing the right thing,’” Super quoted Kucherenko as saying, CNN reported.    Super said he asked Kucherenko if he also wanted to flee, to which, he said, the minister answered: “It is no longer possible to do so. They take away our passports. And there is no such world where they will now be happy with the deputy Russian minister after this fascist invasion.”  Kucherenko also reportedly told the journalist that he was taking “antidepressants and tranquilizers” to cope but that it wasn’t “really helping.”    “It doesn’t help much. I hardly sleep. I feel terrible. We’ve all been taken hostage. Nobody can say anything. Immediately crushed like aphids. Leave soon, Roma. And save everyone,” he allegedly added.

Multiple reports have corroborated Kucherenko’s claim that senior Russian officials’ passports had been confiscated to prevent them fleeing the country after it launched the invasion.  Kucherenko joins the list of at least 13 high-profile Russians who have lost their lives under mysterious circumstances in the last 15 months.  In February, Marina Yankina, 58, the head of finance and procurement for Russia’s western military district, died after an apparent fall from a St Petersburg high-rise.  A preliminary investigation determined she committed suicide.  Kucherenko reportedly said he was taking “antidepressants and tranquilizers” but it wasn’t “really helping.” Nexta_Live / Telegram  Also that month, Ministry of the Interior Maj. Gen. Vladimir Makarov, 72, died of an apparent suicide in a Moscow suburb.  Unconfirmed reports alleged that he had fallen into a “deep depression” after being sacked by strongman Vladimir Putin in January.  In November, Col. Vadim Boiko, 44, deputy head of the Makarov Pacific Higher Naval School in Vladivostok, was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds in what also has been described as a suicide.  Boiko, who played a role in mobilization efforts, “executed” himself with five gunshots to the chest in his commander’s office after allegedly being set up to take the fall for some of the problems plaguing the invasion, according to his widow.  At least 13 high-profile Russians have died under mysterious circumstances since the Kremlin launched its invasion. via REUTERS  In December, sausage tycoon Pavel Antov, who criticized the invasion of Ukraine, plunged to his death from a luxury hotel in India — three days after his friend lost his life on the same trip.

"suicide","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","{""Fairfield"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T13:07:12","In this week’s episode of The American Legion Tango Alpha Lima podcast, the special assistant to the president for Veterans Affairs discusses Be the One, White House initiatives and the death by suicide of her father, a Navy veteran.  The American Legion’s Be the One program educates, encourages and empowers everyone to take appropriate action when a veteran or servicemember may be at risk of suicide. The goal is to raise awareness, destigmatize mental health counseling and reduce the rate of veteran suicide.  Terri Tanielian, who was a speaker at The American Legion’s Washington Conference in March, first became interested in the topic when she worked on a study at a think tank.  “We were trying to understand the impact of deployment and look at the potential causes of Gulf War Illness,” she recalled. “I became fascinated with it. I really dove into the work to understand the challenges, the traumas, the deployment-related stressors and opportunities that were facing our military members and their families.”  In her role at the White House, her number one priority is the veteran suicide issue.  “This is very important and was mentioned in the State of the Union address this year,” she said. “We need to do more to address the number of veterans who are dying by suicide each year.”  That’s at the heart of the Be the One initiative.  “I’m really grateful for the work The American Legion is doing through this program,” she said. “I think it’s going to be the game changer we need.”  Tanielian also discusses how community and caregivers play a significant role in the care for servicemembers and veterans. She has worked with The American Legion for years, and grew up attending many family events at an American Legion post in Hudson Falls, N.Y.  She said in the coming year, VA will roll out new ways to support caregivers and their families.  “One of those is support from mental health services because we know that caregiving can be stressful. And we want caregivers to be supported so they can live healthy lives and they can support their loved ones.”  Also on the episode, hosts Jeff Daly and Ashley Gutermuth offer their thoughts on:  • Memorial Day and Poppy Day, of course.  • The renaming of Fort Hood. The Texas Army base dropped the name of a Confederate general and was renamed as Fort Cavazos, in honor of the Army's first Latino four-star general.  • A good girl’s mission aboard the USS Gerald Ford.  Check out this week’s episode, which is among about 180 Tango Alpha Lima podcasts available in both audio and video formats here.

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T15:24:53","May is National Mental Health Awareness Month, which aims to bring attention to mental health and honor those living with mental health conditions, as well as the professionals who care for them. Mental health is important to everyone, regardless of age, gender, race or socioeconomic status.  What is Mental Health?  Mental health encompasses various aspects of our overall well-being, including emotions, psychology and social interactions. Our mental health profoundly affects how we think, feel and ultimately act – influencing our ability to handle stress, maintain relationships and make choices. While genetic factors play a role, environmental influences and personal experiences also significantly affect our mental health. In the United States, approximately one-in-five adults is affected by a mental health condition.  Mental health conditions are diagnosed on a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe. Discussions around generalized anxiety, which is a common mental health condition, may differ from discussions concerning those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  To shift perceptions, the working groups of the Special Committee on Kansas Mental Health Modernization and Reform suggested integrating mental health into overall health discussions to promote understanding and education and to normalize conversations about behavioral health (Recommendation 4.7, Page 87). Learn more about the special committee’s recommendations to modernize the state’s behavioral health system.  Kansas Responds to Mental Health Challenges  Improving the mental health of Kansans and the care environment to meet their needs is an ongoing challenge. According to Mental Health America’s 2023 measures, Kansas ranked last overall. Data for Kansas indicated high prevalence of mental health conditions among youth and adults and low rankings for access to care.  In Kansas, greater investment is being made in behavioral health. Most recently, on May 17, the state allocated $37.7 million in grants from the federally funded COVID-19 Strengthening People and Revitalizing (SPARK) fund to strengthen behavioral health services in Kansas by increasing bed capacity with the addition of two new facilities, one in Sedgwick County and the other in Olathe. This added a total of 122 adult and youth beds. Kansas also has adopted the certified community behavioral health clinic model to increase access to care.  Suicide in Kansas  In the past two decades, suicide rates in Kansas have risen. In 2020, there were 26 suicide deaths among youth age 10-17. Among adults aged 19 or older, there were 518 suicides in 2021, surpassing the previous year. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) is accepting applications until June 16, from health organizations to implement the Zero Suicide in Health Systems treatment framework as part of its system of care programming, specifically targeting adults aged 25 and older residing in Kansas. The goal is to establish partnerships with health systems throughout the state and work together to reduce suicide ideations, attempts and deaths.  In March 2023, the governor announced the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services awarded $525,000 to 15 community organizations across the state to develop strategies to prevent suicide for at-risk Kansans of all ages. The plans are expected to include conducting a community assessment, building suicide prevention infrastructure, addressing cultural competency and ensuring prevention efforts are evidence-based.  Another milestone in suicide prevention was the implementation of the national 988 suicide prevention and crisis lifeline, intended to intervene in crisis scenarios for those experiencing severe mental and behavioral health episodes. Between January 2022 and February 2023, 19,834 calls made to 988 were answered in Kansas. The future for 988 includes a transformed crisis care system, linking lifeline callers to community-based behavioral health services. Learn more about the 988 Coordinating Council, which KHI helps facilitate.  Homelessness and ACEs  Certain populations are disproportionately affected by mental health conditions, including those experiencing housing instability. In Kansas, and across the country, homelessness is on the rise. This rise can be attributed to factors such as severe mental health challenges, substance use disorder, lack of affordable housing, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and more.  Research has evaluated ACEs as being a strong risk factor for individuals becoming homeless. ACEs also tend to be experienced substantially higher among those who are experiencing homelessness than the general population.  ACEs may include forms of abuse, neglect, exposure to violence, familial substance use and instances of suicide attempts or deaths among family members and friends. These experiences significantly impact a child’s sense of safety, stability and parental bonding, which can ultimately influence short and long-term mental health. Without adequate and person-centered prevention and intervention, a combination of these scenarios and factors can perpetuate cycles of trauma and mental health deterioration for generations to come.  To help mitigate mental health challenges for children enrolled in public schools, the approved state budget for FY 2024 allocates $3 million SGF ($13.5 million in total), to be used to expand the Mental Health Intervention Pilot Program to 15-25 additional school districts. The program creates agreements between schools and community mental health centers (CMHCs) to eliminate barriers for students and families needing clinical therapy and access to CMHC services.  The causes of homelessness vary, emphasizing the need to comprehend root causes and address barriers that perpetuate homelessness. Acquiring a permanent address and necessary identification documents is crucial for accessing benefits like health insurance coverage, social support and permanent housing. Helping individuals obtain these items and establish an address are key objectives for organizations working with Kansans who are homeless.  To learn more about how the Kansas Legislature discussed homelessness this session, read the House Welfare Reform Committee survey from Week 11 of the 2023 Session.  The Behavioral Health Workforce  Health care and social assistance is a major employment sector in Kansas, but funding and support are needed to fill the persistent service gaps and expand the behavioral health workforce. KHI took a closer look at this issue and identified workforce shortages and strategies to address this challenge. Most Kansas counties have a shortage of behavioral health providers, and a robust workforce is needed to address the mental and behavioral health challenges faced by Kansans. Read more about KHI’s work defining Kansas’ behavioral health workforce and addressing behavioral health workforce needs.  During Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognize the mental health challenges faced by our friends, family, neighbors and ourselves. Behavioral health provider organizations in Kansas highlight the need for policymakers to prioritize addressing barriers contributing to those experiencing the spectrum of mental health conditions. Addressing those barriers may lead to more effective interventions, enhance access to mental health services and develop comprehensive strategies to tackle these issues effectively. Read the Report of the Special Committee on Kansas Mental Health Modernization and Reform to the 2022 Kansas Legislature for how Kansas can prioritize issues related to behavioral health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoaS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmVjb2duaXppbmctbmF0aW9uYWwtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1hd2FyZW5lc3MtbW9udGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-20","14:00:00","{""Victoria"", ""NewBrunswick"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-23T17:26:00","A model granddaughter has gone public in support of her terminally ill grandmother’s decision to end her life on her own terms: “It’s the light at the end of the tunnel.”  Victoria’s Secret catwalker Ali Tate Cutler filmed an emotional conversation with her “Bubbie,” who will soon be euthanized in Canada. She uploaded the footage to TikTok on Saturday, where it quickly clocked more than 3.2 million views and divided opinion.  While Cutler, 32, is based in Austin, Texas, Bubbie resides in Canada, where euthanasia has been legal for adults since 2016. The practice — known as Medical Assistance in Dying — has drawn criticism in the past two years after Canadian lawmakers loosened the criteria for those who can qualify.  Bubbie has been battling cancer, but has not disclosed her name, age or the date she has chosen to end her life.  Speaking with The Post on Tuesday, Cutler said she spent an emotional final week with her grandmother in Canada, where she filmed the footage that she later posted to her TikTok.  “I’m a spiritual person and I signed up for the ride, the full spectrum of options,” the model declared. “We spent time talking and laughing together, going over memories. Watching her die well has been the biggest gift.”  Cutler told The Post that she was initially opposed to the practice of euthanasia until seeing the pain her grandmother was in.  “I didn’t think much about the ethics of it before,” she stated. “This is the first person I’ve really been close to who is dying, and it’s completely changed my mind.”  @alitatecutler Replying to @Matthew This was the hardest and most beautiful conversation ive ever had. Healing for both parties. I had resistance to Euthanasia before this, but after being with her and hearing her, I no longer do. ❤️ #euthanasia #finalfarewell #ondying ♬ multiverse – Maya Manuela  Ali Tate Cutler (right), 32, filmed the emotional conversation with her grandma, known only as Bubbie, before uploading it to TikTok on Saturday, where it quickly clocked up more than 3.2 million views and fiercely divided opinion. Instagram / @ali_tate_cutler  Cutler also revealed that all of her family has chosen to support Bubbie’s decision, although they are processing her impending death in different ways.  While the model has had a more emotional response, her father has been trying to process what euthanasia means from an intellectual standpoint.  In the caption of her viral TikTok video, Cutler declared: “How to live well and die well are codes, and she [Bubbie] has given me knowledge on both. I will treasure this conversation forever.”  While speaking with Bubbie in the footage, the model asked her grandmother how she came across euthanasia as an option after being faced with her terminal cancer diagnosis.  Bubbie explained that she sought it out, with doctors making sure her cancer diagnosis was terminal before they continued any further discussion. The medics also gave her “time” to consider whether it was something she actually wanted to pursue and insisted that she could change her mind up until the date of her death.  When discussing how the process will take place, Bubbie told Cutler that she has an “appointment” whereby medics will administer three different injections.  “The initial injection is putting you to sleep,” the grandmother explained. “Once you’re in a deep sleep, there’s two other injections. Once you get to that point, you don’t know, so it’s painless.”  Bubbie is having the procedure done at a hospital, saying: “I came in quietly, I’d like to go out quietly.”  “I’ve always made decisions for myself,” she defiantly declared. “I do believe my husband is there [in the afterlife] saying, ‘It’s about time.’ And I’ll say, ‘Hi Aaron, I’m here.’ That’s it.”  Many viewers were moved by the conversation between Cutler (right) and Bubbie, saying they supported the grandmother’s decision to end her life on her terms.

Instagram / @ali_tate_cutler  Many viewers were moved by the conversation between Cutler and Bubbie, saying they supported the grandmother’s decision to end her life on her terms.  “This is so bittersweet. It’s heartbreaking but comforting to know how sure she is. I’m happy her pain will be over but I’m sorry for your pending loss,” one wrote.  “Hospice aide here. This needs to be legal in every state. I’ve believed this for so many years,” a second supporter of euthanasia chimed in.  “I love that Canada truly has freedoms like this,” another concurred.  However, some viewers said the grandmother should choose to let things play out naturally, given that she seemed both comfortable and lucid.  “She seems so mentally present. Why would she want to do this ? Let God decide when,” one stated.  Another agreed, writing: “What’s the difference between euthanasia and suicide? In both cases is avoiding suffering. Why do you encourage this?”  “I’ve always made decisions for myself,” Bubbie (left) defiantly declared. “I do believe my husband is there [in the afterlife] saying, ‘It’s about time.’ And I’ll say, ‘Hi Aaron, I’m here.’ That’s it.”  Cutler shared several other TikTok videos alongside her grandmother, including one that showed them dolled up before they headed out for their final dinner at a restaurant together.  In Canada, euthanasia — also known as Medical Assistance in Dying — was legalized in 2016 for people aged 18 and over provided they met certain conditions: They had to have a serious condition, disease or disability that was in an advanced, irreversible state of decline and enduring “unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be relieved under conditions that patients consider acceptable.”  Their death also had to be “reasonably foreseeable,” and the request for euthanasia had to be approved by “at least two physicians.”  The law was later amended to allow people who are not terminally ill to choose death, significantly broadening the number of eligible people and leading to criticism that there are not enough safeguards in place.  Today, any adult with a serious illness, disease or disability can seek help in dying.  Earlier this year, there were reports that Canada could soon allow mentally ill minors to also end their own lives.  A 138-page report from the Canadian Parliament’s Special Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying listed a number of recommendations, including offering euthanasia to those under the age of 18.  “For MAID and mature minors, the committee heard a mix of views about whether MAID should be available to those under the age of 18,” the report said. “Many witnesses believed that age alone does not determine whether someone is capable of consenting to MAID. At the same time, a cautious approach was recommended, especially since there is little evidence from youth themselves on this topic.”  Cutler is based in Austin, Texas, but flew to Canada to say her final goodbyes to her grandmother. Getty Images for Beyond Yoga  Euthanasia is currently legal for adults in seven countries — Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain — plus several states in Australia.  In the Netherlands, MAID is available to minors 12 and over, while in Belgium there is no minimum age.  Back in January, a doctor from Belgium was forced to furiously deny claims that the country acted as a “euthanasia dispenser” for the rest of Europe after a French YouTube star said she was heading there for assisted suicide.  The YouTube star — a 23-year-old woman known as “Olympe” to her 268,000 subscribers — recently raised eyebrows when she claimed Belgian medics will be assisting with her suicide later this year.  As of this month, Olympe is still alive and posting videos on her popular social media pages.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL21vZGVsLXNoYXJlcy1ncmFuZG1hcy1maW5hbC1tb21lbnRzLWJlZm9yZS1iZWluZy1ldXRoYW5pemVkL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL21vZGVsLXNoYXJlcy1ncmFuZG1hcy1maW5hbC1tb21lbnRzLWJlZm9yZS1iZWluZy1ldXRoYW5pemVkL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2019-07-14","14:30:00","{""Lisbon"", ""Lisboa"", ""Portugal""}","2023-05-24T04:31:52","Current and past cinematic pieces covering end of life issues, such as “Plan 75,” are making their way back into cultural and political conversations. Regardless of belief in an “afterlife,” death and suffering are concepts most humans struggle to grasp.  Euthanasia is the act of intentionally ending a life to relieve suffering, and generally also includes assisted suicide or assisted dying. Euthanasia was legalized less than two weeks ago in Portugal. Canada is set to loosen their standards surrounding the procedure in 2024 and Spain recently upheld its euthanasia law. Versions are in effect in 10 out of 50 U.S. states, and pending in the New York state Legislature since 2015 as Medical Aid in Dying (MAID) (A995, S2445).  Countless individuals are riddled by seemingly irreversible chronic pain, illness, disease and disability. Some believe the costs of life outweigh the benefits for themselves, their families and communities, daily donating money, time and energy at large inconvenience.  However, there is a growing movement that embraces peaceful solutions for personal and societal harms, no matter how difficult or tragic. Non-violent advocates recognize age, infirmity and disability as gifts, laden with opportunities to forge and enjoy enhanced connections and interpersonal relationships with all those around them.  Another euthanasia-related mainstream film, “Me Before You,” was met with an uproar of criticism from the disabled community. Representatives claimed that the film promotes the notion that “disability is tragedy, and disabled people are better off dead.”  The relevant question is: Does an increase in suffering equal a decrease in value? I saw first-hand the beauty of embracing suffering and natural death while watching my parents, aunts and uncles give basic care, with patience and gentleness, to their beloved mother, even when severe Alzheimer’s disease and Dementia made them unrecognizable to her. They came together to affirm her intrinsic dignity and to return love to the woman they depended on as children.  In a different light, natural death need not be a burden, but a gift and an opportunity for loved ones to give of themselves.  Not everyone has support or loving, kind and thoughtful families. Advocates of non-violence understand this and support services for families wrought with pain. For example, a bill that aims to provide better support for those with life-threatening illness is currently pending in our state legislature and deserves support regardless of political affiliation.  Sadly, the MAID bills, also currently pending, smothers suffering’s potential redemptive richness, most poignantly for those vulnerable to exploitation.  MAID allows for “mentally competent terminally ill” people, beginning at age 18, to request and consume deadly medication that will end their lives. While MAID forbids calling death by MAID a “suicide,” “assisted suicide” or “mercy killing,” it involves the intentional taking of life.  Powerful evidence from the Anscombe Bioethics Centre depicts the total number of suicides rising significantly where euthanasia is legal, especially impacting older women. Suicide is a leading cause of death in states were MAID is legal, including Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado and Montana where suicide is a leading cause of death, including among youth.  A burgeoning body of research demonstrates that a significant portion of terminally ill patients consider themselves a burden to family and others, a relevant factor in making death-hastening decisions.  Gallup polling demonstrates that support for euthanasia is declining. Numerous professional associations and organizations oppose euthanasia, including, American Medical Association, World Medical Association, and American Association of People with Disabilities.  Progressive societies promote life-affirming solutions, not the violent destruction of human life. What will come of our society if inconvenience becomes a death sentence?  — — —  Emily Cappello is the operations manager and outreach coordinator for Feminists Choosing Life of New York in Rochester, which describes itself as a statewide human rights coalition.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkaXJvbmRhY2tkYWlseWVudGVycHJpc2UuY29tL29waW5pb24vZ3Vlc3QtY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIzLzA1L3RoZS1naWZ0LW9mLWRlYXRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Suicides (n = 38,529; 58.4%) accounted for the highest rate of violent death captured by NVDRS (15.8 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). The homicide rate was 7.5 per 100,000 population (n = 20,681; 31.3%). Deaths of undetermined intent (n = 5,429; 8.2%), legal intervention deaths (n = 874; 1.3%), and unintentional firearm deaths (n = 504; <1.0%) occurred at lower rates (2.0, 0.3, and 0.2 per 100,000 population, respectively). Data for deaths by manner that include statewide counts and the rates for California and Texas are available (Supplementary Table S2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523).  Suicides  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  For 2020, a total of 48 NVDRS states (46 states collecting statewide data, 35 California counties, and four Texas counties) and the District of Columbia collected data on 38,481 incidents involving 38,529 suicide deaths among persons aged ≥10 years (Supplementary Table S1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The overall suicide rate was 15.8 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years (Table 1).  The overall suicide rate for males (25.7 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) was 4.1 times the rate for females (6.3 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) (Table 1). The suicide rate for males ranged from 1.9 to 18.3 times the rate for females across age groups and 2.7 to 4.7 times the rate for females across racial and ethnic groups. Adults aged ≥85 years (20.1 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), 30–34 years (18.7 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), and 45–54 years (18.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) had the highest rates of suicide across age groups. White persons accounted for a majority (78.4%) of suicides; however, AI/AN persons had the highest rate of suicide (31.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) among all racial and ethnic groups.  Among male suicide decedents, nearly one half (46.2%) were aged 35–64 years (Table 1). By age group, men aged ≥85 years had the highest rate of suicide (51.3 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), followed by men aged 75–84 years (36.0 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) and 30–34 years (30.3 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). Across racial and ethnic groups, AI/AN males had the highest rate of suicide (48.9 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), followed by White males (31.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). The rate of suicide for AI/AN males was 4.0 times the rate for males with the lowest rate (i.e., non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander [A/PI]; 12.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). The suicide rate was 15.9 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years for Black males and 14.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years for Hispanic males.  Among females, those aged 35–64 years accounted for 52.6% of suicides (Table 1). Females aged 45–54 years had the highest rate of suicide (8.5 per 100,000 population), followed by those aged 35–44 years (7.5 per 100,000 population) and 55–64 years (7.2 per 100,000 population). The suicide rate was highest among AI/AN females (14.6 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), followed by White (7.6 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), A/PI (4.6 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), and Black and Hispanic (both 3.4 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) females. The suicide rate for AI/AN females was 4.3 times the rate for females with the lowest rates (i.e., Black and Hispanic females).  Method and Location of Injury  A firearm was used in more than one half (51.6%; 8.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) of suicides, followed by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (27.2%; 4.3 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) and poisoning (11.1%; 1.8 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) (Table 1). Among males, the most common method of injury was a firearm (56.7%), followed by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (26.7%). Among females, firearm (31.9%) was also the most common method of injury, followed by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (29.4%) and poisoning (27.3%). Among all suicide decedents, the most common location of suicide was a house or apartment (71.5%), followed by a motor vehicle (4.9%), a natural area (4.3%), a street or highway (2.6%), and a hotel or motel (2.2%).  Toxicology Results of Decedent  Toxicology tests for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) were conducted for 47.4% of suicide decedents (Table 2). Among those with positive results for alcohol (41.0%), 66.0% had a BAC ≥0.08 g/dL. Tests for the following substances were conducted for the percentage of decedents indicated in parentheses: amphetamines (38.0%), antidepressants (24.4%), barbiturates (31.3%), benzodiazepines (37.0%), cannabis (commonly referred to as marijuana; 34.7%), cocaine (36.9%), and opioids (39.6%). Positive results were found for 17.5% of decedents tested for amphetamines. Among those tested for antidepressants, 36.1% had positive results at the time of death; 2.1% of those tested for barbiturates had positive results, 21.9% of those tested for benzodiazepines had positive results, 28.3% of those tested for cannabis had positive results, and 6.1% of those tested for cocaine had positive results. Test results for opioids (including illicit and prescription opioids) were positive for 22.1% of decedents tested for these substances. Carbon monoxide was tested for a substantially smaller proportion of decedents (4.0%) but was identified in approximately one third of those decedents (35.3%).  Precipitating Circumstances  Circumstances were identified in 32,307 (83.9%) suicides (Table 3). Overall, a mental health problem was the most common circumstance, with approximately one half (47.8%) of decedents having a current diagnosed mental health problem and 31.9% experiencing a depressed mood at the time of death. Among the 15,433 decedents with a current diagnosed mental health problem, depression or dysthymia (73.1%), anxiety disorder (22.5%), and bipolar disorder (15.1%) were the most common diagnoses. Alcohol use problems were reported for 18.4% of suicide decedents, and other substance use problems (unrelated to alcohol) were reported for 17.7% of suicide decedents. Among suicide decedents, 24.1% were receiving mental health or substance use treatment at the time of death and 32.0% had a history of having been treated for a mental health or substance use problem (Table 3).  The most commonly reported interpersonal or life stressor–related precipitating circumstances for suicide were a recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks (29.8%), intimate partner problem (26.6%), physical health problem (19.9%), and argument or conflict (17.0%) (Table 3) (Supplementary Table S4, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among other circumstances related to suicide, 35.5% of decedents had a history of suicidal thoughts or plans, 29.7% left a suicide note, 23.2% had disclosed suicidal intent to another person, and 18.3% had a history of attempting suicide. Among those who disclosed intent, the greatest proportion of disclosures were to a previous or current intimate partner (38.9%), followed by a family member other than an intimate partner (34.8%) and friend or colleague (14.3%).  When examining known circumstances by sex, a larger percentage of female decedents (63.0%) had a current diagnosed mental health problem than did male decedents (43.8%) (Table 3). Male and female suicide decedents had similar percentages of depressed mood at the time of their death (31.8% and 32.3%, respectively). A larger percentage of female decedents (36.3%) than male decedents (20.9%) were known to have been receiving mental health or substance treatment at the time of death. Suicide events (e.g., leaving a suicide note), history of suicidal thoughts or plans, and history of attempting suicide occurred more frequently and at higher rates among females than males.  Homicides  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  For 2020, a total of 48 NVDRS states (46 states collecting statewide data, 35 California counties, and four Texas counties) and the District of Columbia collected data on 19,705 incidents (Supplementary Table S1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523) involving 20,681 homicide deaths. The overall homicide rate was 7.5 per 100,000 population (Table 4).  The homicide rates were higher among males than females across nearly all age groups, and the rate was highest among adults aged 20–24 years (18.2 per 100,000 population) (Table 4). The homicide rate for men aged 20–24 years (30.8 per 100,000 population) was six times the rate for females in the same age group (5.1 per 100,000 population). Among males, the rate of homicide was highest among adults aged 20–24 years (30.8 per 100,000 population) and 25–29 years (28.0 per 100,000 population). Among females, the rate of homicide was highest among infants (i.e., children aged <1 year; 5.3 per 100,000 population). Among all children who were homicide victims, the overall homicide rate for infants (6.9 per 100,000 population) was 3.6 times the overall rate for children aged 1–4 years (1.9 per 100,000 population) and 8.6 times the rate for children aged 5–9 years (0.8 per 100,000 population).  Black persons accounted for 61.8% of male homicide victims and more than one half (58.0%) of all homicide victims (Table 4). Black males had the highest rate of homicide compared with males in all other racial and ethnic groups (57.6 per 100,000 population); this rate was 25.0 times the rate for A/PI males (2.3 per 100,000 population), 14.8 times the rate for White males (3.9 per 100,000 population), 5.1 times the rate for Hispanic males (11.2 per 100,000 population), and 2.6 times the rate for AI/AN males (21.9 per 100,000 population). Among females, the homicide rate was also highest among Black females (8.2 per 100,000 population) (Table 4), followed by AI/AN females (6.4 per 100,000 population), Hispanic females (2.2 per 100,000 population), White females (1.8 per 100,000 population), and A/PI females (0.9 per 100,000 population).  Method, Location of Injury, and Victim-Suspect Relationship  The weapons most commonly used in homicides were firearms, used in 76.7% of homicides overall; followed by a sharp instrument (9.1%); a blunt instrument (3.3%); personal weapons (e.g., hands, feet, or fists; 2.5%); and hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (1.5%) (Table 4). The method was unknown in 4.3% of homicides. A firearm was the most common method of injury for both males (80.1%) and females (61.9%); however, the firearm homicide rate for males (9.9 per 100,000 population) was 5.8 times the rate for females (1.7 per 100,000 population). A larger proportion of homicides among females than males involved a sharp instrument (13.0% versus 8.2%, respectively); blunt instrument (5.5% versus 2.8%, respectively); hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (4.5% versus <1.0%, respectively); and personal weapons (3.9% versus 2.1%, respectively). Among all homicide victims, a house or apartment was the most common location of homicide (41.0%); followed by a street or highway (22.3%); a motor vehicle (10.3%); and a parking lot, public garage, or public transport (4.5%). A larger proportion of homicides among females (59.9%) than among males (36.6%) occurred at a house or apartment, whereas a larger proportion of homicides among males (25.0%) than among females (10.4%) occurred on a street or highway.  The relationship of the victim to the suspect was known for 32.8% of homicides (28.4% of males and 51.6% of females) (Table 4). For males, when the relationship was known, the victim-suspect relationship was most often an acquaintance or friend (30.9%); other person known to the victim, but the exact nature of the relationship was unclear (22.2%); a stranger (18.1%); a current or former intimate partner (7.9%); or other relative (7.4%). For females, when the relationship was known, one half (50.0%) of suspects were a current or former intimate partner, followed by an acquaintance or friend (9.2%); a child or other person known to victim, but the exact nature of the relationship was unclear (both 8.4%); or a parent (8.3%).  Precipitating Circumstances  Precipitating circumstances were identified in 69.1% of homicides (Table 5). One third of homicides with known circumstances were precipitated by an argument or conflict (33.9%), and 14.6% of homicides with known circumstances were related to intimate partner violence (Table 5). Intimate partner violence–related deaths include deaths related to conflict or violence between current or former intimate partners and also include deaths associated with intimate partner violence that are not deaths of the intimate partners themselves (e.g., a former boyfriend killing an ex-partner’s new boyfriend). Homicides also were commonly precipitated by another crime (22.9%); in 66.0% of those cases, the crime was in progress at the time of the incident. The most frequent types of precipitating crimes were assault or homicide (38.9%), robbery (32.9%), drug trade§§ (14.5%), burglary (10.8%), motor vehicle theft (5.0%), rape or sexual assault (2.3%), and arson (1.7%) (Supplementary Table S6, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). A physical fight between two persons (13.7%), a drive-by shooting (12.7%), and drug involvement (e.g., relating to a drug habit or illegal drug trafficking; 10.3%) were other common precipitating circumstances.  Among the identified homicide circumstances, several differences were noted by decedent’s sex, and intimate partner violence accounted for the largest percentage difference. Intimate partner violence was a precipitating circumstance for approximately 41.3% of homicides among females but only 7.9% of homicides among males (Table 5). In incidents where intimate partner violence was a precipitating circumstance and victim-suspect relationship was known, the suspect was a current or former intimate partner in 92.8% of homicides among females and 50.3% of homicides among males. Females were more often the direct victims of intimate partner violence–related homicides, whereas males were more often corollary victims. A larger proportion of homicides of females than males also resulted from caregiver abuse or neglect (9.0% versus 2.7%) or were perpetrated by a suspect with a mental health problem (e.g., schizophrenia or other psychotic conditions, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder) (6.3% versus 1.7%). A larger proportion of homicides of males than females were preceded by a physical fight (14.9% versus 8.9%), involved drugs (11.4% versus 6.0%), or were gang related (8.8% versus 3.3%). A larger proportion of male homicide victims (8.4%) than female homicide victims (1.4%) also were reported to have used a weapon during the incident.  Legal Intervention Deaths  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  For 2020, a total of 48 NVDRS states (46 states collecting statewide data, 35 California counties, and four Texas counties) and the District of Columbia collected data on 868 incidents involving 874 legal intervention deaths (Supplementary Table S1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The highest rate of legal intervention death by age group was among men aged 30–34 years (1.5 per 100,000 population), followed by men aged 25–29 years (1.4 per 100,000 population) and 35–44 years (1.2 per 100,000 population) (Table 6). Approximately all legal intervention deaths were among males (96.2%). Although White males accounted for nearly one half (49.1%) of all legal intervention deaths, AI/AN males had the highest legal intervention death rate (3.1 per 100,000 population), representing a rate 6.2 times that of White males (0.5 per 100,000 population). The legal intervention death rate for Black males (1.2 per 100,000 population) was 2.4 times the rate for White males. The legal intervention death rate for Hispanic males was 0.7 per 100,000 population.  Method and Location of Injury  A firearm was used in a majority (85.2%) of legal intervention deaths (Table 6). Legal intervention deaths occurred most frequently in a house or apartment (35.5%), followed by a street or highway (25.7%) or a motor vehicle (9.6%).  Precipitating Circumstances  Precipitating circumstances were identified in 90.4% of legal intervention deaths (Table 7). The decedent reportedly used a weapon in 69.4% of legal intervention death cases. In 25.8% of legal intervention deaths with known circumstances, a substance use problem (other than alcohol) was reported as a contributing factor, and 20.1% of decedents reportedly had a current diagnosed mental health problem. An argument or conflict or physical fight precipitated 15.4% and 6.7% of legal intervention deaths, respectively. A recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks was reported in 7.6% of legal intervention deaths. Among legal intervention deaths with known circumstances, intimate partner violence (10.3%), being a perpetrator of interpersonal violence during the past month (12.7%), family relationship problems (5.6%), and drug involvement (4.6%) were other notable precipitating circumstances.  Unintentional Firearm Deaths  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  In 2020, a total of 48 NVDRS states (46 states collecting statewide data, 35 California counties, and four Texas counties) and the District of Columbia collected data on 500 incidents involving 504 unintentional firearm deaths (Supplementary Table S1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Nearly one half (n = 225; 44.6%; data not shown) of these deaths were self-inflicted, and 170 deaths (33.7%; data not shown) were known to be inflicted by another person; for the remaining 109 deaths (21.6%; data not shown), whether the injury was inflicted by the decedent or by another person was unknown. Males accounted for 86.1% of decedents (Table 8). Persons aged ≤24 years accounted for more than one half (55.4%) of all unintentional firearm deaths. The majority of decedents were White persons (52.8%), followed by Black persons (33.1%).  Location of Injury and Firearm Type  Among unintentional firearm deaths, 75.0% occurred in a house or apartment, followed by a motor vehicle (5.8%) or a natural area (4.6%) (Table 8). The majority of unintentional firearm deaths involved a handgun (59.9%), followed by a rifle (8.7%) or a shotgun (6.7%). The firearm type was unknown in approximately one quarter (24.6%) of unintentional firearm deaths.  Context and Circumstances of Injury  The context and circumstances of injury were identified in 81.3% of unintentional firearm deaths (Table 9). Among those with context and circumstance information, the context of injury for nearly one half (47.1%) of unintentional firearm deaths was playing with a gun. Other contexts of injury were showing the gun to others (11.2%), cleaning the gun (7.3%), and loading or unloading the gun (4.6%). Approximately one fourth (27.8%) of unintentional firearm deaths were caused by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger; 10.5% were caused by a person mistakenly thinking the gun was unloaded, and 8.0% of deaths were because of the gun being mistaken for a toy.  Deaths of Undetermined Intent  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  In 2020, a total of 48 NVDRS states (46 states collecting statewide data, 35 California counties, and four Texas counties) and the District of Columbia collected data on 5,386 incidents involving 5,429 deaths of undetermined intent (Supplementary Table S1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The overall rate of deaths of undetermined intent was 2.0 per 100,000 population (Supplementary Table S10, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The rate of deaths of undetermined intent was higher among males (2.7 per 100,000 population) than among females (1.2 per 100,000 population). Approximately two thirds (69.8%) of deaths of undetermined intent were among adults aged 30–64 years. The rate of deaths of undetermined intent was highest among males aged 30–34 years (4.7 per 100,000 population), followed by males aged 35–44 and 45–54 years (both 4.3 per 100,000 population) and 55–64 years (3.9 per 100,000 population). The rate of deaths of undetermined intent among infants (i.e., children aged <1 year) was 2.7 per 100,000 population. Although White persons accounted for the majority (63.7%; 2.0 per 100,000 population) of deaths of undetermined intent, AI/AN persons had the highest rate (4.3 per 100,000 population). Among males, AI/AN males (5.6 per 100,000 population) and Black males (5.4 per 100,000 population) had the highest rate of deaths of undetermined intent. Among females, AI/AN females also had the highest rate of deaths of undetermined intent (3.1 per 100,000 population), followed by Black females (1.7 per 100,000 population).  Method and Location of Injury  Poisoning was the most common method of injury in deaths of undetermined intent (66.4%), followed by firearm (4.5%); drowning (4.1%); blunt instrument (2.9%); fall (2.8%); motor vehicle (2.7%); and fire or burns or hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (2.0% each). Personal weapons, sharp instruments, intentional neglect, shaking, and other methods were each used as method of injury in <1.0% of undetermined intent deaths (Supplementary Table S10, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Weapon type was unknown for 10.0% of undetermined intent deaths. The majority of deaths of undetermined intent occurred in a house or apartment (63.8%), followed by a street or highway (4.8%), a natural area (4.7%), or a hotel or motel (4.0%).  Toxicology Results of Decedent  Toxicology tests for BAC were conducted for 70.7% of decedents in deaths of undetermined intent (Supplementary Table S11, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among those with positive results for alcohol (37.4%), 47.2% had a BAC ≥0.08 g/dL. Tests for the following substances were conducted for the percentage of decedents indicated in parentheses: amphetamines (36.5%), antidepressants (34.3%), benzodiazepines (38.3%), cannabis (commonly referred to as marijuana; 33.0%), cocaine (46.4%), and opioids (71.0%). Among decedents tested for amphetamines, 34.3% had positive test results. Among those tested for antidepressants, 52.1% had positive results at the time of death; 40.8% of those tested for benzodiazepines had positive results, 34.5% of those tested for cannabis had positive results, and 43.4% of those tested for cocaine had positive results. Results for opioids (illicit or prescription) were positive in 76.9% of decedents tested. Carbon monoxide was tested for a substantially smaller proportion of decedents (4.1%) but was identified in 65.3% of those decedents.  Precipitating Circumstances  Circumstances were identified in 78.0% of deaths of undetermined intent (Supplementary Table S12, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among deaths of undetermined intent with known circumstances, 34.3% of decedents had a current diagnosed mental health problem at time of death; depression or dysthymia (54.1%), anxiety disorder (27.2%), and bipolar disorder (21.0%) were the most common diagnoses among these decedents, and 7.9% had a current depressed mood. Substance use problems (other than alcohol; 68.8%) and alcohol problems (25.3%) were the most commonly reported circumstances. Among all deaths of undetermined intent, 20.3% were receiving mental health or substance use treatment at the time of death; 27.7% of decedents had a history of ever being treated for a mental health or substance use problem. Physical health problems (12.7%) and a recent or impending crisis during the preceding or upcoming 2 weeks (9.9%) were other life stressors identified in deaths of undetermined intent (Supplementary Table S13, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among decedents, 10.5% had a history of suicidal thoughts or plans, 7.3% had a history of attempting suicide, and 4.9% had disclosed intent to die by suicide.  Violent Deaths in Puerto Rico  For 2020, Puerto Rico collected data on 729 incidents involving 790 deaths (data not shown). Homicide (n = 550) accounted for the largest proportion (69.6%) and highest rate (16.8 per 100,000 population) of violent deaths, followed by suicide (n = 210; 26.6%; 7.0 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years) (Supplementary Tables S14 and S17, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523).  Homicides  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  In 2020, a total of 500 homicides among males and 49 homicides among females were reported in Puerto Rico (Supplementary Table S14, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The overall homicide rate for males (32.2 per 100,000 population) was 11.5 times the rate for females (2.8 per 100,000 population). Among males, the homicide rate was 79.8 per 100,000 population among adults aged 18–29 years and 66.5 per 100,000 population among those aged 30–44 years. Most (94.5%) homicide victims were Hispanic.  Method, Location of Injury, and Victim-Suspect Relationship  A firearm was used in a majority (88.9%) of homicides (Supplementary Table S14, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). A firearm was the most common method used in homicides of both males (89.6%) and females (83.7%); however, the firearm homicide rate for males (28.8 per 100,000 population) was 12 times the rate for females (2.4 per 100,000 population). Among males, a street or highway was the most common location (49.0%) of homicides, whereas a house or apartment was the most common location (40.8%) of homicides for females.  The victim-suspect relationship was known for 48.9% of homicides (Supplementary Table S14, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). When the relationship was known, the suspect for male victims was most often a person known to the victim, but the exact nature of the relationship was unclear (39.5%), followed by a rival gang member (30.5%). Among females, the suspect was most often a current or former intimate partner (38.9%), followed by a person known to the victim, but the exact nature of the relationship was unclear (27.8%).  Toxicology Results of Decedent  Tests for BAC were conducted for 99.3% of homicide decedents (Supplementary Table S15, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among those with positive results for alcohol (26.6%), 34.5% had a BAC ≥0.08 g/dL. Tests for cocaine, cannabis (commonly referred to as marijuana), and opioids were conducted for 99.3%, 75.1%, and 99.3% of decedents, respectively. Results for cocaine, cannabis, and opioids were positive in 18.1%, 31.0%, and 9.0% of decedents tested, respectively.  Precipitating Circumstances  Precipitating circumstances were identified in 97.3% of homicides (Supplementary Table S16, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among males, more than one half (50.3%) of homicides were gang related, 43.1% involved drugs, and approximately one fourth (22.0%) involved drive-by shootings. Intimate partner violence was identified as a contributing factor in 9.0% of homicides overall; approximately one third (33.3%) of homicides among females were precipitated by intimate partner violence, compared with 6.6% of homicides among males.  Suicides  Sex, Age Group, and Race and Ethnicity  In 2020, a total of 210 suicides among persons aged ≥10 years (178 suicides among males and 32 suicides among females) were reported in Puerto Rico (Supplementary Table S17, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). The suicide rate for males was 6.2 times the rate for females (12.5 versus 2.0 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). The suicide rates were highest among men aged ≥65 years (16.3 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), 45–64 years (16.2 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years), and 30–44 years (13.5 per 100,000 population aged ≥10 years). The majority (90.5%) of suicide decedents overall were Hispanic.  Method and Location of Injury  Hanging, strangulation, or suffocation was the most commonly used method for suicide among both males (66.9%) and females (50.0%) (Supplementary Table S17, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). A firearm was used in 18.0% of suicides among males. The most common location where a suicide took place was a house or apartment both for males (76.4%) and females (93.8%).  Toxicology Results of Decedent  Tests for BAC were conducted for 97.6% of suicide decedents (Supplementary Table S18, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Among those with positive results for alcohol (29.3%), 60.0% had a BAC ≥0.08 g/dL. Other than alcohol, suicide decedents were most often tested for cocaine (97.1%), cannabis (commonly referred to as marijuana; 65.2%), and opioids (97.1%). Results for cocaine, cannabis, and opioids were positive in 12.3%, 8.8%, and 6.4% of decedents tested, respectively.  Precipitating Circumstances  Circumstances were identified in 93.8% of suicides (Supplementary Table S19, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127523). Overall, a mental health problem was the most common circumstance among suicide decedents, with 52.8% having a current diagnosed mental health problem and 49.7% experiencing a depressed mood at the time of death.  Among males, 49.7% of suicide decedents had a current depressed mood, and 49.1% had a current diagnosed mental health problem. Depression or dysthymia was most often the mental health diagnosis experienced by male suicide decedents with a diagnosed mental health problem (77.8%), followed by anxiety disorder (18.5%). Approximately one third (31.5%) of male suicide decedents had a history of ever being treated for a mental health or substance use problem. Approximately one fourth (23.0%) of male suicide decedents had a history of expressing suicidal thoughts and plans, and 22.4% had a history of attempting suicide. Other precipitating circumstances for male suicide decedents included physical health problem (17.6%) and intimate partner problems (15.2%).  Among female suicide decedents, 50.0% had a current depressed mood, and 71.9% had a current diagnosed mental health problem. Depression or dysthymia was most often the mental health diagnosis experienced by female suicide decedents who had a diagnosed mental health problem (73.9%). One half (50.0%) of female decedents had a history of ever being treated for a mental health or substance use problem, 40.6% were known to have been receiving mental health or substance use treatment at the time of death, and 34.4% had a history of attempting suicide.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNkYy5nb3YvbW13ci92b2x1bWVzLzcyL3NzL3NzNzIwNWExLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It's time to have real conversations about our mental health. ABC Owned Television Stations presents an original documentary examining the state of mental health in America by looking inside the lives of those who suffer, the stigma associated with mental illness, organizations making a difference and those standing up to give hope.  ""Our America: Mental State"" explores five key areas:  The state of mental health in America  Millions suffer but it goes unnoticed. 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with a mental disorder every year, with 1 in 10 children facing a serious emotional disturbance. Despite cries for help and a pandemic that has brought to light these struggles, there are not enough mental health providers to help those in need and an insurance system that's too complicated to navigate. In fact, nearly 2,000 counties in the U.S. have fewer than 50 mental health care providers per 100,000 residents. How did we get here and what needs to change?  Stigma  Two-thirds of adults and children who experienced a major depressive episode did not receive mental health services. Whether it's the fear of being labeled as ""psychotic"" or ""crazy,"" to the cultural and generational views of mental health, stigma has deep roots. Why? We look at the issues stigma creates and how we can break free of the misconceptions of mental illness.  Speaking up  Would you be able to recognize someone struggling with mental health? Many can mask their struggles from their family and friends, only to find out when tragedy strikes. Go inside the life of the mother of a high school football star who died by suicide and how she is using her trauma to speak up for others.  Built from the ground up  Lack of mental health providers for children and adults can have dire consequences later in life. Experts agree that early prevention is crucial in staving off future issues. Recent studies show a third of mental health disorders develop by age 14 and about half by 18 and it's usually years later until help is sought. So, what are we to do? We meet the people who are building access to care for everyone from the ground up.  Change  Mental health experts agree, early prevention can tremendously help anyone going through a mental episode. Meet Dr. Felipe Mercado, formerly homeless and a drug addict, knew his life could have been different had someone intervened when he was younger. Now as a father and advocate, he is determined to make the change in mental health by training the next generation of mental health experts.

A MORAY man whose world was turned upside-down by suicide is hoping to use his life experiences to help others through their darkest days.  In 2019, Steve Ferrett received an unexpected phone call from police. His son, Stephen, had taken his own life. He was just 27.  At a celebration of Stephen's life, in the chapel of rest, he promised his son he would not stop championing mental health.  Four years on, true to his word, Steve is a fully-trained volunteer with the Elgin branch of Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide (SoBS), who he said helped him through his worst days.  Steve Ferrett is hoping that people going through the loss of a friend or family member through suicide will come forward and attend the meetings. Picture: Beth Taylor  His hope is to reach people in Moray who are in a situation similar to the one he found himself in, to give them a chance to open up and speak to like-minded members of the community.  ""It was getting in touch with Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide that really got me started on my journey towards looking forward to living again,"" Steve said.  ""When I was going through the mill, SOBS gave me the strength I needed to try to move forward. Bereavement is always there, it's about how you build your life around it.  ""We offer a group that meets, sits and discusses bereavement. Sharing with like-minded people who have gone through similar can provide hope and support.  ""If we make somebody's life a little easier then we have done our job.""  The Elgin branch of SoBS meet on the third Tuesday of every month at 7.30pm at a room within Borough Briggs in Elgin.  Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide (SoBS) volunteer, Steve Ferrett, outside Borough Briggs where the group meets. ..Picture: Beth Taylor.  There are currently only four members attending on a monthly basis, with others dropping in occasionally.  However, Steve is sure there are more people in Moray who would benefit from the service provided – and wants to make clear that all are welcome.  ""We want to put the Elgin group on the map and let people know we are here,"" he added.  ""There is a massive catchment area and I'm pretty sure there will be people who are suffering and requiring support. There will be people out there in a dark place and they need a chink of light.  ""We let people talk, we listen and try to guide them as much as we can.  ""People can stay at meetings as long as they want and say as much or as little as they want. Sometimes newcomers don't say a lot, but it is their choice and there is absolute confidentiality.  ""All SOBS volunteers are well-trained and go through a rigorous screening process.""  Contact with the group can be made through Steve on elgin@uksobs.org or by phone on 07754068529. Free tea and coffee, as well as cakes, will be offered at meetings.  For men who don't want to attend an in-person meeting, BereaveMENt – which meets on the first Tuesday of the month – offers a similar service online. Contact can be made with bereaveMENt@uksobs.org.  ""Give me a ring, if you are ready, and speak about coming to either group,"" Steve, who is also involved with the online group, added.

"suicide","2023-05-08","10:00:00","{""Galesburg"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T16:26:00","May is Mental Health Awareness Month.  At a work session Monday, the Galesburg city council heard from several organizations that want to work together to improve mental health and substance abuse issues in the community.  “As everyone knows, we have challenges, as do all communities,” said Mayor Peter Schwartzman. “We’re here tonight to share in those and to see if there are ways the city can participate and move in positive directions.”  Reducing stigma and early intervention were recurring themes in the wide-ranging discussion that covered issues from addiction and suicide to poverty and foster care.  “It’s not scary to go to a counselor or therapist, and everybody should do it if they have the opportunity or they need it,” said Stacy Brown, vice president for behavioral health services at Bridgeway.  Bridgeway is a non-profit formed in 1993 by a merger of several other community health organizations in west central Illinois. It now has 600 employees and serves 10,000 people through a variety of mental health, human service, and substance use programs.  “We meet with people who are just struggling with life decisions and life issues clear up to people who are experiencing PTSD and schizophrenia,” Brown said.  She said many people aren’t aware that Bridgeway exists and what it provides – and likely aren’t getting the help they need.  “Stigma is huge. It’s very real. Unless we really start talking about mental health and substance use and realize that it happens in our community and our families, people we know, people we work with, we’re never going to move forward and work on getting people the help they need,” Brown said.  One of the challenges in the Galesburg area is lack of local psychiatric hospitalization options, with people having to travel to Peoria, Chicago, and beyond.  With the closure of Cottage Hospital last year, the community lost a geriatric psychiatric unit.  While Bridgeway operates the Recovery Oriented System of Care and other substance use programs, Brown said the closest in-patient substance abuse treatment facility is 50 miles away.  “So our peer recovery support specialists, who are people with lived experience, people who have experienced this in their lives, work every day driving people to treatment needs,” Brown said.  There are positives in the Galesburg area, such as the Knox County 708 Mental Health Board approved by voters in 2017, through which a slight property tax increase funds grants for organizations providing mental health services.  In addition, through United Way of Knox County, the community has a 211 hotline for information on all health and human services programs.  Brown said poverty, mental health, and substance abuse issues go hand in hand.  Organizations like CASA of West Central Illinois are there to advocate for the children who end up in foster care as a result.  But there is a need locally for more volunteer advocates.  Currently CASA is only able to serve about half of the children in foster care in Knox, Warren, Henderson, and McDonough counties.  Stephanie Brockett, a social worker for the Center of Youth and Family Solutions in Galesburg, said in addition to addressing the mental health and substance abuse issues that force children into foster care, families need childcare and children need adequate opportunities.  She said one possibility to address such gaps in Galesburg is a proposed community center.  “I think that’s an excellent opportunity to think from a different perspective,” Brockett said. “Rather than saying I now have a kid who is in foster care, what do I do with them, if I think about a community center, I can say how can I support this family so that the system is never involved in the first place?”  Representatives from Out of the Darkness and Foster's Voice, two suicide prevention organizations, also spoke to the council about their efforts.  Foster’s Voice was founded by the parents of a Quad Cities teenager who committed suicide in 2017.  Foster Atwood was 19 when he died and had been on a waiting list to get the help he needed.  His father Kevin Atwood said the mission of Foster’s Voice is to end stigma by improving conversations about suicide.  “Understand, first and foremost, it’s not talking about suicide that leads to suicide. That’s the first thing you have to understand. Talking about suicide does not lead or cause someone to contemplate suicide. It’s just the opposite,” Atwood said.  Foster’s Voice operates a club at Galesburg High School.  Tri States Public Radio produced this story.

(JFI), a nationally recognized leader in suicide awareness and prevention, and the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (DCS) announced today a collaboration aiming to reduce suicidal ideation and behavior among youth in the foster care system. The Jason Foundation produced the educational seminar ""Preventing Suicide Among Foster Care Youth: A Training for Foster, Adoptive, and Other Out-of-Home Caregivers,"" released earlier this year. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services has adopted the module as part of the training and education required by prospective and current foster families within the state. The seminar will also be made available to DCS staff.  While suicide is a significant public health crisis for the general population, the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior increases for youth in care because of the complex circumstances they often face.  At any given time, nationally there are estimated to be approximately 400,000 youth in care.  Youth in care may have complex medical, mental, and behavioral health concerns stemming from a trauma history.  Children who are adopted wait an average of almost three years in our country.  This training module discusses facts, myths, and signs regarding suicide risk for youth involved with the child welfare system. Specialized topics such as trauma and adverse childhood experiences are also discussed. Material is presented by a professional speaker and people with lived experience (former foster youth, foster and adoptive families, and experts in the field). Suggested protective factors and recommendations are provided for caregivers.  The announcement follows Tennessee Governor Bill Lee's recognition of May as Foster Care Month in Tennessee. May is also recognized as Mental Health Month. Across the nation, individuals and organizations alike are raising awareness of mental health well-being and the importance of open communication on the subject.  ""Every child deserves to know they are loved and that they belong, and this year, Tennessee is making historic investments to ensure that foster children have our strongest support,"" said Gov. Lee. ""We thank The Jason Foundation for partnering with the Department of Children's Services to provide additional resources for foster families and caregivers across our state.""  ""We're fortunate to have The Jason Foundation anchored in our state where we can partner with Tennesseans doing great work preventing youth and children from tragic circumstances of suicide. The Jason Foundation formulated evidence-based practices coupled with empathic, compassionate, strong, resilient voices who prepare foster families to best serve the needs of custodial youth,"" added Tennessee DCS Commissioner Margie Quin.  ""The Jason Foundation is excited to be working with the Tennessee Department of Children's Services and many other state entities to provide additional resources for families across our state,"" remarked Clark Flatt, President for The Jason Foundation. ""This newly formed collaboration has the opportunity to save young lives and truly make a difference within the foster care community.""  The Jason Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting the ""silent epidemic"" of youth and young adult suicide through educational programs for young people, educators, parents, and other community groups.

Stern, 69, is best known for his popular radio show, The Howard Stern Show, which has hosted the likes of Kim Kardashian, Nick Cannon and Bruce Springsteen over the years.  However, back in 1994, the New York City-born creative managed to convince a man not to jump off the George Washington Bridge.  The desperate man told Stern and his co-host, Robin Quivers, that he was planning to jump off the 184-metre suspension bridge and plunge to his death.  Advert 10  The Howard Stern Show is a favourite of celebrities. Credit: The Howard Stern Show.  Live on air, the host asked Bonilla: “Why are you killing yourself?” to which the man replied: “Because life sucks sometimes you know?  “I been here before, I come here often to think and I regret the moment that I haven’t jumped earlier.”  Stern employed humour throughout the five-minute conversation, even joking with listeners that Bonilla 'had jumped' when the line went unexpectedly dead for a few seconds.  Advert 10  He also claimed that if the married man went through with the jump, then he wouldn’t be alive to watch Stern’s forthcoming film, Private Parts.  While broadcasting, one listener went to the George Washington Bridge to stop Bonilla from jumping.  According to EightiesKids, the woman who stopped the suicide was Miss Helen Trimble from Brooklyn.  Advert 10  The suicide prevention call is from way back in 1994.

They took Bonilla into custody and later helped him receive psychiatric help for his suicidal tendencies.  For those wanting to get more acquainted with the moment, an hour-long video of the incident can be found on YouTube, which documents the chat between Stern and the man in full.  Advert 10  Over the years, fans have flocked to the comments to commend the host for his quick thinking and his ability to talk Bonilla down.  After watching the 29-year-old video, one YouTube user wrote: “As someone who tried to commit and struggled throughout my life, Howard was great. He didn’t do the cliche of ‘Please don’t do it, you’re worth it'.  “He used humour to make him laugh and forget that he’s even trying to jump. He may sound insensitive, but that’s how comedians are, and he truly helped.”  Loading…  Advert 10  Another said: “People saying Howard was being insensitive to the guy don’t know what they’re talking about.

Now the suit is settled — and its terms include measures to help prevent another such tragedy.  ""Camika Shelby and Patrick Cruz, the parents of 15-year-old Nigel Shelby, settled a civil lawsuit against the Huntsville City Board of Education and the high school's then-freshman principal, Jo Stafford in March,"" NBC News reported.  ""Nigel was loved at home, but that wasn't enough, obviously,"" Shelby told NBC News, giving her first interview since the settlement, which included a monetary sum of $840,000.  ""I just want kids of the LGBTQ community, Black kids, all kids really to be able to go to school and feel comfortable and not feel closed in, alone, alienated,"" Shelby added.  The terms of the settlement will hopefully help achieve that end. NBC reported that ""the Huntsville City Board of Education is required to implement a number of policies aimed at ensuring the safety and security of LGBTQ students in the district,"" including ""a districtwide electronic recording system where incidents of bullying can be monitored; the hiring of external consultants to advise on best practices and policies to investigate harassment; and the clarification of Title IX policies to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual expression.""  Moreover, the news report added, ""The board is required to provide Shelby's counsel with annual reports for three years demonstrating compliance.""  The state's policy regarding bullying doesn't cover harassment directed at victims due to sexual orientation or gender identity, NBC News noted, so the terms — while constructive — may mean that the school district is something of an oasis.  Shelby's attorney, Adele Kimmel, told the news outlet, ""These cases are not just about accountability. It's also about trying to make a systemic change to change the culture of the school district.""  ""That requires policy changes, training programs, climate surveys and then some way to make sure that all of these things are actually happening,"" Kimmel went on to say.  The progress represented by the settlement's preventative measures may be fragile, though. NBC relayed that ""more state legislatures embrace policies that limit or bar gender-affirming care for transgender youth and other restrictive measures for LGBTQ youth,"" and there's a possibility that ""future state legislation"" will cast doubt on the ""enforceability of this part in the agreement...""  The report detailed the horrific abuse Nigel faced on a daily basis. ""Students allegedly told Nigel to kill himself repeatedly,"" the report said. According to the suit, ""at one meeting, Stafford told Nigel that bullying was the price he had to pay for being gay and for making 'adult' posts on social media about his sexual orientation,"" NBC added.  Even some of Nigel's schoolmates tried to persuade the school to take action as the bullying continued, the suit claimed, and they ""relayed worries over suicidal thoughts the student was expressing.... Stafford allegedly downplayed the serious nature of the conversation, asking reportedly if this was 'another one of his episodes where life is getting too hard and things get tough and we want to kill ourselves.'""  ""Stafford and spokespeople for the Huntsville Board of Education did not immediately respond to requests for comment,"" NBC News said.  But the superintendent of Hunstville City Schools, Christie Finley, said in a statement that ""First and foremost, we continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to Nigel's family, friends and school community.""  Added the statement: ""While we understand nothing can replace the life of a student, it is our hope that the settlement will bring a sense of peace and closure for all involved.""  Nigel killed himself on April 18, 2019. But the bullying didn't stop with his death — and it wasn't limited to Nigel's fellow teens. A law enforcement officer, identified in the media reports at the time as Madison County Deputy Jeff Graves, took to social media to mock the young man, reportedly starting a homophobic screed with, ""Liberty Guns Bible Trump BBQ. That's my kind of LGBTQ.""  The post, which was later deleted, reportedly said, ""I'm seriously offended that there is such a thing as this movement. Society cannot and should not except this behavior.""  ""I have a right to be offended and will always be offended by this fake movement which requires no special attention but by people with an altered ego and fake agenda.""  Graves was placed on leave as the department investigated the post, and subsequently resigned. The following July, Graves ""was hired by the Owens Cross Roads Police Department, which has five full time and two part-time officers,"" NBC News reported at the time.

You may be surprised to hear this but it’s true. Of the top 10 countries with the highest suicide rates globally, 6 are African countries. Yet this is rarely spoken about. There’s a cultural belief that suicide is ‘not an African problem’ or that it’s taboo to talk about it in this part of the world. But the facts clearly show otherwise. Suicide is a real issue that affects real people on our continent, and it urgently needs to be addressed.  Losing someone to suicide, or having a loved that is considering suicide or has attempted it can be a very painful experience for anybody. It’s important to know that people experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviour can get better if the right steps are taken (such as seeking professional help).

"suicide","2016-09-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T13:17:54","One of the latest covers of the magazine The Economist carries a headline “Peak China”. This, as its name suggests, is a claim that while during the last seven decades China’s has enjoyed a peaceful “rise”, specifically in relation to the U.S., this has now ended:  Whereas a decade ago forecasters predicted that China’s GDP would zoom past America’s during the mid-21st century (at market exchange rates) and retain a commanding lead, now a much less dramatic shift is in the offing, resulting in something closer to economic parity… One view is that Chinese power will fall relative to that of its rivals… The Peak China thesis rests on the… observation that certain tailwinds are turning to headwinds… All of this is dampening long-run forecasts of China’s economic potential. Twelve years ago Goldman Sachs thought China’s GDP would overtake America’s… and become over 50% larger by mid-century. Last year it revised that prediction, saying China would… peak at less than 15% bigger. Others are more gloomy. Capital Economics, a research firm, argues that the country’s economy will never become top dog, instead peaking at 90% of America’s size in 2035… the most plausible ones [of these projections] seem to agree that China and America will approach economic parity in the next decade or so—and remain locked in this position for decades to come.  The first reaction, was really to literally laugh at what, as will be seen, was the latest of decades long wildly inaccurate predictions by The Economist regarding China. Indeed, the record shows that probably a good working guide to what will happen in China is to take what The Economist says and assume that the opposite will occur! Second, to reflect on what are the deep reasons for such a combination of ignorance and arrogance that it leads to a refusal to make any balance sheet of entirely wrong analyses repeated for these decades but when it still claims to be taken seriously on an issue on which it has such a provenly lamentable record. As the latter applies not only to The Economist but to many other Western publications that make similar claims it will be returned to at the end of this article.  The Economist on China and the Asian Financial Crisis  First, however, in order to avoid any suggestion that we are misrepresenting The Economist, let us factually establish its prolonged inaccuracies on China. Similarly, to avoid any suggestion of seizing on incidental or secondary remarks, taken out of context, which do not represent the central views of the publication, only front pages, and special supplements, that is the journal’s most important publications, on China will be used.  A suitably distant starting point is to go back 25 years to The Economist’s analysis of China and the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98. The Economist’s front page on 24 October 1998, referring to this, was “Will China be next?” Inside it posed the question: “whether China’s growth is slowing or even grinding to a halt… yes”. It then posed the question:  whether the resulting unemployment will prompt political unrest, or a power struggle among the leadership… yes.  In fact, as is well known, China was fundamentally economically stable during the Asian financial crisis. There was no unemployment leading to political unrest, let alone a “power struggle”. In short, The Economist was completely inaccurate.  The Economist “out of puff”  Moving ahead four years, on 15 June 2002 The Economist published a special supplement on China. This had the title “A Dragon Out of Puff”—a self-explanatory analysis. Its conclusion on China was the following:  the economy still relies primarily on domestic engines of growth, which are sputtering. Growth over the last five years has relied heavily on massive government spending. As a result, the government’s debt is rising fast. Coupled with the banks’ bad loans and the state’s huge pension liabilities, this is a financial crisis in the making… In the coming decade, therefore, China seems set to become more unstable. It will face growing unrest as unemployment mounts. And if growth were to slow significantly, public confidence could collapse, triggering a run on banks.  Turning from The Economist’s analysis to reality, what actually happened in the decade that followed was simple. China’s economy from 2002-2012 expanded by a total of 173% or an annual average of 10.5%. For comparison, in the same decade world GDP grew by a total 37%, or an annual average 3.2%. The U.S. grew by 21% or an annual average of 1.9%. In summary, China’s GDP grew 4.7 time as much as the world average and 8.4 times as time as much as the U.S.  And this is supposed to be China “out of puff”? It is just known as The Economist being hilariously wrong.  The Economist wrong on China and India  Let us now turn to another major sortie of The Economist into analysing China. Its front cover headline of 2 October 2010 was “How India’s Growth Will Outpace China’s”—also self-explanatory. The analysis this headline referred to stated: “Chetan Ahya and Tanvee Gupta of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, predict that India’s growth will start to outpace China’s within three to five years… For the next 20-25 years, India will grow faster than any other large country, they expect. Other long-range forecasters paint a similar picture.” The Economist approvingly quoted that India would “outpace” China because socialist “China’s growth has been largely state-directed. India’s, by contrast, is driven by 45m entrepreneurs.”  Once more, turning from a comparison of what The Economist predicted to what happened, the reality was clear and is shown in Figure 1. Taking the data from the Economist’s prediction in 2010 up to the present, that is to the end of 2022, China’s economy grew by 116.0% and India’s by 94.6%. Far from India “outpacing” China, China’s total economic growth in this period was 23% greater than India’s. China’s annual average GDP growth was 6.6% compared to India’s 5.7%.  Regarding the supposedly negative features of China’s socialist “largely state-directed” economy even more striking, because it is an index of overall economic efficiency, was the result in terms of per capita GDP growth. From 2010-2022 China experienced an average annual population increase of 0.4% and India of 1.2%. So, China’s more rapid growth of total GDP than India was despite the fact that India had significantly more rapid population increase.  In terms of per capita GDP, as Figure 2 shows, China’s total growth from 2010 to 2022 was 105% and India’s 69.6%. That is, China’s per capita GDP growth was 51% higher than India. China’s annual average per capita GDP growth was 6.2% compared to India’s 4.5%. It turns out that China’s socialist “state directed growth” was far more effective at producing per capita GDP growth than India’s “45 million entrepreneurs”. Once more The Economist was not wrong on details but got the entire course of events wrong.  The significance of population trends in China’s economic growth will be considered in more detail below.  The current claims by The Economist  Having established the successive previous errors of The Economist on China let us now turn to its claims in its most recent issue. This, as already noted, is summarised in the front cover issue with the headline “Peak China?”—that is the claim that China’s rise has stopped. Regarding the details of this inside we read supposedly regarding the “certain tailwinds are turning to headwinds” that:  The first big gust comes from demography. China’s working-age population has been declining for about a decade. Last year its population as a whole peaked… Wave goodbye to the masses of young workers who once filled ‘the world’s factory’.  The Economist then goes on to claim: “China has this year liberated its economy from the lockdowns, quarantines and other strictures of its ‘zero-covid’ regime. But it has not freed itself from longer-term worries about its growth prospects. Its population is shrinking. Its epic housing boom is over.” Supposedly China has problems from “a regulatory crackdown on e-commerce firms.” Regarding comparison with the U.S.: “Some ask how much longer China’s economy can grow faster than America’s.” Quoting works which it considers notable, and which coined the “peak” claim:  Hal Brands and Michael Beckley, two American political scientists, argue that China’s rise is already coming to a halt. The age of ‘peak China’, as they call it, is upon us.  As already noted, The Economist justifies these claims in particular with reference to population trends—the bogus claim, promoted for several years, that “China will grow old before it grows rich.” More precisely: “What accounts for the lower expectations for China’s economy?… Start with population. China’s workforce has already peaked, according to official statistics. It has 4.5 times as many 15- to 64-year-olds as America. By mid-century it will have only 3.4 times as many, according to the UN’s ‘median’ forecast.” It then goes on to discuss issues such as productivity—which are analysed below.  The Economist then goes on to conclude:  It also seems safe to say that China and America will remain in a position of near-parity for decades. In Goldman Sachs’s scenario, China maintains a small but persistent lead over America for more than 40 years… in Capital Economics’s projection, China’s GDP will… be over 80% of America’s as late as 2050…. if China’s peak is more Table Mountain [a flat-topped mountain in South Africa only slightly over 1,000 metres high] than K2 [Qogir Feng, the world’s second highest mountain at 8,611 metres] its leaders will have little incentive to rush to confrontation before decline sets in.  Leaving aside that China’s leaders have not shown any desire whatever to “rush to confrontation” let us dissect this evaluation of The Economist.  Elementary reality checks  Because no angle should be ignored in dealing with this analysis by The Economist, we will discuss below its assertions using technical methods of economic “growth accounting”. But actually, elementary reality checks and calculations, which can be understood by almost anyone (apparently apart from The Economist’s writers), shows their falsity.  Start with the question of population, on which The Economist lays such emphasis. China’s average annual population growth from 1978-2022, that is since the start of “Reform and Opening Up” is 0.9%. China’s annual average GDP growth in the same period is 9.0%. So, 8.1% a year GDP increase, that is 90% of the growth, could not possibly be accounted for by population changes. In summary, even before doing detailed growth accounting, it is clear that population growth could have played only a very small role in China’s economic development. This will be fully confirmed by the growth accounting data.  Turn to the second feature. According to The Economist we ae entering “the coming age of superpower parity”. What this means in GDP terms is that China and the U.S.’s economies will be roughly the same size—one possible a little bit bigger than the other. Let us analyse the implications of this claim.  Of course, no one doubts that after the “century of humiliation” China’s economic starting point was far behind the U.S. In 1950, in purchasing power parities (PPPs), on the calculations of Angus Maddison, who was the world’s leading expert on long term economic growth, China’s per capita GDP was slightly under 5% of the U.S.. By 2022, measured in PPPs by the IMF, China’s per capita GDP was 28% of the U.S.. That is, since the creation of the People’s Republic in 1949, China has improved its per capita GDP position relative to the U.S. by more than five times.  What is the overall implication of this? In 2022 Mainland China’s population was 4.24 times that of the U.S.—put in other terms, the U.S. population was less than 24%, approximately a quarter, that of China. That means, in turn, that for China to remain having the same, or a smaller, GDP than the U.S. its per capita GDP would have to remain less than one quarter of the U.S..  Why should China be incapable of reaching anything more than one quarter the per capita GDP, with therefore roughly one quarter the living standards, of the U.S.? Is it some xenophobic illusion that the average Chinese person is only one quarter as smart, or only works one quarter as hard, or cannot work out a way to achieve more than a quarter of the living standard of an average American? Or to put it the other way round, that the average American works more than four times as hard, or is four time as smart, or can work out a way to remain living more than four times as well as the average Chinese person?  That type of thinking is delusional and is also leaving the U.S. open to a terrible shock not only in regard to China but a second one later in this century when it finds out that the average member of the more than 1.4 billion Indian people is just as smart, just as hard working and just as capable of working out how their country can develop as the average American.  In fact, China’s development has come from successful policies by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and work by the Chinese people—not from economic “miracles”. China is perfectly aware that, given its extremely low economic starting point after a century of foreign intervention in 1949, it has set its goal of becoming a “strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and modern socialist country” to be achieved only by 2049. In the more immediate term, at the 20th Party Congress, its goal was stated as reaching the level of a “medium-developed country by 2035”. Slightly earlier, in 2020’s discussion around the 14th Five Year plan, it was concluded that by 2035 for China: “It is entirely possible to double the total or per capita income”. These two goals are essentially the same. This target requires an average annual growth of GDP of at least 4.6% a year by 2035. That this target can be achieved will be shown in detail below.  But the size of China’s population, and the speed of its economic development, does have an inevitable consequence. Those who believe that China will never significantly exceed one quarter of the per capita GDP of the U.S. and therefore that China’s GDP will never become significantly greater than the U.S., are deluding themselves. It is only necessary to be able to multiply by four to know what will be the final result.  Growth accounting  So far only issues that can be understood by anyone, whether or not they are an economist, regarding the elementary errors of the thesis of “peak China” have been dealt with—that is, the facts that the very slow growth of China’s population compared to its GDP growth shows that increase in labour supply plays only a very small role in its economic growth, and the consequences of the fact that China has over four times the population of the U.S. Actually, these are quite sufficient to understand why the theory of “peak China” is false. The fact that these false arguments can ignore such elementary realities shows how blinded people can be by their own propaganda. But nevertheless, it is also useful to analyse more detailed issues of economics—it should not be thought that any questions are being avoided. Therefore, more detailed issues of economic growth will now be examined. Analysing these, furthermore, does cast a light on important questions and further clarifies the fundamental errors of the theory of “peak China”—and what lies behind it.  Turning from the most fundamental trends to detailed growth accounting the most recent data will be examined in order to avoid any accusations that what is really being analysed is the effects of the period immediately after 1978—which almost no one would dispute brought gains but which some claim have now disappeared. Figure 3 therefore shows the latest 10 years, 2011-2021, for which detailed growth accounting data exists—it is not yet available for 2022.  Changes in labour inputs in China  As labour is the aspect most concentrated on in the theory of “peak China” it will be dealt with first. Initially, to get these out of the way, some elementary conceptual mistakes of the “peak China” brigade will be dealt with and then their most fundamental fallacy will be shown.  The detailed data on labour inputs in Figure 3 immediately shows one of the first elementary arithmetical fallacies of the old “China will get old before it gets rich” argument—which is essentially the same as that of “peak China”. This is that this fails to distinguish between the “quality” of labour inputs (that this their level of education, training etc) and the “quantity” of labour inputs—that is simply the number of hours worked.  This fallacy can be easily illustrated for non-specialists in economics. Take an hour of labour in South Korea—this country is chosen because today it has one of the highest levels of higher education in the world. In 1945 85% of South Korea’s population lived in rural areas and Illiteracy was 88%. Today 85% of South Korea’s population lives in urban areas and enrolment in tertiary education is equivalent to the entire population of the relevant age groups. China’s is passing through the same historical process from its own extremely rural past—with urbanisation reaching 65% by 2021, and enrolment in higher education reaching 60% by 2022.  The value produced by an hour’s labour by someone with a university degree in Korea, very possibly a PhD in engineering or computing, in 2022 is obviously far higher than that of a peasant who was illiterate in 1945. Similarly, as China’s population becomes more and more highly educated and trained the inputs of “labour quality” (to use the technical economic term) will rise even if “labour quantity” (the total number of workers and therefore the number of hours worked) goes down.  This is precisely what occurred in China from 2011-2021. As Figure 3 shows, the total number of hours worked (labour quantity) fell, reducing GDP growth by 0.4%. But the contribution of labour quality, that is better training and education, increased GDP growth by 0.4%. Therefore, the actual change in total labour inputs was zero. (As a side note for technical economists, calculating labour inputs simply by hours worked, without taking into account labour quality, was an error in Solow’s original formulation of growth accounting which has been replaced in modern growth accounting. For non-technical economists the difference between the value created by an hour of labour by someone who is illiterate with someone who has an engineering PhD makes the point clear).  But even leaving aside this basic distinction, actually regarding labour quantity itself China’s position is not remotely as bad as claimed by “peak China”. For example, approximately a quarter of China’s working population is still in the countryside—the passing of a substantial part of this into urban areas, as will occur over the coming decades, will increase productivity, China’s current retirement age, of 60 for men and 50-55 for women, is extremely low by international standards and is bound to gradually increase given China’s great increase in life expectancy—which will produce an increase in available labour quantity compared to if the retirement age had not been raised .  In short, because they make the elementary mistake of failing to distinguish between labour quantity and labour quality, because they do not take into account the consequences of shift of labour from the countryside to urban areas, and because they do not note that China’s very low retirement age is bound to gradually increase with growing life expectancy, claims about the reduction of labour inputs in the theory of “peak China” are greatly exaggerated even in their own terms.  The small role of increases in labour inputs in China  But actually, even all the above issues are secondary to the main one which was already analysed in fundamental terms above—the point that China’s average annual population growth from 1978-2022 is 0.9% and China’s annual average GDP growth in the same period is 9.0%. Therefore, 8.1% a year GDP increase, that is 90% of the growth, could not possibly be accounted for by population changes. What this shows is that the increase in labour inputs has played a very small role in China’s economic growth.  Turning to analyse this in detail, it was already noted that in 2011-2021 the contribution of labour inputs to GDP growth was zero—a 0.4% annual increase in GDP due to improvements in labour quality, offset by a 0.4% of GDP fall caused by a reduction in labour quantity (hours worked). Even if the longer period from 1990-2021 is taken, the contribution of labour inputs to GDP growth was only 0.7% a year out of an average of 8.7% annual GDP growth—that is 92% of GDP growth was due to factors other than increase in labour inputs.  The reason that a slowdown in labour inputs will not produce a very sharp fall in China’s economic growth is therefore very simple. Because the detailed growth accounting data naturally confirms what was already obvious from the most fundamental facts on China’ population and GDP changes since 1978. That population and labour input changes have only played a very small role in China’s economic growth!  The fundamental factors which really do affect China’s economic growth, and their consequences, will be analysed below.  The reasons for China’s rapid economic growth  Turning from what has not made a large contribution to China’s economic growth, labour inputs, to those which have made a big difference, again the latest period 2011-2021 will be taken. China’s annual average GDP growth in that period was 6.7%. The detailed contributions to growth of the different inputs are shown in Figure 4. This chart is simply a different way of presenting the facts given in Figure 3—which showed the relative weight of different inputs into China’s economy. Figure 4 is merely more convenient for present purposes because by showing how much of China’s GDP growth is due to different inputs it makes it easy to see which changes would, and which changes would not, seriously affect China’s economic growth. That is, what would, and what would not, create a real situation of “peak China”. It also allows an easy calculation of whether China can or cannot achieve the 4.6% annual average economic growth necessary to achieve its target of doubling per capita GDP by 2035.  The role of labour inputs  The first reality from these facts which is obvious, as already noted, is the relatively small effect that changes in labour supply will make. Assume that no changes are made to offset the decline in labour quantity, for example there is no increase in the retirement age, and this continues to deduct 0.4% a year from GDP growth. Assume also that the increase in the beneficial effect of increases in labour quality is eliminated and therefore this deducts the 0.4% a year from GDP growth due to this factor—there is no justification for making such an assumption as China’s education and training growth will continue, but it is hypothetically assumed here just to analyse a “worst case” scenario. What then happens? It means that China’s GDP growth would fall from 6.7% a year to 6.3%—easily enough to surpass the 4.6% a year growth required to achieve the doubling of per capita GDP by 2035.  The role of Total Factor Productivity  Now consider productivity, more precisely Total Factor Productivity (TFP)—for non-economists, TFP measures all processes raising the output of the economy which are not due to increases in capital or labour (for example, improvements in technology, the benefits of larger scale of production, improvements in management techniques, scientific discoveries, benefits of increased specialisation in production etc). Assume a catastrophic case that China’s rate of TFP increase fell to zero—once again there is no justification for such an assumption and China’s rate of TFP growth is one of the fastest in the world, but it is analysed here just to demonstrate the effects of the most extreme negative assumptions. What then happens is that China’s GDP growth would fall by 1.5% a year—from 6.7% to 5.2% a year. China would then still achieve the 4.6% a year target to double per capita GDP by 2035.  Even if the ludicrous assumption is made both that China achieved no increase in labour quality, deducting 0.4% of GDP growth a year, and that its rate of TFP growth collapsed to zero, deducting 1.5% a year from GDP growth, then the combined slowdown of 1.9% a year would still leave China growing at 4.8% a year—enough to achieve its 2035 target.  These negative assumptions are of course themselves ridiculous—there is no reason China’s improvement in labour quality will fall to zero, on the contrary it is pouring resources into education and training, and there is equally no reason why its TFP growth will fall to zero. But these extremely unrealistic assumptions have the benefit that even with them the thesis of “peak China” will not work.  Cutting China’s investment  It is factually clear that only one assumption would justify the argument of “peak China”—i.e. that a drastic slowdown in China’s economy will occur. This is that there is a huge fall in China’s level of investment in GDP—that is, in technical terms, in capital inputs into the economy (it should be understood that by “capital” in this sense is simply meant fixed investment—it is irrelevant whether this investment is carried out by the state, private capitalists, or any other form of ownership). This is, indeed, an inevitable result of the fact that 78% of China’s economic growth is due to capital/investment inputs—or in other terms that these account for 5.2% annual GDP growth out of a total of 6.7% growth. China’s dependence on capital inputs for economic growth is furthermore fairly standard, the average percentage contribution of capital inputs to economic growth of the world’s 20 largest economies in 2011-2021 being 81%. This is indeed why reductions in the level of investment in GDP do produce very large slowdowns in economic growth. This was analysed in the earlier article 它曾成功“谋杀”了德国、日本、四小龙，现在想要劝中国“经济自杀” and is dealt with in detail below.  In reality, although they spend large amounts of space discussing other issues which would have no great effect even if true, the statistics of those arguing for the theory of “peak China” show that they arrive at their claims because they assume that China will drastically cut the percentage of its economy devoted to investment. The reasons this claim is made will be analysed below, but first, to clarify the issue, the arithmetic of those who present serious quantified justifications for the “peak China” arguments will be examined—although, it is striking, that some who makes such claims don’t even bother to attempt to quantify them.  Taking first, among those studied by The Economist, an analysis by Roland Rajah and Alyssa Leng for the Lowy Institute with the self-explanatory title “Revising down the rise of China”. This concludes regarding China that: “our projections suggest growth will slow sharply to roughly 3% a year by 2030”. This analysis precisely assumes a huge fall in the percentage of China’s economy devoted to fixed investment/capital inputs:  total investment falls from the current 43% of GDP to 33% of GDP on average over the coming decades.  The same assumption is made by Goldman Sachs, which projects that China’s GDP growth will fall from an annual average 6.0% in 2013-2022 to 3.4% in 2023-2032—that is a decline of 2.6%. The reason for this alleged slowdown is because of the overwhelming effect of a single fact that the annual increase in GDP growth created by capital investment is projected to fall by 2.4%—from 4.8% to 2.4%. As this fall in capital investment accounts for 92% of the decline in the GDP growth rate, only 8% of the decline the Goldman Sachs report projects, or 0.2% GDP growth a year, is attributable to factors other than the decline in investment. Without the investment decline, the Goldman Sachs report’s data shows that China’s annual GDP growth would only fall from 6.0% to 5.8%—a level which would easily allow China to exceed its own targets for 2035. In short, Goldman Sachs shows that only the decline in investment makes a decisive difference to China’s growth rate, and therefore, to use The Economist’s terms, accounts for “peak China”.  Of course, these calls for, or predictions that, China will cut the level of investment in its economy are put forward in a concealed way. They are presented as calls for China to increase the percentage of consumption in its economy. But as consumption and capital creation/investment combined necessarily add up to 100% of China’s economy the call for China to increase the percentage of consumption in its economy is necessarily to call for it to reduce its level of investment. This would indeed, of course, for the reasons already given, lead to a drastic slowdown in China’s economy—to “peak China”. But it would simply be a case of China deciding to commit economic suicide.  While the studies published by the Lowy Institute and Goldman Sachs at least have the virtue of being clear, others don’t—so these will be examined below.  A leader is certainly different  There is no doubt that from the facts already given that if China drastically cuts its level of investment its rate of economic growth would indeed substantially fall—as capital inputs account for 78% of China’s economic growth that is inevitable. But why should China make such a drastic cut in its level of investment in GDP?  The alleged reason for this is because China is different from other “Western” economies. For example Capital Economics, which unlike the Lowy Institute or Goldman Sachs studies, does not even properly quantify its findings, but is nevertheless cited by The Economist as a source, argues: “we expect China’s trend rate of economic growth to fall to around 2% by 2030.” It notes:  China… has an unusually large capital stock…. If China’s capital stock to GDP ratio were to continue to rise at the rapid pace of the past decade, it would soon be much higher than in other major economies.  Similarly, Goldman Sachs argues that China’s level of investment in its economy will fall sharply: “Investment as a share of GDP is forecast to decline from 42% in 2022 to 35% by 2032.” The reason that this will happen is apparently because China is at present an upper middle-income economy, although approaching the level of a high-income economy by World Bank standards, and:  Investment as a share of GDP in upper-middle-income countries is 34%.  Well certainly China is different from other economies. Why? For the simple reason that its economy is growing much more rapidly than they are! Therefore, it is producing a more rapid increase in average living standards than they are, it has produced a more rapid reduction in poverty than they have etc. Naturally the leader is different to those who are further behind£ The economy with the most rapid economic development is different to the countries with slower economic development.  Why should the more rapidly developing copy the less rapidly developing  But then it is a completely bizarre logic that says that the economy which is most rapidly developing should change to become like the less successful ones! What would a client of Goldman Sachs, or any other bank or consultancy, say if it argued “We notice that you are developing more rapidly than your competitors—so you need to stop that and reduce yourself to their level.” Or if they said to a company: “We notice that in this field one company is developing much more rapidly than the others. Therefore, you should ignore that company and copy the less successful ones. Incidentally we are advising this most successful company to abandon its advantages and instead accept the approach of its less successful competitors.” Anyone who made such a proposal would be laughed at—in the few seconds before the contract with them was immediately terminated.  But that is exactly what those who are arguing the case for “peak China! are doing. They are saying: “We note that China’s economy is developing more rapidly than others. Therefore, it should abandon the reasons for this success and adopt the methods of the less rapidly developing.” Instead, of course, what any sensible person would argue is: “China is different because it is the most rapidly developing. Therefore, other countries should learn from the reasons for China’s success (which is not, of course, to pursue the impossible course of mechanically copying it).” This entirely logical argument is, of course, what other countries are doing. It explains the increasing international interest in China’s socialist development strategy.  Instead, what those arguing the case for “peak China” propose is that China should voluntarily commit economic suicide. That it should abandon the methods that have made it the most rapidly developing economy in the world and adopt the methods of the less successful. If China decides to commit economic “suicide” then that certainly would produce “peak China”—if someone decides to commit suicide they will undoubtedly be dead. But it would be very bizarre for China and the CPC to adopt such a logic! Why, having brought China from almost the poorest country in the world in 1949, after a century of foreign intervention, to achieve the most sustained rapid economic growth of any major country in world history should the CPC decide to adopt a less successful approach? Gorbachev may have decided that the USSR should commit suicide, bringing ruin to his country, by adopting Western approaches, but the CPC has shown no similar inclination.  The reasons for blind arrogance  Turning from these specific economic points to more general considerations, these factual issues are so obvious to anyone who thinks about them seriously, that it takes us back to a point made before the discussion of detailed analysis of growth accounting. That is, what is the explanation of the blindness to reality, to facts, that is created by unconscious arrogance?  The Economist, Goldman Sachs etc note that China’s economy differs from their capitalist ones. But instead of drawing from the more rapid development of China’s economy than theirs the conclusion that China’s system shows its superiority, they conclude that necessarily China must be wrong—and that they are right! The reason is because to accept the facts would be to overturn their, conscious or unconscious, arrogant way of looking at the world. It is worth looking at just a few of these implications to understand the reasons for the blindness.  The first is the role of CPC. It is the CPC, no other political force, which created the socialist market economy, an economic system which had never before existed in history, which has created the most rapid economic growth of any major country in human history, which has produced the most rapid increase in living standards or any country, which has produced the greatest reduction in poverty in any country in human history, and which overall has produced the most rapid sustained improvement in the living standards of any country in human history. The idea that such gigantic achievements could occur by “accident”, that is without thought or theory leading it, is laughable. What it means is that the CPC not only produced better practical results for its people than any other political force but that the CPC out thought every other political force.  Second, it means that China has achieved what every country that was once dominated by imperialism dreams of—that China, and China alone, will decide its destiny. This is indeed the greatest of all the CPC’s national achievements. That after a “century of humiliation”, in which China was simply trampled on by other states, only China will now decide its own fate. If China takes wise decisions it will prosper. If China takes foolish decisions it will suffer. But no one else will decide the outcome. In a fundamental sense that is precisely the basis of the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”..  Third, China’s success, brought by the CPC, brings to an end an entire centuries long epoch in human history—perhaps this is particularly to be commented on by someone from Europe? During approximately the last 500 years, “white” European countries, and their offshoots, became the most powerful in the world. That 500 years is certainly a short period in the approximately 5,000-year history of human civilization. For most of that time it was Asia’s people—China, India, West Asia/parts of North Africa (falsely labelled the “Middle East” in Eurocentric worldviews) who were the most advanced. But, of course, 500 years is far longer than the life of anyone alive today. And during that 500 years these “white” countries built into the foundations of their capitalist system the vile dregs of racism—this is a point particularly emphasised in recent material produced by the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research which should be regarded as of fundamental importance. Slavery, the treatment of non-“white” people as not equal in order to justify colonialism, were built into the foundations of that European originated capitalist system.  China’s rise, that of almost one fifth of humanity, which it should be remembered is more than the population of all “advanced” economies in the world put together today, not only creates a socialist society but completely destroys the entire cultural basis and assumptions of that 500-year-old epoch in human history. A long time Afro-Caribbean friend of mine, knowing I followed China as closely as I could, once said to me “but what does China’s rise mean for the rest of us?” I said: “Well among other things it destroys the myth of the ‘superiority’ of the white race”. To which their reply was “well that’s a victory for everyone.”  Indeed, in terms of the entire moral dignity of humanity, China’s success is playing an indispensable role in putting an end to the shameful traits of an entire period of human history. It is in large part because of that entire 500 year history that those proclaiming “peak China” can continue to write views that are so completely out of touch with the facts and with reality and why they refuse to draw any lessons even when they are repeatedly shown to be wrong—as was shown with the test case of The Economist at the beginning of this article (and many more examples could be taken). The stubborn blindness of the refusal of Western reporters and analysts to face the fact they have repeatedly been proven entirely wrong reflects not only bad journalism or a love of capitalism. It reflects the blindness to reality produced by 500 years of an unconscious cultural arrogance produced by a system which is fortunately now progressively disintegrating.  Xi Jinping noted carefully at his first press conference after becoming General Secretary of the CPC that China directly sees its own national rejuvenation as a part of the overall progress of humanity:  Throughout 5,000 years of development, the Chinese nation has made significant contributions to the progress of human civilization… Our responsibility is… to pursue the goal of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, so that China can stand firmer and stronger among the world’s nations, and make new and greater contributions to mankind.  This is not simply a goal for the future. This is a process that is underway today. It is a part of China’s great achievement, brought about by the extraordinary struggle of its people for national rejuvenation, that the rest of humanity benefits from it. That certainly involves economics. But it goes far beyond it.

The director general (prisons) said that a judicial probe has been initiated into the case. (File)  The man, identified by security officials as Jawed, was produced before the court on Monday and later he was found hanging in a jail bathroom.  Sanjay Baniwal, the director general (prisons), said, “As per the security officials, Jawed hanged himself from a tap in the bathroom with the help of a cloth at 5pm at the common toilet area of the enclosure for mulahiza inmates.” He further said that the staff later took him to the jail hospital where the doctors declared him ‘brought dead’.

Later in the evening, he went to the bathroom, where he hanged himself with a very thick cord, made by twisting together several thinner clothes.

One Corpus Christi Police Officer is now working to make sure more lives aren't lost near the bridge.  According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a person dies by suicide about every two hours in the State of Texas.  Ashley Ramirez's son Adrian Lee Guerrero died by suicide on March 9.  ""The day of, he was not himself. He didn't sleep all night, so he had been up for 24 hours,"" Ramirez said.  It's a day she said she will never forget.  ""I did have to hold my son until paramedics arrived and my son did pass away in my arms,"" she said.  ""I just remember cutting through the whole crowd and asking, 'Where is my son?' and the doctor told me that there was nothing more than they could do. That he was pronounced deceased at 6:30 p.m.”  It's been two months since Adrian’s death and Ramirez continues to grieve her son while trying to move forward.  “And the hurt that is left behind is unbearable, especially to a parent,” she said.  Senior officer Shawn Barnes with the Corpus Christi Police Department has taken it upon himself to remind people there is help.  Barnes worked with the Texas Department of Transportation to install signs at the entrances of the Harbor Bridge.  They read ""We can help you cross this bridge,"" and offer phone numbers for the national suicide and crisis prevention lifeline.  ""Even me myself, my mother killed herself and so these are kind of real for a lot of people. So being able to have an additional message, right there readily on display 24/7, 365 to get people connected with the appropriate support,” Barnes said.  Ramirez said the signs are a good idea and hopes that it would deter more people from committing suicide.  “But all these signs that are going up now and bringing awareness to this, will help the youth and adults because, (there's) just too many young adults going,” Ramirez said.  Ramirez hopes those struggling with suicidal thoughts would think of loved ones they are leaving behind.  ""Baby, don't do it. Don't do it. There are so many people out there that love you and that care for you,"" she said.

"suicide","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T06:47:16","Unite says that the HSE should be given the power to investigate all suicides where work is a factor in someone taking their own life.  Unite’s call comes in the wake of the suicide in March of Ruth Perry, a Berkshire headteacher evidently anguished by an Ofsted inspection.  An article in the British Medical Journal has called for all suicides of teachers to be investigated by the HSE. But Unite says it is not just teachers who feel under pressure at work.  Unite argues that extending the powers of the HSE to be able to investigate all work-related suicides could help tackle the excessive deaths occurring in industries such as construction. Latest figures reveal that 507 construction workers committed suicide in 2001. Suicide rates in construction are at 33.82 per 100,000, which is the highest death rate of any sector.  Unite believes that there is a correlation between this statistic and the working conditions seen in the construction industry – precarious employment, short term assignments, a long hours culture and high numbers working away from home.  Coping mechanisms used by the overwhelmingly male workforce tend to include drinking, gambling and substance misuse, all of which can exacerbate mental health problems.  Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The failure to fully investigate the reasons why workers in all sectors are taking their own lives is a scandal. Until all aspects of why workers commit suicide are investigated, the necessary reforms needed to save lives cannot be implemented.”  Unite national officer for construction Jason Poulter said: “Construction suicide rates are increasing dramatically and the critical issues that are causing workers to commit suicide are not being addressed.  “The vast majority of construction employers do not take the mental wellbeing of their workforce seriously and until the HSE is given the powers and the resources to investigate these tragedies properly that will continue to be the case.”  Got a story?

The city of about 110,000 on the edge of Reno said in a statement Monday it hopes the agreement helps bring ""closure"" to all parties.  Miciah Lee, 18, Sparks, had no criminal history and was not wanted for any crime when a white officer shot him five times while he was sitting in his car with a handgun between his legs and his hands in plain sight on Jan. 5, 2020, his family's lawyer, Terri Keyser-Cooper, said.  MOTHER WHO LOST SON TO SUICIDE BELIEVES MARIJUANA USE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS MENTAL BREAKDOWN  But she said Lee did have a long history of mental illness and drug abuse, and that the officers' rush to violence defied any limited training they had received to diffuse such confrontations.  Lee's mother, Susan Clopp, called 911 shortly before the shooting and told the dispatcher three times her son was ""mentally unstable,"" had a gun and intended to ""die by cop or die by himself.""  One of the officers who responded to the scene after Lee fled an initial attempt to confront him and crashed in a suburban neighborhood said in an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court last year before the settlement talks that they ""did everything they were trained not to do with mentally ill persons.""  A federal judge ordered mediation and the parties said last month they had reached a settlement. The city's insurance company completed the final installment of the $2 million in payments on May 18, lawyer Keyser-Cooper said.  ""The size of this settlement speaks volumes,"" said Keyser-Cooper, who alleged Lee would still be alive if he was white.  ""I am greatly encouraged that Sparks has promised to provide to its officers more training, with oversight to ensure officers act pursuant to their training, and a tragedy like this will not occur again,"" she said in a statement late Friday.  As part of the settlement, Keyser-Cooper said Sparks agreed that all officers will receive 40 hours of Crisis Intervention Training and that each year all Sparks police officers will receive refresher training.  In addition, each officer will receive annual training on some additional new policies which include: Use of Force, Suicidal Subject Response, and Interacting With Persons Suffering From Behavioral Health Issues, she said.  FISHING IS THE FIX FOR A MAN WITH PTSD WHO WAS NEARLY STABBED TO DEATH: 'SAVED MY LIFE'  The city of Sparks confirmed in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Monday that the city's insurance carrier hired outside counsel to handle the case and that the parties agreed to settle it for $2 million during a settlement conference in Las Vegas.  ""The City of Sparks is hopeful that all parties involved will get closure after this settlement,"" the statement said.  About six months after the shooting, Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks cleared Sparks police of any wrongdoing. His office was not part of the civil case and declined comment on the settlement on Monday.  The lawsuit filed in 2022 said Lee's death was an unjustifiable homicide that resulted from a ""police culture in Sparks"" — a ""police department so poorly trained that it had a history of failing to investigate, analyze, or even talk to any officers involved in any police shootings for the past 15 years.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The lawsuit also alleged the Sparks Police Department failed to sufficiently train officers on how to interact with the mentally ill and systematically, failed to de-escalate as required when interacting with the mentally ill.  Former Sparks Police Chief Peter Krall testified that responding officers knew what they were required to do and their conduct in failing to utilize their training was an ""aberration.""  ""However, it was anything but an aberration: It was a highly predictable consequence of system-wide failures,"" Keyser-Cooper wrote in the original lawsuit.  ""It is consistent with a pattern endemic in SPD — but also throughout the country—that, when encountering mentally ill persons, officers all too frequently choose violence as their first resort,"" she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3BhcmVudHMtYWdyZWUtbmV2YWRhLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtMi1taWxsaW9uLXN1aWNpZGFsLWJsYWNrLXRlZW4ta2lsbGVkLXdoaXRlLW9mZmljZXLSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS91cy9wYXJlbnRzLWFncmVlLW5ldmFkYS1zZXR0bGVtZW50LTItbWlsbGlvbi1zdWljaWRhbC1ibGFjay10ZWVuLWtpbGxlZC13aGl0ZS1vZmZpY2VyLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Shakespeare used it: think of the doomed lovers in Romeo and Juliet who would rather die than live in a world where they couldn’t be together. It wasn’t even new in the Bard’s day: suicide as a subject for storytelling goes back to ancient times. More recently, suicide has featured in films as diverse as It’s a Wonderful Life and Full Metal Jacket, and TV shows from Mad Men to Seinfeld.  There is nothing surprising about this. Writers and artists are drawn to depicting suicide for obvious reasons: it is a means both of making clear the seriousness of proceedings and of igniting a drama by introducing a devastating event into the lives of those left behind.  Vivian (Thomasin McKenzie) is a “guardian” who looks after people contemplating suicide in Totally Completely Fine. Credit: Stan  At this stage, however, some creators are seeking to explore suicide in a more in-depth and realistic way. Two new Australian comedy-dramas are tackling the subject in an attempt to bring truth and sophistication to the issue. In the ABC’s In Limbo, a man is haunted by the ghost of his best friend, who has died unexpectedly. In Totally Completely Fine, a young woman moves into a house next to a notorious suicide spot and assumes the responsibility of saving those who come to end it all.  For Gretel Vella, creator of Totally Completely Fine, the idea came from personal experience during lockdown. “Within the space of five days I was witness, from a distance, to two different suicide attempts. During the second one, my Uber driver turned around and said to me, ‘Every day I take the same route and every day this is happening’.” This sparked her to research “guardians” – people who take it upon themselves to go to places where people attempt suicide and try to help them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2N1bHR1cmUvdHYtYW5kLXJhZGlvL2lzLWNvbWVkeS1hLXdheS1vZi1zaGVkZGluZy1saWdodC1vbi10aGUtbW9zdC1kaWZmaWN1bHQtb2Ytc3ViamVjdHMtMjAyMzA1MTktcDVkOXIyLmh0bWzSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS9jdWx0dXJlL3R2LWFuZC1yYWRpby9pcy1jb21lZHktYS13YXktb2Ytc2hlZGRpbmctbGlnaHQtb24tdGhlLW1vc3QtZGlmZmljdWx0LW9mLXN1YmplY3RzLTIwMjMwNTE5LXA1ZDlyMi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter  A former Paisley schoolboy yesterday told a jury how he has made multiple attempts to take his own life after claiming he was subjected to child sex abuse from his teacher.  The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence at Paisley Sheriff Court and said Kenneth Divers sexually abused him when he was aged between 12 and 14.  The now 66-year-old told how the abuse started when Divers took a group of boys from all-boys school, St Aelred’s Secondary in Gleniffer Road, on weekend trips to Sandbank Village in Dunoon, Argyll.  The man claims Divers promised the boys they would meet professional footballer Stewart Houston – who played for Manchester United and Chelsea – but they never did.  Giving evidence, he told jurors: “We went to Dunoon for fun. We went to play football. He told us we would meet Stewart Houston, he used to tell us that quite a lot.”  Fiscal depute Dana Barclay asked the man what the sleeping arrangements were in Dunoon and he answered: “There was a settee in the living room.  “On the first night I slept in the bed with Divers and the other two boys slept on that, then the next night it would change.”  It was claimed that, in 1969, Divers sexually abused the boy when he was aged 12. The witness stated: “He asked me if I had a girlfriend. He asked if I touched her and if she touched me. I said no.  “He started to talk about sex and if she got pregnant it would ruin her life, it would ruin my life and my parents would be disappointed but he said there was something you can do without getting pregnant.”  The man told the court that Divers touched him intimately and made him perform a sex act on him, adding: “He made me feel like this was for my benefit.  “I didn’t sleep much that night, I lay in bed not really knowing what had happened. He told me not to tell anyone.”  He also claimed Divers would take boys on football trips. Ms Barclay asked if he remembered attending any football games with Divers and replied: “The Scotland and England game at Hampden Park in 1969, it was very busy.  “There were no seats in those days, just standing. He was very close to me rubbing his erection against me.  “He had planned a trip to Spain for four of the boys and I was one of them and during that game, I had in my head [that] I didn’t want to go to Spain.  “As we left Hampden and were walking to the train station, a car came round the corner and I stepped out in front of it. I didn’t want to go to Spain. I wasn’t able to tell my parents I didn’t want to go.”  Ms Barclay asked if the man was injured during the incident and he told the jury how he suffered a broken femur, telling them: “I was in plaster for a year, crutches for a year-and-a-half and had a walking stick for six months.”  Ms Barclay asked: “How has all of this affected you?” Weeping in the witness stand, the man replied: “I’ve had two attempts at my life since walking in front of the car, I lost my family, my house, I got into debt because I couldn’t work, I suffered depression. It’s taken 50-odd years of my life. I never told anyone for 40 years.”  A second male also gave evidence during the trial yesterday in which he claimed he was also sexually abused by Divers at St Aelred’s school.  The 49-year-old man claimed Divers inappropriately touched him at the school when he was 12 years old.  The man, who we can’t name, claimed Divers taught the teen one-to-one football coaching in the gym hall and afterwards would “make him” take a shower where Divers would join him and touch him sexually.  Divers is accused of child sex abuse over a 24-year period. The 78-year-old was extradited from Vietnam to face the claims before being remanded at Paisley Sheriff Court in February last year.  Prosecutors claim Divers abused a number of boys from 1968 to 1993. Divers, described as a prisoner of Low Moss prison, East Dunbartonshire, denies all charges against him.

Pictures’ action adventure “THE SUICIDE SQUAD,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/™ & © DC Comics. © 2021 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is the acclaimed developer’s next game but it has an uphill battle to face once it releases.  Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has quite the uphill battle in front of it. Modern development for big budget releases can take anywhere from 3-5 years (or more) and it can make or break any studio.  In 2015 Arkham Knight released to record sales and critical acclaim and it would become the last big Rocksteady game for a long time.  After many delays Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will finally see the light of day in February 2024. It will have been 9 years since Arkham Knight. Development on this game will essentially outlast most of the DCEU’s existence.  Seeing Rocksteady spend almost a decade working on a multiplayer focused team loot shooter with microtransactions is quite baffling. Fans just witnessed the drastic fall of Marvel’s Avengers, which is essentially the same type of game Suicide Squad is going to be.  By the time this releases, Warner Bros and Rocksteady will have most likely spent over hundreds of millions of dollars developing and advertising this game.  Yes players will be initially interested in this game because it has DC characters. But to keep fans on board and to satisfy WB’s bottom line, the game essentially has to stand out and be good enough to take them away from the countless games out there.  With big online games like this, there’s likely going to be problems at launch. Rocksteady has to listen to fan feedback to fix issues and keep their base engaged. There has to be a future roadmap of content like new playable characters, cosmetics, quests, maps, that Rocksteady has to be transparent about.  In order for this game to be considered successful they would not only have to sell a lot of copies, but also have players invested into their microtransactions. Let’s not forget the servers they have to keep up as well.  Suicide Squad’s multiplayer elements will directly compete with heavyweights like Call Of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch, Apex Legends, Destiny and PUBG. The studios behind those games essentially spend most of their time and resources on them so they could become what they are today.  The reality is that a modern successful multiplayer game can make a lot more money for them than something single player due to the constant income from DLC and microtransactions.  Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will launch with a $70 price tag as well and its competitors like Fortnite, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Warzone are all free to play. So if Suicide Squad isn’t hitting on all cylinders in its launch, players will be quick to abandon it and its longevity could go the way of Avengers.  Hogwarts Legacy recently just launched to great acclaim and is a billion dollar earner. It’s an expansive single player RPG that pays loving homage to the Wizarding World. Imagine if Rocksteady did something like that for DC?  They’re already aren’t enough DC games and with the underwhelming performance of Gotham Knights, all eyes are on this game to succeed for fans.  The game could be a resounding success, but there are definitely obstacles ahead for WB and Rocksteady. If it succeeds, then Rocksteady definitely deserves their flowers, but it probably would’ve been less of headache for everyone had they just made another single player game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFtc21hY2twb3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvc3VpY2lkZS1zcXVhZC1raWxsLXRoZS1qdXN0aWNlLWxlYWd1ZXMtdXBoaWxsLWJhdHRsZS10by1zdWNjZXNzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vYmFtc21hY2twb3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvc3VpY2lkZS1zcXVhZC1raWxsLXRoZS1qdXN0aWNlLWxlYWd1ZXMtdXBoaWxsLWJhdHRsZS10by1zdWNjZXNzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)  Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes  SALT LAKE CITY — When military veteran Ross Smith was struggling with suicidal ideation, what kept him alive were the people in his community who reached out to check on him and help him get the professional treatment he needed.  ""I am grateful for my past and extremely grateful to be alive today,"" said Smith, who has survived two suicide attempts and now serves as a national commander for American Veterans (AMVETS). ""Honest and heartfelt questions can and will save lives.""  Smith and other leaders from veteran service organizations addressed the community at the Utah State Capitol on Tuesday as part of the group's suicide prevention tour across America.  We must never become complacent as we take care of those who stood guard for our freedoms that you and I enjoy every day. – Ross Smith, AMVETS National District VI commander  A group of seven AMVETS members and two bus drivers launched their tour with a presentation in Sacramento on Monday. They will make stops in Denver, Kansas City and Cleveland this week before ending Sunday at Rolling to Remember, a motorcycle rally raising awareness for U.S. prisoners of war, those missing in action and veteran suicides.  During their Utah presentation, speakers urged local veterans, and also their families and community members, to engage in helping America's veterans get access to treatment and other mental health resources.  Mental health and suicide are subjects that need to be confronted ""head-on,"" Smith said.  ""You and I have a great responsibility to the defenders of this nation, both past and present,"" Smith said. ""We must never become complacent as we take care of those who stood guard for our freedoms that you and I enjoy every day.""  Data from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs shows the suicide rate for veterans was 57.3% greater than for non-veterans in 2020. That same year, suicide was the 13th leading cause of death among veterans, and the second-highest cause of death for veterans under the age of 45.  ""Our veterans are killing themselves every day in isolation,"" said Lisa Roybal, chairwoman of the California AMVETS suicide awareness and prevention committee.

She shared the acronym SAVE, which she said can be used to help prevent suicide:  Signs of suicide like anxiety, hopelessness or abusing drugs or alcohol;  Ask if they are thinking about suicide;  Validate their experiences;  Encourage them to seek treatment.  ""Suicide can be prevented through meaningful connections, one person at a time,"" Roybal said. ""Well-coordinated responses are needed not just from our veteran communities, but from our civilian communities as well, because community is the first line of defense.""  She also encouraged veterans to call the national suicide hotline at 988, then press 1 for veterans.  Cory Pearson, director of veterans services at Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs, encouraged Utah veterans to take advantage of resources on the department's websites. Resources include mental health information, access to health care benefits and the Governor's Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans and their Families.

Eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and taking breaks when you need them are all essential for feeling your best. When you take care of yourself, you’re more likely to feel happy and healthy.  Be grateful  Tip: Start every morning acknowledging at least one thing your grateful for or would you rather write it in a gratitude journal  Being grateful for what you have is a great way to boost your mood and feel happier. When you take the time to appreciate the good in your life, you’re more likely to feel positive and hopeful. This is a great way to boost your mood and feel happiness.  Get physical  Tip: Don’t just sit, get your 30-minute fix  Any form of movement is good for your mental health. Activity and exercise has been shown to lower stress levels, improve mood, and boost self-esteem.  Live in the present moment  Tip: Try mindfulness meditation or prayer  Acknowledge and challenge negative thoughts. It’s easy to get caught up in the thoughts of what might happen or how things could have been, but this only keeps you from enjoying the here and now.  Instead, focus your attention on what’s going on around you right at this moment. Notice the colors, the sounds, the smells, and how your body feels. Appreciate the beauty of the world and savor every moment. The present is a gift, and you can make today great by living in it!  Perform a random act of kindness  Tip: Do something nice for someone  Kindness matters. Kindness makes a difference.

Doing something for others is a great way to show gratitude as well as to provide a boost of positive energy. When you help others, you not only make them feel good, but you also make yourself feel good. Whenever you’re feeling sad, lonely, or emotional, try practicing kindness.  Get enough sleep  Tip: Start a sleep journal to track what works and what doesn’t  Everyone has different definitions of what is enough sleep. Only you know your body and how many hours of sleep are needed for your physical and mental health. Numerous research studies have proven that a well-rested person is less sensitive to negative emotions and more responsive to positive feelings. If you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re more likely to feel stressed, anxious, and depressed. Take an afternoon nap, or go to bed a little earlier than usual. Your body (and your mind) will thank you.  Final thoughts  Tip: Choose happiness. You do happy. You be happy.  Happiness is an important part of living a healthy, fulfilling life.

(WATE) — A months-long investigation has determined a Union County man shot four children and set his house on fire before committing suicide, the district attorney wrote Monday.  Eighth Judicial District Attorney General Jared Effler filed a memorandum on Monday following an investigation into a January 29 house fire in Luttrell. He made the determination that Charles Aljumaily shot four children and killed himself based on evidence found by Tennessee Bureau of Investigation special agents.  Briseis Aljumaily, 15, Audrie Cooper-Fortner, 9, Gabriella Aljumaily, 5, and Evie Cooper-Fortner, 5, were found dead in the home.  Effler wrote that autopsies and ballistic evidence indicate that all four children were shot before the house caught fire. Charles Aljumaily, the father of Briseis Aljumaily and Gabriella Aljumaily and grandfather to Audrie and Evie Cooper-Fortner, is believed to have shot all four before setting the house fire and shooting himself.  Autopsies determined that all four were killed by gunshots from a .45 caliber Sig Sauer handgun, which was found near Charles Aljumaily. He died from a single gunshot to the head. The gun was purchased by Aljumaily in 2013 and registered to him.  Special agents found that the deadbolt on the home’s front door remained in a locked position after it had been breached by firefighters.  TBI special agents interviewed multiple family members. One told an investigator that Aljumaily was diagnosed with borderline bipolar disorder. They reported he had been paranoid recently and told them for the last few months that there was “a devil in his head attacking him.” He also reportedly said he wanted to harm himself but was afraid to because of how that would affect his salvation.  A relative also told a TBI agent that they suspected Aljumaily of being bipolar and that he was on medication, but stopped taking it because he did not like how it made him feel.  Another relative told investigators that Aljumaily said a few months prior that he “felt like ending it.” Minutes before the fire was reported, Aljumaily told a relative by phone that “it’s bad right now, it’s not good right now.”  Effler wrote that no criminal charges will be brought because Charles Aljumaily is dead.  “In my twenty-three(23) years as a prosecutor, this is one of the most tragic and heartbreaking cases I have ever encountered,” wrote Effler about the case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdW5pb24tY291bnR5LW5ld3MvZGEtbHV0dHJlbGwtbWFuLXNob3QtZmFtaWx5LXNldC1ob3VzZS1maXJlLWJlZm9yZS1zdWljaWRlL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdW5pb24tY291bnR5LW5ld3MvZGEtbHV0dHJlbGwtbWFuLXNob3QtZmFtaWx5LXNldC1ob3VzZS1maXJlLWJlZm9yZS1zdWljaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WJBF)– May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and one man in Utah is shining a light on men’s mental health. Sarah Murphy met the man behind the I Love You, Bro project.  “I actually was thinking, I cannot let this happen. My kids are gonna watch this happen. They’re never gonna forget this,” Joe Tuia’ana remembers.  What started as a regular drive home for Joe Tuia’ana, became a life-changing experience. In January, 2022, Joe and his daughters saw a man standing on a freeway overpass, about to jump off into oncoming traffic. Joe immediately got out of the car.  “I was overwhelmed with fear, and I said a quick little prayer. The only thing that I could think of to say was, ‘I love you, bro.’ And I grabbed him by the hoodie and the belt and we slid down this concrete embankment and just sat on the sidewalk, and I just kind of held him like he was one of my kids.”  It was a life-changing moment led to a friendship, and those four words stuck with him. He created the I Love You, Bro project, which is a platform focused on talking about men’s mental health.  The project helps men get connected with mental health professionals.  The suicide rate for men in the United States is four times higher than it is for women. LGBTQ men, soldiers and first responders are more vulnerable to suicide.  In 2021, more than 47,000 people in the US died by suicide. 38,025 of those were men. You can find lots of information and ways to help people in crisis on the projects website, iloveyoubro.net.

"suicide","2019-06-10","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T01:23:00","Actress Julia Ling is passionate about her latest project — Veteran Powered Films.  You might recall her from her recurring role as Anna Wu on the NBC TV series “Chuck” or from appearances on “ER,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “House” and “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.”  But her current role is that of a filmmaker and co-producer for a company she started with Micah Haughey in 2017.  Advertisement  She has been working with Haughey on film projects for her Silver Rose Entertainment production company but aspired to add something with more social impact.  Ling, who is in the Navy Reserve and lives part time in San Diego, could empathize with the veterans who were carrying heavy burdens of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and combat disabilities as they return into civilian life.  The U.S. Veterans Affairs statistic of 22 veterans committing suicide every day alarmed and distressed her. She joined in the 22 Pushup Challenge, a social media campaign to promote awareness of this grim statistic.  It went viral when celebrities — Chris Evans, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, John Krasinski, Chris Pratt and others — posted videos of themselves doing 22 pushups and challenged others to do the same.  The suicide rate peaked in 2018 and, in a 2022 report, the VA cited 2020 statistics indicating the rate had dropped to 16.8 per day — still unacceptably high.  “I lost a lot of people I know in the service — four committed suicide. I wanted to do more than just pushups,” says Ling, noting that she, too, struggled with depression related to her military service.  That’s when she began reaching out to help veterans by inviting them to be scriptwriters, producers, actors, prop and scenery workers, videographers and editors on films.  Thus, the Veterans Producing Films production company was born. She co-starred with Ryan Stuart (“No Time to Die”) in its first film, “Tango Down,” a short feature released in 2019 about two Afghanistan War veterans facing off in civilian life.  The cast and crew of Veteran Powered Films’ pre-pandemic film, “Tango Down,” includes 28 military veterans. (Michael Leahy)  The script was written by Rick Swift, a Marine Corps veteran and associate producer on the project, who lives in Florida.  “We brought vets together to write, tell a story, direct and perform. It was really surprising that the concept worked,” Ling says. “Starting this whole thing wasn’t easy, but we created this community. ... A few different vets came up to me with tears in their eyes saying, ‘You have no idea how this project saved my life.’ ”  Swift puts it succinctly: “We are working with them because we are them.”  The project inspired Jesse Ryun, an Army vet in Oregon whose weight had crept up to 300 pounds, to begin taking better care of himself. He started working out, lost 105 pounds and got an award from his gym for spending the most time there — three hours a day, six days a week.  “Jesse inspired us,” Ling says.  Next month, Haughey and Ling will be filming a proof-of-concept trailer for their next feature film on Palomar Mountain.  Ling had scoured Airbnb and Vrbo listings and contacted real estate managers in search of a secluded cabin in the woods as the setting. She found one owned by a veteran’s family.  So, from June 10 to 13, Veteran Powered Films will shoot scenes for an as-yet-unnamed horror feature film using veterans. It’s also supporting and getting the support of veteran-owned businesses, such as Mostra Coffee and Bailey’s on Palomar lodging.  “We want to employ veterans, train them with valuable skills and ultimately give them the tools they need to transition out of the military mindset and find a new mission in life,” Haughey said.  One veteran who worked on “Tango Down” was inspired to use his GI Bill to enroll in film school, he says. Creation of a platform inviting veterans to pitch stories and movie scripts is also in the works.  Michael de Leon, of Oceanside, who retired as a Navy chief petty officer in 2016, met Ling in 2019 when both were on the set of the sci-fi film “Tenet,” directed by Christopher Nolan. De Leon identifies with the VPF mission and is helping with the film projects.  It’s critical for vets suffering with mental health issues to be involved in activities with other vets because of the camaraderie and brotherhood and a chain-of-command style of operation, de Leon says.  He doesn’t play a role in the upcoming film or trailer but will be working on prepping the set, cabin decor, supplying provisions and community outreach.  “The concept is absolutely amazing,” says Ryun, who had a non-speaking role in “Tango Down.” “It’s probably one of coolest things I’ve ever heard of. The only problem is the direction our country is going right now. This is not a very patriotic place to live.”  Ling notes that this will be the first time they have filmed in San Diego County. “We feel like this is a warm, welcoming community for the military.”  Haughey adds that San Diegans are incredibly supportive. “Because we’re a small, independent film company starting out on a grassroots level, the community is coming together to help make it happen.”  “Even if it’s not the next Hollywood blockbuster, we all band together and create a brotherhood doing cool things together,” Ryun says. “And there’s no need for anyone to end their life.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmRpZWdvdW5pb250cmlidW5lLmNvbS9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL3N0b3J5LzIwMjMtMDUtMjMvdmV0ZXJhbi1zdWljaWRlcy1zcGFya3MtYWN0cmVzc3MtcGFzc2lvbi1wcm9qZWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T13:41:42","23 May 2023  The rate of suicide registrations in England and Wales has risen since 2007. But data for the last few years shows a mixed picture, with the rate of suicide occurrences broadly flat. Recent data is also complicated by the pandemic and a change to the way suicide is recorded.  Suicide is the biggest killer of young lives in this country… And the rate is going up. Our mission must be, and will be, to get it down. Sir Keir Starmer, .  In a speech on healthcare on 22 May, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the suicide rate is going up.  Labour has told us that Mr Starmer’s claim was based on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the rate of suicides registered in England and Wales, which does show a general rising trend between its low point in 2007 and 2021. However data for the last few years is less clear, and trends vary according to which year you start from.  Separate ONS statistics for the rate of suicides in England and Wales by when they occurred, rather than when they were registered, show that it has been broadly flat in recent years, with slight falls since 2019.  The recent data is also complicated by the pandemic and a change in 2018 to the way suicide is recorded. Professor Louis Appleby, a government advisor on suicide prevention and former national director for mental health, made these points in a Twitter thread on 22 May, in which he wrote: “Is the national suicide rate currently rising? Short answer: no.”  In a statement released by Labour before Mr Starmer’s speech, Dr Adrian James, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), originally said: “We support the Labour Party’s pledge to reverse rising rates of suicide.”  Following contact from Full Fact, the RCP changed its statement to read: “We support the Labour Party’s pledge to reduce rates of suicide.”  Any life lost by suicide is a terrible event. Public figures should try to describe this complex subject as accurately as possible, with appropriate context and caveats, to improve our chance of reducing the harm it causes.  Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I’m in  How is the suicide rate measured?  The ONS publishes age-standardised suicide rates for England and Wales by date of registration and by date of occurrence. The latest data on suicide registrations covers 1981 to 2021. There can be a significant delay between a suicide occurring and it being registered, so around half of each year’s registered suicides will have occurred in the previous year. The ONS has published provisional 2022 suicide registration rates for England only, while coroners’ statistics give 2022 registration data for England and Wales, but don’t provide an age-standardised rate.  The ONS also publishes data on suicide occurrences in England and Wales, covering 2013 to 2021. These figures are based on when deaths actually occurred, which means they are subject to revision after publication, as it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered.  What do the different measures show?  Labour told us Mr Starmer’s claim referred to the rising rate of suicide registrations since their low point in 2007. It is true this rate has risen since then, from nine per 100,000 in 2007 to 10.7 per 100,000 in 2021, although it remains generally lower than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.  Whether suicide registrations have been rising recently depends partly on when “recently” begins. For instance, the rate of 10.7 per 100,000 in 2021 had risen since 2017, when it was 9.4 per 100,000, but fallen since 2019, when it was 11 per 100,000. In a press release distributed before Mr Starmer’s speech, Labour referred to a different source, saying: “Coroners statistics published earlier this month revealed that 2022 saw the highest number of suicides recorded in England and Wales.”  This is true, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the the suicide rate is rising, because it’s difficult to directly compare this data with previous years. It is not presented as an age-standardised rate, and the most recent data may have been affected by pandemic delays and changes in the way suicide is recorded (which we discuss below).  ONS data on suicide occurrences may give a more reliable picture of recent trends, because it is less affected by changing delays to inquests, although it is subject to possible revisions.  This appears to show relatively little change in the rate of suicides between 2013, when the dataset begins, and 2021. Again, there are periods in the data when the rate is rising, but it has fallen in the last two years, and was slightly lower in 2021 than in 2013, although the figures could be revised in future.  We don’t yet have clear data on the rate of suicides that occurred in 2022, which may eventually show that it rose or that it fell.  As the graph above shows, the data we have for occurrences in the past few years does not appear to give a clear picture. Professor Appleby said he believed the current trend was “not rising, but not falling either”, adding: “That should be concern enough.”  Recent disruption makes comparisons hard  In his Twitter thread, Professor Appleby highlighted two factors that he said made interpreting recent figures “problematic”. One was the impact of the pandemic, during which the delay between suicides occurring and being registered grew substantially. This may have caused a backlog in the system, leading to fewer suicides being recorded for a time—then more, as the system caught up.  The 2022 coroners’ statistics say: “There were 35,643 inquest conclusions recorded in 2022, up 3,321 (10%) from 2021, in part reflecting the change in the number of inquests opened and possibly due to a backlog caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”  Suicides accounted for 14% of deaths recorded by coroners in 2022, down from 15% the year before.  Professor Appleby also mentioned a change in the way suicide is recorded, which happened in 2018.  In the words of the ONS: “The standard of proof – the level of evidence needed by coroners to conclude whether a death was caused by suicide – was changed from the criminal standard of ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’, to the civil standard of ‘on the balance of probabilities’ on 26 July 2018.”  The 2022 coroners’ statistics acknowledge this, saying: “The overall increase may be a consequence of the change in the standard of proof.”  However it’s not clear how much of an impact this change may have had to the overall statistics. The ONS says: “Since the change in the standard of proof, suicide rates have not seen unprecedented increases. Recent increases have been seen among English males and females, but these increases started before this change. Whenever a change in suicide rates occurs, the reasons are complex and will rarely be because of one factor alone.”  Contacting Samaritans  The Samaritans’ helpline is available at all hours and can be contacted free on 116 123, or you can email jo@samaritans.org  Image courtesy of Rwendland","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZnVsbGZhY3Qub3JnL2hlYWx0aC9rZWlyLXN0YXJtZXItc3VpY2lkZS1yYXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The show's dark twists and shocking turns have kept fans hooked since episode one, and Oshi no Ko continues to push boundaries. This month, that was proven true when a recent episode tackled the topic of suicide and online harassment. But following its release, it seems the mother of late wrestler Hana Kimura feels Oshi no Ko was disrespectful with its release.  For those who do not know Kimura, you should know Hana was an up-and-coming wrestler who followed in the steps of her mother. She became known the world over when Kimura was cast in Terrace House: Tokyo. During her time on the show, Kimura faced harsh harassment online from netizens and eventually addressed the situation on social media before being found dead in May 2020. Kimura's death was ruled a suicide stemming from bullying, and her legacy has gone on to highlight the dangers of online harassment.  As for Kimura's mother Kyoko, she continues to share her daughter with the world on social media. It was there she aired her frustrations with Oshi no Ko after it aired a controversial episode involving suicide. In this update, audiences watched a character named Akane deal with online bullying and attempt to end their own life as such. In the end, Akane's life was saved by Aqua as fans saw in the Oshi no Ko manga. But for Kimura's mother, well – she and others online felt this episode riffed off a real-life suicide.  ""By using a true story, people who treasure Hana are now deeply hurt. Can you imagine? What's more is the anime's release is timed so nearly to the anniversary of [Hana's] death? I despise you from the bottom of my heart,"" Kyoko wrote on Twitter shortly after Oshi no Ko's episode aired.  Kimura's mother went on to share several quote tweets from others criticizing the anime's apparent riff. Still, others online have been quick to correct the narrative surrounding Oshi no Ko. The original manga was drafted before Kimura's death, so its plans for Akane were inked at least a month before the Terrace House tragedy. Still, Oshi no Ko's harsh look at online bullying and suicide was bound to ruffle feathers. It is no doubt upsetting to see Kimura's mother so distraught.

Assisted suicide was legalized in Canada in 2021 for those with a ""grievous and irremediable medical condition,"" but a sizable portion of Canadian respondents in a May poll conducted by Research Co. want expanded access for those with in less fortunate economic conditions. Homelessness, 28% of respondents said, is enough reason for assisted suicide access, and another 27% of respondents said poverty is a justifiable reason.  An inability to receive medical treatment in the country, which has a socialized system, should qualify those for assisted suicide, according to 51% of respondents. Half of respondents said those with disabilities should have access to assisted suicide. Another 43% said mental illness is reason for access.  Nearly three quarters of the Canadian respondents approved of their country's guidelines for assisted suicide, which requires the person to be at least 18-years-old, have a grievous and irremediable medical condition, make a voluntary request, and give informed consent.  Legalized assisted suicide and euthanasia has grown in popularity in recent decades, with the most notable countries with access being Canada, Australia, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands.

The 988 Mental Health Lifeline says it’s averaging 4,000 calls a month from Oklahomans.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department is sounding the alarm after seeing a dramatic increase in attempted suicide calls.  “Years previously, tracking back to 2018, 2019, during the same time frame January through May, we were responding to around 500. We did see an increase in 2020 and it has gradually increased in this year,” said Capt. Scott Douglas, with the Oklahoma City Fire Department.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department says they have responded to around 1,000 attempted suicide calls just this year.  That’s about seven a day since January 1st and mental health officials say the problem in Oklahoma is only getting worse.  “I think it’s hurtful to know that anyone is struggling and that there are resources available to them and maybe they just didn’t get them ahead of time,” said Bonnie Campo, senior director of public relations of Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.  988 Oklahoma is a free service and available for people struggling with mental health. The resource is able to help those in need within a matter of seconds by just calling or texting 988.  “Sometimes it’s just having a bad day and they need someone to talk to because in that anonymous way, you feel like there is no judgment. But it could also be that we need to send out physical resources to a location so that we can help those people get in-person services if they need that,” said Campo.  988 Oklahoma data shows one in five Oklahomans struggle with a mental health issue. That’s about 789,000 Oklahomans.  “Our job is saving lives. We want to save lives. We want to put prevention in place first. Maybe there were not enough prevention efforts, and that’s why we’re pushing 988 so hard, is now that we’re not going to see those numbers spike. It’s all about getting there earlier rather than when it’s too late,” said Campo.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department is staying busier than ever, but the department is now providing firefighters with resources to help with their mental health.  “Oklahoma City Fire Department did recently hire a counselor for the firefighters. So, we have mental health issues as well, you know, and she’s there just as basically as an aide for us. So mental health is an issue. And we just want to identify that not only with the residents and attempted suicide calls that will go on, but also for firefighters, health and wellbeing,” said Douglas.  If you or someone you know is struggling with a mental health crisis, you can call or text 988 and you will be in contact with someone in 10 seconds.  Throughout the rest of Mental Health Awareness Month, 988 Oklahoma is launching events and content every day in May to help you learn more about mental health and the resources available for you and your loved ones.

However, AFSP shows suicide rates have decreased in San Diego by 15%.  Example video title will go here for this video  SAN DIEGO — We live in a time where, sadly, many of us have known someone that has lost their life to suicide.  1.2 million people attempted to commit suicide in 2020, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  Now, there is a method experts claim reduces the likelihood of someone taking their own life.  DJ and dancer Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss, Miss USA Chelsie Kryst, and Robin Williams are people many remember for their positive light who lost their lives to suicide. However, their deaths are one of the reasons mental health has come to the forefront nationally and locally.  Jan Gloster lives in San Diego. He was shocked when his godbrother took his own life.  ""My godbrother was a very energetic man. He was a go-getter, someone who let the world come to him. But, he was a gentle and kind man. We didn't see any of this coming, and that's what is so obscene and rare. It's always when you least expect it,"" said Gloster.  From 2012-2021, suicide rates have increased nationally by 12%. However, AFSP shows suicide rates have decreased in San Diego by 15%.  ""San Diego has shown a decrease since 2018. So, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, we've seen a steady decrease,"" said Veronica Campbell, Psychotherapist at Sharp Mesa Vista.  The decrease is attributed to suicide prevention safety plans, according to local suicide prevention experts.  ""It is an incredibly researched tool. This is something that mental health knows it works. When things are specific, it works better,"" said Campbell.  ""We've seen reductions we've never seen before, the lowest rates we'vein 10 years. So it has shown, and it has proven that it works. Having a plan has been shown to reduce the rates of suicides,"" said Yeni Palomino, Vice President of Community Health and Engagement for Community Health Partners in San Diego.  The method was created by Columbia University's Director of Suicide Prevention Training, Barbara Stanley.  According to Stanley's findings, all studies that used a suicide safety plan had a 43% reduction in suicidal behavior.  So, how does it work? The safety plan is a six-step process that includes ways for patients to cope, distract themselves and reach out for support.  Campbell and Palomino say they assess their patients before providing a safety plan, yet they say you do not need to be a doctor to create a plan.  A person experiencing suicidal thoughts can write or talk these ideas out before or during a crisis.  Step 1: Warning Signs  *List thoughts or moods, or behaviors that lead to suicidal thoughts  Step 2: Internal Coping Strategies  *what can you do to not act on your thoughts?  You can move on to Step 3 if Step 2 does not resolve the crisis  Step 3: Social contacts who may distract from the crisis  *List several people who can help take your mind off your problems  Step 4: Family members or friends who may offer help  *Have a back plan of more people who can support you and make you feel better  Step 5: Professionals and agencies to contact for help  *List names and numbers of urgent care services  Step 6: Make the environment safe  *Make sure firearms, weapons, and medications are stored in far away safe places during a crisis  ""People can say, 'I'm not alone.' You prevent suicides by giving people hope and connections,"" said Palomino.  ""The fact I'm talking to you about this is so different from 10 years ago. I think there's a decrease because mental health has been given the light it has needed,"" said Campbell.  She says you can change the plan to personalize it specifically to your needs.  Gloster wished he had known about this plan sooner.  ""I was not equipped with the proper resources to see the warning signs with my godbrother. I think it needs to be a plan of action and spread like wildfire. I think a safety plan is integral in suicide prevention because it will equip people and prevent a potential suicide from happening,"" said Gloster.  And he has a message for those who are having dark thoughts.  ""I think if anyone who doesn't have a voice or feels their voice isn't heard or you're not having the best days, you're not alone. You being present and alive is better than being gone and not remembered,"" said Gloster.

"suicide","2018-10-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T18:03:00","The last several years have been exhausting for the parents of Brandon Caserta, who died by suicide at Naval Air Station Norfolk in 2018.  “He just has helped people almost from birth,"" said Teri Caserta, Brandon’s mother.  ""He loved life. He loved people. He loved to help people.""  Brandon left texts saying he had been bullied and harassed by his command. The sailor’s final notes say he wanted to help others in similar situations, so his family pushed for the law, which makes it easier for sailors to ask for help, even when their command is reluctant.  “If you invoke the Brandon Act, you get to go attend to whatever your problem is immediately, and the command needs to help you with it,"" said Patrick Caserta, Brandon's father. ""So if you don't have an appointment or can't get one, they need to get you one and ensure that you're going.  Congress passed the law in 2021. Caserta’s parents are frustrated that the Pentagon is just now implementing the new rules across all services. Each branch has a higher suicide rate than the general public.  Though the law spells out that commands are responsible for getting help for service members quickly, that doesn’t mean help is always available. The Navy told Congress last May that half its Deployed Resiliency Counselor positions were unfilled.  All of the services are struggling to find mental health providers, said Father William Waff, who runs the Military Chaplains Association. Waff is a retired Army major general who worked as a hospital chaplain before he retired.  “Everybody wants a mental health professional, and the number one person that the VA is recruiting for are mental health professionals,"" Waff said. ""The branches of the military are doing the exact same thing.""  The services are trying to fill the gap with chaplains, who are used to playing a spiritual and wellness role. Over the years they have been given more mental health training, but not enough to be licensed in mental health. Their job is to mainly alert medical staff when they notice a change in behavior among a soldier or crew member, Waff said.  “You will not be a therapist. You will not be a counselor,” Waff said. “Basically, you’re providing an awareness that there are some things that would be indicators for a referral to a mental health specialist.”  Even finding chaplains is tough. The Air Force wants more chaplains to deploy forward with units. The Navy estimates it will need an extra 70 to 90 chaplains to fulfill its plan to put chaplains on every destroyer.  Obtaining mental health care often isn't much easier for service members who pursue options outside the military.  In Norfolk, only one private mental health practice is dedicated to active duty clients.  “There's to me nothing more rewarding than working with active duty,” said Greg Lemich, who runs the practice. But he adds that private providers often have a full client list and are put off by the paperwork associated with TriCare, the military’s insurance program.  Clinicians in the provide sector also may be unprepared for the schedules of service members. Lemich, for instance, said his office sees an influx of new clients whenever an aircraft carrier arrives in Norfolk.  And military personnel often have particular stressors of military life, such as combat related injuries and other issues.  “Military sexual trauma is unfortunately something that we see quite a bit,"" Lemich said. ""People who are on board a ship and somebody who they know commits suicide is something which can be very devastating,”  The root cause of suicide is elusive. Around Norfolk, nine sailors died in a little over a year when they were assigned to shore duty or their vessels were in the shipyard. Cmdr. Michael Siedsma, the captain of the submarine Massachusetts, which is under construction at Newport News, acknowledges the challenge for the crew.  “It's certainly a big stressor for them. If you sign up for the Navy to go to sea and see the world and visit foreign ports, and that foreign port is Newport News, Virginia, that maybe is not what you would count on. It can be tough for some of those folks,” Siedema said.  His philosophy is to engage with sailors and keep the crew busy and motivated. He said the Navy has improved living conditions at shipyards in recent months.  The Pentagon officially rolled out the Brandon Act May 5. The services have 45 days to create policies for implementing the new law for all active duty troops. The law will then be extended to reserve and National Guard troops after another 45 day window. The Defense Health Agency plans to train commanders how to refer troops to mental health treatment and promote the policy among service members, with the goal of lessening the stigma of seeking treatment.

I get time to think,” said Chapple, on the last leg of a 50-mile jaunt.  Chapple is walking, not because he has to, but because he needs to.  “My health has gotten so bad that I was pre-diabetic,” acknowledged Chapple.  So the 33-year retired Army master sergeant laced up his boots and hit the open road.  “It was just me and God walking and talking, and then that young man killed himself,” said Chapple, referring to a teenager who attended his church.  “It just kind of hit me really really deeply,” Chapple reflected.  That stunning incident actually triggered Chapple’s mood swings and PTSD.  “When people are trying to get over on me … I just got from zero to 60 in a heartbeat,” he said.  “I was like a drill sergeant, why people are killing themselves and taking our gifts to the grave.  We’re all invested with a gift, you and me, we’re supposed to release that gift on the world.”  It was at that moment that Chappel challenged himself to up his walking game. With his US Army flag in hand and a rucksack on his back, he spent five days on a walking crusade to raise awareness to prevent suicides.  KRIS 6 News  “I encourage any vet with suicide … any medical conditions … get help,” said Chapple, who is also a social media influencer.  Licensed professional counselor Emilia O’Neil believes Chapple is literally taking positive steps to find meaning and an explanation for his triggers.  “Instead of keeping it inside and suffering and dealing with those memories,” said O’Neil. “That’s a great healthy way to deal with trauma and to deal with PTSD. “  O’Neil knows this experience firsthand.  She was a first responder in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that claimed numerous lives.  And when a more recent earthquake struck there, that event triggered O’Neil. It so happened to be on a day she was helping veterans like Chapple.  “And instead of panicking, I told them what was happening and I remember one of them telling me, we got your back. So I think that’s the healing effect,” recalled O’Neil.  O’Neil sees that same healing effect in Chapple’s walk. She believes it not only brings attention, but it could also help those impacted to open up about this difficult subject.  “We use those events and say now I know what it’s all about. Now I can talk about it. And now it can help others going through the same thing,” said O’Neil.  Chapple believes it just takes a leap of faith, one step at a time, to find hope.  “Life is worth living. There is always a chance to start again,” he said.

George Sullivan, 25, from Surrey, is backing a new ""workplace charter"" which would help people support colleagues more effectively and enable more helpful discussions at work about suicide.  ""Everyone deserves this, everyone deserves help,"" he told Sky News.  ""I am a suicide attempt survivor, I attempted suicide both at 14 years old and at 23.""  ""I felt shame and embarrassment - for someone to try and end their life in that way, we just can't have that in our society.  ""If I told you that you had the ability to save someone's life everyone would want to, and that is totally possible by learning how to have that conversation and reducing that stigma.""  The charter, which is designed for businesses of all sizes, is led by the team behind Baton Of Hope, a suicide awareness initiative that will embark on a UK-wide tour this summer with a specially-designed baton similar to the Olympic torch.  Ahead of the launch, Mr Sullivan explained that conversations in the workplace about suicide prevention and support need to be normalised and encouraged.  ""We can still do better on this.

The Health and Safety Executive estimates that 17 million working days are lost each year due to depression, stress and anxiety.  ""It is not just about saving human lives,"" Mr Sullivan added.  ""I was out of work for a year-and-a-half and what effect does that have on the economy?  ""On efficiency, productivity, tax, family networks, friend networks - there are so many things that it affects.""  Companies that sign up to the charter will agree to make suicide prevention and support a priority, use clear consistent messaging when discussing the issue, train staff, embrace people with experience, and promote crisis services and further support.  'Ultimately a message of hope'  Former Sky News correspondent Mike McCarthy is the founder of Baton Of Hope - his son Ross battled depression for a decade before taking his own life in 2021.

Mr McCarthy said: ""The hope - and I use that word deliberately since ours is ultimately a message of hope - is that businesses up and down the country will see the critical need for guidance around suicide prevention and support, that they'll discuss it openly, and that this can be the catalyst for real change.""  Image: Mike McCarthy with the Baton Of Hope.  'If suicide were a virus we'd be on the hunt for a vaccine'  More than 100 MPs have pledged their support to the Baton Of Hope which will tour 12 UK cities starting in Glasgow on 25 June.  Dean Russell, MP for Watford, who will help launch the charter in Westminster later, said: ""The workplace plays a crucial part in our mental health and there is a clear need for guidance on how organisations can better support their greatest asset - their people.  ""If suicide were a virus we'd be on the hunt for a vaccine and if loneliness were a disease, we would be trying to find a cure.  ""We can achieve this by working together.""

Children and teens can experience the same emotions as adults.  FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A young person dying due to feeling hopeless and alone is devastating.  In the Central Valley, there are trainings and screenings implemented to identify those at risk.  Children and teens can experience the same emotions as adults.  According to health experts at Valley Children's Hospital, their feelings can be more intense, and oftentimes, hard for them to understand.  ""Creating a safe space and being able to communicate with a child within the range of their language development, their emotional development, being able to simplify it and talk and ask in words that they can understand,"" said Deonna Villegas-McPeters, Director of Patient and Family Services. ""The Social Work Department has dolls. We have multicultural dolls, we have animals and we have different resources that we use.""  This method helps Valley Children's staff assess their patients for a possible suicide risk.  In addition, since January 2022, the hospital has implemented a universal screening process. It's for patients 12 years or older in the emergency department, day surgery and acute care units.  ""If a child is presenting with moderate or high risk based upon their answers, it then triggers a process where then a social worker will actually then meet with that patient, their caregiver and ask more comprehensive questions -- just to identify what the risk is at the time that the child is there,"" Villegas-McPeters said.  Something similar to the screening is available to students and staff at Fresno State.  It's called the QPR Training -- which stands for Question, Persuade and Refer.  ""It's really just a way to have a conversation with an individual and then to get eventually to the point where you're talking about available resources,"" said health educator Georgianna Negron-long. ""Then of course, we tell them about resources -- not just on campus, but also in the community.""  QPR Training must be requested.  ""Professors will invite us into the classroom, or oftentimes, like different departments that have like peer mentorship groups on campus -- like we have our Upward Bound, it's an upcoming one that we're going to be doing for the students that are actually going to be working with K through 12 students over the summer,"" said Negron-long.  While studies show youth suicides in California increased during the pandemic, some health experts remain hopeful that this same generation will reduce the stigma surrounding mental health.  ""The generation coming behind us is so powerful in so many ways in terms of being open and talking about it,"" Villegas-McPeters said.  They're hoping it will lead to an increase in young people reaching out for help when feeling hopeless and alone.

West Herr Automotive Group donated $11,000 to support a local Challenge 22 event, which raises funds for groups treating and supporting at-risk veterans and awareness of veteran suicide.  Several veterans groups accepted the donation to help with the event, which will be held Saturday, June 10, in Canandaigua.  And to return the favor, veterans involved in the event presented the auto dealership with their “Stars & Stripes” honor for ongoing generosity, for which words cannot be expressed, said Dave Brisbane, commandant of the Memorial Day Detachment 468 of the Marine Corps League.  “Their leadership and concern for America’s veterans and those right here in the Finger Lakes cannot be overstated,” Brisbane said.  Meeting the challenge of veteran suicide  Last year, $54,000 was raised during the event, well over the goal of $22,000.  Money distributed to the Canandaigua VA Medical Center, Warrior Salute, Equicenter and Marine Corps Coordinating Council to aid in these groups' efforts to help veterans and, in the process, reduce that suicide rate.  Another goal last year also was realized this year.  Since last year, organizers wanted to get more veterans groups involved in the planning of the event and raising money. Mission accomplished, with members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETs and Vietnam Veterans joining counterparts from the Marine Corps League and American Legion in helping to plan for this year's event and raise money and awareness of veteran suicide.  About the Challenge 22 event in Canandaigua  The Canandaigua American Legion Post 254 will host the event Saturday, June 10. Registration is from 9 a.m. to noon.  A 2.2-mile walk is intended to highlight the issue of 22 veteran suicides a day, as well as show support for the efforts of helping veterans.  Food trucks, live music, silent auction and car shows are also planned that day. Motorcycle enthusiasts will be touring Canandaigua Lake as a further show of support.

Carla Miller lost her son, Will, after he died by suicide last year. The Fridell Middle Schooler was a gifted student with an appetite for adventure. Especially if it involved sports like soccer, skateboarding, or skiing.  So Carla decided to keep her son’s kind and giving spirit alive by starting a fundraiser in his memory.  The 2nd annual ‘Will Be Free 2 Dream” fundraising event took over the Garden indoor skatepark in Rochester on Tuesday. The room was packed with Will’s family and friends. All to help a family trying to move past one of the worst moments of their life, and bring joy to others.  “Out of all of the grief we’ve been through this last year, it’s beautiful to see our community come together,” Carla Miller said. “It brings me so much joy.”  Carla is a mental health practitioner and she says it’s important to talk regularly with your children about ways to cope with their emotions. Even if you think they’re doing fine.  “Statistics say suicide rates go up amongst youth that has had a peer pass away by suicide,” Carla Miller said. “But that’s why we’re here, is to hopefully raise awareness and lower the stigma about mental illness and around suicide.”  The love for the Miller family was flowing out the door during tonight’s fundraiser. All the proceeds will go toward a group that was dear to Will’s heart, the Rochester Community Ed Youth Ski Club; Which he was a part of during the last four years of his life.  In their last fundraiser, they were able to raise enough to get six kids involved in the ski club. Carla hopes they can double that this time around and make ‘Will Be Free 2 Dream’ an annual celebration.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthYWx0di5jb20vbmV3cy90b3AtbmV3cy93aWxsLWJlLWZyZWUtMi1kcmVhbS1zcHJlYWRpbmctYXdhcmVuZXNzLW9mLXN1aWNpZGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

You can also find them online at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org.  BALTIMORE (AP) — Eurico Rosa da Silva was in a dark place.  On the track, the jockey in his early 30s was winning races and making money. At home, he was fighting suicidal thoughts every day.  WATCH: 41% of surveyed LGBTQ+ youth considered suicide in the past year  “I got to the point where I have no more choice but to go for help,” he recalled recently. “I went because if I have no choice, I would kill myself.”  Da Silva got help in 2006 and rode for more than a decade before retiring. He’s one of the lucky ones.  Earlier this year, horse racing was stunned by the suicides less than six weeks apart of two young jockeys, 23-year-old Avery Whisman and 29-year-old Alex Canchari. A friend of Whisman’s, Triple Crown-winning rider Mike Smith, said he has seen similar tragedies over three decades.  “I know several riders that I knew very well committed suicide when it was all said and done,” Smith said. “This is not all of a sudden just happening. It’s been going on. You just never heard of it.”  READ MORE: 988 mental health line receives over 2 million calls and texts in 6 months  The dangers of riding thoroughbreds at high speed add up to an average of two jockeys dying from racing each year and 60 being paralyzed, according to one industry veteran. Combine that with criticism from owners, trainers and bettors and the need to maintain the low weight necessary to establish a career, and jockeys have been quietly suffering for as long as they have been riding horses.  While jockeys interviewed for this story worry that racing has lagged behind other sports in accepting the importance of their mental health on the job, there is hope that renewed conversation about it prompts real change.  “This needs to be addressed,” jockey Trevor McCarthy said. “We take a lot of beatings mentally and physically. With the mental and physical state, when you mix both of them together, it can be a recipe for disaster. Look, there’s proof of it, right? We lost two guys.”  McCarthy last year, like da Silva before him, sought help before it was too late. His father was a jockey, as is his father-in-law and his wife, Katie Davis McCarthy. They are all used to the ups and downs of the job, from the broken pelvis and collarbone from his spill during a race in November to the uncertain hold on a ride.  A particularly rough summer, including flying up and down the East Coast to ride, took a toll on McCarthy, who at 118 pounds could feel his diet and lack of calories affect his work. He wanted to quit.  “I was going absolutely nuts, and my body couldn’t handle it,” McCarthy said. “You’re constantly going through mind games. And I think a lot of guys get caught up in that with the weight and the mind game of not doing good or thinking they’re not good enough.”  His wife made him promise to talk to a sports therapist. McCarthy did so for months, learning how to find a better work-life balance that has helped him win 28 races already this year.  Now 47, da Silva was named Canada’s best jockey seven times and is the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.  “In 30 years of riding horses, I can say to you that I never heard anybody talk about the emotional pain, never talked about going for help,” said da Silva, who’s now a mental health coach. “I approached many jockeys that I feel like they need help, and many times I said, ‘Go for help.’ I motivate them to go for help. They just listen, but they don’t really want to talk about.”  Analysis: There’s a mental health crisis among teen girls. Here are some ways to support them  Dr. Ciara Losty of South East Technological University in Waterford, Ireland, pointed out that jockeys have an “underdeveloped sense of self inside of their sport,” compared to team sport or Olympic athletes who are less likely to burn out because they seek out other activities. She said jockeys can also be less familiar with mental health topics because of low literacy levels and lack the support system of a coach or coaching staff.  “Maintaining a low weight and obviously disordered eating is a big part of it,” said Losty, who co-authored a 2018 study on jockey mental health. “Being a jockey, you have a risk of serious injuries, and if you’ve had a serious injury the fear of re-injury when you engage or get back up on the horse again may impact your performance or lead you to some kind of distress.”  Dr. Lewis King, now at Ireland’s Technological University of the Shannon, did his doctoral degree in 2021 on the subject because he wanted to explore what makes jockeys susceptible to mental health problems and what stopped them from seeking help. In talking to 84 jockeys in Ireland, he said, he found 61% met the threshold for adverse alcohol use, 35% for depression and 27% for anxiety.  King’s research showed that despite nearly 80% of jockeys having at least one common mental health disorder, only a third saw a professional. He said most feared losing their jobs.  “The main barrier was stigma and the negative perceptions of others,” King said. “But primarily it was related to the negative perceptions of trainers. There was a perception within the jockeys I interviewed that if they spoke about their mental health issues or it somehow got back to their trainer that it may impact whether they get rides. The trainer may perceive them as not in the right headspace, for instance, to ride their horses.”  Trainers told King and his colleagues they felt similar worries about sharing their own mental health concerns with owners.  McCarthy, who has been a jockey since 2011, said in recent months he has actually confronted trainers in the U.S., telling them to ease up on berating fellow jockeys after races.  The entire cycle speaks to horse racing being “an old-school sport,” McCarthy said. Losty pinned the lack of progress in mental health on the masculinized nature of the industry, and da Silva said the topic is still “taboo” in racing.  “Asking for help in our sport is almost a sign of weakness, sad to say,” said Smith, who rode Justify to the Triple Crown in 2018 and is still riding at 57. “You certainly don’t want to show any signs of that. We’re supposed to be tough and be able to handle it all.”  The Jockeys’ Guild and Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority recently sent out an anonymous survey — the first of its kind — to gauge the best ways to support riders’ mental health and wellbeing, a hotline is among the ideas being considered and a meeting with industry stakeholders is planned soon.  “It’s important for the industry to come together on this issue and other issues to grow our industry and make sure equine and human athletes are taken care of,” said Jockeys’ Guild president and CEO Terry Meyocks, a third-generation horseman whose daughter, Abby, is married to Kentucky Derby-winning jockey Javier Castellano. “It’s important that people talk about it.”  McCarthy only started talking seriously about it after getting married and daughter Riley was born, knowing he’s at the leading edge of thinking about mental health and how far behind other jockeys are.  “We’re just behind the 8-ball a little bit with that,” he said. “It’s going to be baby steps, but we have a long way to go.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvbmF0aW9uL2pvY2tleS1zdWljaWRlcy1icmluZy1hdHRlbnRpb24tdG8tc3RyZXNzLWFuZC1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWNvbmNlcm5zLW9mLXRoZS1qb2LSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL25ld3Nob3VyL2FtcC9uYXRpb24vam9ja2V5LXN1aWNpZGVzLWJyaW5nLWF0dGVudGlvbi10by1zdHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY29uY2VybnMtb2YtdGhlLWpvYg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2020-05-20","Not Discerned","{""LittleRock"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:10:09","A mother and daughter duo who are graduating this spring from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock are using their education in applied communication to help prevent teen suicide in Arkansas.  Ebene Givan graduated with a Master of Arts in applied communication studies, while her daughter, Aliya Givan, has earned a bachelor’s degree in applied communication.  “Ever since she was younger, I made college mandatory,” Givan said. “I got my undergraduate degree in 2019, and she graduated from high school in 2019. It was her freshman year that she was undeclared. She told me, ‘Mom, I’ve seen such a change in you with this degree that I want to do the same thing.’ The rest is history.”  Givan recalls that it’s been a long journey to complete her college education. She’s been a single mom to Aliya since 17, and it’s been all about working and providing since then. She earned an associate degree from the University of Arkansas – Pulaski Technical Institute in 2007. She first transferred to UA Little Rock in 2008 and has been attending off and on since then.  “School was necessary, but it wasn’t urgent,” Givan said. “Work was a priority. I remember thinking that I kept getting paid these low salaries because I didn’t have a college degree. I started taking it more seriously after the birth of my youngest daughter, who is 7. It’s been a long journey to understand what I needed to do to make enough to support my family. My kids needed to see that finishing strong is the most important thing.  After earning her undergraduate degree in 2019, Givan thought she was finished with college, but then the unthinkable happened.  “In May 2020, my nephew Mike died by suicide,” she said. “It changed everything from my perspective on life to my relationships. I wanted to understand how my degree could be used to help in the fight against suicide. I learned that if you increase connectedness between people, it decreases the risk of suicide. It was a journey that led me to understand that communication increases connectedness, and that led to my desire to get a master’s degree.”  So, Givan returned to UA Little Rock to earn her master’s degree in 2021, which is the same year she started Mike’s Mission, a nonprofit organization named after her nephew that aims to prevent teen suicide by promoting family and community connectedness and providing positive communication in the family dynamic.  “The Applied Communication program has been amazing in so many ways,” she said. “I don’t know of a better faculty and staff than in this program. I’ve made some amazing new friends on this journey. I will cherish every single moment with this program.”  Mike’s Mission holds a variety of trainings that promote positive communication, conflict resolution, and family togetherness. They hold events like basketball tournaments, food drives, and shoe drives. For her graduate project, Givan completed a needs assessment for Mike’s Mission to find out how the nonprofit can help even more families.  “It laid the foundation for what we are able to build in our nonprofit organization, what parents need, and build those trainings accordingly,” Givan said. “It helped me get a good look at how I can partner with parents to help strengthen the parent-child relationship.”  Now that they are graduating, both mother and daughter will be using their education to expand Mike’s Mission, along with their full-time jobs as a training specialist at UAMS and hair salon owner.  Givan is reminded of the fact that Mike would have been 18 this year and should have been headed off to college. She takes comfort in the fact that Mike wanted her to finish college.  “One thing that made this so important for me was a memory from my undergrad years,” Givan said. “I remember going to my sister and just being like, ‘I don’t have the money to buy my books.’ My nephew has never been a fan of tears. He patted me on the back, and said, ‘Titi, it will be alright.’ As I left the house, we had a secret handshake. He gave me money and said, ‘Titi, buy your books. You are going to graduate.’ That is how I knew he wanted me to go to college and graduate.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdWFsci5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL2ZhbWlseS1wcmV2ZW50LXRlZW4tc3VpY2lkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2022-11-01","10:00:00","{""Adelaide"", ""SouthAustralia"", ""Australia""}","2023-05-23T06:33:00","Independent reports into dozens of defence suicides took more than 18 months to complete, an inquiry has been told.  The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide on Tuesday focused on statistical analysis of 57 death reports between 2016 and 2022.  Counsel assisting Gabriella Rubagotti told the hearing it took the inspector-general of the Australian Defence Force 575 days on average to complete each death by suicide report.  ""That refers to permanent members and reservists (and) for permanent members (only) it was even longer, 610 days,"" she said.  Group Captain Daniel Drinan, former director of Defence's Strategic and Sensitive Issues Management unit, said every case was unique and factors such as coronial investigations could delay reports being completed.  ""Every range of circumstances needs to be explored based on the requirements and expectations both of the inquiry officer and how the inquiry officer engages with the family,"" he said.    Ms Rubagotti asked Capt Drinan if he agreed that 610 days between a death and a report's release was a ""fairly long time"".  ""It would be difficult to identify whether this is high or low or should be different because the circumstances are the primary driver,"" he replied.  Capt Drinan told the inquiry commissioners the completed reports were handed to the Office of the Chief of the Defence Force and the Strategic and Sensitive Issues Management unit, where the recommendations were identified for implementation.  Asked how long the process took, Capt Drinan said: ""There's no policy (but) there are time frames that we factor into our own internal planning process so that we understand how long overall this may take.""  ""That will be heavily dependent on the nature of the recommendations,"" he said.  Capt Drinan said some recommendations following a suicide could be implemented before the reports were completed but others involved changing infrastructure and that ""takes time"".    ""If it is something that can be managed at a unit level within a particular unit then that is different to an enterprise-wide change,"" he said.  ""Sometimes we see reports that have a mixture of both and that will extend our ability to compete and close the work.""  The commissioners were also told about the limitations of the reports, such as not including the geographic location of the member when they died or their length of service with the ADF.  The reports also paid limited attention to external factors that may have impacted the member before they died, like relationship breakdowns, mental health issues or alcohol abuse.  Royal commission chair Nick Kaldas said it was important for the reports to identify such factors.    ""What if all 57 (deaths) were in the one place,"" he said, referring to the failure to include the location of the member who had died.  Anneliese Hilder, former deputy director of assurance at ADF headquarters, said the overall analysis of the 57 deaths showed mental health was a dominant factor in 61 per cent of the reports into member suicides.  Two-in-three members were receiving treatment for mental health issues around the time of their deaths and 51 per cent had been assessed for risk of suicide in the previous year.  Of the members who died, 83 per cent also had additional risk factors such as a relationship breakdown or chronic pain, with 32 per cent experiencing mental health concerns or a breakdown at the time of their death.

"suicide","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T10:59:00","The family of British Bollywood actress and former Knightsbridge schoolgirl Jiah Khan, whose mysterious death was the subject of a BBC documentary, have accused the courts of “sweeping her death under the carpet”.  Her boyfriend, Indian actor Sooraj Pancholi, was acquitted of abetting the 25-year-old’s suicide late last month in a case that has gripped Bollywood since she was found dead in a flat she shared with her mother in an exclusive part of Mumbai 10 years ago.  The death of Ms Khan, who at one point was hailed the brightest talent of her generation, was declared a suicide by the police, however her family have long maintained that she was murdered.  Ms Khan’s entry into the decadent world of Bollywood sounds like the plot of one of the industry’s typical romantic melodramas. The privately educated, Knightbridge schoolgirl was on holiday in India when she became an overnight Bollywood sensation following her performance as a sexually uninhibited teenager in the film, Nishabd, a remake of American Beauty.  While she ticked every PR box as far as Bollywood debuts go, her death appeared at first glance to confirm every cliché about troubled starlets.  A different narrative soon began to emerge when on the morning of her funeral, a six-page letter was discovered in which Ms Khan made harrowing claims about her relationship with Mr Pancholi, saying it was marred by violence, infidelity and a traumatic abortion.  The London-educated Bollywood actress, 25, was found dead at her flat ten years ago (Photo: Prasad Gori/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)  Mr Pancholi admitted to having an argumentative relationship with Ms Khan, but denied claims he was violent.  Details of the abortion were reported by The Observer and in the BBC documentary. Police questioned the doctor who performed the procedure at the time.  Mr Pancholi, the son of Bollywood film star Aditya Pancholi, had been dating Ms Khan for nine months when she died. He was arrested for abetting her suicide, a charge which carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison, and the story captured international attention, becoming the subject of the documentary series Death in Bollywood. The charge sheet cited Ms Khan’s letter and her claims about their relationship, as well as witness statements alleging she had told friends she was assaulted by him.  The actor was sensationally freed of all charges on 28 April, ten years after Ms Khan’s shocking death, with the court citing a lack of evidence and describing her as “suicidal in nature”.  In a statement, the special Central Bureau of Investigation court, where the case was heard, said: “The available evidence reflects that the deceased was a victim of her sentiments. She could not overcome the emotions. The deceased could have always walked out of the relationship. However, she could not overcome her sentiments and her love for the accused, for which the accused cannot be held responsible.”  Bollywood actor Suraj Pancholi was acquitted of charges of abetting Ms Khan’s suicide late last month, ten years after her death (Photo: Sujit Jaiswal/AFP via Getty Images)  Her family has furiously disputed the court’s claims and maintains that she was murdered. Her mother, Rabbiyah Khan, told i : “This case was on the wrong track from the very beginning. It should have been an investigation of murder.  “The inequality and injustice that we have experienced through court is horrific.”  Rabbiyah accused the police and courts of “sweeping Jiah’s death under the carpet” and failing to investigate unexplained injuries revealed during a post-mortem examination.  “My daughter did not have suicidal tendencies. She was much loved by her family. She had everything to live for and was planning a new life away from the film industry. The police and courts built up a narrative to suit their own purpose,” she said.  “They conveniently followed a pre-determined theory of suicide. It was like reverse engineering to show the desired outcome and get the deal done.”  Mr Pancholi has always strongly denied any involvement in Ms Khan’s death and now plans to resume his career which has been overshadowed by the case.  The 32-year-old said in a statement: “The verdict has taken ten long painful years and sleepless nights. I have not only won this case against me but I have also won my dignity and confidence back. It took a lot of courage to face the world with such heinous allegations.  “I hope that nobody goes through what I have gone through at such a young age, I don’t know who will give these 10 years of my life back to me, but I am glad that this has finally come to an end.”  Rabbiya says she now plans to take the case to the high court.

Korea’s Rate  The Economist has reported that the suicide rate in South Korea recently began to reverse a yearslong decline on the back of increasing suicides among young women.    The British weekly said on Monday that after trending downward for a decade, the country’s suicide rate began rebounding from 2018.    The report said the increase reflects the higher rate of suicide among women. Although men continued to die by suicide at a higher rate than women, the raw total did not increase.    The weekly found that South Korea’s suicide rate for women under 40 was particularly high compared to 17 other countries that were willing to share data with the magazine.    The statistics showed that between 2018 and 2020, the rate in South Korea rose from an average of 13-point-six per 100-thousand women to 16, while the average of the 17 other nations rose from four-point-six to just four-point-seven during the same period.    The report said that one cause for the spike may be “the increasingly contradictory expectations forced on women” in South Korea, noting that they face workplace discrimination and homemaking expectations despite excelling in the nation’s highly competitive education system.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd29ybGQua2JzLmNvLmtyL3NlcnZpY2UvbmV3c192aWV3Lmh0bT9sYW5nPWUmU2VxX0NvZGU9MTc3OTk10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Big changes are afoot in the superhero world, with Guardians of the Galaxy legend James Gunn departing Marvel to helm the new era for the DCU, which is set to be a full reboot of the established DCEU, alongside Peter Safran.  This is far from the filmmaker’s first outing with DC, having directed The Suicide Squad and the Peacemaker TV series, which allowed Gunn to apply his distinct voice to the long-running franchise.  Article continues after ad  With plenty of new projects in the pipeline, Dexerto caught up with a star from The Suicide Squad about Gunn’s takeover and where she’d like to see her character go next.  The Suicide Squad star wants Amanda Waller team-up in any DCU movie  Dexerto spoke with Alice Braga – who played the rebel leader Sol Soria in the Suicide Squad’s standalone sequel – ahead of the release of her latest movie, Robert Rodriguez’s Hypnotic.  When asked about where she’d like to see her character go next in the DCU, Braga replied: “I would love to see her meeting Viola Davis’ character [Amanda Waller]. That would be a very interesting combination, her and Viola together. I love that character so much.”  Article continues after ad  Given Soria’s success at the end of The Suicide Squad, it’s not out of the question that her arc could continue in a new DC property. And Braga’s hopes of a Waller team-up could come to fruition given that Gunn announced a new series based on Davis’ morally ambiguous Task Force X leader as part of his DCU slate.

Email Sign up  As for whether she’s spoken with Gunn about a potential follow-up to The Suicide Squad, Braga said: “I haven’t heard anything about The Suicide Squad 2, or a sequel to the film that we did. I would jump on board on anything with James, because he’s such a joy and such a brilliant director, a visionary.”  Article continues after ad  “James Gunn is seriously one of the nicest human beings I’ve ever met. And I’m a huge fan of his films, I think he’s a brilliant director,” she added. “As a DC comic fan, I was so happy that he jumped on board for that role, because I know how much he cares, how much he is a fan himself.  “I think he’s really going to bring it on for the fans, for the people who really appreciate these characters. And I think he’s going to do an amazing job.”  Article continues after ad  Hypnotic dropped in US cinemas on May 12, 2023, with a UK theatrical release set for May 26, 2023.

The Dewan Rakyat has passed the amendments to the Penal Code (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2023, by voice vote, to decriminalise attempted suicide, The Star reported.  Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Legal and Institutional Reforms) Ramkarpal Singh said the amendments, comprising of four clauses, are to delete Section 309 of Act 574, to remove attempted suicide as a criminal offence.  Ramkarpal said the existence of Section 309, a provision from the 19th century, saw criminalising suicide as an act of prevention.  Abolishing Section 309 of Act 574 is a stepping stone towards preventing attempted suicide in the country and reduces the stigma around the issue to help people to come out and seek the help they need.  Previously, Section 309 punished anyone who attempted suicide with up to a year’s imprisonment, a fine, or both, upon conviction.  Ramkarpal said in the latest study published in 2022, countries that have amended or repealed the law to not criminalise attempted suicide saw a decrease in suicide death rates, Malay Mail reported.  If an individual is imprisoned or faced with legal procedures, this action will delay healthcare assistance given to the individual and increase the risk of suicide for the individual. Until now, there is no evidence or scientific study that supports or proves that the law which criminalises attempted suicide can prevent such acts in society. Ramkarpal Singh, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Legal and Institutional Reforms)  Image: TRP File  Abetment of attempted suicide is also a criminal offence  The amendments also seek to recognize any abetment of attempted suicide by any individual as a criminal offence under Section 306 of Act 574.  Under Section 306, anyone who abetted someone’s suicide or attempted suicide faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine upon conviction.  The additional amendment includes making it a criminal offence for those who abet the suicide attempt of a child, a person of limited faculties, or a person in a state of intoxication under Section 305.  Ramkarpal said the amendments of Sections 305 and 306 would cover the action of cyberbullies found abetting or influencing the suicides of children, and those who were mentally disabled, as a criminal offence.  The decision would help protect victims from online bullying, which could lead to suicide.  The move to decriminalise suicide also sees the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)(No.2) 2023 and Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2023.  According to Malaysiakini, several opposition lawmakers raised concerns over whether the amendment had considered religious views and the legal framework used in other Muslim countries.  Ramkarpal said the legal frameworks of countries that still criminalise suicide such as Brunei, Qatar, and Emirates were studied.  He also mentioned that Pakistan had already abolished the criminalisation of suicide. Ramkarpal added that the Attorney-General Chambers had also engaged with the Federal Territory Mufti Department and Syariah authorities to decriminalise suicide attempts.

"suicide","2015-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:12:26","Perhaps I should be pleased that a prediction I made some years ago is coming true. Instead, I am horrified. I argued that legalising assisted suicide and / or euthanasia, far from liberating people to decide their own destinies, would reduce their autonomy. Indeed, it would promote the deaths of some vulnerable people while eroding individual freedoms, like the right to refuse medical treatment. Now a recent article in the Journal of Medical Ethics (JME), which has garnered a great deal of attention in the Canadian press, demonstrates my point all too well.  The article in question, written by two bioethicists at the University of Toronto – Kayla Wiebe, a PhD candidate in philosophy, and Amy Mullin, a bioethicist and professor of philosophy – tries to defend Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada’s now notorious euthanasia programme. (Euthanasia is the apt term, given that more than 99 per cent of Canada’s MAID deaths are by euthanasia administered by medical personnel, rather than by assisted suicide, which is initiated by the individual concerned.) The article tries to respond to the widespread criticism that Canada is ‘euthanising its poor’. MAID is currently made available to anyone with a condition or disability that they believe ‘cannot be relieved under conditions that they consider acceptable’. In practice, this has led many people who are poor and helpless to seek an assisted death as a means of escaping their problems. In 2024, the eligibility criteria for MAID will be expanded further to include people who suffer from mental-health problems alone.  The case of Amir Farsoud, a disabled man who applied for MAID last year because he was about to be made homeless, sparked an international outcry and led many people to reconsider their support for assisted dying. As one popular Twitter blogger based in Scotland, where assisted-dying legislation is being considered, said recently: ‘Canada has pretty much changed my mind about assisted dying. It’s absolutely terrifying.’ Wiebe and Mullin see no problem with cases like Farsoud’s. In fact, they argue that it is ‘unacceptable’ to force people to wait for improvements in their personal circumstances before accessing MAID. They also see MAID as a form of ‘harm reduction’, as a ‘“lesser evil” between two or more less than ideal options’.  The JME article tries to defend Canada’s euthanasia programme on the basis of personal autonomy. The article is worth reading not because it is convincing, but because it highlights just how confused and irrational the case for euthanasia has become. It also reveals some of the dangers that could lie ahead for Canada. To place the article in context, it is necessary to trace the history of legalised assisted dying in Canada. In 1972, the Canadian government repealed Section 241(b) of the criminal code, which prohibited suicide. However, 241(b) still provided that anyone who aids or abets a person in committing suicide commits an indictable offence. Section 14 similarly stated that no person may consent to death being inflicted on them.  In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously found that preventing someone from accessing assisted suicide would violate Sections 7 (the right to ‘life, liberty, and security of the person’) and 15(1) (equality) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, introduced in 1982. The court’s reasoning followed a case in British Columbia (Carter v Canada), which stated that the criminal code denied ‘equality to the physically disabled by criminalising a choice – the choice to end suffering through suicide – that is available to the able-bodied’. This is essentially an argument for the right to die when someone does not have the ability to kill themselves. Justice minister David Lametti repeated this argument last year.  In 2016, parliament – which accepted the Supreme Court’s decision – legalised both euthanasia and assisted suicide for the terminally ill. In 2021, Bill C-7 extended euthanasia beyond those who were dying after a Quebec court case found the stipulation of ‘reasonable foreseeability of natural death’ to be unconstitutional. The formal justification for all of these developments in Canada is the right to autonomy. But as the JME article reveals, this has only been possible by a radical redefinition of autonomy.  Of course, choosing MAID is not an expression of autonomy at all. Autonomy refers to an individual’s right or capacity to make free decisions for him or herself. But the final decision to grant MAID is made by doctors and the state, not by patients. Tellingly, despite their appeals to autonomy, the authors of the JME article insist that patients should not have the right to decline medical treatment. They use an example cited by feminist scholar Catriona Mackenzie, who writes on relational autonomy. Wiebe and Mullin state:  ‘Mrs H has cancer, has had part of a leg amputated, and her husband has left her due to her disability and regards her as an embarrassment. Mrs H, as described by Mackenzie, has lost all sense of self-worth, does not trust herself, and does not want any of the treatment options her medical team proposes. She wants to die. We agree with Mackenzie’s suggestion that Mrs H as so described is not fully autonomous. However, the judgement that she is not autonomous is grounded in the fact that in this particular case, we have an agent who lacks self-trust, has no self-worth and has evidently lost engaged hope.’ Using what can only be described as tortuous logic, Wiebe and Mullin have decided that those who seek death – who, almost by definition, have no self-worth and have plainly lost hope – should always be considered autonomous. This is because they are said to be making an active choice to be killed. Poor Mrs H, on the other hand, is told she lacks the ‘engaged hope’ of those demanding MAID. Therefore, the authors argue, she should not even be allowed to refuse medical treatment – a basic tenet of bodily autonomy and a well-established right in almost all areas of the world.  Instead, Wiebe and Mullin recommend ‘interventions’ aimed at increasing Mrs H’s ‘sense of hope, such as putting her in contact with people successfully coping with a diagnosis like her own’. This, they assert, is totally different from the cases of homeless and disabled people who seek death through euthanasia. Referring to those outrages, the authors ask: ‘Does this mean they think their own lives are not worth living because of their disability, while more abled lives are? We answer no.’ Ironically, the authors even condemn arguments that Canada should provide better palliative care and services for disabled and ill people rather than euthanising them: ‘This type of argument appears to us to licence paternalistically overriding the decisions of competent people whose suffering has led them to choose to die with medical assistance in order to make instrumental use of their suffering.’ Then they have the cheek to say that arguments for better service provision are ‘insensitive to the… very real suffering of people requesting MAID, and… therefore unsupportable, no matter how noble the cause’.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwaWtlZC1vbmxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvdGhlcmUtaXMtbm8tanVzdGlmaWNhdGlvbi1mb3ItZXV0aGFuaXNpbmctdGhlLXZ1bG5lcmFibGUv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3Bpa2VkLW9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi90aGVyZS1pcy1uby1qdXN0aWZpY2F0aW9uLWZvci1ldXRoYW5pc2luZy10aGUtdnVsbmVyYWJsZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The authorities responded to the scene in Wallace in northern Idaho at about 8.30pm on Wednesday, Shoshone County Sheriff Holly Lindsey said in a Facebook post.  The bodies of Elizabeth Lawley, 33, and her two-year-old son were found at the residence.  Both had gunshot wounds, and according to a preliminary investigation, Ms Lawely likely shot and killed the child before dying by suicide, the sheriff said.  “Speaking honestly, in my 19 years of service for Shoshone County, I’ve never seen the SCSO so somber, so devastated; we shared a lot of hugs, and we shared a lot of tears,” Sheriff Lindsey wrote. “Today was an extremely difficult day for the family, for our office, and for this community. And I can only imagine what the family is going through.”  “As the Sheriff, I’m obligated to share the news with the citizens of Shoshone County, but I can’t in good conscience put the family through any more pain by reporting on this incident any further, so this will be our last comment pertaining to this tragedy,” the sheriff added.  The small town of Wallace is located in northern Idaho near the Montana border and east of Coeur d’Alene.  After arriving at the home, the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office asked for help from the Idaho State Police to go through the scene and launch the investigation, according to the Coeur d’Alene Press.  Ms Lawley’s father came back to his house at about 6pm on Wednesday, thinking that his daughter and grandson were napping in one of the rooms. As the night went on, he eventually went to check on them, finding them dead.  The house in Idaho where a mother and her son were found dead (Google Maps)  Law enforcement said Ms Lawley was six months pregnant at the time of her death. Her father isn’t considered to be a suspect.  The authorities stayed at the home until the early morning as they processed the scene after getting a search warrant.  Shoshone County Captain Jeff Lee said the evidence collected strongly suggests that it was a murder-suicide.  “Not only the community, but the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office is extremely saddened and shocked at the incident,” the captain said, according to the Coeur d’Alene Press. “We are continuing the investigation and awaiting the complete processing of all of the evidence, as well as the medical examiner’s report and all of their findings.”  Ms Lawley’s family has been made aware of the tragic incident, and out of respect for the privacy of the family, the name of the child will not be made public.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvY3JpbWUvZWxpemF2YmV0aC1sYXdsZXktaWRhaG8tbXVyZGVyLXN1aWNpZGUtYjIzNDM0NDEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Samantha Joseph was devastated when her aunt Gail died by suicide.  “She was a giant – everything she did really had magic.” she told 7NEWS. “Losing her to suicide was so painful.”  A publicist and comedy division manager who worked with the cast of “Friends” and “Will and Grace,” Gail Joseph was a titan in the comedy business and also very close to her niece when she died in Nov. 1999 at age 39.  For years, Samantha searched for answers.  “Really trying to piece together as much information as I could about what might have happened or how much pain she was in that we really didn’t understand,” she explained.  She said the journey to healing has been a long one and took her all across the U.S.  “The ‘why?’ haunted me for many years. It took me to California to meet her friends – to this situation where I was seeking out people who knew her, including some of the celebrities she worked with like David Schwimmer,” she described.  Joseph said her aunt had a special relationship with Schwimmer and she wanted to know more about the friendship they shared.  “He gave me the gift not only of talking about her, but of thanking me for the opportunity to remember her,” she recounted. “Those words really stayed with me, that it meant something to him.”  And through heartache, Joseph has found hope. She’s now the Chair of the Board of Directors at Samaritans Inc., an organization that provides lifesaving suicide prevention services in Massachusetts.  It also offers grief support services for people who know someone who died by suicide.  Joseph says it’s important that families and friends never blame themselves for the loss of a loved one.  “What Samaritans really tries to do is a pathway out of that guilt – a chance to say you did everything you could, you loved with your whole heart, and that’s not yours to hold any more,” she said.  Going forward, Joseph plans to keep fighting the stigma around suicide by telling her aunt’s story. And she encourages others to do the same.  “We’re all suffering alone because we’re afraid and there’s so much stigma around suicide and suicide loss that I think everyone of us can help do something, just a little something to help break that stigma by having those conversations,” she said.  If you or someone you know is struggling, help is available. Call the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 9-8-8. Help is available 24/7.

LISTEN NOW: Dr. Jill Harkavy Freidman discusses ways to reach out to someone who may be struggling  “I think what many people may not realize, is when somebody is struggling with their mental health… that experience is very isolating,” said Dr. Marshall. “In fact, they may even believe that other people don’t want to hear about it or that they’re a burden to other people. It’s why it’s really important that those of us that notice things reach out and reach in.”  She continued, “to not let those things you’re noticing in your friend that’s acting differently or withdrawing, or even talking in ways that they sound very hopeless — to really not be afraid to ask them how they’re doing with their mental health. And if you’re worried about suicide, not being afraid to ask them directly if they’re having thoughts of suicide. You won’t put the thought in their head, in fact they’re more likely to feel heard and feel somebody recognizes the emotional pain that they’re in.”  Dr. Friedman acknowledges it can be a lot easier said than done to have these conversations, but it’s important to know, it’s more common than we think for individuals to have suicidal thoughts.  “It’s uncomfortable, but it’s really important,” she stated. “It’s normal to have feelings, it’s not unusual to think about suicide. We know that more than half of people have been affected by suicide loss, so we really want to have those conversations.”  Listen to your favorite music now on Audacy and keep up with artists creating music focused on feeding the mind with the I’m Listening Mental Health Mix  To hear more about initiating those conversations, how to find help for yourself, or more information surrounding mental health, check out the above interviews with Dr. Doreen Marshall and Dr. Jill Harkavy Freidman.

(Herald DB)  Sin Chang-won, Korea's most famous fugitive, has attempted to take his own life but was not in critical condition, according to the Justice Ministry on Monday.  Sin, 56, was found by a correctional officer while attempting to commit suicide in Daejeon Prison at around 8:15 p.m. Sunday. After resuscitation, he was immediately transferred to an unnamed hospital nearby.  Sin was admitted to the intensive care unit, but is able to breathe without mechanical assistance, the ministry said.  It was Sin's second suicide attempt after one in August 2011.  Serving a lifetime behind bars since 1989 for armed robberies involving a murder, Sin gained nationwide attention after he escaped prison in Busan in January 1997. He remained on the run for 2 1/2 years despite a nationwide manhunt by police. To escape, Sin forced himself to lose weight until he was able to fit through an air ventilation shaft in the cell's bathroom.  After having traveled over 40,000 kilometers across the country, Sin was captured by law enforcement in July 1999 in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province. The escape from prison cost him an additional sentence of 22 1/2 years.  While on the run, Sin was found to have committed over 100 thefts, five burglaries and one rape. About 50 police officers were disciplined for failure to arrest Sin.

"suicide","2018-10-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T19:09:00","The last several years have been exhausting for the parents of Brandon Caserta, who died by suicide at Naval Air Station Norfolk in 2018.  “He just has helped people almost from birth,"" said Teri Caserta, Brandon’s mother.  ""He loved life. He loved people. He loved to help people.""  Brandon left texts saying he had been bullied and harassed by his command. The sailor’s final notes say he wanted to help others in similar situations, so his family pushed for the law, which makes it easier for sailors to ask for help, even when their command is reluctant.  “If you invoke the Brandon Act, you get to go attend to whatever your problem is immediately, and the command needs to help you with it,"" said Patrick Caserta, Brandon's father. ""So if you don't have an appointment or can't get one, they need to get you one and ensure that you're going.  Congress passed the law in 2021. Caserta’s parents are frustrated that the Pentagon is just now implementing the new rules across all services. Each branch has a higher suicide rate than the general public.  Though the law spells out that commands are responsible for getting help for service members quickly, that doesn’t mean help is always available. The Navy told Congress last May that half its Deployed Resiliency Counselor positions were unfilled.  All of the services are struggling to find mental health providers, said Father William Waff, who runs the Military Chaplains Association. Waff is a retired Army major general who worked as a hospital chaplain before he retired.  “Everybody wants a mental health professional, and the number one person that the VA is recruiting for are mental health professionals,"" Waff said. ""The branches of the military are doing the exact same thing.""  The services are trying to fill the gap with chaplains, who are used to playing a spiritual and wellness role. Over the years they have been given more mental health training, but not enough to be licensed in mental health. Their job is to mainly alert medical staff when they notice a change in behavior among a soldier or crew member, Waff said.  “You will not be a therapist. You will not be a counselor,” Waff said. “Basically, you’re providing an awareness that there are some things that would be indicators for a referral to a mental health specialist.”  Even finding chaplains is tough. The Air Force wants more chaplains to deploy forward with units. The Navy estimates it will need an extra 70 to 90 chaplains to fulfill its plan to put chaplains on every destroyer.  Obtaining mental health care often isn't much easier for service members who pursue options outside the military.  In Norfolk, only one private mental health practice is dedicated to active duty clients.  “There's to me nothing more rewarding than working with active duty,” said Greg Lemich, who runs the practice. But he adds that private providers often have a full client list and are put off by the paperwork associated with TriCare, the military’s insurance program.  Clinicians in the provide sector also may be unprepared for the schedules of service members. Lemich, for instance, said his office sees an influx of new clients whenever an aircraft carrier arrives in Norfolk.  And military personnel often have particular stressors of military life, such as combat related injuries and other issues.  “Military sexual trauma is unfortunately something that we see quite a bit,"" Lemich said. ""People who are on board a ship and somebody who they know commits suicide is something which can be very devastating,”  The root cause of suicide is elusive. Around Norfolk, nine sailors died in a little over a year when they were assigned to shore duty or their vessels were in the shipyard. Cmdr. Michael Siedsma, the captain of the submarine Massachusetts, which is under construction at Newport News, acknowledges the challenge for the crew.  “It's certainly a big stressor for them. If you sign up for the Navy to go to sea and see the world and visit foreign ports, and that foreign port is Newport News, Virginia, that maybe is not what you would count on. It can be tough for some of those folks,” Siedema said.  His philosophy is to engage with sailors and keep the crew busy and motivated. He said the Navy has improved living conditions at shipyards in recent months.  The Pentagon officially rolled out the Brandon Act May 5. The services have 45 days to create policies for implementing the new law for all active duty troops. The law will then be extended to reserve and National Guard troops after another 45 day window. The Defense Health Agency plans to train commanders how to refer troops to mental health treatment and promote the policy among service members, with the goal of lessening the stigma of seeking treatment.

"suicide","2022-09-22","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T02:24:00","May is National Mental Health Awareness month and the administration of a relatively new state program, called Live On, which aims to help those suffering with their mental health is encouraged by the first-of-its-kind program.  Alison Foust is Live On’s suicide prevention program administrator. She explains it’s a partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and many private donors who felt suicide prevention is something that should be talked about.  “They all came to the table and funded this campaign. But essentially, this is a campaign that teaches people warning signs for suicide, what to look for, and then how to have those really hard conversations once you recognize that somebody might be struggling,” Foust said.  The program launched shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in May of 2020. She said the Live On Playbook was created when someone helped save a friend who was thinking of ending their own life.  “And his quote was, 'There's no playbook for this.' I had no idea what to do,” she said. “All I did was love this person and just be there with them. And so Live On Utah really used that story to drive the idea of the playbook and said, why isn't there a playbook? We need to teach people what to do in these situations.”  Then in September 2022, Live On launched its training via social media.  “We launched the world's first suicide prevention training, delivered entirely through Instagram for free,” Foust said. “So, if you follow Live On Utah on Instagram, in less than an hour, you can become a suicide prevention ambassador and learn the warning signs for suicide and how to lead others to help.”  The training includes videos with people sharing their stories and mental health experts on the platform to explain how to recognize warning signs and what resources exist in Utah.  “We say the word course, but it's honestly like you're flipping through an Instagram post. So, it's very unique and very user friendly,"" she said. ""You can take each lesson in less than 10 minutes.”  In addition to educating people on suicide prevention, Foust said they will focus on the importance of locking up firearms and prescription medications to help reduce suicide risk.  Half of the suicides in Utah involve firearms and 85% of all firearm deaths in Utah are suicides.  “So those are significant statistics that tell us if we can just temporarily remove these firearms from people when they are struggling with thoughts of suicide, we can potentially save a life,” she said. “And this isn't Live On doing this. This is Live On teaching friends and family members to do this with their own networks. This doesn't have to be a government mandate. This can be something we all do together in our personal lives.”  The program is being rolled out this year to include a Spanish version of the playbook as well as one for members of the military.  If anyone is struggling with thoughts of self-harm, they can call 988 24/7 and speak to a trained crisis worker.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtwY3cub3JnL3BhcmstY2l0eS8yMDIzLTA1LTIyL25ldy1wcm9ncmFtLWdpdmVzLXV0YWhucy10b29scy10by1oZWxwLXRob3NlLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctd2l0aC1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2022-09-20","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T20:59:36","CA to Pay $300K After Trying to Force Religious Doctors to Assist with Suicides  The state of California will no longer force doctors to participate in physician-assisted suicide against their religious convictions and professional ethics after settling a lawsuit brought by a Christian physician and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations (CMDA).  As part of the settlement, California state officials agreed not to enforce ""any criminal or civil punishment, including professional discipline or licensing sanction for a California-licensed physician's refusal or failure to"" document a request, refer, or assist a patient in any way with ending his or her life. The state will also pay $300,000 for attorneys' fees and legal costs.  As CBN News reported in February of 2022, attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) a religious rights law firm, representing Dr. Leslee Cochrane, M.D., and the CMDA filed their lawsuit, Christian Medical & Dental Associations v. Bonta, against the state.  California first legalized physician-assisted suicide in 2015 with the passage of the controversial End of Life Option Act or SB 380. It was signed into law by then-Governor Jerry Brown (D). The law allows an adult diagnosed with a terminal disease, who meets certain qualifications, to request aid-in-dying drugs from their attending physician.  According to court documents, despite the medical ethics consensus that no physician should be forced to participate in physician-assisted suicide even where the practice is allowed, California recently legislated to not only eliminate important safeguards from the End of Life Options Act but also to force conscientious physicians to participate in the process.  In an emailed statement to CBN News in February of 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta's press office said, ""SB 380 reduced the waiting period for terminally ill individuals who have chosen to end their life via medication prescribed by participating health care providers. The Attorney General will continue to enforce and defend the law.""  Then last September, a federal district court ruled that the law likely violated the First Amendment rights of religious medical professionals and halted enforcement of the law while the lawsuit proceeded.  ""(N)on-participating providers are compelled to participate in the (End of Life Option) Act through this documentation requirement, despite their objections to assisted suicide,"" U.S. District Judge Fernando Aenlle-Rocha of Los Angeles wrote in his ruling granting the CMDA a preliminary injunction.  Rather than appealing Aenlle-Rocha's ruling, state officials agreed not to enforce the recording and referral requirements against objecting physicians, and also agreed to pay the physicians' group $300,000 for attorneys' fees and legal costs, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.  ""Our clients seek to live out their faith in their medical practice, and that includes valuing every human life entrusted to their care. Participating in physician-assisted suicide very clearly would violate their consciences,"" said ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot. ""This is a significant victory for religious and conscientious physicians in California. The government can't force any health care professional to act against his faith or medical ethics.""  As part of the settlement, the parties agreed to a stipulated judgment that was entered last week by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  **Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**  CMDA is a national association of conscientious Christian healthcare professionals whose personal religious convictions and professional ethics oppose the practice of assisted suicide. Dr. Cochrane, a member of CMDA, is a California-licensed physician who joined the lawsuit.  Catherine Short of the Life Legal Defense Foundation, one of more than 3,500 attorneys allied with ADF, is serving as local counsel in the case.  Last month, ADF attorneys favorably settled a similar federal lawsuit in New Mexico on behalf of CMDA and a Christian doctor in Lacy v. Torrez.

Doctors say that, as of now, at least 580 protesters have lost one or both eyes in Tehran and in Kurdistan alone. But the actual numbers across the country are much higher. The report concluded that such actions by the security forces could constitute a “crime against humanity,” as defined by Article 7 of the Rome Statute.  IranWire has explored this question more deeply in an interview with Professor Payam Akhavan, a prominent human rights lawyer, special advisor to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and a former member of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  IranWire is aware of more than 50 serious eye injuries sustained by protestors and bystanders over the past five months. With the help of independent ophthalmologists, we have reviewed the medical records of around a dozen individuals and compiled a comprehensive medical report.  In the series of reports “Blinding as a Weapon,” IranWire presents the victims’ stories told in their own words. Some have posted their stories, along with their names and pictures, on social media. Others, whose real names shall not be disclosed to protect their safety, have told their stories to IranWire, which can make their identities and medical records available to international legal authorities and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  This is the story of Artin, a tattoo artists who had just turned 18 when he lost an eye during mourning ceremonies held for victims of the repression. He lived in sheer isolation for several months after being shot, lost all hope and even attempted suicide. But he stood up again.  “I often try to hide my feelings, but I forget that my eye reveals everything,” he wrote on an Instagram post on his 19th birthday.  Artin was successful in his work as a tattoo artist, sold his own paintings, took guitar classes and prepared to take university entrance exams. But everything changed on November 17, 2022, when he lost an eye and his job, stopped studying and painting.  “Everything was going fine until they robbed me of my eyesight.”  November 17, 2022, Sanandaj  That day, Artin attended mourning ceremonies marking the 40th day since the death of three protesters -- Yahya Rahimi, Payman Manbari and Dariush Alizadeh -- at a cemetery in Sanandaj, Kurdistan province's capital.  After security forces started firing teargas at the large crowds of mourners, Artin and his friends took shelter in a neighborhood behind the cemetery. After a few hours they set out to return home, but security forces riding motorcycles and wearing black uniforms and masks fired at protesters who were blocking the streets.  Suddenly Artin's head and body were filled with pellets and he fell to the ground. A few minutes later he stood up and realized that his left eye had gone dark.  Artin was using contact lenses. The lens in that eye broke and tore his eyeball. A pellet also lodged in that eye. A young woman of his neighborhood took him to her home where the shredded lens was taken out. Artin was then transported to a hospital.  From Sanandaj to Tehran  Artin was taken to Sanandaj’s central hospital, where his eye was cleaned. Medical staff said they could not do anything else. Artin’s stepfather put him in his car and took him to Tehran. Eight hours later, Artin was finally hospitalized. After tests and a CAT scan, he was sent to the operating room. The pain in his injured left eye was so excruciating that he could not open his right eye.  Artin underwent three eye surgeries over a period of three days. Doctors stitched his eye, removed the pellet and injected silicon oil into it because the retina had been displaced. The young man had to sleep on his belly for some time so that the retina would not get detached.  He has been living by himself for years. After his father left his family, his mother remarried, and Artin packed a bag and left at the age of 16.  After the surgeries, Artin returned from Tehran and for two months slept on his belly, alone and in silence. He was in pain. The pain had lingered in his neck, his teeth and even his gums. The only thing that he could do was to sit on a chair while holding down his head and play with his mobile phone.  During that time, he himself removed tens of pellets from his body.  Despair and Suicide Attempt  Before his eye was shot, Artin worked as a tattooist. A few months earlier he had bought books to prepare for university entrance exams. He wanted to continue his education in arts. Four times a week he also attended painting and guitar classes. Artin has a diploma in chiaroscuro, a style of painting that uses strong contrasts between light and dark.  But when he was shot, he turned his back to everything, including himself. And Artin had to reimburse his stepfather half the cost for his treatment and hospitalization.  “Becoming blind is worse than death,” he thought.  One night, Artin took eight sheets of pills and swallowed them one by one. But at the last moment, he became terrified and called a friend. Artin survived.  Returning to Life  These days, Artin found some support in meeting with other victims who have been blinded. Sharing each other’s pain has opened the doors to a new world.  During this time, Artin has worked at different jobs to make a living, including as a car washer and plasterer.  Artin’s left eye has no sight. When he looks left, the world is black and when he looks right everything is blurred. And the eye cannot distinguish between colors.  However, he has resumed his friendship with his guitar, and his love for tattooing is now stronger than the desire to go to the university.  In his Instragram post written on the 100th day since losing his eye, Artin said that when he was feeling that his life had been destroyed he went to his tattoo master who introduced him to Mariusz Kedzierski, a Polish painter who was born without arms.  He wrote that he practiced day and night until he succeeded in re-establishing the harmony between his nerves and his muscles. He ended his post by declaring, “Now, I'm not sorry but very content.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2lyYW53aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9ibGluZGluZy1hcy1hLXdlYXBvbi8xMTY3ODMtYmxpbmRpbmctYXMtYS13ZWFwb24tMzktcmlzaW5nLWFnYWluLWFmdGVyLWxvc2luZy1hbGwtaG9wZS1hdHRlbXB0aW5nLXN1aWNpZGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A popular influencer who goes by the name Hotboy Chuckie on Instagram and Purplereignera Chuck on Twitter recently committed suicide, after posting what appears to be a suicide note and video on social media.  The exact date of his apparent suicide is not exactly known, but many of his fans commented about his death on May 20. It was stated on social media that a friend found the father of two young boys dead of what seemed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The influecer’s name and exact age are also unknown.  Suicide deaths occur across the lifespan and have increased for Black youth as well, along with other racial and ethnic minorities, according to Rheeda Walker, professor of psychology and director of the University of Houston’s Culture, Risk and Resilience Lab.  The highest rate of death is among Black Americans aged 25-34, said Walker, who recently conducted research on the suicide rate by Black people.  “Unfortunately, Black men often suffer in silence,” said therapist Nettie Jones, MS, LPC. “They don’t seek the help that sometimes women will reach out to get. We’ll call our girlfriends, let them know that things are not okay. But, unfortunately, Black men tend not to do that. They hold things in; they self-medicate, and they are workaholics.

"suicide","2020-01-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T01:41:15","The parents of a suicidal Black teenager who was fatally shot by police in Sparks, Nevada have agreed to a $2 million settlement with the city  SPARKS, Nev. -- The parents of a suicidal Black teenager who was fatally shot by police in 2020 in Nevada have agreed to a $2 million settlement with the city of Sparks that also includes more crisis intervention and mental health training for police officers.  The city of about 110,000 on the edge of Reno said in a statement Monday it hopes the agreement helps bring “closure” to all parties.  Miciah Lee, 18, Sparks, had no criminal history and was not wanted for any crime when a white officer shot him five times while he was sitting in his car with a handgun between his legs and his hands in plain sight on Jan. 5, 2020, his family's lawyer, Terri Keyser-Cooper, said.  But she said Lee did have a long history of mental illness and drug abuse, and that the officers' rush to violence defied any limited training they had received to diffuse such confrontations.  Lee's mother, Susan Clopp, called 911 shortly before the shooting and told the dispatcher three times her son was “mentally unstable,"" had a gun and intended to ”die by cop or die by himself.""  One of the officers who responded to the scene after Lee fled an initial attempt to confront him and crashed in a suburban neighborhood said in an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court last year before the settlement talks that they “did everything they were trained not to do with mentally ill persons.”  A federal judge ordered mediation and the parties said last month they had reached a settlement. The city's insurance company completed the final installment of the $2 million in payments on May 18, lawyer Keyser-Cooper said.  “The size of this settlement speaks volumes,” said Keyser-Cooper, who alleged Lee would still be alive if he was white.  “I am greatly encouraged that Sparks has promised to provide to its officers more training, with oversight to ensure officers act pursuant to their training, and a tragedy like this will not occur again,” she said in a statement late Friday.  As part of the settlement, Keyser-Cooper said Sparks agreed that all officers will receive 40 hours of Crisis Intervention Training and that each year all Sparks police officers will receive refresher training.  In addition, each officer will receive annual training on some additional new policies which include: Use of Force, Suicidal Subject Response, and Interacting With Persons Suffering From Behavioral Health Issues, she said.  The city of Sparks confirmed in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Monday that the city's insurance carrier hired outside counsel to handle the case and that the parties agreed to settle it for $2 million during a settlement conference in Las Vegas.  “The City of Sparks is hopeful that all parties involved will get closure after this settlement,” the statement said.  About six months after the shooting, Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks cleared Sparks police of any wrongdoing. His office was not part of the civil case and declined comment on the settlement on Monday.  The lawsuit filed in 2022 said Lee's death was an unjustifiable homicide that resulted from a “police culture in Sparks” — a “police department so poorly trained that it had a history of failing to investigate, analyze, or even talk to any officers involved in any police shootings for the past 15 years.”  The lawsuit also alleged the Sparks Police Department failed to sufficiently train officers on how to interact with the mentally ill and systematically, failed to de-escalate as required when interacting with the mentally ill.  Former Sparks Police Chief Peter Krall testified that responding officers knew what they were required to do and their conduct in failing to utilize their training was an “aberration.”  “However, it was anything but an aberration: It was a highly predictable consequence of system-wide failures,” Keyser-Cooper wrote in the original lawsuit.  “It is consistent with a pattern endemic in SPD — but also throughout the country—that, when encountering mentally ill persons, officers all too frequently choose violence as their first resort,"" she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2ZhbWlseS1zdWljaWRhbC1ibGFjay10ZWVuLWZhdGFsbHktc2hvdC1zcGFya3MtcG9saWNlLTk5NTIzMDU20gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2ZhbWlseS1zdWljaWRhbC1ibGFjay10ZWVuLWZhdGFsbHktc2hvdC1zcGFya3MtcG9saWNlLTk5NTIzMDU2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T19:53:00","Work-related suicides should be reported by employers and investigated by the safety watchdog amid concern that workplace stress is at “epidemic levels”, trade unions have said.  They fear the death of the primary school headteacher Ruth Perry, who killed herself while awaiting the outcome of an Ofsted report, shows that potentially fatal work-related stress is not confined to teaching.  The Trades Union Congress (TUC), Unison, the Public and Commercial Services Union and teaching unions are all backing a change in the law to allow the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate work-related suicides.  Under HSE rules, employers have a duty to report all deaths of their workers, with an exception for suicides – unlike other countries. In the UK the HSE cannot investigate any work-related suicide unless it receives a referral by a coroner.  Perry’s death prompted experts to call for a change in the law to allow it to launch an immediate inquiry into work-related stress in the education sector. An article in the British Medical Journal by Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and Prof Sarah Waters from the University of Leeds said there had been reports of at least eight other teacher suicides linked to Ofsted reports. But it said the true extent of the problem could not be known without an inquiry.  Trade unions have backed the call for a change in the law but say it should be broadened to include a duty on all employers to report work-related suicides.  The TUC’s Shelly Asquith, who leads on health and safety issues, said: “It is vital that work-related suicides are reported and investigated by the HSE.  “The tragic case of Ruth Perry is not an isolated one. Ofsted has been cited several times by inquests into educators’ deaths. Work-related stress is at epidemic levels. We cannot turn a blind eye to it.  “The HSE must be given the funding it needs to improve safety and wellbeing at work. That means reversing the swingeing cuts of the last decade.”  Unison and the PCS union are also backing the call. Jon Richards, an assistant general secretary at Unison, said: “Stress, bullying and harassment at work take a massive toll on the mental health of staff. The HSE should take account of the full impact of work on employees. That includes where workers tragically take their own lives.”  Prof Phil Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association, backed the call and said there was a “serious mental health crisis amongst healthcare professionals driven by huge levels of demand, the largest ever backlog of care and serious staffing shortages”.  He added: “The HSE must have the necessary resources and correct processes in place to ensure that they can effectively investigate and evaluate this in a way that can result in much-needed change within the healthcare system to ultimately help reduce the prevalence of work-related suicides.”  The National Association of Head Teachers praised the BMJ article as a “powerful intervention”. And in a tweet the National Education Union also welcomed it for “highlighting the urgency of the mental health crisis @Ofstednews is fuelling”.  McKee said: “Every suicide is a tragedy for the family and friends of the individual who loses their life. And if there are circumstances that could be tackled to prevent that happening we have a responsibility to do something about them.”  Jim McManus, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, stopped short of backing a change in the law, saying suicides were currently investigated by coroners.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIzL21heS8yMi93b3JrLXJlbGF0ZWQtc3VpY2lkZXMtc2hvdWxkLWludmVzdGlnYXRlZC13YXRjaGRvZy11bmlvbnMtc2F50gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzIyL3dvcmstcmVsYXRlZC1zdWljaWRlcy1zaG91bGQtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVkLXdhdGNoZG9nLXVuaW9ucy1zYXk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The training is free and will be offered virtually on June 6 and is open to any member in the community.  Through the Suicide Prevention Foundation, AAA7 staff have been trained to provide the community educational program QPR: Question, Persuade, and Refer. Much like the well-known CPR, the fundamentals of QPR are easily learned and applied through a short training which can be done virtually or online.  QPR, like CPR, functions as a “chain of survival,” allowing lay persons and professionals to respond to a life-threatening event: suicidal crisis. The training provides a booklet for each participant which becomes the resource to assist those experiencing suicidal thoughts and is an instrumental part of the training.  Teachers, coaches, local clergy, police officers and any community individual can learn the QPR method to help recognize signs and clues of suicidal behavior, how to approach and communicate with a person experiencing suicidal thoughts and where to refer them for assistance.  In Ohio, five people die each day by suicide. A report released by the Ohio University College of Health and Sciences in July 2020 found rural counties have higher incidences of suicide and less resources to treat mental health conditions in Ohio. Of Ohio’s 88 counties, 37 have above the United States average deaths from suicide. Adams, Gallia and Jackson Counties have 20 suicides per 100,000 individuals annually; Brown County has 18 per 100,000; Highland, Pike and Ross counties have 17 per 100,000; Scioto and Lawrence counties have 13 per 100,000; and Vinton County has 11 per 100,000. The Area Agency on Aging District 7 serves all 10 of these counties with a mission of providing resources and services for the area.  The session on June 6 will begin at 10 a.m., and the training will last a couple hours.

"suicide","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T02:39:56","In Norway, euthanasia is illegal and is defined in the law as either murder or assisted suicide. (Photo:Olga Kononenko / Unsplash)  THIS ARTICLE/PRESS RELEASE IS PAID FOR AND PRESENTED BY University of Oslo - read more  Researchers have recently examined the Norwegian population's attitudes towards the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide.  Euthanasia means that a healthcare professional intentionally causes a person's death. They do so by injecting a lethal drug at the person's request.  Assisted suicide is helping to cause a person's death by providing them with lethal meidcation that they can ingest themselves, at their request.  In Norway, euthanasia and assisted sucicide is illegal, and is defined in the law as murder or helping someone to commit suicide.  ""In recent years, several countries, including Spain and Austria, have legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide. It is therefore interesting to see what the Norwegian population thinks about this topic too,"" Morten Magelssen says. He is an associate professor at the Centre for Medical Ethics at the University of Oslo.  Annonse  The survey was initiated by the Medical Ethics Council. Researchers at the Centre for Medical Ethics at the University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, and NHH Norwegian School of Economics conducted the study.  The degree of support for legalisation varies  ""This is the most comprehensive study of Norwegians' attitudes towards the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide that has been conducted,"" Magelssen says.  In the study, researchers found that the degree of support for legalisation varies depending on the patient situation described in the survey.  The strongest support was found for physician-assisted suicide in cases of terminal illness with a short life expectancy.  Associate Professor Morten Magelssen at the University of Oslo. (Photo: Private)  ""Here, approximately one inthree strongly agreed and one in three slightly agreed with the legalisation of euthanasia. Around one in ten strongly disagreed and one in ten slightly disagreed. The age group of 30-44 years old was the most positive towards legalisation,"" Magelssen says.  Nuances in Norwegians' attitudes towards euthanasia and assisted suicide  ""As in previous studies, there was significant support for the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide, but in this survey, it was possible to grade the support from 'ssomewhat agree' to 'strongly agree'. This has allowed us to capture nuances in people's attitudes towards this topic,"" Magelssen says.  If the researchers combined those who 'strongly agreed' and 'somewhat agreed' to legalisation of physician-assisted suicide in cases of terminal illnesses with short life expectancy, seven out of ten individuals were in favor of legalising euthanasia and assisted suicide.  But is it reasonable to interpret that all of these individuals want legaisation?  ""It is unprecise to classify people who 'somewhat agree' as being 'in favor of euthanasia and assisted suicide',"" Magelssen says. ""Both those who 'somewhat disagree', 'somewhat agree', and those in the middle who answered 'I neither agree, nor disagree' can be said to have an unclear opinion on the issue of legalising euthanasia. They could be influenced by strong arguments from both sides of the debate.""  References  Aarseth et al.

(WATE) — Knox County Health Department released a report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs revealing that veterans account for 15 percent of all suicides in Tennessee.  A survey was conducted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to find out the state of veterans’ mental health throughout the nation. The report found that many veterans are struggling to adjust to civilian life, especially post-9/11 veterans or those who experienced combat.  In 2020, the suicide rate of Tennessee veterans was 39.9 per 100,000. The suicide rate in the Veteran Affairs Southern Region was 31.9.  Knox County veterans reported fewer days of poor mental health in the past month (4 days) compared to non-veterans (5.8 days) in 2018. Knox County is home to almost 29,000 military veterans which means they are 7.7 percent of the county population.  According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, three primary mental health concerns that people who serve in the military experience are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and traumatic brain injury.  In the report, about 11-20 percent of U.S. veterans experience PTSD compared to 4 percent of the general population. PTSD affects at least 25 percent of veterans with life-threatening war zone experience. 9 percent of all appointments in the outpatient military health network are related to depression.  27 percent of veterans overall say that re-entry into civilian life was difficult, according to the report. 44 percent of veterans who served after Sept. 11, 2001 report difficulty transitioning back to civilian life.  There are available resources for veterans in need of mental health services. There is TN Crisis Line at 855-274-7471. The Veteran’s Crisis Line, which can be accessed by dialing 988 and then pressing one. Coaching Into Care, another telephone-based support service, can be reached at 888-923-7458.  The other resources include the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, NAMI Homefront and William C. Tallent Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.  “Veterans and service members have unique experiences which are important to acknowledge when considering mental health,” said Dr. Corinne Tandy, division director of epidemiology at KCHD. “This report takes a look at the primary mental health concerns facing veterans and provides a list of resources for those in need of services.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3Mva25veC1jb3VudHktbmV3cy92ZXRlcmFucy1hY2NvdW50LWZvci0xNS1vZi1hbGwtc3VpY2lkZXMtaW4tdGVubmVzc2VlLXN1cnZleS1maW5kcy_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tub3gtY291bnR5LW5ld3MvdmV0ZXJhbnMtYWNjb3VudC1mb3ItMTUtb2YtYWxsLXN1aWNpZGVzLWluLXRlbm5lc3NlZS1zdXJ2ZXktZmluZHMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Bowie Police Chief Guy Green reported about 4:45 p.m. Monday the bare basics of the incidents as the investigation is only in its preliminary stage.  Incident one involved information from the county sheriff’s office about a man who was allegedly making threats of suicide and had a gun. Green said the man has children in local schools and there were concerns in case he came to school. The sheriff’s staff was able to find him out in the county and talk with him. He was unharmed and additional details will come later.  Incident two the chief said involved a middle-aged lady who was driving in the area of Farm-to-Market 1125 and Rock Hill Road when she was flagged down by a man who needed a ride. She stopped and picked him up, but once inside he reportedly began threatening her to drive or he would kill her. Green said based on the basic info he had at 4:45 p.m. Monday the male subject began hitting the female driver assaulting her.  “She was able to stop the car and when she did, he jumped out running toward the area near Murphy Express and Walmart. Officers were already over at the high school which had been locked down and some of them went to that area to search. Deputy Chase Pelton brought over K9 Ace and he was deployed to track down the suspect. K9 Ace and Pelton captured and placed him into custody without further incident,” said the chief.

"suicide","2019-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T21:14:42","Four years after a gay Black teenager in Alabama died by suicide following an onslaught of bullying at school, his mother said she finally feels as though she can almost breathe again, now that the civil litigation against her child’s school district has been settled.  Camika Shelby and Patrick Cruz, the parents of 15-year-old Nigel Shelby, settled a civil lawsuit against the Huntsville City Board of Education and the high school’s then-freshman principal, Jo Stafford in March. In her first interview since the settlement, Shelby said she now wants to focus on keeping the memory of her only child alive.  “Nigel was loved at home, but that wasn’t enough, obviously,” Shelby said. “I just want kids of the LGBTQ community, Black kids, all kids really to be able to go to school and feel comfortable and not feel closed in, alone, alienated.”  As a result of the $840,000 settlement reached in March, the Huntsville City Board of Education is required to implement a number of policies aimed at ensuring the safety and security of LGBTQ students in the district.  “First and foremost, we continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to Nigel’s family, friends and school community,” Huntsville City Schools superintendent Christie Finley said in a statement, according to WAFF News. “While we understand nothing can replace the life of a student, it is our hope that the settlement will bring a sense of peace and closure for all involved.”  Nigel Shelby died by suicide following an onslaught of bullying at school. GoFundMe  The agreement also calls for a districtwide electronic recording system where incidents of bullying can be monitored; the hiring of external consultants to advise on best practices and policies to investigate harassment; and the clarification of Title IX policies to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual expression. The board is required to provide Shelby’s counsel with annual reports for three years demonstrating compliance.  “These cases are not just about accountability. It’s also about trying to make a systemic change to change the culture of the school district,” said Adele Kimmel, Shelby’s lawyer and the director of Public Justice's students civil rights project. “That requires policy changes, training programs, climate surveys and then some way to make sure that all of these things are actually happening.”  Alabama’s anti-bullying policies do not include protections on the basis of sexual identity or gender orientation. As more state legislatures embrace policies that limit or bar gender-affirming care for transgender youth and other restrictive measures for LGBTQ youth, Kimmel said it was notable that an Alabama school district agreed to prohibit discrimination based on students’ sexual orientation, gender identity and sexual expression.  It is possible that future state legislation raises questions about the enforceability of this part in the agreement, Kimmel said, but the other protections of the agreement would remain in effect.  Nigel and concerned classmates approached school administrators about the harassment, which was happening both in school and online, according to the complaint. But, it was only after his death in April 2019 that his mother learned about the harassment her openly gay son had faced. Students allegedly told Nigel to kill himself repeatedly.  Nigel Shelby. via Facebook  Shelby alleged that her child’s concerns were being ignored, according to the civil complaint, and that at one meeting, Stafford told Nigel that bullying was the price he had to pay for being gay and for making “adult” posts on social media about his sexual orientation, according to the complaint.  Nigel’s peers also relayed worries over suicidal thoughts the student was expressing, the complaint said. Stafford allegedly downplayed the serious nature of the conversation, asking reportedly if this was “another one of his episodes where life is getting too hard and things get tough and we want to kill ourselves.”  Stafford and spokespeople for the Huntsville Board of Education did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Shortly after the settlement was reached, school board member Ryan Renaud said “moving forward, I think it’s a process of rigorous implementation and a plan of strategic implementation and working with our staff and administration to make sure that that implementation is consistent across the district.”  It’s a scary feeling, Shelby said, being alone. At 19, she got pregnant with Nigel and left her mother’s house, where she lived with five other siblings. After that, she always had Nigel.  “For the first time ever in my life, it’s actually just me.” The pain of his death is everlasting, she added, but the solitude has sparked a new chapter.  Shelby is working toward a bachelor’s degree in business administration. She is also planning to write a book that grapples with the raw emotions she felt upon discovering her son the day he died.  “I’m Nigel’s mom, but I’m also a person too,” she said. “I was his mom for so long that I forgot who I was outside of that.”  If you or someone you know is in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255, text HOME to 741741 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbmJjYmxrL25pZ2VsLXNoZWxieXMtbW90aGVyLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtYWxhYmFtYS1zY2hvb2wtcmNuYTg0NTA30gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvcmNuYTg0NTA3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Throughout her nonstop advocacy work, she has been puzzled by the fact that within the suicide prevention, intervention and postvention communities, more time, energy, and research funding has not been spent on engaging those who experienced ideation or an attempt and did not die by suicide? “Why don’t we do better follow-up? Who can better help inform all of us what coping skills and actions do work?” were questions she raised in a conversation between workshops at the recent Massachusetts Conference for Suicide Prevention.She continued, “We rarely, if ever, hear about the how and why that not only did ideation/attempt survivors lives change because they stayed and had life opportunities and experiences that they would not have had, but also how they were able to increase their own self-awareness, acknowledgement, and acceptance that they continue to make a positive difference in the lives of others by being here,” adding a reference to the George Bailey character in the 1946 Frank Capra film, It’s a Wonderful Life. “That film changed my life, Medeiros noted. “I began to see that I have had angels like the Clarence character in my life.”Taking a #BreakTheSilence and #BeTheOneTo approach, she began to write down what it is she has done and learned that influences her day to day intentional decision to choose to live life fully. The result is a new series of informal notebooks titled, Because I Stayed. The first volume was released on Amazon on May 21. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S7Q59C?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860 Volumes 2 and 3 will be released in June and July, respectively.Not unfamiliar with developing a movement within the suicide prevention field, Medeiros joined friend and mentor, Annemarie Matulis in 2014 to launch an Impacted Family & Friends Movement through their nonprofit A Voice at the Table. “We’re the little-engine-that-could in postvention,” co-founder Matulis said smiling. “So are these notebooks.” Both agree that there is no one-size-fits-all solution that ideation/attempt survivors can turn to, any more than suicide loss survivors can as they walk through their bereavement.Medeiros reflected that this is not an easy road to travel because “there is still so much prejudice, discrimination and judgement, but I hope this new series will motivate other ideation and attempt survivors to step up and be much louder about who they are and what more is needed for resources to make sure we stay. The goal is to prevent suicides. “Let’s get this Because I Stayed conversation going!”Tracey Pacheco Medeiros has a B.A. in Psychology, is a suicide attempt survivor, loss survivor and impacted family member; she is the co-founder of the grassroots, nonprofit Movement, A Voice at the Table/Impacted Family & Friends, she holds the Attempt Survivor/Lived Experience seat on the Executive Committee for the Massachusetts Coalition for Suicide Prevention (MCSP).

There are no murder suspects on the loose after two people died Friday at the scene of a camper fire just north of Gillette, Campbell County Sheriff Scott Matheny reports.  Authorities believe 56-year-old Patrick M. Mahoney shot Steven E. Hague, 59, in the upper left shoulder area so that the bullet struck Hague's aorta. Mahoney then apparently shot himself in the head. They both died.  But investigators are not yet saying what caused the fire engulfing Mahoney and the camper when police, fire, and emergency personnel arrived midday Friday.  Deputies found the murder scene when they responded at about 11:06 a.m. that day, to a camper fire on Midland Road just north of Gillette, Matheny told Cowboy State Daily on Monday.  First they found Hague, collapsed outside on the ground with a bullet wound near the blazing camper. Emergency personnel attempted CPR, said Matheny, but Hague was dead.  Blasting Projectiles  “Tiny explosions” sounded from the burning camper, from ammunition exploding in the fire, said Matheny. Deputies pulled Hague, who was outside, away from the fire while the rounds popped.  A body later found inside the camper “burnt beyond recognition” also had a bullet wound, the sheriff said.  Campbell County Coroner Paul Wallem said the body has now been identified as Patrick M. Mahoney, 56.  The two men had a landlord and tenant relationship, as well as an employer/employee relationship, said Matheny, who noted that Mahoney also had a criminal record.  Wallem said investigators are still contemplating the unique angle of the bullet into Hague's aorta.  ""(We're) trying to figure if he was bent over, or the shooter was from a heightened position - just trying to figure it out,"" said Wallem.  Police recovered several weapons from the camper, but they do not believe Hague was armed when he went into the conflict.  Both men's bullet wounds were from .308 caliber rounds, said Wallem.  No One’s Running  The sheriff’s office called both the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation crime lab and the arson investigation team to help with the investigation.  Matheny said there was no danger to the public at any time, as the conflict happened between the two men.  No neighboring structures suffered fire damage, Matheny said.  Wallem said toxicology reports are pending for both men, which is ""standard procedure"" but declined to comment on whether alcohol or drugs are apparent factors in the case at this point.

"suicide","2023-05-19","09:45:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T23:06:50","LAYTON — The events surrounding a triple-homicide Friday are starting to become clearer.  An affidavit of probable cause filed Friday evening in the 2nd District Court in Farmington stated that Jeremy Lake Bailey, 34, Layton, was charged with three counts of aggravated murder, three counts of felony discharge of a firearm and three counts of aggravated cruelty to animals.  Bailey is accused of shooting three people Friday morning: his wife, Anastasia Stevens, 36, plus her father, Donald Stevens, 73, and stepmother Becky Stevens, 61.  According to the affidavit, Bailey called the Layton Police Department at 9:45 a.m. Friday to report “there will be a murder suicide.”  “The suspect told dispatch that he has killed his wife, his father-in-law, and his mother-in-law, along with three of the four family dogs after engaging in a domestic violence incident with his wife,” the affidavit said. “The suspect confirmed the victims and dogs were dead multiple times while on the phone with Layton Police dispatch. The suspect estimated he had killed everyone approximately twenty minutes before calling Layton Police dispatch.  “He told Layton Police dispatch he had firearms which had been stored at friend’s garage because he was thinking of doing this a few days ago. Furthermore, the suspect stated he was armed with a Springfield 9mm firearm which had belonged to one of the victims and he had forgotten about it until May 19th, 2023.”  However, in spite of the proclamation of a murder-suicide, Bailey ended up surrendering to officers without incident as soon as they arrived at the home in the 1800 block of Gentile Street. Upon entry, authorities confirmed the deaths of the three victims and three dogs. A handgun, an open box of ammunition and two cellphones were discovered at the scene. During a search of Bailey’s truck, a receipt was found for the ammunition, which had been purchased less than an hour before the shootings were reported.  “The suspect was taken to the Layton City Police Department and placed into a secure holding cell,” the affidavit continued. “The suspect was video and audio recorded during this time. The suspect made an excited utterance: ‘I can’t believe I did it,’ while he was in a holding cell awaiting to be interviewed.”  The police filing adds that right around the time of the call to police, a post was made on one of the victims’ Facebook pages saying, “MASSACRE SUICIDE Jeremy Bailey JUST KILLED EVERYONE Becky Stevens Don Steven AND 3 OF THE 4 DOGS 1832 EAST GENTILE STREET LAYTON.”  “One of the victims had contacted a therapist earlier in the day and sent a message stating, ‘I think we may have a very real problem. So I uncovered the (mega) load of his shady s—. And it’s really bad. Like scary. I think it may be time for legal interference I know I definitely need to find an attorney and He’s still at the house so I can’t talk,'” the affidavit said.  Bailey was given food and water at the police station and requested the surviving dog not be sent to the pound. He reportedly also asked investigators about the death penalty and whether it was still carried out by a firing squad. He reportedly made an utterance that he’d rather get the death penalty than life in prison. Bailey asked for an attorney to be present before any questioning take place and was not questioned about the incident.  The affidavit said contact was also made with the friend who had taken possession of the firearms. The investigation is still ongoing.  On Saturday, an order to hold without bail was filed.

A friend of the family, Stacey Greenberg, wrote in the GoFundMe post to raise the funds to defray the cost of the funeral:  “Hello, this is Stacey a friend of Melissa and Mom to one of Nova’s close friends. No one should have to outlive their child, but Melissa has now experienced this twice. On Wednesday afternoon, 14-year-old Nova left this earth and found the peace and acceptance he was searching for.”  The New Hampshire Union Leader reported that Manchester School District Supt. Jenn Gillis sent an email to district families last Wednesday night that said in part: “It is with deep sadness that we inform you that one of our students has died unexpectedly.”  Gillis wrote that: “This loss may raise many emotions, concerns and questions for our entire school community, especially our students.”  Manchester School District spokesperson Andrew Toland, in a press statement, noted that counselors from other Manchester area schools and the state’s Disaster Behavior Health Response Team spent May 18 at the school “directly impacted” by the death.  “Our focus in the coming days and weeks is to be supportive of our students, families and staff,” said Toland.  Multiple sources alleged that bullying and transphobia factored into the death of the teen, although the Washington Blade has been unable to verify any of those claims.  In the past few months there has been considerable attention focused on trans youth nationally, particularly around school policies regarding trans youth health care and gender identity. Last month, New Hampshire Public Radio reported that the New Hampshire Supreme Court heard arguments in a case brought by a Manchester parent challenging school policies around trans and nonbinary students.  The parent says she was kept in the dark when her child began using a different name and identifying as a different gender at school — something the parent objected to, NHPR reported.  At issue is a district policy that says Manchester school staff generally shouldn’t disclose when a student identifies as trans or gender nonconforming without that student’s permission.  Republican New Hampshire lawmakers are rallying behind legislation that would force schools to disclose a student’s gender identity to parents when asked. The state House of Representatives narrowly rejected one such proposal last month, but another remains on the table after passing the state Senate along party lines.  Nova Dunn/Facebook  In an interview on Rated LGBT Radio with Rob Watson this past week, Lance Preston, founder and executive director of the Rainbow Youth Project USA, noted that the toxic legislative atmosphere had tripled calls for assistance to the RYP’s crisis counselors, as nearly 18 states have banned trans youth gender-affirming therapy for minors, and have also passed laws the forbid discussion of LGBTQ issues, history and people in classrooms.  Preston also pointed out that more than a half dozen states enacting measures, like New Hampshire’s proposed disclosure of a youth’s gender to parents, in cases of non-affirming households specifically places those youth at risk for suicide or leaving, oft times ending up living homeless on the streets.  At the beginning of this month, the nation’s leading suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ youth, the Trevor Project, released the results of its latest survey of queer young people ages 13 to 24.  The survey of 28,000 youth nationwide, conducted last fall, underscores the negative mental health impact of anti-LGBTQ legislation and policies. Among the key findings:  41 percent of LGBTQ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year — and those who are trans, nonbinary and/or people of color reported higher rates than their peers.  56 percent who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it.  LGBTQ young people who had access to affirming homes, schools, community events and online spaces reported lower rates of attempting suicide compared to those who did not.  Trans and nonbinary young people reported lower rates of attempting suicide when all of the people they live with respected their pronouns and/or they had access to a gender-neutral bathroom at school.  LGBTQ young people who experienced victimization because of their orientation or identity — including being physically threatened or harmed, discriminated against or subjected to conversion therapy — reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not have any of these anti-LGBTQ experiences.  Nearly 2 in 3 LGBTQ young people said that hearing about potential state or local laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school — also known as “Don’t Say Trans or Gay” laws — negatively impacted their mental health.

Corpus Christi Police Department Sr. Ofc. Shawn Barnes, the department’s crisis coordinator wants people who are contemplating suicide to know they have more options and choices than they think.    He said he received inspiration for the thought-provoking message from other cities who have found ways to improve how they handle mental-health emergencies after attending an international crisis intervention convention.    ""Made me think how many folks I've talked off our bridge, and felt like ‘Man, we could really use that if it might act as that trip wire for them,’ "" he said.      Barnes said it's been a long process turning this idea into a reality, but he was determined to get the signs up.    He partnered with different agencies who spearhead crisis intervention efforts such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness, better known as NAMI.    NAMI volunteer JD Leza knows what it's like to battle something alone, and said it’s important for folks to know there is help.    ""I heard Officer Barnes mention there would be eight of these signs,” he said. “Somebody is going to see it going forward, they're going to see the next one. It’s going to be a constant reminder to them that they are not alone, that there is help, there are resources. It doesn't have to be the end. It can be the start of something beautiful and glorious.”    The signs will be placed at the entrances to the bridge, as well as at the very top, and will feature national and local crisis numbers.    ""So people can call that number, get somebody here, locally, who can dispatch some of our local workers who are qualified mental-health professionals,” said Nueces Center for Mental Health and Intellectual Disabilities (MHID) Mental-Health Service Director Andrea Kovarik.  Kovarik said MHID can help a person experiencing suicidal thoughts get immediate help.    ""We've been able to have law enforcement dispatching, really partnered up and did a good job, increase our crisis services, a walk-in clinic,” she said. “When we do have someone in crisis, we can get them in to a doctor in 15 minutes which is unheard of.""  Everyone involved hopes the signs will get across to someone who needs support, the moment they need it.    ""Coming from someone who has been suicidal a few times in her life, I think it’s great,” said NAMI communications manager Heather Loeb. “It’s not so much dying you want to do – it’s the pain you want to get rid of, think it would stop me in my tracks.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWlpdHYuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWljaWRlLXByZXZlbnRpb24tc2lnbnMtdG8tYmUtaW5zdGFsbGVkLW9uLWhhcmJvci1icmlkZ2Utd2Fsa3dheS81MDMtOWUwYWE5MjctYTFkYS00NTRjLTk1MmMtZDM1OTAzNTkyYzU20gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpaWl0di5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWljaWRlLXByZXZlbnRpb24tc2lnbnMtdG8tYmUtaW5zdGFsbGVkLW9uLWhhcmJvci1icmlkZ2Utd2Fsa3dheS81MDMtOWUwYWE5MjctYTFkYS00NTRjLTk1MmMtZDM1OTAzNTkyYzU2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Honolulu"", ""Hawaii"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T01:38:00","HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Honolulu EMS is now responding to between 10 and 15 suicide attempts a day amid an alarming uptick that health officials say they’re watching closely.  Experts say youth and young adults are among those most at risk.  It’s a trend the Prevent Suicide Hawaii Task Force is taking seriously. Officials there say Hawaii’s young people are the most likely to try and kill themselves by suicide, specifically between the ages 10 and 24.  And over the past three months, Honolulu EMS has seen a dramatic increase in calls for self-harm and suicide attempts. “Pre-pandemic we might go on a couple of calls a day where people tried to hurt themselves or intentionally overdose. Now, it’s 10. Sometimes 15 a day,” said Honolulu EMS Director Jim Ireland.  If you or someone you know is in crisis, reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline 24/7 by calling or texting 988.  In the 20 minutes it took to do an interview with Ireland last Monday, ambulances were dispatched to two different attempted suicides: a man and a young woman. He confirms both tried to overdose on drugs.  Ireland says in addition to attempted suicides, the number of people who’ve taken their own lives is also on the rise.  “Not just taking pills or overdoses, but also people trying to hurt themselves in other ways. Traumatic injuries including the use of firearms, knives and other trauma,” he said. “It’s increasing and it’s concerning.”  According to officials from the Prevent Suicide Hawaii Task Force, youth and young adults are the age group most likely to try to hurt themselves.  “It can go 10, all the way up to 24,” said Jeanelle Sugimoto Matsuda, task force leadership committee member.  She said often the reason stems from a lack of connection.  “Whether that’s with a significant other or at home with mom or dad. Or lack their of,” Matsuda said. “But when they’re disconnected or when they’re in unhealthy relationships that really becomes a risk factor for them.”  Data from the Department of Health shows over the past four years, the no. 1 cause of death in Hawaii for people between the ages 15 and 44 was suicide.  During that same time period, officials say 10 children under the age of 14 took their own lives.  Experts say it’s a problem we should all be talking about.  “It’s just so important because everything around the issue, mental health, getting treatment is so stigmatized,” Matsuda said. “The more we shy away, the more we’re feeding into that stigma.”  When EMS responds to an attempted suicide call, medics usually insist the patient go to the hospital. “It’s the hope that the hospital’s team with their mental health experts can engage the patient and not only get them better from whatever they did to themselves, but also get them to a place where they’re not going to do it again,” Ireland said.  A resource that everyone should know about is Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Just dial or text 988 and you’ll be connected with a trained crisis counselor. They’re available to talk 24 hours a day.

"suicide","2022-04-12","Not Discerned","{""Newport"", ""RhodeIsland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T20:16:06","NEWPORT NEWS, Va. - The parents of a locally based Sailor who died by suicide are taking their fight to Washington to get the Navy to address housing for junior Sailors.  Xavier Sandor died by suicide while serving on USS George Washington in April 2022.  Military PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Navy releases report on deaths of USS George Washington (CVN 73) Sailors Jay Greene  ""It's to help every single Sailor that's going through the same thing our son was,"" said Mary Graft, his mother.  Sandor was just 19 years old when he took his own life on the ship with his Navy-issued gun.  ""It could've been preventable. They knew what was happening,"" his father John said.  Sandor's parents say he had been complaining about living on the ship and said there were a number of issues with it.  The Master at Arms worked the night shift and they say it wasn't easy to sleep during the day at the noisy shipyard. They say he often slept in his car.  ""Prisoners pretty much had it better than he did,"" John Sandor said.  Now, they're working with the U.S. Senators from Sandor's home state of Connecticut to have Congress pass a bill so junior Sailors can live in commercial housing if they're assigned to a ship undergoing extensive maintenance.  It would also increase the number of mental health counselors assigned to larger ships.  ""It changes the fact of a junior Sailor automatically getting housing or allowance for housing,"" John said.  Sandor was one of three Sailors assigned to the Washington to die by suicide in the same week in April 2022.  The suicides prompted the Navy to examine what led to the suicides and to look into living conditions for Sailors assigned to ships at shipyards.  Military RELATED: Navy releases investigations related to clusters of local Sailor suicides Brendan Ponton  Last week,the Navy released the report on quality of lifeand found several deficiencies, including things like inconvenient parking, lack of food options, and morale issues due to Sailors being assigned to a ship undergoing maintenance.  ""Throughout that investigation and assessment of Quality of Service, it was pointedly obvious that the Navy had failed the George Washington,"" Adm. Daryl Caudle, the commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command said during a press call last week.  The bill will now go through the process of becoming law. Sandor's parents say they're fighting for accountability.  ""I promised by son when I was holding him in a Virginia funeral home. I promised him that I wouldn't let your death go in vain and I'm keeping to that promise,"" said John.  News 3 has been reporting on other efforts to address Sailor mental health. Last week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Virginia) introduced a bill that in part requires Sailors on limited duty to receive more mental health screenings.  Military Rep. Kiggans on bill to address Sailor mental health: 'We have to do better' Brendan Ponton  In addition, the Pentagon recently began implementing the Brandon Act, which is named after a once locally-based Sailor and helps empower service members to get mental health treatment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGtyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21pbGl0YXJ5L2l0LWNvdWxkdmUtYmVlbi1wcmV2ZW50ZWQtcGFyZW50cy1vZi1sb2NhbC1zYWlsb3Itd2hvLWRpZWQtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1wdXNoLWZvci1uYXZ5LXRvLWFkZHJlc3MtaG91c2luZ9IBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGtyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21pbGl0YXJ5L2l0LWNvdWxkdmUtYmVlbi1wcmV2ZW50ZWQtcGFyZW50cy1vZi1sb2NhbC1zYWlsb3Itd2hvLWRpZWQtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1wdXNoLWZvci1uYXZ5LXRvLWFkZHJlc3MtaG91c2luZz9fYW1wPXRydWU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-07-14","10:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T21:44:59","SAN FRANCISCO -- Many teens who died by firearm suicide grew up in gun-owning families, according to a small psychological autopsy study.  Interviews with family members of nine teens who died by firearm suicide showed that 89% of decedents had prior family engagement with firearms or the family considered itself to be engaged in firearm culture, said Paul Nestadt, MD, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Anxiety Disorders Clinic in Baltimore.  In addition, 67% of youth used a family-owned firearm to complete their suicide.  ""Interventions must acknowledge culturally embedded routes of identity formation while re-scripting firearms from expressions of family cohesion to instruments that may undermine that cohesion -- and might cost the life of their child,"" Nestadt said during a press conference at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) annual meeting.  Suicide death rates have been steadily climbing since 2000, Nestadt explained, and now account for the second most common cause of death among youth.  ""It's a big problem,"" Nestadt said. ""And when we're talking about suicide, it's hard not to talk about firearm suicide.""  ""One of the reasons so many suicides are by firearm ... is that firearm attempts are much more lethal,"" he added.  According to CDC data, firearms are the most common method used in suicide; they were used in 55% of suicides in 2021. Of suicide attempts that involved a firearm, 90% resulted in fatality.  For reference, Nestadt said only about 8% of all suicide attempts result in death. ""That's why having a firearm is such an important risk factor for completed suicide,"" he said. In addition, most firearm deaths in the U.S. are suicides.  Prior to their death, 78% of decedents in the study had received some form of mental health treatment, reported suicidal ideation, or had a suicide plan. About 44% had a prior suicide attempt.  Psychological interviews (average length 2.5 hrs) were conducted with 11 family members -- mostly mothers -- of nine decedents from Maryland. All but one decedent was male, nearly all were white, and the average age was 19.  Family Firearm Culture  Three distinct themes emerged from the qualitative interviews. The first was how prevalent firearm culture was among families of youth who died by firearm suicide.  ""[He] used to love shooting with his dad. That was something that they did together. It was a big point of connection for them,"" one person said during the interview.  Firearm culture tended to play an integral role in how these families identified themselves and part of family traditions, Nestadt explained.  Understanding Firearm Risks  The second theme that emerged -- and the most clinically relevant, according to Nestadt -- was the perspective on firearm risk. Many family members tended to be unaware of the potential danger that access to firearms had for youth at risk for suicide and few locked up household guns. Most families said they would have removed guns from the house if it had been suggested to them.  ""If [the hospital] had recommended it, we would've agree to it and removed the gun from the house. But I wasn't worried, though -- it wasn't even a thought,"" said one family member.  As most decedents in the study were engaged in active mental health treatment, Nestadt pointed out that parents were doing everything that they thought they had to do -- making psychiatrist appointments, keeping their kids in treatment -- but often didn't take into account how access to a gun in the household would play into suicide risk.  This underscores the importance of healthcare providers, particularly mental health providers, starting a conversation about gun safety with both patients and caregivers. ""They just should do it,"" Nestadt told MedPage Today when asked how healthcare providers should initiate this discussion.  ""I know these are politically valent topics of the time, but as healthcare providers, we ask about their sex life, rashes, all kinds of sensitive things, religion,"" he said. ""It's important that we're able to really do that.""  ""I will point out for any healthcare provider that it's never illegal to ask about gun access. It's medically relevant to saving the life of your patient,"" Nestadt added.  ""Pediatricians: remember, this is the second leading cause of death,"" he said. ""It's important to screen for all these things that can hurt your kid, but the most likely thing that will result in your child patient dying will be suicide. The number one is accidental death.""  Risk Mitigation Strategies  This theme was closely entangled with the third theme that emerged from interviews, which involved risk mitigation strategies. While some parents said they would have considered filing an Extreme Risk Protective Order (available in Maryland) in hindsight, others placed little emphasis on removing their child's access to guns, saying they simply would have found a different method.  But Nestadt emphasized that people who are thwarted or fail in their suicide attempt seldom go on to die by suicide thereafter. ""[This is] why the method used is so important,"" he said. ""It's the myth we [as clinicians] have to work really hard to combat.""  Calling this ""truly a courageous study,"" session moderator Howard Liu, MD, MBA, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, praised the research for bringing up such an ""important, timely public health discussion.""  ""Of course, we're all facing this challenge of, how do we reduce suicide in all ages ... and I think this is a really vital discussion and such an important clue about access, and just trying to reduce access in the moment of impulsivity and a moment of grief.""

"suicide","2023-02-03","Not Discerned","{""Bentonville"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T10:38:15","    BENTONVILLE -- A man who hung himself in his cell in the Benton County Jail, after threatening to kill himself just days earlier, wasn't on suicide watch at the time of his death, according to Lt. Shannon Jenkins and jail records.  Timothy Plank, 53, of Rogers died Feb. 3, according to court documents.  Plank's death certificate lists his manner of death as suicide as a result of ligature hanging. The certificate states Plank hung himself with ligatures made from bandages.  The Benton County Sheriff's Office released a statement in February saying Plank was found unresponsive in his cell and pronounced dead at a local hospital.  He was alone in the cell, according to jail documents.  Plank had been in the jail on charges of aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated assault on correctional facility employee, possession of a controlled substance and obtaining drugs by fraud.  He was being held on a $750,000 bond.  Rogers police received a report at 4:25 p.m. Jan. 30 concerning an armed robbery at Walgreens at 1722 W. Walnut St., according to a probable cause affidavit.  Plank reportedly approached the pharmacy, brandished a black pistol and demanded oxycodone to commit suicide. He waved the pistol around in the pharmacy at the three employees as he demanded the medication, according to the affidavit.  He was given a small bottle that contained five 10 mg oxycodone pills. He immediately took the pills and left the store, according to the affidavit.  Police later found Plank in his pickup in the parking lot of the Rogers District Court, which is next to the Police Department.  An officer ordered Plank to put his hands out the window, but Plank got out of the vehicle with a black pistol in his right hand and pointed the gun at an officer, the affidavit states.  Plank was ordered to put the gun down, but he told the officers they were going to have to shoot him, according to the affidavit.  Plank extended the pistol in front of him and pointed it slightly toward the ground. Police believe Plank attempted to fire the gun, but the pistol malfunctioned, according to the affidavit.  Plank retrieved a second pistol from his pickup, and a police officer grabbed him, but Plank was able to fire one shot before the officer got him under control, according to the affidavit.  Police took him into custody, and Plank yelled, ""Shoot me. I want to die,"" according to the affidavit.  He was taken to the hospital where he told the police his initial plan was to rob Walgreens for the medication, take the medication, then rob the Arvest Bank across the street and wait for police to arrive so they would kill him, according to the affidavit. Plank said he changed his mind and decided to go to the Rogers Police Department, so officers would kill him there, according to the affidavit.  Plank said he was diabetic, had been in great pain and had attempted to kill himself within the previous few weeks, according to the affidavit.  Plank said if he were released from the hospital, he would hang himself, according to the affidavit.  Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the Benton County Sheriff's Office, said detainees on suicide watch are checked every 15 minutes, but Plank had been removed from suicide watch.  Plank denied thoughts of self harm during a Feb. 2 screening at the jail but said he previously wanted to be killed by a police officer, according to the affidavit.  He was questioned at the screening about the severity of his suicide threats, according to jail documents. He was asked to rate the most suicidal ideation in his life and since the arrest, and Plank answered both as a 5 of 5, being the most severe, according to the jail records.  He scored 25 on the Feb. 2 screening, which is based on a scale of eight to 40, according to jail documents. Scores of 24 or higher should remain on suicide watch and scores under 24 still require the clinical judgment of the psychiatrist, mental health professional or provider, according to jail documents.  The jail's mental health therapist released Plank from suicide watch, Jenkins said.  The ligature Plank made was put together with medical bandages and medical adhesive wrap, which were provided to him for his feet which had open sores due to complications from diabetes, according to jail documents.

"suicide","2018-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Yorktown"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T22:55:00","A Navy investigation into four sailors assigned to the Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center who died by suicide found no causal links.  All four sailors who died were on limited duty at Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center, although their reasons differed. Three of them were seeking mental health resources prior to their deaths. They were all in their first enlistment, according to the investigation.  Access to mental health services was not a factor in the deaths, according to the investigation, although it noted that a lack of a medical department at the maintenance center led to a communication breakdown between medical facilities and the command. MARMC does not have a chaplain or embedded mental health professional assigned to the facility.  “A properly staffed medical department, to include an individual with a clinical (i.e., Independent Duty Corpsman/IDC-like) background, could promote improved continuity of care and serve as a central POC to facilitate the monthly meetings between the [Medical Treatment Facility] and the Command to review LIMDU cases and discuss issues or concerns related to patient care,” according to the report.  MARMC was also ill-equipped to handle suicidal sailors, according to the report. The maintenance center had not run a suicide prevention drill in three years, and it did not have plans for reintegrating sailors who had displayed suicide-related behaviors or what actions to do after a suicide.  Two of the sailors that exhibited suicide-related behaviors were not referred to the Navy’s Sailor Assistance and Intercept for Life, which offers constant contact for sailors who are demonstrating suicide ideation and offers additional mental health support.  “SAIL referrals were not made in either of the above cases due to a lack of clarity regarding the definition of an SRB,” according to the report.  The investigation report defines suicide-related behaviors as self-harming behavior, suicide ideation or a suicide attempt.  If SAIL was implemented properly at MARMC, it could better prevent suicides, according to the investigation.  The report also noted that there is a lack of handoffs between commands and MARMC for sailors on limited duty, which makes it harder to assess sailor needs and risks. MARMC leadership also need to be more attentive to sailors who request leave when experiencing crisis, as this can prevent someone from intervening at a critical point, according to the report.  The four sailors all died within a month of each other from gunshot wounds, and the report noted that firearms access was an issue, highlighting that the sailors did not surrender firearms as a safety precaution or use gun locks as an added safety measure, according to the Navy’s investigation into the deaths.  The Department of Defense’s Independent Review Commission on Suicide noted the use of firearms in suicides in their 2023 report. The commission recommended a number of changes about firearms, including ones to the sale of firearms on DOD property.  Gun locks were offered to some of the sailors who died, but the sailors refused, according to the investigation.  One of the recommendations in the report is to develop a screening for sailors who are in crisis before granting personal leave.  Other recommendations include having suicide prevention and awareness as part of the indoctrination and assessing MARMC’s staffing to make sure there are enough people to oversee the limited duty sailors.  The investigation does not recommend punitive action against MARMC or its leadership.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL25ld3MudXNuaS5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWludG8tbWlkLWF0bGFudGljLXJlZ2lvbmFsLW1haW50ZW5hbmNlLWNlbnRlci1maW5kcy1uby1jYXVzYWwtbGlua3MtYmV0d2Vlbi1zYWlsb3ItZGVhdGhz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T21:37:38","Editor’s note: This report contains discussion of suicide. Troops, veterans and family members experiencing suicidal thoughts can call the 24-hour Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-8255, texting 838255 or visiting VeteransCrisisLine.net.  An internal Navy audit has found that the sea service has struggled to properly implement its suicide prevention program, even as crews continue to grapple with shipmates lost to suicide and the brass speaks of tackling the problem.  Among the findings of a Naval Audit Service audit completed in January, selected commands were unable to determine whether all their sailors completed annual suicide prevention training, potentially hindering the ability of sailors to help themselves and their friends through crisis points.  Problems with the Navy’s suicide prevention program also threaten the service’s ability to fully surveil data and “proactively prevent a crisis,” according to the audit, which was obtained by Navy Times via a Freedom of Information Act records request.  Navy officials said Monday that the service has implemented all the reforms laid out in the audit and pushed other initiatives aimed at combating sailor suicide.  In a report focused on calendar year 2021 data, auditors found that the Navy’s 21st Century Sailor Office, known internally as N17 and falling under the chief of naval personnel did not track all so-called “suicide related behaviors,” which include everything from suicidal ideations to attempts and suicide deaths.  RELATED  The audit further found that certain commands did not have a “crisis response plan” in place and did not conduct annual drills as required by Navy instructions.  Failing to properly track all suicide-related behaviors, or SRBs, is limiting the service in its ability to further prevent suicides, auditors warned.  “Without a process for tracing the full details of all SRBs, the Navy cannot provide enterprise-wide SRB surveillance to proactively mobilize resources to prevent a crisis,” the audit states. “In addition, the Navy is unable to analyze SRBs as required.”  It notes that the 21st Century Sailor Office is not tracking suicidal ideations and “lacked the necessary management oversight and internal controls for verifying annual training completion.”  Auditors also found that higher-ups “did not provide management oversight” to ensure the surveyed Echelon 4 commands were completing crisis response plans and annual drills.  The Navy’s suicide prevention program is supposed to educate the fleet on suicide risk factors and warning signs, while fostering resiliency and supportive command climates.  As auditors began their work, they found that the Navy lacked “a complete detailed universe” of suicidal ideations, and that suicide attempts were not being tracked.  They found that roughly 60 percent of the Navy’s 238 suicide attempts in calendar year 2021 were missing command information, further hindering the service’s ability to analyze data and spot potential trends.  Unit-level suicide clusters have tragically emerged in the spotlight in recent years, for example, at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center and aboard the aircraft carrier George Washington.  In both clusters, investigators determined that the deaths were not connected, but noted systemic failures along the way.  RELATED  When it comes to annual suicide prevention program training, auditors found that none of the four selected commands they surveyed could verify that all of their sailors had gone through the training in fiscal 2021, a violation of Navy regulations that reflects a lack of higher-level oversight and internal controls.  The audit also found that the surveyed commands did not hold crisis response plan drills to ensure that sailors understand how to handle an SRB-related situation.  The audit was conducted from January 2022 to October and looked at data for calendar year 2021, when 59 sailors died by suicide.  To conduct the audit, staffers focused on four Echelon 4 active duty commands that had the highest number of SRBs in 2021: the aircraft carriers Carl Vinson and George H.W. Bush, Destroyer Squadron 9 and Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Pacific.  Echelon 4 commands were picked because that command level runs such programs.  Auditors originally planned to survey eight commands but stopped after the first four when they realized their findings “would have a systemic impact on the implementation of the Suicide Prevention Program.”  A table included in a January Naval Audit Service report shows the commands with the highest number of suicide-related behaviors during calendar year 2021. Suicide-related behaviors include suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. (Naval Audit Service)  The audit notes that Carl Vinson had nine suicide attempts in 2021, but zero deaths by suicide, while fellow carrier George H.W. Bush had three attempts but also no deaths by suicide.  Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Pacific had three deaths by suicide in 2021, while Destroyer Squadron 9 had one attempt and one death by suicide, according to the audit.  Among prescriptions for reform, the audit service recommends that the 21st Century Sailor Office establish internal controls and oversight over SRB data collection and analysis, as well as annual suicide prevention training and crisis response plans.  “At a minimum, the policy would require collection of the name, date and location of deaths by suicide, suicidal attempts and suicidal ideations,” auditors wrote.  The Navy agreed with the need to better track such SRB data but also noted in its response that “research and literature does not support a linear relationship between suicidal ideation and suicidal death.”  “However, collection of detailed suicide related behavior data can be used to support Navy’s broader data analytics efforts in the behavioral space to identify risk and protective factors, and put actionable integrated prevention methodologies in place,” Navy officials wrote in their response.  While Navy officials concurred on the need to better ensure commands are tracking that their sailors complete annual suicide prevention training, the audit service report noted that officials did not lay out plans for better internal controls and management oversight to ensure commands track this data.  “We plan to conduct a follow-up audit in the future regarding 100 percent completion of the suicide prevention training and tracking of the completed training,” the January audit states.  The Navy also agreed to better ensure that the surveyed units are conducting annual crisis response plan drills as required.  CNP spokeswoman Capt. Jodie Cornell said in an email Monday that the service has begun tracking SRB data at the individual level, part of a “broader analytic effort to curb destructive behaviors.”  She noted that recent Navy actions on suicide prevention go beyond the scope of the audit service report.  Those actions include releasing a “Mental Health Playbook” and changing the name of N17 to the Navy’s “Culture and Force Resilience Office,” a change that better reflects that office’s broader goals.  “The U.S. Navy views suicide prevention as an all hands, years-long effort and will utilize findings from the Naval Audit Service report to help inform and continue Navy suicide prevention efforts,” Cornell said.

"suicide","2022-11-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T22:27:57","The Navy's investigation into a cluster of four suicides in the span of a month at one East Coast maintenance center found the command was not well suited to managing the sailors, who were all evaluated for medical issues.  The latest investigation, which was released alongside a report on USS George Washington carrier suicides, noted that all of the deaths at the maintenance center were among first tour sailors who were at various stages of the disability evaluation process and ""suffering from a confluence of external stressors.""  All four also had unrestricted access to personally owned guns -- an issue that goes largely unaddressed in the report.  Read Next: VA Claims Backlog Expected to Grow to 400K, Largely Due to the PACT Act  The report investigated four sailors who killed themselves between Oct. 29 and Nov. 26, 2022. Three reported some form of anxiety or stress related to their Navy service, but some also had serious medical issues. One sailor was being evaluated for seizures; another obesity; and one had ""debilitating back pain.""  The command the four sailors were assigned to is the Navy's Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center, or MARMC, a massive unit that manages the maintenance needs of the many ships in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. The command has around 3,000 people, and half are active-duty sailors.  About one-third of those sailors at any time are assigned to the unit because they are undergoing some sort of medical issue or event.  For example, on Jan. 23, the report says 200 sailors were being evaluated for a disability, 213 had recently given birth, and a handful were either waiting for new orders or to be separated from the Navy.  The command struggled to offer even basic suicide prevention. The MARMC's policies didn't have any guidance on dealing with sailors who demonstrated suicidal behaviors or what should be done in the aftermath of a suicide.  Investigators found that the unit hadn't conducted an annual suicide prevention drill in three years.  The report did note, though, that ""the Navy, writ large, has failed to fully implement the Suicide Prevention program"" as defined by its own rules.  Some commands, including a similar maintenance center in Mayport, Florida, did use the cluster as a chance to come up with new and different ways to talk about and try to prevent suicide.  Ultimately, investigators made recommendations for 25 reforms that the Navy leaders who received the report accepted in their letters endorsing the findings. Missing among the actions was any mention of addressing the method that these four sailors used to end their lives: guns.  Investigators found all of the sailors had ready access to firearms, and some resisted suggestions of keeping them under lock.  The Navy report found that ""access to personally owned firearms, and unwillingness to  surrender access to lethal means, to include the use of gun locks, was a causal factor in the deaths of all four Sailors.""  An independent panel commissioned by the Pentagon recently recommended that military exchanges stop selling guns to service members under 25 years old and put in place waiting periods for gun and ammunition purchases as a way to bring down the military's high suicide rates.  The panel's findings showed guns were involved in 66% of active-duty suicides, as well as 78% of National Guard suicides and 72% of reserve suicides.  Military.com's own investigation into the issue revealed that, while guns are not allowed in the barracks, leaders have few ways to police that policy since they aren't being told by the stores when one of their service members buys a gun.  Adm. Daryl Caudle said in a call with reporters last week that the Navy is looking into when sailors are issued a gun by their ship as part of watch-standing duties. The call was part of the release of the report and another that looked into the suicides aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington.  ""Far too many, on a percentage basis, of the tragic deaths due to suicide are due to a firearm and far too many of that population is with a service-provided weapon,"" Caudle added.  The report into the suicides at MARMC noted that the command handed out about 100 locks after the second suicide, and more than 300 since it received them in November 2022.  The report recommends that, if the Navy plans to continue assigning potentially disabled sailors to these centers, more manpower with the appropriate background and skill sets would be needed.  Investigators ultimately concluded that the four suicides ""were neither related, nor connected,"" but the report found communication between the doctors who were regularly seeing the sailors and leadership at the command was fractured.  That led to blind spots in keeping tabs on the sailors at the MARMC and became a contributing factor in their deaths, the Navy found.  Investigators said that, due to the industrial environment and fast-paced work tempo, maintenance centers like the one in Norfolk are ""not well-suited"" to provide effective management, administration and oversight of the sailors.  One issue was an overwhelmed system of oversight that began with the command's deployability coordinator -- a sailor charged with the accurate ""accounting, tracking, medical treatment, and expeditious movement"" of sailors on medical restrictions from duty through the screening process.  The sailor ""was overwhelmed … given the significant number of [limited duty] Sailors under his cognizance [and] the amount of work involved,"" the report said.  Investigators also determined that the training available for that position was inadequate: Ideally, the sailor in the position should have a medical background and receive ""focused training beyond a PowerPoint presentation.""  -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com.

"suicide","2020-07-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T12:41:15","Youth Suicide Rates Increased During the COVID-19 Pandemic  May 22, 2023 • Research Highlight  Suicide is a leading cause of death among young people in the United States. Rates of youth suicide deaths were rising before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began, so it is critical to understand how the pandemic impacted this public health crisis. In a new study supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, researchers examined national youth suicide trends and characteristics in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.  A research team led by Jeffrey Bridge, Ph.D., Donna Ruch, Ph.D., and Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., MPH, analyzed national suicide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers first identified all U.S. youth aged 5 to 24 years with suicide listed as the cause of death over the first 10 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020–December 31, 2020). They calculated the total and monthly suicide deaths overall and by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and suicide method. Then, they examined how many young people died by suicide during the first 10 months of the pandemic and compared it to an estimated number of suicide deaths during that same period had the pandemic not occurred (calculated using data from the previous 5 years).  The researchers identified 5,568 youth who died by suicide during the first 10 months of the pandemic, which was higher than the expected number of deaths had the pandemic not occurred. Higher than expected suicide rates were found a few months into the pandemic, starting in July 2020.  The increase in suicide deaths varied significantly by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and suicide method. During the pandemic, there were higher than expected suicide deaths among males, preteens aged 5–12 years, young adults aged 18–24 years, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth as compared to before the pandemic. Suicide deaths involving firearms were also higher than expected.  The significantly higher number of suicide deaths reported for certain racial and ethnic groups, specifically non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black youth, highlights ongoing disparities in rates of suicide that the pandemic may have exacerbated. The increase in suicide deaths among preteens also suggests that more attention may need to be paid to this age group, who tend to be understudied in suicide prevention research and have different developmental needs than older adolescents and young adults.  This research is only a first step in examining the pandemic’s impact on youth mental health and points to several areas for further investigation. First, it is possible that other events or factors unrelated to the pandemic that occurred during the study’s time frame contributed to the rise in youth suicide deaths but were unmeasured. Second, research is still needed to identify the underlying causes of the increase in youth suicide deaths, both overall and for specific groups. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic period analyzed in this study was limited to 10 months in 2020 and does not reflect longer-term trends in youth suicide that may have changed as the pandemic wore on. Last, suicide deaths for some groups may have been underreported due to inaccurate or misclassified data; ongoing monitoring of suicide rates will help clarify the suicide risk faced by young people in the United States.  This study shows that the pandemic impacted youth suicide rates, but the impact was not the same for everyone and varied based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity. As such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups. Moreover, given the extended duration of the pandemic and its ongoing impact on young people in the United States, it will be important to monitor long-term trends in suicide rates associated with COVID-19 and identify factors driving the increased risk for suicide among some people.

"suicide","2017-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-21T07:05:13","There have been periods of convergence and cooldown in U.S.-Russian relations on issues pertaining to international information security (IIS), the latter being witnessed by us today.  Moscow remains open to dialogue, advocating the rules of responsible conduct for governments, with a view to boosting peaceful development of the ICT environment, both globally and bilaterally. However, Washington is betting on maintaining its leadership and deterrence of Russia in cyberspace, so reaching agreements in the near future seems rather unlikely.  Amid a complex geopolitical environment, communication between the two countries needs to be maintained for managing contradictions and reducing the risk of escalation in cyberspace. Today, bilateral interaction takes place on the platform of the UN Open-ended Working Group on the Safe Use of ICTs (OEWG), which was established at the initiative of Russia. Informal diplomacy of the expert community, business representatives and NGOs can play an important role in determining possible areas of cooperation between the two nations in the long term.  Cybersecurity as a foreign policy priority for Russia and the U.S.  In 1998, Russia turned to the United States with a proposal to sign a bilateral agreement focused on preventing the militarization of the information space. Washington did not endorse Moscow’s peacemaking initiative, willing to keep a free hand in the military use of ICT. In the same year, Russia proposed this issue to the UNGA, which became the starting point of the UN negotiation process on IIS. Since then, at the initiative of the Russian side, a resolution on “Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security” has been annually adopted at the UNGA. Six groups of government experts were convened to discuss this problem, and four of them managed to pass the final reports.  The most important result of Russia’s diplomatic efforts was the adoption of 13 rules of responsible behavior of states in the global ICT environment, which were outlined in the 2018 UNGA resolution. These include: non-use of force or threat of force in the ICT environment, respect for state sovereignty, peaceful resolution of disputes, inadmissibility of unproven accusations of cyberattacks, etc.  In the early 2000s, this topic, largely due to the efforts of Russian diplomats, entered the agenda of most global and regional forums, including the SCO, CSTO, BRICS and others. IIS is currently one of the key topics.  According to complex expert ratings, Russia and the U.S. (along with China) are the leading cyber powers as of today. Therefore, their relations in the field of cyber security bear critical importance for the whole international community. Russia supports digital multipolarity and peaceful development of the ICT environment, while the United States seeks to preserve its leadership and sees Russia and China among its main strategic rivals in information and real geopolitics. The U.S. National Security Strategy of October 2022 considers deterring Russia and China, including in cyberspace, as one of the national security priorities.  The priority nature of international information security for Russia is enshrined in a number of strategic planning documents, such as the Fundamentals of Russia’s National Policy in International Information Security 2021, National Security Strategy 2021, and others. According to these documents, Russia pursues a policy towards shaping a peaceful and stable ICT environment and an inauguration of the IIS regime.  The U.S. has long been wary of Russia’s proposals, seeing them as an attempt to limit the development of ICT and challenge American leadership. In April 2022, the United States issued a Declaration for the Future of the Internet, proposing to fight for freedom of information transfer, and naming authoritarian states Russia and China as antagonists of the free Internet.  However, vulnerability to cyber threats has repeatedly prompted the U.S. to seek bilateral agreements with Russia.  In 2013, on the sidelines of the G8 Summit in Lough Erne, a Joint Statement of the Presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States of America on a New Field of Cooperation in Confidence Building. It included three documents stipulating the establishment of direct lines of communication between Moscow and Washington to prevent any escalation of cyber incidents, to promote the exchange of information between national security supervisors, as well as to establish incident and emergency response teams. A special working group was supposed to foster such cooperation. However, as a result of the general chill in the relations between Russia and the Collective West after Russia’s reunification with Crimea in 2014, Washington suspended its participation. A direct line of communication was used in October 2016, when President Obama contacted Moscow in view of hacking attacks on U.S. political institutions on the eve of the U.S. presidential election. The conflict was frozen, but it was an important precedent that attested to the importance of responding to various incidents or emergencies and the importance of communication channels between the two countries.  It was much more difficult for Donald Trump to collaborate in this area due to allegations of his ties to “Russian hackers,” which is why discussions on this issue did not result in practical agreements. In July 2017, during a meeting with Trump in Hamburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to step up engagement in cyberspace. Initially, the head of the White House publicly expressed support for the initiative, backtracking later due to the pressure from the U.S. Congress. During the 2018 meeting between the two leaders in Helsinki, Russia offered cooperation in preventing cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, but Washington rejected that initiative as well.  Collaboration between Russia and the United States to promote information security in historical perspective  The dynamics of negotiations changed under Joe Biden. On September 25, 2020, President Vladimir Putin proposed a project called to normalize U.S.-Russian relations in cyberspace, which included an exchange of “guarantees of non-interference in domestic affairs, such as election campaigns, using the ICT leverage.” The initiative followed a growing number of accusations by various U.S. political forces that Russia had deliberately interfered in the U.S. elections. Moscow has always denied and still denies the very possibility of such interference. The U.S. did not support the proposal, but Russia’s efforts bore fruit later. During the meeting of Putin and Biden on June 16, 2021, the two leaders reached an agreement on cooperation in fighting cybercrime. Besides, a joint U.S.-Russian resolution on international information security was proposed and subsequently adopted as a follow-up to the agreements at the UNGA level.  In 2022, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from cyber agreements reached in 2021 under the pretext of Russia’s special military operation (SSO) in Ukraine, embarking upon the path of aggressive unilateral action. As Oleg Syromolotov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, points out, Washington is supporting Ukraine’s IT army, including for attacks on critical information infrastructure. At present, the largest number of cyberattacks on Russian territory comes from the United States, NATO member states and Ukraine.  Thus, in the short term, the U.S. is not willing to engage in dialogue with Russia as an equal partner, while Moscow will not accept any interactions imposed on it from a position of power. Moreover, as was noted by Andrey Krutskikh, Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation in the Field of Information Security, “statements about the need to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia sidetrack any opportunity for dialogue.”  Problems of reconciling the approaches of the two nations to IIS  This situation in bilateral relations is far from new. We can draw parallels with the crises of the Cold War, when the parties saw the need for dialogue in the face of acute mutual contradictions. Today, interaction on cyber issues is carried out on the OEWG platform. During the Cold War, the UN performed the same functions in the area of strategic stability as the OEWG does today in cyber policy and IIS.  In addition to the OEWG, the UN Special Committee on Combating the Criminal Use of ICTs, also established at Russia’s initiative, successfully follows through with its effort.  Despite the fact that Western states have repeatedly tried to divert the OEWG’s discussions—away from the mandated issues of designing rules of responsible conduct for state actors in the ICT environment to the discussion of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine—the platform has maintained its importance, with Western nations, along with Russia and its partners, actively participating in the proceedings of the platform.  Moreover, there has been a shift in the U.S. position on the regulation of the global ICT environment. The U.S. officially declares the need to develop rules for the behavior of state actors in the information space. Thus, the State Department’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy defined the development of rules of responsible conduct for states in cyberspace as one of its goals in 2022. U.S. support for the UN dialogue is related to the fact that the U.S. is becoming more vulnerable in the midst of multipolar digital world order.  Thus, Moscow’s and Washington’s approaches to a potential cybersecurity dialogue at the UN level may seem to be complementary on many issues. No reconciling is to be expected, however. The U.S. and its allies seek to “hijack the agenda” in global forums, orienting the global community towards their own initiatives. As for the rules of responsible conduct for state actors—the area of cooperation traditionally supported by Russia—the U.S. took a stand in favor of the French draft resolution of the UNGA “Program of action to advance responsible State behavior in the use of information and communications technologies in the context of international security” in 2022. This program, as conceived by its authors, should become a permanent UN institutional mechanism for discussing issues related to countering global threats in the field of ICT. It is suggested that the French project should be launched once the OEWG mandate expires in 2025.  The document presents a number of propositions that coincide with Russia’s stance on IIS and that our country has been proactively promoting over the past 20 years. In particular, there is an emphasis on the priority role of the UN in the process of negotiations on those issues. It is also recognized that, taking the specifics of ICT into account, new binding norms might be adopted in the future, and the significance of the results already achieved within the framework of the UN GGE on IIS is also pointed out. The discrepancy has to do with the longer-term prospects of cooperation. In the long run, Russia advocates for an international convention on IIS under the auspices of the UN, while the West insists on non-binding voluntary norms, conditioning the rapid obsolescence of any document on the speed of technological advancement. Non-binding norms are insufficient to deal with the increasing intensity and danger of threats to IIS, and this explains why the Russian vision is backed by many states. In 2023, Russia submitted its draft resolution “Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security” to the UNGA, which was backed at the General Assembly.  Besides, there are contradictions in the area of combating the criminal use of ICTs. The United States supports the 2001 Budapest Convention, which makes it possible to combat cybercrime without regard for state sovereignty and, in fact, assumes extraterritorial extension of the right of the strongest in this area. Russia, for its part, supports the adoption of a UN Convention, stemming from the principle of inviolability of state sovereignty in combating the criminal use of ICT. At the same time, successful discussions on the draft convention proposed by Russia show support for the Russian vision of IIS, focused on the respect for state sovereignty, equal partnership and formation of international regimes on the basis of legally-binding agreements.  Meanwhile, U.S. initiatives have, for the most part, a limited number of supporters. For example, about 60 states have joined the Declaration for the Future of the Internet. As was noted in the report Confronting Reality in Cyberspace: Foreign Policy for a Fragmented Internet co-authored by Nathaniel Fick, Head of the State Department’s Bureau of Digital Policy and Cyberspace, norms are better used for rallying allies than for managing the behavior of competitors. Washington’s approach is not widely supported around the world, and only its closest allies are willing to sign on to it. Many nations support Russian initiatives, or back both Russian and Western approaches, as they try to avoid politicization in this area.  At the same time, the U.S. expert community, traditionally having a serious influence on foreign policy, is getting tired of anti-Russian rhetoric. In particular, the authoritative political scientist John Mearsheimer argues in his article published by Foreign Affairs in 2022 in favor of dialogue between Washington and Moscow as it could prevent further escalation between the nuclear superpowers. Another prominent realist, Stephen Waltz, published an article following a similar logic. Cyberspace experts pay more attention to the need for dialogue and parity with China, than with Russia, although some publications are devoted to the necessity of dialogue between superpowers in order to prevent global “cyber disorder.” Similar ideas are expressed in the European expert community, including among SIPRI experts. Russian experts and politicians have repeatedly stated that Russia is ready to cooperate on the condition of equal partnership.  Yet, given the modern-day circumstances, no political force in Washington can support cyber negotiations with Russia as anti-Russian sentiments are very strong in the American society. Be that as it may, from practical perspectives, the U.S. is still interested in cooperation to de-escalate incidents and combat cybercrime, as Biden’s representatives have repeatedly stated before. Thus, one should not expect deeper cooperation and new documents adopted, but the U.S. will probably seek to preserve the existing channels of communication instead of tearing relations completely. Drawing an analogy with the Cold War, one can argue that cybersecurity is becoming part of a new strategic stability equation in bilateral relations, despite Washington’s unwillingness to openly admit it, as it insists on maintaining its leadership in this area.  Conclusion  With bilateral ties severed through Washington’s fault, the UN’s OEWG still serves as a channel of communication, which is especially important in promoting information security, where misattribution of a cyber incident can lead to escalation. The prospect of new bilateral agreements on information security signed looks rather unlikely in the foreseeable future; and the most important task is to maintain the level of ties and relations that have been achieved so far.  Despite growing tensions in the international arena, there have been no major cyber clashes between cyber powers. This suggests that states view the use of cyber weapons as one of the “red lines”, being well aware that crossing them could lead to an unwanted escalation. Thus, the IIS in bilateral relations confirms is the best evidence that it belongs to a larger network of strategic stability relationships.  Even the crisis in U.S.-Russian relations, following the launch of Russia’s operation in Ukraine, did not see any changes in the activities of the UN platforms—the dialogue remained intact. The OEWG, as a negotiating platform on international information security, has passed the test in a rough environment, having proven the relevance of such platforms as well as Russia’s global initiatives. In the long run, informal channels of communication will be important, including expert, academic and business meetings, where the search for ways to develop bilateral relations in the cyber space will be possible.

The police official said that they broke open the door and found Samiur hanging from the ceiling.  He said that they recovered the body and sent it to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for autopsy.  Sohrawardy Hossain said that they came to know that Samiur returned to Rajshahi two days ago from the capital city.  ‘It seems that the student has committed suicide.

Bandon teenager Aidan Burke, known as ‘Burkie’, penned the rap song to mark the one-year anniversary of the day his friend, Rian, took his own life.  The third-year student at St Brogan’s College said of ‘We Ain’t Mad at Ya’: “It is a rap song in memory of my friend, Rian. I wrote all the parts, except for the chorus, which was written by Nichole Desmond, who is from Cork City. I record all my stuff with M5 Sound Studio.  ""I was looking for a female artist to do the chorus and Coco, the executive producer, called in Nichole, who is known as N’D, to sing the verses. She has a beautiful voice. It worked out great,” he said.  The 15-year-old first discovered his love for performing when he sang the hit ‘Big Poppa’, by the artist The Notorious B.I.G., to Rian’s family and friends gathered on the grounds of Bandon AFC.  “I took up singing about a year or two ago. At home, I would throw on the record player and turn up the rap music up to the top. It kept me happy. Rian died in February 2022 from suicide.  ""After Rian died, a large group of people went up to the soccer pitch in Bandon and we released balloons. I was asked to do something to lift people’s spirits, so I sang a song, which made everyone happy.  “I knew, from then on, that it was what I wanted to do on a full-time basis. I started writing the song ‘We Ain’t Mad at Ya’ the month after he died. I went through a few different drafts. I am delighted with the way it came out. It is great to raise awareness about such an important topic. We released the video for the song last Sunday. We did a good bit of the filming in Courtmacsherry,” he added.  The rap tune, which is available on Spotify, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music, has already received significant airtime on Cork radio stations and has attracted international recognition.  “The song has gone international. A suicide-awareness campaign from Canada is after hearing about the song. They want to use my song as a theme for their international programme, which they will be using in all the schools in North America, Australia, and Europe. I have also got some radio play in Cork with RedFM and 96FM.”  The Bandon musician starts his Junior Cycle exams on Wednesday, June 7, before he spends the summer pursuing his musical ambitions.  “I have the Junior Cert starting soon, but I expect to release more songs during the summer.  ""I am looking forward to writing and playing lots of music during the summer. There will be more songs to come.

"suicide","2023-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Seoul"", ""Seoul"", ""SouthKorea""}","2023-05-21T16:21:20","James Gunn, on April 18, during a press conference in Seoul. JEON HEON-KYUN (EFE)  One of the most famous methods for falling asleep is counting sheep. However, for James Gunn, what worked for him was choreographing action sequences in his head. That was the last thing he did before drifting off. What’s so relaxing about picturing fights, leaps and somersaults? Who knows. It may have something to do with the fact that the filmmaker’s brain cannot slow down, even at night. He himself admits that his mind constantly wanders off, no matter what he is doing. “The worst part is that I talk to myself sometimes, and I don’t know that I’m doing it. It’s like I’m mumbling dialog, or music or something,” he says. His wife inevtiably catches him and brings him back to reality.  Speaking in a Paris hotel, the director seemed focused on the conversation. But you never know: rarely has his brain accumulated as many tasks, emotions and stimuli as these days. On one hand, he was presenting the recently released Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, the final part of the most peculiar trilogy of Marvel superhero movies — a film that, incidentally, he was not supposed to direct, because Disney fired him after the second movie in light of some old jokes he made about pedophilia, rape and 9/11 on Twitter.  Pom Klementieff (left), Chris Pratt and Karen Gillan in ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.’  However, the protests from the cast and the public forced the company to back down. They saved the project, but a little too late: Gunn had already signed with Marvel’s arch-rival, DC. First, to direct The Suicide Squad. And then, as soon as the promotion with Marvel ends, Gunn will set his sights on shaping stories for Superman, Wonder Woman and other DC characters in movies, series and video games. The name that was chosen for the first phase of the project may offer a clue: Gods and Monsters.  “I don’t think there’s ever been a storyteller in charge. It’s unprecedented. No one in the history of Hollywood has ever had an opportunity to tell the biggest story ever told across television, film and games, to have that type of creative outlet. So how the fuck could I say no?” This dispels any doubts there could be regarding his decision to join DC. The studio has been experiencing ups and downs for years, triumphing with Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy and Todd Philips’ recent Joker, but having less success with Batgirl, which was canceled, Black Adam, which was a box office disaster, and Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad (not Gunn’s, but one with almost the same name) and Justice League, which all received terrible reviews. No one, until today, had proven to have the superpower of being able to draw up a coherent long-term plan.  To solve such an unusual situation, the company has turned to a mind that is just as unusual. As a child, Gunn was obsessed with inventing alien races, complete with pets, homes and even a hydraulic network for each planet in the solar system. Today, he explains that his creative process is “like being a journalist,” observing and transcribing plots and conversations that never stop in his head. And as strange as it sounds, it works. “There aren’t too many people that get to make movies at the budget level that I’m able to make them and still do exactly what they want,” he says.  James Gunn and Margot Robbie on the set of ‘The Suicide Squad’ in 2021. Warner Bros.  Like what? Like demanding expensive songs such as Radiohead´s Creep for the third installment of Guardians of the Galaxy; shooting visually stunning sequences, sparing no expense; adding a dark twist (and a few expletives, something forbidden until now) to a film made by the ever-merry Marvel Studios; pushing his cast to repeat the shots endless times; or even getting Disney to eat their words. “The offensive attitude and the statements discovered on James’ Twitter are indefensible and incompatible with our values,” stated Alan Horn, the boss at the time, in 2018, when he fired the filmmaker who ended up being reinstated, something that also spurred the imaginations of the fans who are dreaming up a film that brings together the heroes of Marvel and DC. With Gunn and the freedom he enjoys at the helm, of course, there’s a better chance of that happnening. “In 10 years,” Gunn laughs.  The filmmaker attributes his current status to the first and highly celebrated installment of Guardians of the Galaxy. That is also perhaps when his trademark style — a mix of rock, epic slow-mo, absurd humor and a desire to risk and amaze — began to be recognized. But the applause came earlier, as well as his connection with the audience. In March 2004, for the first time in the U.S., a film that led the box office for a week, Dawn of the Dead, was dethroned by another by the same scriptwriter, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.  Freddie Prinze jr. in ‘Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed,’ scripted by James Gunn.  A man of many talents  Gunn tends to take pride in a career that he built by himself with his own talent and effort. There was a time when the most powerful creator of commercial cinema used to serve clients in a bar and look after patients as a nurse; he also worked in a quarry and sang in seedy dives. “I was finding my way. But I always knew that I was an artist,” he points out.  One thing was what put bread on the table; another, his dream. Since he was a child, Gunn has drawn comics, composed music, started bands, taken photos, acted and written novels. His first film, made when he was 11, consisted of a string of fake commercials “made with the kids in the neighborhood.” Other homemade horror movies brought Friday the 13th to mind: “I can’t make Star Wars, but I could make that,” he recalls thinking at the time. Then, passion and work finally coincided: he was asked to write the script for Lloyd Kaufman’s Tromeo and Juliet (1996). “I was just kind of desperate to make a living doing something creative. When I started working in the film industry, it was almost like my backup, if that makes any sense. I was a rock star, you know, a novelist... now I’m going to sell out and go make movies.” Chris Pratt, star of Guardians of the Galaxy, puts it differently: he says that Gunn was “born to do it.”  Maybe this is why Gunn values so much the path he has traveled. And although he notes that money does buy a lot of creative freedom, he warns: “The budget can be a trap because people can rely on it too much. But the budget won’t make a good movie. Sometimes having restrictions placed upon you can really help you, even when you make movies like this. I would say 90% of the time I’ve had restrictions placed on me, it’s made the movie better, not worse, because somehow I’m able to make things more streamlined, you really you cut out the things you don’t need and you keep the stuff that you do.”  His team also helps him a lot. Gunn believes that, even though years ago he placed too much trust in people who did not deserve it, today he is surrounded by talent that is able to bring his boundless imagination to reality, often even improving it. “Part of [the process] is me; you need to have a good foundation, a good story. But then part of it is finding the right people to surround yourself with,” he reflects. Today he even enjoys the power to take certain collaborators with him wherever he goes.

Photo by StillMoving.Net for Disney (Photo by StillMoving.Net for Disney)  Right now that will not be possible with the Guardians of the Galaxy, however. This is also why his end at Marvel comes with a certain sadness, apart from the relief of being satisfied with the result. “We’ve been like a family,” he says. “Every single group of actors is like, they love each other, but usually they don’t. It’s not like that with us.” So much so, that he talks to Pratt at least twice a week.  Defending the superheroes  In addition to the infamous tweets that got him briefly fired — of which Gunn himself expressed regret about after the scandal — the director’s Twitter account also shows his vision without mincing words. After the success of Deadpool, in 2016, he encouraged his peers to learn the lesson: more unique films, less copies. Has it been achieved? “Infinity War and Endgame were totally unique. The first Shazam! movie was high concept comedy. So I think that there’s been really interesting films. I wish there were more, but yeah.”  A poster for ‘Endgame’ (2019), the last installment of the ‘Avengers’ series. © Marvel Studios  Gunn has also defended superhero films from those who, like Martin Scorsese, dismiss them as second-rate works or accuse them of overwhelming, repeating themselves and becoming tiresome. To say that a type of film is not cinema because of its subject or characters is ridiculous, he argues. And now he has an unprecedented opportunity to prove it: for Legacy, the new Superman film, he will get behind the camera. In the animated series Creature Commandos he is directing the actors and their voices. And in other cases, he will choose the director and supervise. “I’m hiring great directors and great writers. It’s going to be interesting stuff, if nothing else. That’s what I’d rather make, stuff that’s interesting and doesn’t work, than stuff that is just the same old thing that we’ve seen again and again.”  After all, throwing himself into creating stories not only brings him applause and money. Apparently, it also helps him live better: “My demons change over the years. I was an alcoholic as a young person, and a drug addict. I went through a number of crazy years. I think that for me, it’s really about focusing on the creative process and not being distracted by money, power, attention, negativity, and just focusing on the creative process. If I can do that, then everything works out really well. It still can be a struggle, mentally. But life is difficult enough without me making it more difficult.” Better to imagine the battles of others. And how to stage them. It may even help you sleep.

His parents have accused educational establishments of a 'cover up' as new research finds just 40 per cent of universities disclose the number of students who took their own life while studying.  And more than half have no record of the number of their pupils who died by suicide.  Alice made her way into her son's room on the morning of June 24 2021 - waking him up and letting the family cat roam across his sleep-crumpled bedding.  Having spent the morning busy with admin, she chatted to him about his Covid jabs.  Harry Armstrong Evans was one of at least 11 students at Exeter University to take their lives in six years - and the second on his course in four years - when he died aged 21 in June 2021  Harry's mother Alice Armstrong Evans (pictured together when he was 3) wrote to 140 universities and 600 MPs - gaining the support of prominent government figures  Harry Armstrong-Evans was a smart, gentle 21-year-old who excelled at rowing - something he learnt among the ducks on a pond next to the family's Cornish watermill home.  But, according to his mother, the Physics with Astrophysics student would far rather be playing chess or working on his computers.  Later in the day she asked him to collect the post - which is not delivered directly to their rural house. She never expected these to be the last words she would ever say to him.  Two years on from his death, she said: 'We were preparing supper and so we went to look for him. And he was in a barn.  'It was so shocking we just screamed. We just didn't know what to do - you don't know what to do when you come across that.  'We could not believe it. We just could not believe it.  'He was gentle, and kind. I know Harry would never have done that to one of his students.  'I know that he would always have tried to help someone.'  Less than a month before he died, Mr Armstrong Evans emailed his tutor and the wellbeing service detailing his isolation during lockdown and his declining mental health, which he said had affected his exam performance. Pictured: Harry, second from left, with sister Freddy, left, brother Archie, second from right, and baby sister Matilda, right  Over the last five years there have been seven student suicides at Exeter (pictured), according to the university  Two years after his suicide, Alice is accusing universities of a 'cover up' as she and Harry's dad Rupert try to make it compulsory for them to record suicide rates within their student body.  A student at Exeter University, his inquest in October 2022 found the institution failed to respond to his 'cry for help'.  Alice, 63, and Rupert, 73, say the tragedy would never have happened if the university had published their suicide rates.  It comes as new research finds just 40 per cent of universities disclose the number of students who took their own life while studying.  And more than half - 54 per cent - have no record of the number of their pupils who died by suicide.  Last month the parents of an undergraduate who took her life at the University of Bristol on the day she was due to give a presentation visited No. 10 to hand over a petition urging Westminster to give universities a 'duty of care' for their students.  Nearly two years after Harry's death his mother Alice said: 'The year before Harry started university someone on the same course took their life.  'We should have known about that. We should have had that information.  'And I know if we had had that information we would not have lost Harry. It's a cover up.'  On the day Harry died, his mother had woken him up, bringing the cat into his room and having a chat  Harry was a good rower, having learned the skill on the pond next to their house surrounded by ducks  In November last year the couple launched a petition for new rules regarding the suicide of higher education students - called 'Harry's Law'.  Battling for a mechanism by which universities must record and publish their suicide rates, the petition was closed with just over 5,100 signatures.  Alice also wrote to 140 universities and 600 MPs - gaining the support of prominent government figures.  Over the last five years there have been seven student suicides at Exeter, according to the university.  His father Rupert, who works as a water engineer, added: 'How could any MP or any university Vice Chancellor actually stand up and say we don't want information about suicides shared and recorded.  'Could anybody actually say that when everybody's talking about transparancy and making things better?  'The starting point for making things better is to understand what's actually happening.'  Their plea was echoed by Helen Hartery-Brown, whose son Ben died while in his final year at Loughborough.  The first time the 22-year-old's parents heard that he was struggling in his studies was during his inquest.  Gregarious and outgoing Ben, who was on an army scholarship, had spent the evening before his death having a barbeque with his housemates and chatting with his family on Zoom.  Helen, 57, says that while she does not think it would have changed whether her son killed himself, it is important for universities to be transparent.  Gregarious and outgoing Ben Brown (pictured), who was on an army scholarship, had spent the evening before his death having a barbeque with his housemates and chatting with his family on Zoom  Helen, 57, left, says that while she does not think it would have changed whether her son, right, killed himself, it is important for universities to be transparent  She said: 'I don't think if those figures had been published we'd have taken any notice of them because it was never going to happen to my son.  'There is no transparency. Most universities do not know how many students they've lost to suicide. It is absolutely shocking.  'I do not blame the university - it was Ben's decision.  'I'm hoping lessons were learned. But if they're not recording suicide then there's going to be no lessons learned.  'I think the publishing or even the university keeping a note of suicide should be investigated. It should be far more transparent.'  Ben died in his fourth year at university while resitting his third year in the lockdown of 2020.  Helen continued: 'As a parent of a young adult going off to uni if I was looking at different universities and one had a significantly higher suicide rate I would just be more aware.  'And I think that is just invaluable information.  'I don't do social media too much these days because it's too full of ""happy"" and I'm not happy anymore.  'But I have friends who are posting: ""I'm sending my child off to university, how dreadful!""  'And I just want to post: ""how dreadful when they never come home.""  'It did not enter my head that my son may never come home from university. I'd never considered that, ever.'  Ben (pictured) died in his fourth year at university while resitting his third year in the lockdown of 2020  The highest numbers of student suicide for any that responded was the University of Manchester (pictured), where 12 have taken their own lives since 2018 - half of which were on campus property. It is also the third largest university in the UK, with more than 45,000 enrolled students  Of the 134 UK universities contacted with freedom of information requests, 39 disclosed the number of suicides among their student body.  According to their figures 123 took their own lives over the last five years, although coroners reports are still being released.

The highest numbers of student suicide for any that responded was the University of Manchester, where 12 have taken their own lives since 2018 - half of which were on campus property. It is also one of the largest universities in the UK, with more than 45,000 enrolled students.  Research by the Office of National Statistics suggests figures may be far higher - estimating 319 students in higher education died by suicide between the academic years 2016-17 and 2019-20.  Equivalent to 3.9 deaths per 100,000 students, the median age of death was 22 years.  On April 24 the parents of Natasha Abrahart gave No 10 a petition signed by nearly 130,000 people calling on the government to make universities responsible for student welfare.  Robert and Margaret Abrahart took legal action against the University of Bristol after the death of their daughter, who suffered from severe social anxiety.  The judge ruled the university discriminated against her and failed to accommodate her mental health disability, with the university having to pay £50,000 in damages.  Olly Parker, Head of External Affairs at mental health charity YoungMinds, said: 'The reasons why a young person might feel suicidal are often complex and unique and every suicide is an individual tragedy.  'University can be a difficult time for young people as many navigate leaving home for the first time and might not have access to their usual support networks.  'Young people in this age group are also facing enormous pressures, while those who went to university during the pandemic might have felt even more isolated.  Physics student Natasha Abrahart, 20, was found dead in her flat in April 2018, the day before she was due to take part in a group presentation in a 329-seat lecture theatre  'Universities have a duty of care to their students and it’s vitally important young people have access to mental health support when they need it.  'Collecting data on young people’s mental health can help to identify trends and support preventative measures. Mental health support in universities is generally improving, but there’s still a long way to go to ensure all students can get help when they need it most.  'We’re calling for a network of early support hubs across the country. This would ease the pressure on other services and mean all young people up to the age of 25 have somewhere they can go to get advice and support quickly.'  In Harry's inquest Assistant Cornwall coroner Guy Davies blasted Exeter University, saying there was a 'total absence of personal engagement' from the university towards Mr Armstrong Evans and there had been a 'catalogue of missed opportunities along with system failures'.  In his final year, over lockdown, the student's results had fallen off a cliff edge.  Less than a month before he died, Mr Armstrong Evans emailed his tutor and the wellbeing service detailing his isolation during lockdown and his declining mental health, which he said had affected his exam performance.  Mr Davies described this as a 'cry for help' but said it did not lead to any direct engagement between the university and Mr Armstrong Evans, or his parents Rupert and Alice Armstrong Evans.  Cornwall Coroner's Court heard that Mr Armstrong Evans's exam results were good in his first two years but by the third year were 'falling off a cliff edge'.  Harry also voiced his worries about his family's financial situation, Cornwall Coroner's Court heard  The inquest heard Mrs Armstrong Evans had made three attempts to contact the wellbeing service at Exeter University (picured), but no one got back to her due to IT system failures  By May, he was emailing his tutor and the wellbeing service about his options for deferring his summer exams and resitting others, but they said there was nothing in what he had told them that they described as a 'red flag'.  He also voiced his worries about his family's financial situation, Cornwall Coroner's Court heard.  His personal tutor, Professor Matthew Browning, said university policy prevented him from discussing his welfare with his parents, but the coroner said there was a 'misunderstanding' of this policy and he had overlooked 'exceptional circumstances'.

The university spent £11,610 for legal services relating to Harry's death - with other legal support provided by internal teams.  This money covered the preparation of evidence bundles and detailed statements as requested by the Coroner, in order to assist the inquest, and to support the University in giving evidence to the inquest.  Alice continued: 'I had just lost my son. I just felt there was a brick wall and I couldn't get the information.  'Whenever we speak to anybody about it they can't believe that coroners don't send that information to universities. They can't believe that universities don't keep records and they can't believe that they aren't published.  'When your child goes off to university, you don't think they're going to kill themselves. It never crossed our mind that he would take his own life.'  On the day Harry died, his mother had woken him up, bringing the cat into his room and having a chat.  The last time she saw him she had asked him to fetch their mail, and his family found him later after looking for him at supper time.  He was a good rower, having learned the skill on the pond next to their house surrounded by ducks.  Kind and gentle, the Physics with Astrophysics student had just failed an exam after struggling to upload it during lockdown  But his parents say he preferred chess and croquet, and he had a passion for computers.  She continued: 'If we had spoken to Harry about suicide, we'd have told him: ""Your degree doesn't really matter, you matter. If you stack shelves in Tesco for the rest of your life it really doesn't matter. But no degree is worth taking your life over.""  'Just a few words and he would have understood that. But he just didn't communicate with us and we didn't know.  'He was gentle and kind. He wanted to do well and I think that this just threw him. It was the first time he had had such bad results.'  A spokesperson for Universities UK said: 'Universities recognise the profound impact that suicide has upon families and friends, as well as the wider university community, and the need to act with transparency and compassion.  'ONS analysis indicates that students in higher education are less likely to take their own lives than their equivalents in the wider population, suggesting that university support services are having a protective effect. Nonetheless, we believe it is essential that universities continue to prevent avoidable deaths through suicide.  'Ultimately it is for the coroner to determine and record the cause of death. Those decisions are in the public domain. Universities UK is working with government to develop a national reporting system for all student deaths including those by suspected suicide.'  A spokesperson for the University of Exeter added: 'We are deeply saddened by Harry’s death and his family's loss. We are grateful for the Coroner’s careful consideration of the circumstances of, and issues arising from, this tragedy. We addressed in detail the concerns that were raised in the Coroner’s letter, setting out the ways in which we are responding to each of these.  'We are acutely aware of the current mental health challenges for young people. We have invested significantly in student welfare and wellbeing support in recent years and will continue to do so.  'Following the Coroner’s Inquest, we have undertaken a detailed review of the many ways in which we support student mental health and wellbeing, and we have introduced further enhancements across our University community.  'These include developing additional structured training provision for staff, and investing in further out-of-hours support to ensure there is additional capacity within our trained team, who can proactively support students at their time of need.  'The team can be accessed directly by students, or by others who may be concerned for a student’s wellbeing.  'We are also working with key external partners in order to ensure the best possible support to our students. Further work is taking place to agree data sharing policies with relevant key statutory organisations including GPs, NHS mental health care teams and the police.  'We are updating our policies, ensuring that the considered use of the ‘trusted contact’ is part of our support provision. We have undertaken a robust review of our Case Management System, which has seen additional mitigation measures installed, including a ‘welfare tracker’ to track case progress. We are also investing in an enhanced system this year.  'We have welcomed and support the recent Universities UK guidance on suicide prevention, and we had already introduced a significant number of the recommendations prior to the outcome of the Inquest into Harry’s death.  'We will continue to engage with best practice in student mental health and wellbeing, which will remain our highest priority, and we will work with sector bodies and external partners to ensure our support is continually enhanced.'  Dr. Simon Merrywest, Director for the Student Experience at the University of Manchester, said, 'We have always advocated candour and transparency of information relating to student suicide and this summer we will begin publishing information about our rates of suicide as part of an annual student mental health report.  'Although, very sadly, we have experienced 12 confirmed suicides in the last 5 years, the rate of suicide at our university has fallen over this same period. Noting that not all universities provided data for this article, attempting a direct comparison between suicide numbers at different universities, in the absence of the wider context of each case and institution, is seldom helpful.  'Any death by suicide is by definition a tragic event and the University puts considerable weight on the need to evolve continually its understanding of and response to students at risk of suicide.  We have a comprehensive suicide strategy, which focuses on prevention, intervention and a focus on review and learning from the past in order to inform the future. Our approach to suicide prevention is a key element of our wider student mental health and wellbeing offer, which we have expanded significantly in recent years, with recent innovations including the pioneering Greater Manchester Student Mental Health Service, a General Practitioner service, 24-hour access to support from mental health practitioners and a social prescribing offer.'","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIwNzE3NzcvTXkta2luZC1nZW50bGUtYm95LWtpbGxlZC1ob21lLXVuaS13b3Jkcy1oYXVudC1tZS5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA3MTc3Ny9hbXAvTXkta2luZC1nZW50bGUtYm95LWtpbGxlZC1ob21lLXVuaS13b3Jkcy1oYXVudC1tZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Incheon"", ""InchonGwangyoksi"", ""SouthKorea""}","2023-05-21T21:53:18","Lonely deaths on rise  Tighter social safety net urgent to protect needy    ""The life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""  Seventeenth-century English political philosopher Thomas Hobbes said so in his masterpiece, ""Leviathan.""  No other words better describe the lives of jobless and homeless men in their 50s and 60s in Korea now. However, there is one more thing here ― most of them die alone and are even buried with nobody to mourn them.  More than 1.5 million Koreans are at risk of what is commonly referred to as ""lonely death,"" accounting for 3 percent of the country's population, a government survey showed last week. People in their 50s made up 33.9 percent of them, followed by those in their 60s accounting for 30.2 percent.  According to a separate report released last year, Korea saw 3,378 lonely deaths in 2021, growing at an average annual rate of 8.8 percent over the past five years. That is more than nine every day. Men outnumbered women by five to one. All this shows that middle-aged or elderly Korean men today, driven out of jobs and homes, are the most vulnerable group.  Koreans dislike the Japanese, but are walking down the same path as their former colonizers a few decades later. In Japan, karoshi (death from overwork) and kodokushi (lonely death) were social problems in the 2000s. Korean equivalents to these now are gwarosa and godoksa. However, Korean patriarchs lose their financial means earlier than their Japanese counterparts, fall into bad habits like drinking, and are driven out of their families or abandon them.  Only two generations ago, Korea was a poor but sympathetic society. It has now become a rich but brutal one where individuals are unhappiest and loneliest worldwide. The highest suicide and depression rates among OECD member nations, the fourth-highest anxiety disorder rate, and the rapidly rising share of one-person households demonstrate that. More and more young people don't marry, bear, or rear children. Korea is a paradise for winners, but a hell for losers. Can this country continue like now for much longer?  There are usual suspects, such as worsening poverty among older adults, rapid demographic change, and a widening welfare gap. All these require fundamental social and economic structural changes, which take time. However, a self-proclaimed developed country should not let its people die alone to be found later due to the stench of decay or in mummified form. There must be a modicum of dignity in life ― and death. Death may be individual, but its process and aftermath should be more communal and humane. It decides whether a society is advanced or not.  Releasing the first survey results on lonely death, the Ministry of Health and Welfare vowed to reduce the number by 20 percent until 2027. It also unveiled some steps to detect high-risk groups early and provide timely support. It was meaningful that the central government took the first step to tackle this issue.  However, the ministry cannot do the job properly as it is overburdened with work concerning medical, pharmaceutical and welfare policies, including pension reform, especially given the ministry's workforce and budget shortages. Experts have called for dividing the ministry into two.  Above all, the matter is rooted in a deeper problem of social isolation. That shows why Korea should follow in the footsteps of the U.K. and Japan, which have introduced a Cabinet portfolio exclusively responsible for loneliness. In the two insular countries, the Minister of Loneliness sees that localities and healthcare facilities provide hospice and other medical and funeral services so that even ill wayfarers do not die alone.  Korea must introduce the Ministry of Loneliness and/or the Ministry of Anxiety responsible for increasing mental health problems, eventually leading to deaths and suicides. Loneliness is related to the crisis of democracy, making people skeptical about its value amid rampant hatred and discrimination against losers. Medical experts also say loneliness equals smoking 15 cigarettes daily, eroding longevity.  However, it seems difficult to expect that from an anachronistic, neo-liberalistic government, which puts economic growth ahead of wellness and competition before coexistence. Koreans must wait four more years, provided they can install a more empathetic government.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Cannes"", ""ProvenceAlpesCoteDAzur"", ""France""}","2023-05-21T17:00:08","British director Steve McQueen knows his documentary “Occupied City,” which premiered on the first day of this year's Cannes Festival, may not be what people expect. From him, or from a documentary.  The form is well represented at this year's festival — there are three in competition — but none is as epic in scope or avant-garde in structure as McQueen's.  Based on the Dutch-language book “Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940-1945,” by his wife, Bianca Stigter, it is a four-plus hour-long, street-by-street, building-by-building chronicle of what happened in Amsterdam during the German occupation and what each of those places looks like now.  As the camera captures modern scenes of specific locations all over Amsterdam, narrator Melanie Hyams describes how each figured in the invasion, occupation and deportation of 80% of the city’s Jewish residents, many of whom were murdered in concentration camps.  It is a challenging film to watch and not just because of its subject matter, or even its length. The normality of the modern scenes, gorgeously shot on 35 mm, inevitably offers a disturbing contrast with the narration — a busy school that served as a torture center, a cozy apartment where a Jewish family was discovered and sent to a camp, people ice-skating on frozen canals where the bodies of those who died in hiding were dumped and where many died by suicide.  One contrast after another after another pits your eyes against your ears until it is difficult to keep the images from distracting from the text, and vice versa, to know how to process the information. Are we supposed to be concentrating on the trees or the forest?  This is precisely the effect McQueen planned.  “The way Bianca wrote the text was very factual, so I knew I wanted that — not uncompassionate but matter-of-fact, and then we’re moving on,” he said. “The weight of what happened was so heavy you can’t hold it in your head forever. If you forget things that’s OK because of the magnitude.... It’s a lot to juggle. Like a classical concert, you drift away in one place and come back into another and that’s part of the experience. ‘Occupied City’ is an experience.""  Story continues  “Not a history lesson, an experience,“ Stigter said. “Seeing the film, you are aware of the past that is around you. You cannot activate it all the time, but sometimes it’s interesting to see past and present colliding.”  The two have joined me in the restaurant of the Martinez Hotel just off the Croisette. A power couple by any standards, they are thrilled by the film's reception at Cannes, and happy to be where, as McQueen says, ""films are having conversations with each other."" ""Occupied City"" was born of their shared, and separate, experiences; Stigter is a native of Amsterdam; McQueen has lived there for 25 years.  “Growing up in London, an unoccupied city,” he said, “it was a change to be living in Amsterdam, looking around on a day-to-day basis and realizing, 'Oh, here’s where that happened.' … It wakes you up.”  Steve McQueen in Amsterdam in 2021. (Chantal Heijnen/For The Times)  The book, and by extension the film, began with a question from Stigter’s father. “I was studying history and he wanted to know what actually happened when the Germans came to Amsterdam. How did they know where to go, what to do? And I didn’t know the answer.”  Although “Anne Frank: A Diary of a Young Girl” made Amsterdam one of the war’s most famous occupied cities and the house in which the Franks hid is now a museum, Stigter was surprised at how little information was available. “I realized there were only a few places [where] people knew what happened during the war. I thought I’d write a travel guide book, house by house, floor by floor.”  She took on the daunting task piece by piece, reading a lot of books, going into archives of documents kept by the Germans as well as those of the Jewish Council, which included a 1943 guidebook detailing hiding places, council members' homes, headquarters of clandestine newspapers and other key locations of the Resistance.  As she was writing, McQueen first thought: “Wouldn’t it be interesting to get footage from the '40s and contrast it with today? Then I thought, how great to have the past as text and the living as presence. Our daughter’s school was headquarters of the SS — the whole point, to have living and dead in same frame, to get the present to connect to the past.”  He began shooting in 2019 and, like the rest of the world, was locked down for a time by COVID-19. Indeed, much of the footage serves as a chronicle of the pandemic — a city shutting down, early vaccination stations, anti-vaccination protests, and people partying in defiance.  “It seemed like in that three years, everything was going on,” he said. “Black Lives Matter, climate change, the Ukraine, COVID itself.”  At certain points of the film, the sight of police controlling protesters strikes an alarming contrast to the narration detailing how, in that very spot, Jews and others were rounded up for deportation.  “That’s what happened,” McQueen said, objecting to the notion that he was in some way comparing the two things. “Things change. You have people protesting and you cut to police standing around. The narrative has changed.”  “You get to decide that it’s not the same,” said Stigter.  “Our liberty did not come cheap,” McQueen added. “There is an amnesia about what happened for our freedom. This is to remind people of that.”  McQueen and his crew shot for three years, amassing 36 hours' worth of video that he says he will use “for another presentation somewhere else.” (Stigter is also hoping to publish an English-language version of her book.)  Many scenes take place in people’s homes, often with the residents present — in one a woman dances in her kitchen, in another a person works out on an exercise bike. Most of the people McQueen approached were happy to participate.  “They were interested in the subject matter,” he said, especially the famine that struck the Netherlands during the last winter of the war. “The hunger winter is not something people know about outside of the Netherlands.”  “My grandmother had a recipe for tulip bulb soup,” Stigter interjected. “It’s in the book.”  Only a few of those approached declined.  “Some people didn’t want to know what happened in their house,” McQueen said. “ Some people like to put blinkers on. But life is not Disneyland. All three of us,” he said, including me in his statement, “got here through blood and tears. That’s how we came to this table. A lot of beautiful things happened too, but we mustn’t forget the blood and tears.”  Though not defined by blood and tears, McQueen has never shied away from them. Best known for ""12 Years a Slave,"" he first came to Cannes in 2008 with ""Hunger,"" a film about Bobby Sands and the 1981 hunger strikes in Northern Ireland; his 2021 docuseries ""Uprising,"" made with James Rogan, examined the 1981New Cross fire and how it illuminated and sparked racial tensions in Britain.  In ""Occupied City,"" however, he is not challenging us to remember so much as to recognize the inextricable relationship between the past and the present.  It is not easy to reconcile the ordinary sight of a jogger running through a park, tourists milling in front of a museum, or even a peaceful protest with the constant cataloging of families being yanked from their homes, groups of Jewish men being shot and babies being torn from their parents.  Even with an intermission, four-plus hours of horror take a toll.  “It’s the weight of the situation, it’s too heavy, and that’s part of the experience,” he says. “Film as a form isn’t done. You could do your normal documentary, but I’m using the material to see what I can do with it, pushing the form to communicate in a different way, to get people to engage.”  “It shows you that the past is not stable,” Stigter said. “It’s quicksand under us.”  “If you can rest easy, I’m not doing my job,"" McQueen agreed. ""Because I don’t want you to rest easy.”  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY29sdW1uLWhhcmQtd2F0Y2gtNC1ob3VyLTE3MDAwODU5NS5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2NvbHVtbi1oYXJkLXdhdGNoLTQtaG91ci0xNzAwMDg1OTUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-22T04:18:52","What happened on May 9 would not have been imagined by any patriotic Pakistani or a well-wisher of another country. It was all heart-breaking to see some misguided individuals burning their own house and desecrating monuments of martyrdom with little or no shame! Was it planned, contrived or the outcome of spontaneous outburst is yet to be determined but what has happened is a scar on our collective identity as a nation. This could have been avoided with a few reconciliatory steps taken on time both by the government and the PTI leadership.  But first some hard questions should be asked from those who make and break political order every few years without any constitutionally designated role or public mandate. Why do people rise against the state now and then in different parts of the country? Why would otherwise sane and patriotic people choose to use violent means to be heard? Why do we witness and experience so much intolerance in a country that was supposed to be a model of compassion, place for peaceful coexistence and embodiment of equality?  A person tends to commit suicide when he has no hope left to live with dignity or lose power over his destiny. The May 9 events (which cannot be justified on any ground) should be understood as a form of collective suicide that reflects anger, frustration and utter hopelessness. When laws are trampled under the guise of maintaining order, when fundamental rights are violated to sustain power, and when doors are shut for honest political discussion, expecting peace and stability would not be short of a grand delusion.  Let us have a look at some specifics. There has been a staggering brain drain of professionals over the last one year, economy is teetering on the brink of default with inflation breaking records, industrial production is down by double digits with corresponding rise in unemployment, and the rupee has lost half of its value with little chance of bouncing back in the near future. Investment is moving out more than coming in, thus making the vicious cycle of poverty unbreakable.  To add insult to injury, we have probably the worst government in history which cares more about settling scores with political opponents using all possible means, fair or foul, than to reverse the downward trend. The entire government machinery, at both federal and provincial levels, seems to have bean greased to efficiently crush the opposition and silence dissenting voices. What has been done across the breadth and width of the country has no precedence even in martial law regimes. Blatant abductions, mysterious killings, beatings and dragging, and breaking into homes to intimidate women and children have become the new normal.  What the government has done so effectively so far is to get rid of accountability mechanisms and do away with rule of law. Who would have imagined that the champions of democracy would treat the Constitution as a piece of paper and the Supreme Court with so much disdain! Instead of serving the common man, who can no longer afford healthcare, education, and even food for family, the government has virtually made the country a banana republic.  We should not forget the then East Pakistan. Economic exploitation and political deprivation created so much resentment and anger that the country started to unravel within a few months. The use of force proved counter-productive as it reinforced the belief that power was more important for the ruling elite in West Pakistan than people in East Pakistan. The toxic combination of greed for power and a sense of superiority caused death of the very ideology that had tied the two geopolitically distant brothers together.  Sanity and better sense should prevail now so that healing starts throughout the body. The military establishment should take the lead as it always did in the past during institutional confrontation or political crisis. It can leverage on its relations with all political forces and institutional strength. Instead of reacting to the evolving situation by playing partisan role or making favourites, it should transcend institutional interests and create an enabling environment for democracy to move forward as the basis for national integration and economic prosperity.

BuckhanaCon is a local convention open to all fandoms that started in 2019 after founder and organizer Catherine Fultz arranged a convention for her sister’s birthday. This will be the first year the convention has expanded to two days by popular demand, offering more activities and panels than ever. BuckhanaCon will take place June 10 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and June 11 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Stockert Youth and Community Center.  Tickets will be available for purchase at the door, and children three and under can enter for free; ages 4 to 12 will pay $5; and ages 13 and up will pay $10.  “I think Buckhannon has a lot of people who do not regularly get to just be themselves or express themselves in unique ways, but BuckhanaCon allows them to have that one space where they can dress up as whatever they want to be,” Fultz said. “Our goal is to always be affordable; our prices will probably never change, no matter how much we grow.”  Fultz also emphasized the event will always be family-friendly.  “There are so many events where it’s either for adults, or it’s for children, so the adults take the children, and the adults are bored out of their mind, and the children go with their parents, and they’re bored out of their mind,” Fultz said. “We tried to make an environment that’s fun for all ages. There are lots of vendors that adults can enjoy, and the kids can enjoy their games, quests and interactions, so everyone can participate and express themselves.”  Some of the popular returning events include the BuckhanaQuest, an activity that will last for the entire con. It will be structured to work like a fetch quest from a video game or an elaborate scavenger hunt. This year, returning performers Centauri Prime will be the quest masters, and it will be Star Wars-themed.  “Centauri Prime are recurring every year; they are a Star Wars troupe, so they will do another awesome Star Wars performance,” Fultz said. “They’re an amazing nonprofit organization, so they raise money for different charities.”  The cosplay contest and lip sync battle will also make a dramatic return, encouraging some friendly competition between participants.  “My personal favorite part is the cosplay contest because I get to see how everybody dresses up, how they built their costumes and how they put their love and soul into it,” Fultz said. “I technically compete in the lip sync battle, but I never actually win — I’m not allowed to win the belt.”  Fultz said most of the vendors have not been to the con before, but there are a wide variety of goods that will be available for purchase. She said some new vendors include jewelry makers, plushy makers, 3D print vendors and people making tie-dyed items.  “I’m pretty excited about some of our panels this year too, especially the ‘Dungeons and Dragons character building’ panel because I love the idea of playing D&D, but I’ve never been introduced to it properly,” Fultz said. “I’m also very excited about the ‘Cosplay on a Dime’ panel because I’m always looking for ways to make cosplays for cheap.”  All the concessions at the con this year will be prepared by the Rock Cave PTO to raise money for their school, and all the proceeds from the event will go to a charity raising awareness about suicide prevention.  “We choose a different charity every year, we haven’t chosen a specific organization yet, but the council voted to choose a charity about suicide prevention,” Fultz said. “The event is also solely operated by volunteers and fundraisers we do throughout the year.”  More details about BuckhanaCon’s activities throughout the year can be found on their Facebook page.  2023 BuckhanaCon Schedule of Events  June 10  10 a.m. — Opening Announcements  10 to 10:50 a.m. — Stranger Things Trivia  11 a.m. — Raffle Call  11:05 to 11:45 a.m. — SFX Makeup Tutorial  11:55 a.m. — Raffle Call  Noon — Blood on the Clocktower Game  Noon to 12:40 p.m. — Painting Groot Class  12:50 p.m. — Raffle Call  12:55 to 1:55 p.m. — Youth Cosplay Contest  1:55 to 2:55 p.m. — Adult Cosplay Contest  3 p.m. — Raffle Call  3:10 to 3:50 p.m. — Lip Sync Battle  3:55 p.m. — Raffle Call  4:05 p.m. — Centauri Prime Demonstration  6 p.m. — Closing Announcements and Final Raffle Call  June 11","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWJ1Y2toYW5ub24uY29tL2J1Y2toYW5hY29uLXN0cmlrZXMtYmFjay0yMDIzLWV2ZW50LXRvLWV4cGFuZC10by10d28tZGF5LWNvbnZlbnRpb24tZmVhdHVyaW5nLXN0YXItd2Fycy10aGVtZWQtcXVlc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T13:00:00","Darren Hawkes knows exactly why he wanted to create a garden for Chelsea Flower Show that acknowledges life is full of fear and pain and loneliness: “When we are in despair, what’s common is, we all feel alone. We feel as if that despair is not a shared experience – it’s a personal one. And so, by putting the experience into three dimensions in a public space, there’s a chance it may remind someone that they are not alone. That there are other people who have experienced that.”  Hawkes, an award-winning garden designer, gives up his free time to quietly confront this fact on a regular basis. He has lost friends to suicide and is a listening volunteer for the helpline of the suicide prevention charity, Samaritans, to whom he has dedicated his show garden. “It’s not a real garden. I wouldn’t create this garden for a Samaritans centre. But if, as a show garden, it helps to communicate some of the lived experiences of people who reach out and call Samaritans, that starts a dialogue.”  Depression gave me a fire in my belly that I drew on every day Darren Hawkes  The idea for the garden – or at least, the feelings the garden would evoke – came to him like the fragments of a dream, and the space is intended to have an otherworldly, even nightmarish quality. At the entrance, slabs of reinforced concrete, shaped into brutal, frightening forms by Hawkes’s own hands, hang “uncomfortably low” from thin nylon wires. Unfamiliar, spiny, spiky, thorny plants – including the prickly, towering shape of Aralia chapaensis, a rare shrub – and lots of dark russet foliage crowd the visitor. “It’s the sort of colour you fall into, that draws you in, rather than reaching out to you.”  There is only one way to escape: down a path cracked with deep fissures where the sound of gushing water can be heard. “We can’t see the water, we only hear this crazy turmoil.” Further ahead, a sculpture that looks like a “swirling vortex” of more than 3,000 recycled nails appears to fly out of the ruptured ground, creating a sense of foreboding or even menace. “There’s this feeling of, ‘Is everything closing in on me? Is the ground opening up underneath me? What lies beneath?’”  Hawkes wanted to install a garden at Chelsea that would act as a polemic against the perfectly curated, manicured beauty of other designs. “A lot of what we do in gardens is reflective of good times, and feeling content and happy and at peace,” he says. “So if you’ve experienced loneliness, loss, self-loathing – what does that look like?”  So many gardens at Chelsea are designed to be tranquil, comfortable spaces. “I was interested in doing something that was harder, more authentic, something that dealt with conflict or struggle.”  I was interested in doing something that was harder, more authentic, something that dealt with conflict or struggle.” The Samaritans’ Listening Garden at Chelsea.  Experiences of pain and suffering can transform how you perceive beauty in nature and encourage you to relish the joy in your life. “In our struggle in life, there are moments of absolute bliss when suddenly life, in its pain, is revealed as being so precious.” He cites people living in war-torn parts of the world who take solace from seeing flowers blooming amongst the rubble and destruction. “Plants and garden settings can be places of hope for people in their most distressed time.”  Like distressing feelings and conversations, this is a garden you can’t ignore. “At the front, you have to look ahead and assess and think, ‘Am I ready to step into this? Because I can see something beautiful beyond.’” At the end of the twisty, narrow path, past the crowding concrete and prickly thorns, the garden opens up into a welcoming sanctuary. At the back a bench, sculpted into a L-shape, sits under the canopy of a small-leaved elm. It provides a “listening space” where people can “talk, be heard and gain perspective on their struggles”.  Hawkes hopes that people who have experienced anxiety, sadness, fear, insecurity and depression will feel “a sense of recognition” when they see the garden, a rare opportunity to openly connect with these negative emotions that is not often offered in public spaces. “We don’t outwardly demonstrate these feelings and experiences, because we’re ashamed of them or we feel they need to be overcome. And when we do overcome them, we don’t really want to revisit them.”  His words strike a chord with me. Recently, my mother, Pnina Werbner, died and I am constantly battling immense feelings of loss – particularly in public. I understand exactly what he’s talking about and how isolating such feelings can be. When I have dark thoughts, a common reaction to bereavement, reading poetry about grief has helped me to feel less alone. I ask Hawkes if his garden is intended to be like a poem about loss? “Are you trying to convey that whatever you’re going through, other people do understand – that this garden understands?”  “Yes, that’s it,” he says. “Thank you, that’s it.” He shoots me a look of concern, as though my questions disquiet him. He lost two of his friends to suicide when he was in his early 20s and he feels, looking back, that he could have done more. “The signs were there. But I danced tentatively around them when they were alive and depressed and struggling.”  He wishes that, for example, he had tried harder to take one friend outside for walks and checked up on him more often. “I phoned him and suggested things but, of course, he was never going to say yes.” With his other friend, he failed to acknowledge how tough things were for her. “I was kind of self-obsessed at the time.”  Now, thanks to his training as a Samaritans volunteer, he knows how to listen properly. “Real listening means attending to everything someone tells you. That isn’t just the words they’re using. It’s the pauses between, the shortness of breath, the unsaid things or little clues you might find in a throwaway sentence.”  He tries to offer empathy to his callers, he says, not sympathy. “Sympathy can be patronising and condescending and suggest it’s all going to be OK.” Such an approach is not helpful because it is false. By contrast, “Empathy says: ‘I’m here. I’m here with you, alongside you. I don’t pity you. But I’ll sit with you now, and be comfortable with any discomfort I feel.’”  He hopes his garden will be an empathetic space for difficult emotional conversations, like the Samaritans helpline. “There’s no danger that by talking about suicide, you’ll encourage somebody to take their own life. In fact, it’s probably the opposite. Sometimes, just giving people the space to be able to talk about their feelings can help.”  If visitors do find their emotions are triggered by his garden, he hopes they will leave feeling a sense of pride in their resilience. “I have had times in my life when I’ve been really lonely and lost. And you don’t forget that.” It was a long time ago, he says, when he was a young man, trying to make it in the world and feeling a lot of self-loathing and low self-esteem. He doesn’t often talk about it. “It was horrible and I don’t want to go back there. But I also know that, for years, it gave me a fire in my belly that I drew on every day as a fuel: ‘How can I rise above this struggle? How can I be stronger?’”  To convey this difficult emotional journey that many callers to Samaritans must go on, and the difference that time and perspective can make, the back of each rough slab of worthless concrete in Hawkes’s garden has been lovingly polished, carved and inlaid with gold. “As you pass them, you see that the very obstacles which appeared frightening and difficult are actually things that are very precious – things that, on reflection, you might want to hold on to later.”  This also serves as an analogy about how precious Samaritans volunteers perceive the lives of their callers to be: “It’s a metaphor about taking people, who consider their life not worth living, and saying, ‘Right now, you’re important enough for me to listen to you. I’m going to listen to everything you tell me. And I care.’”  At the end of the interview, he makes a decision. He invites me, quietly, to talk about myself. I tell him about my mum. He listens, and he listens. And I cry.  Samaritans Listening Garden, designed by Darren Hawkes, is at Chelsea Flower Show until 27 May.

"suicide","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""LakeWorth"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T22:02:46","LAKE WORTH BEACH — For many modern literature lovers around the world, the news that the British writer Martin Amis died here Friday may have been the first mention they ever saw of Lake Worth Beach, the small city by the sea where he chose to make one of his homes.  For many here, the news brought the first mention that the author and journalist, renowned for sardonically summing up the angst and absurdity of his generation, lived among us.  Amis was 73, and died of esophageal cancer at his Lake Worth Beach home, according to his wife, writer Isabel Fonseca. The author of 15 novels as well as essays, articles, and literary criticism collected in eight volumes, he was perhaps best known for his 1973 breakout novel ""The Rachel Papers,"" and a trilogy of London novels: The 1985 ""Money: A Suicide Note,"" the 1990 ""London Fields"" and the 1995 ""The Information."" He also was the son of author Kingsley Amis, one of the “angry young men” — novelists and playwrights who changed the course of British literature in the 1950s.  His Florida home was on the north end of Lake Worth Beach, where real estate prices are high, but homes are modest, behind head-height ficus hedges in a white corner cottage-like house.  He lived so quietly here that although you can find 10 of his novels, and 27 works to which he contributed at the Palm Beach County Library, and three at the Lake Worth Beach City library, for the decade he owned a home here, he went unnoticed by local media. He didn’t interact with the British expat charitable St. George’s Society of Palm Beach.  And if he did book events — he published at least two of his novels and, in 2020, an essay collection — since buying a home in Palm Beach County, he hadn’t in recent years; the Palm Beach Book Store, which over the years has carried dozens of titles by him, as well as by his father, now carries none.  But even though we didn’t see him, he saw us. Early in his career, when he was about 30, he visited the island of Palm Beach and wrote about it for the British Tatler, in an essay later published in the 1986 collection “The Moronic Inferno: And Other Visits to America.”  With an eye for details that would change only slightly in the decades to come, he observed: “There is no sign of any work going on here. There is no sign of anyone who hasn’t got lots of money.” He noted that “the only monikers with an aristocratic tang are brand-names — perfumes, cars, domestic appliances.” And that: “People talk obsessively about real estate — partly, I suppose, because it is an informal way of talking obsessively about money.”  While many outsiders forget to differentiate between the island and the mainland, he wrote that on crossing the bridge “you are immediately confronted by . . . booming chaos.”  But when it came time to retreat from the London literary scene where he felt over-scrutinized, as the son of an author who before him had summed up the absurdity of his own generation, Amis chose a small city over the bridge, where, if he liked, he could go unnoticed.  avbarton@gannett.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jvb2tzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvbWFydGluLWFtaXMtbGl2ZWQtaW4tbGFrZS13b3J0aC13cm90ZS1hYm91dC1wYWxtLWJlYWNoLzcwMjQxNTIxMDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T13:00:00","Connect Summit County, a mental wellness nonprofit, partners with the Summit County Health Department behavioral health team to provide various services that are mandated by the state.  Courtesy of CONNECT Summit County  Around 6,800 Summit County residents are expected to receive government-funded behavioral health services this year — a more than 800% increase from when the Summit County Health Department revamped its mental health and substance abuse programs five years ago.  The number was expected to level off over the next few years, Director of Behavioral Health Aaron Newman told the Summit County Council last week, but he said there’s also been a decline in the number of clinicians left in the field. In the meantime, the Health Department’s behavioral health division is working to address local needs through its strategic plan.  Summit County is mandated by the state to provide a series of behavioral health services ranging from adult and youth inpatient, outpatient and residential mental health care as well as 24-hour crisis care, services for the incarcerated, school-based mental health intervention and recovery support services.  The Health Department offers these programs through its behavioral health network, which is made up of 92 clinicians in Summit and Wasatch counties as well as 2,700 others located across the state. It has a budget of around $9 million. The county contracts Medicaid and state-funded services through Healthy U Behavioral and the Huntsman Mental Health Institute.  However, Huntsman is experiencing challenges as its caseload increases. There’s also been a 17% decrease in active licenses in Summit County between 2022-2023, according to Newman. He said nonprofit providers have maintained a 40% increase in services since the end of the pandemic. There’s a 42% decrease in the number of clinicians taking commercial insurance, too.  Newman attributed this to mental health providers who have become more selective in the clients they see. Telehealth also plays a role. He noted one Summit County psychiatrist who transitioned exclusively to virtual services, eliminating office space and staff, and moving to a self-pay model — where the average price for services has jumped from $125 in 2021 to $175. This provider can no longer exist in the county’s network, leading more people to rely on Huntsman.  “How do we maintain quick and simple access to services?” Newman questioned, saying officials are committed to finding creative ways to maintain the quality of care they’ve offered for several years.  The Health Department is striving to address the issue by finding a way to encourage more people to study psychology or psychiatry in college. Newman said they are looking into scholarships that would help support prospective mental health professionals during the junior and senior years of their bachelor’s degree as well as provide internship opportunities and supplemental income while they work toward their master’s.  Other trends this fiscal year include an increase in the number of clinicians specializing in LGBTQ services. Newman emphasized this isn’t conversion therapy, but additional training that gives providers sensitivity and insight into a particular area. It’s likely the current political environment and a slew of anti-LGBTQ legislation in Utah and across the country have contributed to an increase in people seeking mental health services. The Health Department recognized the need for LGBTQ-specific services in its mental wellness strategic plan.  Other trends include a reduction in the number of clinicians willing to see substance use disorder clients as well as more people with severe mental illness leaving the area because of the high cost of living. These clients are often moving to Salt Lake and Utah counties, and Newman said it’s important these individuals “don’t fall through the cracks.”  The top three diagnoses for adults were generalized anxiety disorder, depression and relationship counseling; specifically to help navigate coworker relationships as people return to the office. Youth diagnoses included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation.  Newman noted local statistics related to suicide and mental health are comparable to the national averages. He said spring is the most common time for adults to attempt to take their life, while rates for youth are higher between August and September.  However, the THRIVE program, a project to empower and strengthen youth that was created by Live Like Sam and Well-being Elevated, has so far been effective as a preventive mental health initiative. Newman said Summit County youth have reported a 23% reduction in depression, a 26% reduction in anxiety and a 5% increase in quality of life during the first year and a half of the THRIVE program.  Pamella Bello, the director of behavioral health prevention for the Health Department, also highlighted programs designed to encourage parents to become more active in their children’s lives as a way to reduce risky behaviors. The team held 23 training sessions and 35 prevention-based events last year.  County officials planned to review the behavioral health contract with the University of Utah before it expires next July. Newman said they are too far out to discuss any potential changes.  9-8-8 is the national crisis line. People who call or text the number will be connected to a trained counselor. The suicide hotline is connected to a center in Salt Lake City, which can dispatch Summit County’s mobile crisis outreach team.

"suicide","2023-03-21","23:00:00","{""Queenstown"", ""EasternCape"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-22T04:16:53","“You do not deserve to be my mum. You certainly do not deserve my love.”  That was the message a mother received from her 11-year-old son before he and his stepfather disappeared in 2015, never to be seen again in one of New Zealand’s most baffling missing persons cases.  Swedish-born helicopter pilot John Beckenridge, based in Queenstown, broke a parenting court order and picked up his 11-year-old stepson, Mike Zhao-Beckenridge, from his Invercargill school on March 13 in 2015.  In the following days there were reports of the pair being spotted in the remote Catlins area, at the southernmost point of New Zealand.  Eleven days after their disappearance, police discovered the wreckage of Beckenridge's car at the bottom of a 90-metre cliff near Curio Bay in the Catlins.  John Beckenridge (left) disappeared with his step-son Mike Zhao-Beckenridge in March 2015. Photo: Supplied  Initial indications by police divers were that there were no bodies in the car, but it was not able to be recovered for six weeks until May 6, due to rough conditions at the site.  However, Mike’s mother Fiona Lu is convinced her son is still alive and her former partner staged the pair’s death after she moved her son away from Beckenridge’s Queenstown home to Invercargill with her new partner.  Now, Coroner Marcus Elliot will look into the case at the Christchurch District Court and hear from a number of witnesses to determine if he has jurisdiction to hold an inquest at a later date. An inquest would only be held if it was determined that it is likely that the pair are dead.  The hearing, which began on Monday, was expected to take two weeks and would hear evidence from witnesses, including a woman who believes she spotted the pair overseas four months after their disappearance.  Police have spent thousands of hours investigating the case but have had no success in finding out exactly what happened.  Mike would now be 18 years old.  John Beckenridge's car was found at the bottom of an 90m cliff near Curio Bay. Photo: STEPHEN JAQUIERY/ODT  Today, opening statements were made by Lisa Preston, KC, assisting the Coroner, outlining the background of the case.  Beckenridge met Mike’s mother, Lu, who is from China, in 2006. Lu’s parents were raising Mike at the time.  The pair later moved to New Zealand with Mike where they were based in Queenstown. Their relationship broke down in 2014 shortly after Lu moved to Invercargill.  In February 2015, the Queenstown Family Court made an order that Lu had care of the boy.  The court was told Mike was unhappy to be taken away from his stepfather and was secretly communicating with him by email, pleading for Beckenridge to come to take him away from his mother and her partner Peter Russell.  Mike told Beckenridge he was misbehaving so he could be sent back to live with his stepfather. He also called police on one occasion, saying his mother had assaulted him in hopes he would get sent back to Queenstown.  On March 13 in 2015, Beckenridge dropped off a box of documents and a letter for his Queenstown-based lawyer asking him to contact his friend in relation to his trust fund and estate.  The letter read: It will now be up to him how to do with what is left of my “belongings” ! Thanks for your assistance over the years . Very helpfull!”  That same day, Beckenridge took Mike from his school sometime between a pre-lunch roll call and the end of the day and drove them to the southern Catlins area.  Police were alerted and a search party launched, with concerns raised about the risk of a murder-suicide.  Border alerts were put in place, including for Beckenridge’s aliases Knut Goran Roland Lundh (his birth name), John Robert Lundh and John Bradford.  Fiona Lu, the mother of Mike Zhao-Beckenridge, believes her son is still alive. Photo: supplied  On March 19, police located a campsite off Weir Rd on the Haldane Estuary and the pair’s fingerprints were detected on some items.  The next day Beckenridge’s friends began receiving “concerning” texts from him, stating the “Gestapo” was after him and Mike and they would soon be getting on the “Midnight Express” for departure.  Heartbreaking messages to Lu from Mike expressed his frustration at her not listening to him, stating “you do not deserve to be my mum or to be called Fiona and you certainly do not deserve my love. From Mike.”  Beckenridge also sent a message to Lu, thanking her for being his wife while also accusing her of lying and deceiving.  On March 22, items belonging to the Beckenridges such as clothes and car parts washed ashore in the Curio Bay area. Soon after, Beckenridge’s vehicle was found at the bottom of the cliff in the water.  Tyre marks found at the top of the cliff were analysed by an expert, who will give evidence during the hearing.  A stake made from two pieces of wooden stick tied together with a rope was also placed 10m from the cliff edge, something police suggest was used to give a sightline to the cliff edge.  A senior constable who analysed the likely speed the vehicle was travelling before it went over the cliff indicated it was not possible for a person to safely exit the vehicle at a minimum speed of 45km/h.  The Police National Dive Squad were able to dive on the wreckage of the vehicle on March 29 but it wasn’t until May 6 that the vehicle was able to be recovered.  There had been extensive further damage to the vehicle from when it was first discovered, and no forensic evidence was detected.  Since then, police have spent thousands of hours investigating the case but have been unable to solve it.  The hearing before Coroner Elliot continues.

The search for solace led her to the Hirsh Mental Health Center in Los Angeles, where she found support from other people who had suffered the consequences of that scourge.  ""When I met other mothers, other people, who lost someone, seeing the pain, that they carry, [that] I also carried, we got together and survived together,"" Ybarra-Bryant said. ""It was already a community of survivors.""  Ybarra-Bryant became a volunteer at the center to offer the help she had received there to others.  ""[I want to] help other parents,"" Ybarra-Bryant said. ""Don't let this broken heart happen to her, losing her son, her daughter to suicide.""  Although her son is no longer with her, Ybarra-Bryant says she feels him all the time.  ""Every night when I see a shining star I say, 'I love you, Nathan,'"" Ybarra-Bryan said. ""With that, it fills my heart, I'm happy, knowing that he is the brightest star.""  Resources for those who suffer in silence  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that 45% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth considered suicide, compared to 15% of heterosexual teens.  But there are resources to prevent another death and for this community of the population to continue suffering in silence.  ""We can help anyone who is having a crisis, suicidal thoughts, or simply looking for help for anyone else,"" said Karla Centeno, the bilingual coordinator for the 988 Crisis Line.  The 988 Line has been around for many years but recently changed to that number to be easier to remember.  ""We want the person to open up, tell us what is happening at the moment,"" Centeno said.  Many of the calls come from LGBTQ youth  ""Some of the reasons LGBTG youth are calling out is depression, isolation, peer problems at school,"" said Franklin Romero, of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.  Bullying at school and in social networks further affects LGBTQ youth who already have risk factors.  ""But just being LGBTQ isn't what puts you at risk, it's the environment, your family, school, peers, the community where you live,"" Romero said.  The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has hired specialized counselors for the past two years.  ""At any time, 24 hours a day, any child in our community can call and speak directly with a person who has the training to speak with them and then refer the student to another professional,"" said Alberto Carvalho, LAUSD superintendent. ""LGBTQ kids are under pressures that other kids don't understand and don't get past.""  Reducing the risk of suicide  Specialists highlight the importance of eliminating myths around this problem.  ""Many times we think that if we talk about suicide, the thoughts increase,” Centeno said . ""It's the other way around, if the person tells us about what's going on, we can reduce the risk, and that's our goal.""  Regardless of the numbers, just one death by suicide is already a great loss that could have been avoided.  If you or someone you know needs help, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline on 988, or the Crisis Text Line by texting ""Home"" to 741741, at any time.

Director Mona Achache plays herself in the film, a woman trying to understand why her mother committed suicide and who discovers a stash of thousands of letters and photographs that provide insight into a person she doesn’t recognize. Enter Cotillard, as herself, taking on the role of the mother and bringing her, in a way, back to life in order to retrace her journey.  Cotillard said she felt very close to these women because, “a lot of women in this world had experienced this relationship to men. My mother and my grandmother and even further have had this journey through very difficult relationships with men and sexual assault. I was very touched by this quest because it’s a journey to healing.”  When I asked her how far she thought the film industry has come since the early days of #MeToo, she exclaimed, “We still have a long way to go!” She added, “I always have in mind this woman who goes to another march, another walk with her sign saying ‘I can’t believe I’m still here dealing with this sh*t’.”  Marion Cotillard on the state of #MeToo, in conversation with Deadline’s Nancy Tartaglione at the American Pavilion in #Cannes pic.twitter.com/n3HJuXgT7M — Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) May 21, 2023  Cotillard continued, “I’ve been an actress for a long time; I was [put] in situations that I shouldn’t have been in…There still are some sick men, and women sometimes, who will take advantage of the youth, who will take advantage of the passion that we have as an actor, the fact that we depend on the desire of directors, producers.”  Marion Cotillard on experiencing sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, speaking with Deadline’s Nancy Tartaglione at the American Pavillion in #Cannes pic.twitter.com/O8KI40ps6R — Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) May 21, 2023  But, she sounded a positive note, “To know that today those young actresses know that this is not right, that if someone asks you something that you’re not comfortable with you can say ‘No.’ I didn’t know that when I was a young actress, it was a very different time.”  Turning back to the festival at hand, Cotillard recounted her favorite Cannes memories, noting that the red carpet for Jacques Audiard’s Rust & Bone was something special. Recalling further back, she said that after finishing La Vie en Rose, for which she ultimately won the Best Actress Oscar, the team made its way to the market here to show off a 10-minute reel: “We felt that something was happening, and that was a fantastic thing to live because I understood. I would run into people and they would say ‘Oh my God, we saw those 10 minutes,’ and we felt the desire that was rising.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvbWFyaW9uLWNvdGlsbGFyZC1tZXRvby1ob2xsbHl3b29kLWxpdHRsZS1naXJsLWJsdWUtY2FubmVzLTEyMzUzNzQ3MjAv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9tYXJpb24tY290aWxsYXJkLW1ldG9vLWhvbGxseXdvb2QtbGl0dGxlLWdpcmwtYmx1ZS1jYW5uZXMtMTIzNTM3NDcyMC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Senior leadership will be questioned about the systemic nature of workplace pressures that are unique to the Royal Australian Navy, as well as associated risk factors for suicide and suicidality.  The inquiry will hear evidence about the structure of leadership at Fleet Base West, which comprises HMAS Stirling and Force Command Units, 60km south of Perth, and the various clinical services available to support the mental health and wellbeing of sailors while they’re on shore or at sea on deployment or operation.  The Royal Commission will also hear evidence of a disturbing number of suicide-related incidents at HMAS Stirling, home to approximately 2,000 personnel, in recent times.  Commission Chair Nick Kaldas said leadership and accountability within the Defence chain of command continue to be a key focus of the inquiry.  “I’ve said before that we, as a nation, need to be doing more to protect the health and wellbeing of those who put on a uniform everyday and go to work to protect us,” Commissioner Kaldas said. “We will continue to shine a light where problematic cultural and systemic issues exist within Defence and ask tough questions of leadership about what they’re doing to fix those issues to support and protect their people.”  Later in the week, the Royal Commission’s focus will turn to inter-governmental support for serving and ex-serving ADF members.  WA Minister for Defence Industry and Veterans Issues, the Hon Paul Papalia CSC MLA, will be asked about state government support and how it interacts with Commonwealth initiatives.  The Royal Commission’s Perth hearings will conclude on Thursday (25 May 2023).

"suicide","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T16:01:53","Background: ""Either/Or"" Thinking  Binary thinking -- either/or thinking -- is the opposite of quantified, dimensional thinking and it is especially dangerous in medicine and mental health. It is the thinking of division. It falls short of even one dimension of complexity. For example, who can deny the ever-present tendency to identify flank fullness with or without ascites, a heart attack with or without chest pain, and, as a cautious mental health corollary, self or other murder with or without mental illness.  Is this either/or thinking an ingrained tendency or tactic in mental health? To be sure, when employed -- inadvertently or intentionally -- it can effectively obscure meaningful understanding beyond mere description. It represents a cognitive shortcut or defense against intolerably complex problems. Indeed, in mental health, this approach has caused the extremely traumatized public to find it impossible to make sense of interviews or commentary, or to trust in those responsible for mental health care.  Foreground: Dimensional Thinking  I trained and practiced in the intensely disturbed and disturbing world of the psychiatric emergency room. Whatever the personal or professional challenges, self or other danger required quantification, not ""yes/no"" reductions.  Acute psychological pain, strange motivations, weird intoxication, and atypical forms demanded differentiation from enduring and rigid mental health issues often characterized by bizarre interpersonal manipulation, self-centered gross disregard of others, and other personality disorders, some of which can lead to dangerous and deadly behavior. There were also persons admitted who had self-amputated body parts, driven stakes through victims' hearts, murdered siblings, or engaged in unusual strangulation. Some self-murder cases involved unobvious side effects to antidepressant medications, various forms of akathisia, and dissociative acute stress disorders.  Revisiting the opening binary caveat, are murderous acts the result of the presence of an acute, psychopathologic state, as in delusions and hallucinations? Or, on the contrary, could they represent an enduring trait of deficient psychological health with lasting interpersonal callousness and hostility?  Acute and chronic conditions can exist in the same person, in the same context, and at the same time, such as enduring heart failure with new onset STEMI or lasting type 1 diabetes mellitus with acute ketoacidosis. A mental health example illustrates that although acute paranoid schizophrenia is not a personality disorder, it may feature long-term patterns of eccentric behavior.  In this respect, the awful acts of predatory violence currently seizing our nation cannot be reduced to an either/or resolution. The latest attack in Allen, Texas, is the country's 22nd mass killing (defined as an attack where four or more people died, not including the murderer) in 2023. Without fail, the first question of many following these dreadful events represents yet another binary expression: ""Did mental health play a role?""  An A/B Dimensional Formula  As an illustration, violence can be identified by point A, absence point B, and written AB. This, of course, ignores dimensionality, which if accounted for, would look like: A ... ... ... B.  In a more correct formulation, where AB represents cross-factor products, not only are there intermediate points between A and B, but there are also dimensional points above and below the line. Therefore, in the vast space of self or predatory ideation and acts, there are many intersecting coordinates, such as age, gender, race and ethnicity, religion, shame and humiliation, family history, non-psychotic pathology, neurologic illness, medications, parent authoritarian style or overprotection, legal issues, alcohol and substance abuse, early onset behavioral disorders, and availability of firearms and other lethal methods. The list goes on.  Final Acts of Self or Other Murder, and Suicide by Cop  A healthy and adaptive personality requires the ability, on balance, to understand the plight of others who are less fortunate. This develops in children by stressing the validity of their feelings and providing consistent self and unconditional attentive love. A temperament without integration of empathic competency is a mixture leading to consolidation of impulsivity, grandiosity, and heartlessness. That is, they lack a conscience and have associated cognitive inconsistencies, rigid maladaptive prejudices, and persistent irresponsibility. The unique and shared acute and chronic features of a consolidated narcissistic sociopath (narcissistic and antisocial personalities) can be particularly challenging and potentially dangerous.  Children who are raised with hostility or who are indifferently regarded by caregivers are taught that failure leads to less love and affection. The child's sorrowful experiences of abuse, exclusion, abandonment, and/or humiliation, when re-experienced in older adolescence or young adulthood by shaming, may replicate the early narcissistic injury. This internalized trauma, often unobvious to or unanticipated by family, friends, clinicians, or teachers, can then be projected dimensionally (i.e., outwardly and murderously upon others, inwardly or savagely upon self, or both).  Highlights  Yes/no binary thinking is particularly dangerous in medicine and mental health. Severe mental illness, including psychosis, is less reliably predictive of mass murder. Many mass shooters either take their own lives at the scene (final act) or were killed by law enforcement (suicide-by-cop). The distinctive and shared features of the narcissistic sociopath are unusually dangerous. A personality temperament without integration of empathic competency is a mixture leading to consolidation of impulsivity, grandiosity, and callousness.  Recommendations  Be suspicious of simplistic, single-plane analyses. Focus on early family dynamics and social drivers as significant violence accelerants, regardless of ""pure"" diagnosis, in persons when coupled with experienced or threatened interpersonal shame. The federal law background check for ""mental defective"" is obsolete, vague, and requires an upgraded and comprehensive definition. Beyond means restriction and safe storage, increase red flag law judicial burden of proof to ""clear and convincing,"" a standard consistent with mental health civil commitment. Universal and synchronized mental health background checks for all guns, including soft and higher ballistic armor sales, represent a potential solution to some categories of gun violence.  It stands to reason that additional training in, and screening for, unusual violence phenotypes, with enhanced cooperation among schools, mental health, and legal institutions, should reasonably interrupt and reduce the rate and awful burden of deadly self-harm and other violence.

Check out the clips below.  The band's setlist was as follows:  01. A New Level  02. Mouth For War  03. Strength Beyond Strength  04. Becoming  05. I'm Broken  06. Suicide Note Pt. II  07. 5 Minutes Alone  08. This Love  09. Yesterday Don't Mean Shit  10. Fucking Hostile  11. Planet Caravan (BLACK SABBATH cover)  12. Walk  13. Domination / Hollow  14. Cowboys From Hell  The reformed PANTERA played its first U.S. concert on May 6 at the Thunder Beach Motorcycle Rally in Panama City, Florida. The performance marked PANTERA's first live appearance in its home country in 22 years — since July 25, 2001, when the band played at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington as part of the ""Extreme Steel"" tour.  PANTERA's setlist for Welcome To Rockville and the Thunder Beach Motorcycle Rally included one song which hadn't been performed live since the band's comeback last year: ""Suicide Note Pt. II"", from PANTERA's 1996 album ""The Great Southern Trendkill"".  PANTERA's current lineup includes two surviving members from the band's classic formation, Philip Anselmo (vocals) and Rex Brown (bass),along with guitarist Zakk Wylde (OZZY OSBOURNE, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY) and Benante (ANTHRAX).  Anselmo and Brown, along with Wylde and Benante, are headlining a number of major festivals across South America, Asia, North America and Europe and staging some of their own headline concerts. They will also support METALLICA on a massive North American stadium tour in 2023 and 2024.  According to Billboard, the lineup has been given a green light by the estates of the band's founders, drummer Vincent ""Vinnie Paul"" Abbott and guitarist ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott, as well as Brown, who in 2021 said Wylde wouldn't tour with PANTERA if a reunion were to happen. It's unclear what changed his mind.  This past March, PANTERA headlined the 2023 ""comeback"" edition of Japan's Loud Park festival. The two-day ""limited"" event took place on March 25 at Intex Osaka in Osaka and March 26 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba City near Tokyo.  In December, PANTERA played seven shows in Mexico and South America.  Benante opened up about his participation in PANTERA's return during a recent interview with ""THAT Rocks!"", the new weekly YouTube series hosted by Eddie Trunk, Jim Florentine and Don Jamieson. Speaking about some of the criticism he has received for his involvement with PANTERA, Charlie said: ""People had their preconceived notions of what they were gonna think: 'Oh, I don't dig this without Vinnie and Dime.' And of course… What do you think? We don't know that Vinnie and Dime are not with us anymore? But when we start playing the songs and you just see the faces in the crowd, all that shit goes out the window, the negative stuff that has been said.  ""Man, that's all I ever wanted to do, is just come and do this and make people hear these songs again,"" he explained. ""And that's what it's all about, really. It's about the music.""  Asked who was in charge of making the decision to use the name PANTERA for the new lineup instead of calling it a tribute or naming it something else, Charlie said: ""It wasn't me. [Laughs] For us it was about the celebration of the music and Dime and Vinnie; that's what it was about since day one. No one called it a tribute; no one called it a reunion. It can't be a reunion. This is a celebration of the music of PANTERA. Come and enjoy it. And that's it. That's all could do.""  Benante also talked about his personal connection to Dimebag and Vinnie, saying: ""Yeah. I loved those two guys, man. You never think that certain things would ever, ever happen, and then when it does, you sit back and think, like, 'How did this happen so fast? How did this time just slip by?' And Darrell's been gone for a while now. But it doesn't change how we all miss him and feel him.  ""Every show that we play… [Longtime PANTERA engineer, bass tech and friend] Sterling [Winfield], who used to work for PANTERA — still does, in a sense. The first show, he came to Mexico City and he brought me one of Darrell's wristbands and a pair of Vinnie's gloves that they used. And every show that I've played so far, I wear the wristband and Vinnie's glove is in my pocket because I feel like they're with me. And I do that for every show, and I'll continue to do that for every other show we play. It just has significance.""  Benante previously discussed his involvement in PANTERA's comeback during a recent interview with Consequence. Addressing the negative comments he has received for his participation, Charlie said: ""I don't go [online] looking for [people's negative comments about it]. There's people that send me, 'Hey, did you see this?' And I'm, like, 'Why did you send me this? Why ruin my day?'  ""I think the people who do these things, these comments, I don't even think they realize how much of an effect that they could have on people,"" he continued. ""And whether or not you hate the situation, or whatever it is, why can't you find some sort of restraint? Why do you need to say this thought that you have? Can't you just hold it in and maybe be, like, 'I'll keep my thoughts to myself.' No, they've gotta tell you. I've never seen more of it in my life than I [did] in these past couple of months about just people judging.""  Regarding his personal approach to playing the parts originally written and recorded by Vinnie Paul, Charlie said: ""I just spent a lot of time on Vinnie's parts and more importantly the tone that Vinnie had because I wanted it to sound like PANTERA. That was my thing. And my drum configuration is different from the ANTHRAX one because I wanted to challenge myself to play those parts like he played them in that configuration, which, to me, was more important than anything. But yet people still have to find some problem in that.""  According to Benante, the initial rehearsals for the PANTERA comeback tour were ""an emotional thing"" for Philip and Rex ""too, because they hadn't played as a group, those two hadn't played together in a long time, playing PANTERA songs. Yeah, they played [together] in DOWN, but this was an emotional thing for them,"" Charlie said. ""And I remember after the week of rehearsals that we did, saying goodbye was weird, because it was an emotional thing; we really kind of bonded, the three of us. Zakk wasn't there at the time. But for me, I knew I had done something right.""  Brown was forced to leave PANTERA's Latin American tour after testing positive for COVID-19. Filling in for him at some of the shows was CATTLE DECAPITATION bassist Derek Engemann, who also plays with Anselmo in both PHILIP H. ANSELMO & THE ILLEGALS and SCOUR.  Up until his passing, Vinnie remained on non-speaking terms with Anselmo, whom the drummer indirectly blamed for Dimebag's death.  Vinnie Paul and Dimebag co-founded PANTERA. When PANTERA broke up in 2003, they formed DAMAGEPLAN. On December 8, 2004, while performing with DAMAGEPLAN at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, Dimebag was shot and killed onstage by a troubled schizophrenic who believed that the members of PANTERA were stealing his thoughts.  Vinnie passed away on June 22, 2018 at his other home in Las Vegas at the age of 54. He died of dilated cardiomyopathy, an enlarged heart, as well as severe coronary artery disease. His death was the result of chronic weakening of the heart muscle — basically meaning his heart couldn't pump blood as well as a healthy heart.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYmxhYmJlcm1vdXRoLm5ldC9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLXBhbnRlcmEtcGVyZm9ybS1hdC1mbG9yaWRhcy13ZWxjb21lLXRvLXJvY2t2aWxsZS1mZXN0aXZhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Carolina was unable to sweep the day, as the Seminoles took game two 1-0, ending the season for the Gamecocks.  The game one win for South Carolina was the first loss for Florida State at home in over a year. The Gamecocks end their season with 40 wins for the first time since 2018, their second time under head coach Beverly Smith.  GAME 1  The Gamecocks struck early on the No. 3 seed Seminoles, scoring twice in the bottom of the first. Jordan Fabian led off with a single down the left field line and Zoe Laneaux followed with a bunt single, advancing to second on the throw. Riley Blampied laid down a suicide squeeze bunt, scoring Fabian. One out later, Jen Cummings singled down the left field line, scoring Laneaux.  South Carolina put an exclamation point on the game in the fifth. A walk and an error put two runners in scoring position. Aniyah Black stepped in, and with a full count, singled through the left side, bringing home Fabian and Blampied.  Carolina’s pitchers allowed just two hits on the day, two singles to lead off the first and second innings. They retired the final 18 Florida State batters in-a-row. Karsen Ochs started and threw three innings, allowing two hits and struck out two. Donnie Gobourne (14-7) earned the win as she came on and was perfect over the finale four innings, striking out four.  GAME 2  The Gamecock offense was just not able to get going in the winner-take-all game, as they were held without a base runner in the game.  The lone run came in the bottom of the third, when FSU scored on a throwing error off a bunt.  Bailey Betenbaugh (9-3) took the loss, as she allowed four hits in 2 1-3 innings. Gobourne finished out her Gamecock career throwing the final 3 2-3 innings, allowing two hits and striking out one. Gobourne finished her season with 203 strikeouts, 13th most all-time in a season.

"suicide","2023-03-14","Not Discerned","{""Burlington"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-21T10:18:45","Emboldened by supermajorities in both chambers and a “sea change” in public opinion, Democrats and Progressives in the Vermont Statehouse carried three significant pieces of firearms legislation across the finish line this legislative session.  It was, in the estimation of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden, one of the most successful sessions for gun control advocates in recent years — matching what he called the urgency posed by gun violence rates in Vermont and across the country.  This year’s roster consisted of S.3 — already signed into law — which bans paramilitary-style training camps such as Slate Ridge; S.4, which would primarily bring Vermont state laws on straw purchasing and serial number tampering in line with federal law; and most high-profile of all, H.230, which would implement safe storage rules, broaden existing red flag laws and institute 72-hour waiting periods for gun purchases.  While S.4 and H.230 have yet to become law — and might require a veto override to do so — the central question on the minds of both supporters and opponents is: Will they hold up in court?  ‘A sea change’  Democrats and Progressives had the numbers on their side this year.  They held onto their 23-seat majority in the Senate in last November’s elections and expanded their hold on the House to a combined 109 out of 150 seats. That gave enough seats to reliably override vetoes by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has repeatedly said that he doesn’t believe Vermont needs to institute additional gun control measures following the historic package he signed into law in 2018.  Beyond the parties’ strengthened hand, Baruth said this year just felt different on the issue of guns. “That something that’s in the air is fear,” he told VTDigger last week.  “Within a week’s time, there are multiple mass shootings of different kinds, disturbing in different ways — involving children, involving trans Americans, involving gay nightclubs, churches, supermarkets, racist shootings, people driving cars and shooting into groups of migrants,” he said. “So I think there’s a genuine fear that we’re living in a time where the number of guns is astronomical, and the trend is in the wrong direction.”  Even among Vermont Democrats, Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, noted that there has not historically been consensus on the issue of gun control, and fears of electoral blowback have pervaded in a state with a long history of gun ownership and sportsmanship. The last Democratic governor, for example — Peter Shumlin — opposed nearly every piece of gun control legislation contemplated during his tenure.  This year, though, she pointed to “the fatigue of gun violence” among voters and her legislative colleagues. “It’s palpable,” she said.  “I think that we’ve gotten to a point where we’re just sick to death of it,” Black said. “These legislators have always been very fearful of what this would mean for elections. You know, there’s a very vocal minority, and it can be intimidating. And I think that it’s not just Vermont — I think this country, I think we’re just tired of it. … It just felt like there was a sea change last summer.”  Politically brilliant or dishonest?  Unlike S.3 and S.4, H.230 was titled as a suicide prevention bill. Breaking legislative tradition, the bill was first assigned to the House Health Care Committee, rather than the House Judiciary Committee.  Black, the bill’s primary sponsor and a member of the health care committee, testified to her colleagues about her son, Andrew Black, who died by suicide using a firearm in 2018, mere hours after he purchased it.  Black described to her colleagues the gruesome reality of death by firearms — how she had to clean her son’s brain matter off the walls of his bedroom, and, when she couldn’t remove it all, how she painted over it. She and medical professionals such as Dr. Rebecca Bell, a pediatric critical care physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital, described the suddenness of a gunshot, explaining that suicide attempts by firearm are far more deadly than other forms, such as medication or self-harm. Ninety percent of patients who survive a suicide attempt don’t ultimately die by suicide, Bell testified to lawmakers — but for those who attempt suicide by gun, there’s rarely any going back.  The point they were trying to make was that gun deaths — particularly those that are self-inflicted and those that are suffered by young people — constitute a public health crisis.  Baruth called the move politically “brilliant.” As Republicans nationally have adopted a strategy of pointing to mental health — not the prevalence of guns — as the root cause of gun deaths, Baruth said H.230’s stalwarts flipped the script.  “What they were trying to do was build a record of testimony that this bill would affect the suicide rate,” Baruth said. “And so they built that record, painstakingly.”  Chris Bradley, president and executive director of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, on the other hand, told VTDigger he thought the bill’s machinations curtailed an honest debate.  “If you look at the trajectory of this bill, H.230 was a short-form bill up until the last minute,” Bradley said, referring to the bill’s brief, vague nature upon its initial introduction. “No, that is not how bills get done — not in my experience, not when we’re being forthright and honest about what’s being discussed.”  The Bruen question  But even with the caucus numbers and public opinion polls on Vermont lawmakers’ side, a new precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court threatens to undermine firearms legislation passed not just this year, but in years past.  In a majority opinion issued last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down New York’s decades-old gun licensing system. The precedent set by the case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, established a new legal test requiring that “to justify a firearm regulation, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”  The “historical tradition” test has sent federal courts into a tailspin, inspiring well-funded interest groups to challenge both old and new firearms regulations in courts across the country.  Within the first weeks of this year’s session, the Vermont Legislature’s legal counsel warned that the new Bruen precedent could land lawmakers in uncharted legal territory should they pass any new gun control measures. Heeding those words of caution, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee — including Baruth — stripped language from S.4 that would have prohibited Vermonters under 21 years old from obtaining semi-automatic weapons, explicitly citing the section’s legal vulnerabilities under Bruen.  But lawmakers opted to keep the 72-hour waiting period in H.230, despite hand-wringing by gun rights advocates, the Office of the Defender General and the governor’s office over its constitutionality. They did, however, add what’s known as a severability clause to the bill — a sign they recognize the likelihood of a legal challenge.  “In general, all our statutes are considered by (legislative) counsel to be separable, so if one piece is unconstitutional, the rest can continue,” Baruth said. “But H.230 has an explicit severability piece, so there’s no doubt that if waiting periods were struck down, safe storage would remain in force, expanded (red flag laws) would remain in force.”  Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Scott, told VTDigger last week that the governor remains skeptical of the provision’s constitutionality. Scott could sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. Of those three options, Maulucci said a signature was “unlikely.”  Should Scott opt for a veto, the vote records on H.230 suggest that legislative leaders would be able to marshal the two-thirds majority required to override him. The House gave final approval to the bill in a 106-34 vote, while the Senate granted preliminary approval in a 21-9 vote.  While Bradley isn’t thrilled about any provision of the bill, the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs chief said that H.230’s 72-hour waiting period provision is “really the most nasty, in my humble opinion.”  “The absolute core of the Second Amendment is self-defense,” Bradley said. “If you had some scumbag threatening you or wanting to do bad things, you have a constitutional right to be able to say, ‘I’m going to defend myself. I don’t want to be a victim.’ ”  With the addition of a severability clause, Bradley said lawmakers showed their hand in questioning the constitutionality of their own bill.  “Now, there’s only one reason they put a severability clause in: That’s because they knew — they knew — they were not sure of its constitutionality,” Bradley said.  A lawsuit in the making?  Bradley declined to say this week whether the federation would sue the state should H.230 take effect. “You’re not putting any words in my mouth. Sorry. That’s off the table,” he said when pressed.  The gun rights group did unsuccessfully sue the state when Scott signed a slew of gun control measures into law in 2018. After a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on S.4 in January, Bradley harked back to that lawsuit, saying at the time, “We’re not backing away from our stance to support our rights, even if it means taking things to court.”  This week, he stayed mum on the federation’s legal strategy, but he did point to pending legal challenges to waiting periods in Colorado and California. “And there’s going to be others,” he added.  “If you’re familiar with the Bruen decision, on top of (previous decisions), there’s no way a waiting period can stand constitutional scrutiny for the simple reason that, at the time of our founding, or up to the date of ratification of the 14th Amendment, there were no laws whatsoever that said, ‘Chris Bradley can’t go right out and buy a gun,’ ” Bradley said.  Black said she knows that the waiting period provision could be challenged in court. She also said that she’s confident that a similar law could have saved her son’s life. As battles over gun laws unfold throughout the country, she questioned why Vermont should take a wait-and-see approach.  “Are we supposed to just sit back and wait years and years and years?” Black asked. “How many more people have to die while we wait?”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZuZXdzLmNvbS9WZXJtb250LURlbW9jcmF0cy1wdXNoZWQtdGhyb3VnaC1tYWpvci1maXJlYXJtcy1sZWdpc2xhdGlvbi10aGlzLXllYXItV2lsbC1pdC1ob2xkLXVwLWluLWNvdXJ0LTUxMDM2Mjcw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2017-02-17","Not Discerned","{""Liverpool"", ""Liverpool"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T00:13:28","The first thing you notice as you approach The Martin Gallier Project is a large blue-sky mural above the office windows. It depicts a bright, clear day with a cloud formation shaped into a loving heart. The mural acts as both a beacon of hope and as a signal to all those passing - you’re welcome here.  So, what is The Martin Gallier Project? Simply put, The Martin Gallier Project saves lives.  The project was named after Martin Gallier who was just 55 when he died by suicide in February 2017. Martin’s tragic death prompted his daughter, Jessica Gallier to found a charity in his name which has helped tens of thousands of people in times of crisis.  READ MORE: Woman knew it was 'bad' when told she had stage four cancer  The charity specialises as a suicide prevention service and to date, 23,000 people have walked through their doors. They also work to reduce the stigma around suicide by raising awareness and offering support to people who need it. Additionally, the support also extends to people bereaved by suicide.  It’s barely possible to imagine the human cost if places like The Martin Gallier Project didn’t exist.  The offices for The Martin Gallier Project are in a part of New Chester Road where murals are not uncommon, and which brighten up an area struggling with issues of deprivation. The murals indicate the resilience of the local community and bring focus to an important truth - people care about this place and want the best for it.  This was how the project was able to create a base of operations in 2019 - taking on a lease with a relatively low rent but with a requirement to renovate the building. Within a week they’d cobbled together some plasterboard, paint and other building materials and set about creating office space and consultation rooms.  They were able to do this solely because the community rallied around and offered their full support. They raised funds, offered their trade expertise, did odd jobs, and filled in wherever and whenever they could.  Within two weeks The Martin Gallier Project opened its doors and within the first few hours, it was clear just how much this little hub of hope was needed by people from all over Merseyside. Sadly, the demand for their services has only increased over the last few years.  Jess is under no illusions as to why the project is so desperately needed and she has the personal experience to back that up after the tragic death of her own father.  Lifelong Liverpool fan Martin was described by Jess as lovably eccentric and a bit of a joker with a great sense of humour. Jess says it’s important for people to know this because people at risk of taking their own life can present in many different ways and it’s not always obvious when someone is suffering.  Like so many people who are struggling with their mental health, Martin was ""suffering in silence"" and therefore, his pain was not readily apparent to those outside of his family. It was a set of circumstances which ultimately led to him taking his own life.  Jessica said: ""From the outside you probably thought here he is, Martin Gallier - funny guy. But it was only really us as a family who knew that it was all a bit of a show really.  “Every time we save a life or save someone from suicide, it helps me probably as much as it helps them because it takes a little bit of that pain away from losing my dad.  “I always say that setting this charity up saved my life in a way and gave me the purpose I needed to try and prevent this from ever happening to other families”.  Jessica set the charity up while still mourning the death of her father, and having just become a mum. Like many people bereaved by suicide, she wanted to know why this had happened and what could be done to prevent it from ever happening again. The resolve, bravery, and commitment she has shown in the face of such tragic circumstances and in confronting such an important issue, is truly awe-inspiring.  During a year-long inquest into her father’s death, Jessica was shocked at how little support her father received and how many times he’d been failed by mental health services struggling under the strain of under-investment and increasingly unmanageable demand.  This shock and frustration became the impetus for Jessica to start something which could add real value to mental health provision in Merseyside and a service which would be available to all.  The idea was to create a non-clinical and welcoming environment that would act as a hub and point of access for people in crisis. After designing and developing a programme of services the fundamental offer was to provide simplified and practical tools for people to stay alive and it has had a huge impact.  It's instructive to consider the experiences of the people who work there and the stories of the people whose lives have been saved by them.  A lot of the professionals at The Martin Gallier project have lost someone to suicide. It’s by no means a requirement to start work there but, it’s not hard to imagine why these people were chosen for their roles. The passion, care and love they show for their clients is something which is immediately apparent.  When you walk through the doors you step into what appears to be a living room and you're welcomed by Em who offers a friendly and disarming smile and an invitation to come in and talk. This is all natural and easy-going, but there is also a key logic at play.  The project is the antithesis to a clinical environment and encourages a homely atmosphere where people can be at ease. It’s a space which has welcomed tens of thousands of desperate people looking for help.  It is not uncommon for the professionals at The Martin Gallier Project to see their clients out and about with their families shopping, dining in cafes or walking in the park. There may be a knowing glance as someone whose life was saved nods in appreciation. There may be nothing at all because the service is entirely confidential. Often, the support workers are approached and embraced by family members and friends of the individuals who have accessed their services. Why? Because they know their loved ones are there because of the help they gave them.  The gratitude is overwhelming to see and it’s impossible not become emotionally impacted by the heartfelt thank yous from people who had benefited from The Martin Gallier Project. Two in particular drew our attention on the day. The first was simply and powerfully put.  “I held my granddaughter this morning. If I hadn’t spoken to someone, I would have missed that.”  The other, a bit longer, is equally impactful:  “The difference between being here and enjoying friends, and leaving unhappy and sad family behind, is just talking to Jess at the right time. Thank you”.  As a visitor to the centre, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the stories and become saddened at the realities of other people’s lives. However, it’s also unsettling because it’s clear suicide, thoughts of suicide or knowing someone affected by suicide is all too common. Suicide does not discriminate and can touch the lives of everyone regardless of their personal situation.  That’s why The Martin Gallier Project is a space of inclusivity because they never want someone to feel unwelcome. The stakes are too high. One failed intervention can mean the difference between life and death. It is a responsibility they take seriously and are not willing to compromise on their vision. One can only wonder how they get through each day without breaking down themselves:  “We do have our wobbles”, says Jess.  “We lean on each other. we’ve all experienced loss due to suicide and we have strategies to support each other because it can be very emotional at times. All the time really.  “Everyone chips in, and everyone’s contribution is invaluable. Just as well, because everyone is needed.”  (Image: Jessica Gallier)  As we speak to Jess, Em is on reception speaking on the phone and you can hear them reassuring someone and letting them know they can help them. Support workers rush from room to room to start phone calls or take appointments with people needing support. Emails, texts, social media messages flood in. The demand for their services does not appear to be diminishing. 23,000 people and counting and Jess is already thinking toward 24, 25 and 26,000.  Jess said: “Suicide is not inevitable. It is preventable and that is what we try to do each day”.  This week is Mental Health Awareness Week 2023. It is a good time to consider the challenges we face in addressing the mental health crisis and an opportunity to celebrate the work of projects like The Martin Gallier Project.  For them, it is one of many avenues to raise awareness and support, but for them and charities like them, they are never unaware of the stark challenges we face when it comes to providing effective resource and support to mental health services.  However, Jess and her team are up to the task and will continue to do what they do best - save lives and save futures. Just ask the 23,000 people who’ve walked through their doors.

She said: ""I'm not saying he [Rishi Sunak] has socialist tendencies but clearly it feels at the moment that they are more left of the party than Thatcher-right conservatism which I support.

Jenkyns criticised net migration figures which are expected to more than doubled from pre-Brexit levels GB News  ""It's a tightrope at the moment and we don't want to necessarily bring a leadership change because that will mean there will be a general election and we will end up with 100 seats the way polling is going at the moment. ""We can't do political suicide over this at the moment, this is one where we need to put pressure on the Prime Minister to get back to more conservative type policies. ""And we must really get these met migration figures down and it's disappointing that the Prime Minister is not committing to the target that was set in the manifesto."" As the Prime Minister travelled to Japan for the G7 summit, he was asked three times whether he still stood by the manifesto pledge that ""overall numbers will come"" down.  At the time of the 2019 election, net migration stood at just over 250,000 but figures set to be published next week, are expected to show the figure hit 700,000 people last year. Sunak could only say he wanted to bring ""down legal migration"" and refused to say whether he was committed to lowering it from 2019 levels. In the coming week, analysts expect new estimates from the Office for National Statistics to show net migration topping one million.

"suicide","2022-07-02","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T13:30:43","To reinforce that “breast is best” for babies and that formula feeding is inferior, in 2022, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) affirmed its decades-long stance in favor of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), meaning nothing but breastmilk, arguing for this in the first six months and calling breastfeeding and human milk “normative” and “a public health imperative.” The policy stated that “medical contraindications”—reasons not to breastfeed—“are rare”; the only “true” ones, according to the organization, are infants with galactosemia (a metabolic disorder) or parents with HIV.  Looking back at my own experience, I’m convinced that the pressure to breastfeed contributed to my developing postpartum anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I later learned that this pressure could harm mental health in even more acute ways, including potentially increasing the risk of suicide. I was struggling but determined to breastfeed exclusively because I believed that it would reduce my child’s risk for several diseases and boost lifelong achievement. I was wrong, largely because I was misled. As a reproductive rights activist and journalist who has covered issues concerning kids and food since 2014, I agree with the growing opposition to the decree that exclusive breastfeeding is imperative. Barriers to breastfeeding are real and disproportionately affect marginalized people, many of whom return to work not long after childbirth. The fight for the right to breastfeed rages righteously, and I consider myself a fervent supporter. At the same time, adoptive and other parents who can’t provide human milk or choose not to feel shamed. No matter how cherished our right to breastfeed is, so is our right to feed our infants with or without our bodies.  Because we are told that science shows that “medical contraindications” to exclusive breastfeeding are rare, millions of parents wonder what’s wrong with us when it doesn’t work out. Though breastfeeding proponents suggest that true physiological issues that contribute to low milk supply are “rare,” this science is hardly conclusive. Some studies show that everything from breast surgery to polycystic ovarian syndrome to diabetes to chronic stress and far more can disrupt lactation, and, together, these conditions affect far more than one in 10 birthing folks. Christie Del Castillo-Hegyi, an emergency medicine physician, mom of three, and co-founder of the nonprofit Fed is Best Foundation (FIBF), says that the push for universal EBF makes it “difficult to understand the nuances, the exaggerations and the risks of such a recommendation.” The FIBF’s mission is to advocate for families who have encountered complications in attempting to adhere to EBF. The reliance on breastfeeding can also lead to a violation of children’s right to be satiated.  Proponents often say that breastfeeding is “free,” but it’s not. There’s the cost of our time, effort, pumping equipment and the pausing of pursuits. Those costs and benefits vary for different people. I didn’t realize that EBF would take so much out of me. As I recovered from a traumatic birth, my baby cried unless she was on my breast, which many EBF advocates say is normal, so I nursed constantly. When we were discharged from the hospital, she had lost 9 percent of her birth weight, which was within the 7–10 percent that’s considered normal in an EBF newborn in many birthing facilities. I was told to continue nursing “on demand” at home. On day four of her life, I was devastated to learn that she had lost over 12 percent of her weight. Our doctor recommended supplementing with formula, assuring us that it would be okay and that I could wean off formula in a few days. I felt anything but okay.  Fortunately, my newborn didn’t have to be readmitted to the hospital, or worse. It’s crucial to know the signs that a newborn isn’t getting enough milk, including crying all the time when not on the breast. Extreme dehydration can have severe immediate and long-term consequences. Rarely, it can be fatal. EBF advocates suggest that colostrum, or drops of the clear substance excreted before copious milk production, is plenty to feed a newborn in the first few days of life. But it’s not always enough. EBF is not Mother Nature’s design. Caregivers have fed infants substances in addition to or instead of their own birth parents’ milk and in many cultures for a slew of reasons, including milk supply taking a few days to “come in” and personal preference. These alternatives included milk from human wet nurses and animal milk.  Bottles of formula saved my baby and me. That weekend, following frequent breastfeeding sessions, my partner topped off our voracious newborn with formula while I spent another 20 minutes with an electric pump to further stimulate milk production. The three-day around-the-clock ordeal produced the desired effect. Soon, I was making enough milk, and we ditched formula. It didn’t occur to me that I had the choice to skip the strife and use formula from the get-go instead of avoiding it, using it with a sense of shame and then toiling to stop using it.  “The amount of emotional freight that's attached” to EBF “is grossly disproportionate to the benefit,” says Daniel Summers, a pediatrician and father of four who supports patients’ choice to use formula. The formula industry’s predatory historical and current practices don’t mean that formula is inherently bad or that human milk is “best.”  None of this is to say that it’s a lie that breastfed infants fare better than their formula-fed peers on a population level. Rather, it’s not the human milk conferring better outcomes. The bulk of infant feeding data are observational and come with confounders. In wealthier nations, people who breastfeed tend to be more financially secure, live near fewer hazards and have stable co-parenting relationships. Sibling studies account for these confounding factors because siblings are exposed to similar environments. In 2014, U.S. researchers looked at thousands of siblings born since the 1980s. Breastfed babies from different families had a lower incidence of asthma, hyperactivity, and more; they also showed higher reading and math comprehension than formula-fed babies. When they compared babies who were breastfed with siblings who received formula, almost all of those differences became insignificant.  The bottom line is, safe human milk, infant formula prepared correctly with safe water, or a combination of both are fine choices for full-term infants. Privilege and better outcomes go hand in hand. For meaningful interventions that lead to positive outcomes, Summers would like to see support around “the actual logistical needs” of disadvantaged families. An important note: human milk has been shown to protect premature newborns from a life-threatening bowel infection that can cause holes in intestinal walls. For full-term infants, even though breastmilk contains some remarkable substances, there isn’t evidence that it’s the mechanism behind superior short-term and long-term outcomes.  It’s easier to put the onus on parents to exclusively breastfeed than to solve systemic problems that impact kids’ well-being. All humans have the right to consider the pros and cons of using their bodies to feed their newborns and make their own informed choices, including the choice to use formula, whether the reason is a medical contraindication or straight-up not wanting to.

Stephen Zipprich was named the ""911 Dispatcher of the Year” in competition covering North America.  PORTLAND, Oregon — A 911 dispatcher from Portland has won a big award. Stephen Zipprich was named the ""911 Dispatcher of the Year” in competition with 50 other nominees from across North America.  For ten years, Zipprich has worked at Portland’s Bureau of Emergency Communications, where thousands of calls come in, many of them involving life or death situations.  Systems and protocols have changed, but the senior dispatcher at BOEC has always kept this in mind: ""You never know what you're going to get, but knowing, remembering that the person on the other end of the phone matters. And that they deserve my compassion and my empathy,” Zipprich explained.    It's that kind of caring put into action on the job that got Zipprich nominated for 911 Dispatcher of the Year, one of 51 nominees out of tens of thousands of dispatchers across North America.    That got him a trip to a conference in Denver last month for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch. The organization is a worldwide leader in emergency dispatch protocols and systems.  That's where he heard a 911 call he took last year that exemplified his work. An excerpt was played for conference attendees to hear.  “Then I heard my voice come through the speakers and that's when I knew I had won, and it very emotional” said the 911 dispatcher.  It's a big deal for a humble guy like Stephen Zipprich.    “I am proud that I got it, honored that I got it. Honestly, I’m honored.”    But much more important than the trophy is what Zipprich was able to do that helped him earn it: helping save the life of a suicidal woman who was intentionally overdosing, but then called for help.  After taking the call, Zipprich assured the woman she was not in trouble, then began asking questions that helped him understand the situation.    “You have a knife-- alright, is your breathing normal for you,” he asked.  Along with a suicide crisis counselor on the line, Zipprich was able to help the woman hang on.    The call went on for about 20 minutes before police and paramedics took over, with the lifesaving already well underway on the phone. Here is another excerpt of the call, with Zipprich responding to the woman:  “You said that you want me to not let you die today. And I don't want that to happen so I would really like for you to stay where you are so that help can get to you and find you.”    For work like that, the honor of the award is great, “But if I went my entire career in 911 communications and never got this, I would still be proud of the work that I do, that I get to help people every day,” said Zipprich.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtndy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3BvcnRsYW5kLTkxMS1kaXNwYXRjaGVyLWF3YXJkLzI4My0zNTNlNGIxNS0zYzk4LTQ3MjctYjMxMi03Y2EyMGEzNGFhOTTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-02-14","15:00:00","{""Charlotte"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T13:57:06","To the Editor:  After reading the text messages exchanged between members of the Iredell-Statesville Schools Board of Education, I would like to say that I am highly disappointed in the “leadership” we have in the school district. As a gay student, I feel extremely disrespected, unwanted, offended, and exasperated towards our current board.  Board has clearly violated its own policy  The Iredell Statesville Schools Board of Education Policy Manual, Policy Code: 4000 Focus on Students, states the following:  The board recognizes that providing students with the opportunity to receive a sound basic education must be the primary focus of each school, the school district and the board. To support students in their formal education, each school should strive for a learning environment in which:  ♦ school grounds, buildings and classrooms are safe, orderly, clean and inviting;  ♦ students learn and practice responsible behavior;  ♦ students are treated fairly; and  ♦ students have input in decisions affecting them when feasible.  As a student and member of the LGBTQ+ community, I feel obligated to provide my perspective on this issue. I believe that it is a feasible time to provide my input on a situation that is affecting me.  School board members are focused on party politics  During one of the board’s exchanges in the text messages, District 5 Board member Mike Kubiniec, inquired about a mental health grant that the district applied for. Mr. Kubiniec wants to make sure that “gender identity/affirming ‘care’, LGBTQ+123ABC ‘care’, and other such things” are not in the grant before it is approved. Mr. Kubiniec would allow a larger grant to be lost than to provide mental health care to struggling LGBTQ+ students in the district. In my opinion, this member values party politics over the wellbeing of all students. This is political for the following reasons:  ♦ Conservative mass media outlets speak out against Gender Affirming Health Care;  ♦ Mr. Kubiniec clearly does not believe that gender identity/affirming care is true care;  ♦ State legislatures across the U.S. are passing various bills such as Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill prohibiting gender identity/affirming care.  Instead of focusing on the need for LGBTQ mental health care, Mr. Kubiniec wants to focus on advancing his “non-woke” agenda. He references the LGBTQ+ community as “LGBTQ+123ABC.” That is insulting. By doing this, he is mocking this community. That phrase was not made with good thoughts. Mr. Kubiniec is trying to use his power as a school board member to advance his political views rather than trying to support the district’s students. The school district had no plans to use the grant funds to specifically help LGBTQ+ students. As Superintendent James texted: “No, we write our grants so none of that would ever be written in.” Instead of pushing his personal political beliefs, Mr. Kubiniec and the rest of the board should be working to support efforts to help students.  ‘A walking talking version of the books that should not be here’  Matthew Thomas-Reid, an LGBTQ advocate, was scheduled to speak at an afterschool club meeting at Oakwood IB School. Before moving on to high school, I attended Northview IB under Dr. Carrie Tulbert’s leadership. I know for a fact that the staff at the school does not push a political agenda. If anything, this event would have been an event related to tolerance or open-mindedness. These are traits that these board members need to adopt. In the illegal text messages, Distric 3 representatitve stated that she was uncomfortable with the event. The superintendent replied, “Yes, sad. Matt did teach for us years back. He wanted to do research last year with doctoral students and I told him no.” I was shocked by Mr. Kubiniec’s response when he questioned why the board allows “this type of stuff – optional or not.” District 4 representative Doug Knight’s comments were also very telling: “This man should not be in our schools pushing his agenda. A walking talking version of books that should not be here.” How inappropriate. Why do board officials get to dictate what students are exposed to? If it is not going to hurt the student, and they have the option to not view the content, and it is appropriate, then why conceal it? The only agenda I see being pushed is this board’s anti-LGBTQ agenda. People like this are the problem.  LGBTQ students need empathy, not hate  Here are a few statistics from the Trevor Project, a non profit suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ youth:  ♦ For people aged 10 to 24, the second leading cause of death is suicide (Hedegaard, Curtin, & Warner, 2018).  ♦ LGBTQ youth are four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers (Johns et al., 2019; Johns et al., 2020).  ♦ The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that 45 percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth.  As a community, we cannot wait for suicide to happen. This is a problem in our national community. We need to stand up and take preventative actions before it is too late. In order to prevent suicide, we need to recognize that we are not going to fully understand what other people are going through. We need to try to be more empathetic people.  A few preventative factors for LGBTQ youth suicides include:  ♦ Having an accepting adult can reduce the change of an LGBTQ youth committing suicide by 40 percent. You don’t even have to encourage it – just accept it.  ♦ A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in Transgender Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from adults and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year.  ♦ Reduced suicide rates can come from schools and homes that are LGBTQ-affirming.  ♦ Having Gender and Sexuality alliances can reduce the risk for depression.  We need a school board that understands that LGBTQ students are people — we are not mistakes or products of years of indoctrination. LGBTQ students deserve to be respected and given an environment where they have the ability to function just as well as their counterparts.  Unethical board members have demonstrated they are unfit to serve  Every member of the Iredell-Statesville Schools Board of Education should resign. These members have demonstrated through their words that they have no moral compass when it comes to the wellbeing of all students. As Board Policy 4000 says, “all students should be treated fairly.” When a group of students is targeted, they are not being treated fairly. What took place in this group text is highly inappropriate and unethical and should have never happened. If these board members are not going to resign, then they should make a public apology to the district’s LGBTQ+ students.  Editor’s Note: The writer is a rising junior in an I-SS high school. The student’s name is not being published due to concerns for the student’s personal safety and wellbeing.

"suicide","2023-05-08","Not Discerned","{""QueensCounty"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T02:43:51","""Tell Asian Stories"" (photo: Don Pollard/Governor's Office)  As Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, May is a month of celebration. It is also a time to highlight Mental Health Awareness and commemorate Mother’s Day. But while many of us are celebrating, some are coping with a gaping void left by those who died by suicide in the past year.  Though updated suicide statistics for 2022 are not yet available, we’ve seen the stories reported by community media outlets of individuals in our community who are no longer with us. It’s all heartbreaking.  Take Flushing, Queens, where Asians make up more than 70% of the population. At least four high-profile Asian women have died by suicide in the neighborhood since last May. What’s even more tragic is that family members or friends of most of them told the media that these individuals had shown some signs of distress before they were swallowed up by despair. As we know, these tragedies are often preventable if they had received proper care. But finding those necessary resources is not always easy for Asian American and immigrant women.  Statistics and studies, although far from extensive, have shed light on AAPI women’s critical needs for mental health services through the years. For example, data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Minority Health shows that suicide was the leading cause of death for Asian Americans aged 15-24 in 2017-2018, and Asian American girls, in grades 9-12, were 20% more likely to attempt suicide compared to their white peers.  An annual survey released by MetroPlusHealth this month sounds another alarm. The latest data from the city-owned affordable health insurance entity finds that Asian women face greater mental health risk than many others. Despite recent attention on anti-Asian violence, 41% of respondents had been called a racial slur in the past year. This prejudice was not only from strangers. For example, 48% of participants said they have encountered racial discrimination in the workplace, almost double the average for women citywide.  With the backdrop of these devastating statistics, there is a positive note – Asian women have gained a greater awareness of mental health issues. The vast majority of respondents, 77%, said they would encourage their family members and friends to seek professional mental health services, 10 percentage points higher than last year. While 84% agreed that talking to a mental health professional would positively impact their life, 16 percentage points higher than the previous year.  However, whether higher risks and greater awareness can transfer to obtaining help successfully is another story. The survey finds only 45% of Asian women said they know a community-based organization providing mental health services in their preferred language. The importance of linguistic and cultural competency in mental health services for immigrants and immigrant communities cannot be emphasized enough. How do you explain your sadness or trauma in your native language? How do you express and accept affection when it is not a cultural practice?  The solutions are coming from community groups and healthcare providers who lower the difficulty of seeking help. To close the language gap, the Asian American Federation created a mental health directory serving nearly 18,000 people with a list of in-language professionals in various neighborhoods throughout New York City to ensure every Asian New Yorker who needs mental health care is able to receive it in the language they are most comfortable speaking.  While providing access to professionals is a priority, we must also work towards more transparent conversations at home. In traditional Asian families, regular usage of the word “love” is unusual, and the term “mental health” simply doesn’t exist in many Asian languages and dialects — and when it does, the counterpart often carries significant stigma. This is where representation can make an impact.  The AAPI community has a long road ahead of us in tackling the mental health gap. For us, perhaps the journey can start this month with some simple steps. Hug your mom, tell her you love her and ask how she’s feeling. Open the lines of communication that normalize expressions of affection and care. It is also our hope that more people in broader society will work towards language inclusivity and accessibility to make mental health resources more equitable. That way, next May and thereafter all Asian grandmothers, mothers, and daughters who should be here to celebrate will be here.  ***  Luna Liu is marketing manager of MetroPlusHealth, a New York City-based nonprofit health insurance company.

Caitlyn Scott-Lee, who was autistic, was found dead last month on the grounds of Wycombe Abbey, a prestigious £44,000-a-year independent school for girls.  Her father, Jonathan Scott-Lee, said that his daughter had made an appointment for herself with the doctor for her ""anxiety, depression and having suicidal feelings"" on March 30.  The 41-year-old told the Sunday Times that Caitlyn was referred to Buckinghamshire's child and adolescent mental health services.  Deemed 'low risk' after phone consultation  After a phone consultation with a mental health nurse three days later on April 3, she was assessed to be ""low risk"" so a specialist appointment was made for weeks later on May 16.  But Caitlyn took her own life on April 21 in Wycombe Abbey’s theatre, the night before her first two-hour “headmistress’s detention”.  The 16-year-old had become fixated on the detention, which had been imposed after vodka and a tattoo kit were discovered in her music locker just before the Easter holidays.  Such was her concern over the detention she decided to run away from a prestigious choral event on March 21 at Eton College, where she had been due to sing.  Mr Scott-Lee, a senior executive at HSBC, said he wants Caitlyn’s story to lead to change so that neurodiverse children get the support needed in schools and medical settings.  ""Nothing will bring back my eldest daughter,"" he told the Telegraph. ""Yet during sleepless nights of grief, I find myself wondering whether Caitlyn’s name can catalyse bipartisan societal change.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvZ2lybC1zdWljaWRlLXd5Y29tYmUtYWJiZXktZGVlbWVkLWxvdy1yaXNrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An official said that Mukesh Shukla, station house officer (SHO) of Amaria police station, was placed under suspension after a report by a top officer found that he had exhibited “negligence in handling the case.”  An internal report by Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Anil Kumar Yadav found that SHO Shukla had not displayed fairness in investigation and delayed the filing of report against the accused.  According to reports, the police had allegedly refrained from filing a case and instead “forced a compromise between the accused and the complainant”.

On May 9, an 11-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly abducted by three men—all in their 20s— and later raped for an entire night before being let go.  The victim returned home the next morning and narrated the ordeal to her parents who then approached the police. However, the cops allegedly refused to file an FIR and instead mediated a “forced compromise” between the victim and the accused in presence of some relatives.  Reports said that the cops did not even call or inform the rape survivor’s parents and instead SHO Mukesh Shukla “mediated” the compromise and “closed the matter.”  The victim’s family has alleged that the police refused to file their complaint and were asked to leave by the cops.  They claimed that the accused also threatened to frame the minor girl’s father in a false case and allegedly even filed a fake complaint against their father on May 16 wherein the prime accused claimed to have consumed poison due to “harassment” by the Dalit man.  The distressed man, a marginal farmer, eventually died by suicide on May 17.  An official said the police registered an FIR against the accused on May 17 under sections 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape), 306 (abetment of suicide), 342 (wrongful confinement), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the POCSO Act and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

The then-19-year-old paced the walkway for nearly 40 minutes on September 25, 2000, before he leaped over the four-foot rail and plummeted 25-stories at a speed of 80 miles per hour towards the frigid waters. The drop lasted just four seconds.  'The millisecond my hands left the rail it was instant regret,' Hines told DailyMail.com  While he was mid-air, Hines managed to position so that he crashed feet-first into the water.  'I kept thinking, this is not real, I am not in this water, I did not just jump off this bridge, this did not just happen,' he said.  And, that is when he said he started to pray. 'I said, God please save me. I don’t want to die.'  Hines crushed his spinal vertebrae and broke an ankle, but miraculously survived. He is one of only 36 people to do so.  Kevin Hines was in a deep state of despair and hoplessness when the voices in his head told him to 'jump' from San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. 'The millisecond my hands left the rail it was instant regret,' Hines told DailyMail.com  In September 25, 2000, Hines spent nearly 40 minutes pacing the walkway before he leaped over the four-foot rail and plummeted 25-stories at a speed of 80 miles per hour towards the frigid waters  While he was mid-air, Hines managed to position so that he crashed feet-first into the water. 'I kept thinking, this is not real, I am not in this water, I did not just jump off this bridge, this did not just happen,' he said  Since the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937, there have been 1,800 suicide deaths to date, according to the nonprofit organization, Bridge Rail Foundation, whose mission is to end suicides on the landmark.  Now, Hines, 41, works tirelessly as a mental health advocate, motivational speaker and author, and travels the world to share his story of survival and resilience.  During high school, Hines had been a championship wrestler and on the school's football team, but began struggling with his mental health and by the age of 17 he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  He contemplated killing himself twice in 1999, but was saved. The first time was after he read a passage from Dwayne, 'The Rock,' Johnson's biography that spoke to him in one of his darkest hours. The second time was a message the late rapper DMX, aka Earl Simmons, preached that pulled him back.  On September 25, 2020, he contemplated suicide for a third time and traveled to the iconic bridge.  'I hopped on the bus to the Golden Gate that was filled with at least a 100 people. 'I was hoping that someone would stop me. I was crying my eyes out, yelling at the voices I was hearing,' he said.  'Nobody said a thing. They were laughing at my pain.  'I was so overwhelmed, in such despair because of my depression. I had been dealing with mania depression, paranoid delusions, hallucinations, autoimmune, visual panic attacks and of that was culminating into one day for me.'  When the bus arrived, Hines said he paced the walkway for 40 minutes, and at one point, a woman approached him.  'I thought she was going to ask if I was okay, but she asked me to take her picture. I must have taken her picture five times,' he recalled.  'She was there to create happy memories and I was there to die.'  Then she walked away. And he jumped. A woman, who he has never met, saw him plummet as she drove along the bridge and frantically called a friend at the US Coast Guard who happened to be manning the waters that day.  Hines is pictured hugging one of the Coast Guard members, Marcus Butler, who he credits with 'saving my life'. Butler also features in Hines' 2018 documentary, Suicide: The Ripple Effect.  On average, 30 people have jumped The Golden Gate Bridge each year, with the first death taking place months after its completion in 1937  As Hines hit the swell, he said he felt a sea creature beneath him, and later learned it was a sea lion helping him stay afloat.  'I was drowning. I couldn't get back to the surface. I was going down and this sea creature began circling beneath me, bumping me up... keeping me afloat until the Coast Guard would arrive.'  Within moments, help arrived. One of the Coast Guard members was Marcus Butler, who Hines credits with 'saving my life'. He also features in his 2018 documentary, Suicide: The Ripple Effect.  Once Hines was rescued, he was rushed to a nearby hospital's ER and a nurse on duty said he was apologetic, but in excruciating pain.  Though Hines suffered a significant spinal injury, he did not sever his spinal cord. He also escaped without suffering any serious brain injuries, due in part, to the way he hit the water feet-first. The impact fractured the lower portion of his back, in the area where the spinal cord ends. Trauma experts who worked on him said it was the best case scenario.  Hines' said the physical injuries eventually healed but the emotional scars still remain.  Hines, now 41, is a mental health advocate, motivational speaker and author  A year after his attempt his father took him back to the Golden Gate Bridge.  'We had picked a flower earlier that day - a purple tulip with gold pollen inside and a beautiful green stem and some leaves - when we got to the bridge I didn't want to go. I didn't want to do it. I was like, 'Dad, I can't do this.'  'My dad said we need closure. And so I get there and he goes, show me exactly where...so I showed him the exact rail where I jumped. We held hands and we said the Hail Mary prayer. I then dropped the flower with my right arm.  'I watched the flower slowly hit the water and then it made the tiniest ripple effect, hence the name of our film, 'Suicide: The Ripple Effect.  'And, two feet to the right popped up a sea lion. It was arguably the most beautiful moment I've ever shared with my father next to him being the best man at my wedding.'  Kevin Hines newest book, 'The Art of Being Broken: How Storytelling Saves Lives,' is set for release on September 12  Hines said that after surviving his jump, he later found himself in 10 different psychiatry units.  During one of those lock-ups he met the woman who would later become his wife, Margaret Hines.  Margaret, he said, had been visiting a relative who was in the same psych ward as he was in. Hines called it 'love at first sight.' The pair wed three years later.  'She is an incredible human being, who has saved my life more times than I can count my appendages.'  In 2018, Hines produced the award-winning documentary, Suicide: The Ripple Effect.  The film chronicles Hines personal journey and the ripple effect it has on those who have been impacted by his suicide attempt and his life's work since.  The film highlights the stories of individuals and families who are utilizing their personal tragedy to bring hope and healing to others.  Since its release the film's release has had a global impact reaching hundreds of thousands of people that span more than seven countries.  Hines has written three books: Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After A Suicide Attempt; Through the Eyes of One? and his his latest book, 'The Art of Being Broken: How Storytelling Saves Lives (PostHillPress), that is set for release on September 12.  The book shares his story and six other individuals from all over the globe, who have also survived extreme trauma and adversity.  'We have so much self help in the book. It's for people who are going through brain pain, mental health issues, drug addiction, stress, burnout, and even for people who are living with autism.'  Hines has dedicated his life to help others find ways to #BeHereTomorrow and every single day after that.  Hines spoke about his healing journey and spoke candidly when he told DailyMail.com that 'the thoughts of suicide don't go away'.  'They come back and they haunt me and I have to fight them,' he said.  The last time he had to check himself into the psych unit was in 2019.  'When I can't see that there's a hopeful option. When I get to a place where the suicide ideation becomes so heavy and so overwhelming that I get to a place of starting to plan my death that's when I immediately say to Margaret, I need to go to a psych ward.'  On average, 30 people have jumped The Golden Gate Bridge each year, with the first death taking place months after its completion in 1937.  Hines said his father, Patrick Hines, David Hull, and Paul Mueller, founded the Bridge Rail Foundation, and he was a co-founding board member.  The idea of a safety net around the bridge came from David Hull, founding member and first president of the Bridge Rail Foundation, in 2006, after he lost his daughter Kathy to the bridge on October 26, 2003.  In 2017, construction formally began on the safety barrier- more than 80 years and almost 2,000 deaths later, The San Francisco Standard reported.  Hull and Kay James, whose son, Michael died from the bridge in 2011, have been advocating for the safety net.  It has been a tedious process that involved bureaucracy and obtaining funding, but now 15 years later, the safety net barrier is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIwOTk4NjMvSS1zdXJ2aXZlZC1qdW1waW5nLVNhbi1GcmFuY2lzY29zLUdvbGRlbi1HYXRlLUJyaWRnZS5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5OTg2My9hbXAvSS1zdXJ2aXZlZC1qdW1waW5nLVNhbi1GcmFuY2lzY29zLUdvbGRlbi1HYXRlLUJyaWRnZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2022-09-25","Not Discerned","{""Kuopio"", ""NorthSavo"", ""Finland""}","2023-05-22T06:04:46","The comprehensive public health study found that a fifth of 20–64-year-olds are experiencing psychological distress, representing a noticeable increase from four years earlier – one of six percentage points to almost 19 per cent for men and seven points to 20 per cent for women.  WORKING-AGE PEOPLE in Finland are experiencing more and more psychological distress, reveals a study conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).  The study also detected a steep drop in the quality of life of working-age people, with the share of people who described their quality of life as good falling by over 10 points to just under 50 per cent since 2018.  Even more alarming is that suicidal thoughts have increased among under 50-year-olds. The share of working-age people with suicidal thoughts has risen from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  Annamari Lundqvist, the researcher in charge of the study at THL, said the results are alarming from the perspective of social and economic sustainability.  “There have been earlier indications of the declining well-being of working-age people, but that showing this clearly as a decline in the quality of life and increase in suicidal thoughts is indeed alarming,” she stated in an interview with YLE on Wednesday.  The cause of the development is the subject of widespread discussion but not yet definitive answers.  “I’m sure we’re seeing the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Also global things such as the war-related crisis, inflation, climate change can have an impact. The build-up of crises, you could say,” analysed Lundqvist.  The share of respondents who stated that they have used health care services for mental health-related issues has also risen in the past couple of years, from 15 to 20 per cent for women and from 9 to 12 per cent for men.  Almost 62,000 20–64-year-old people from across the survey were randomly invited to participate in the survey. Fewer than half, or 46 per cent, of them responded to the survey between September 2022 and March 2023.  Many of them estimated that doctor’s appointments are not sufficiently available and that the accessibility of health care services has decreased.  The assessments of the accessibility and availability of services varied regionally. The most challenging situation, the responses suggest, is found in North Karelia, Central Uusimaa and Kainuu, where more than 30 per cent of residents viewed that they do not have access to the physician’s services the need.  “The new well-being services counties are in a tough starting position that they will have to respond to. The adverse development is likely the consequence of several factors, such as the health care backlog arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the delays in carrying out the social and health care reform and staff shortage. In Finland, less money is spent on health care than in Western Europe,” stated Anna-Mari Aalto, a senior expert at THL.  “There is no one solution to the multifaceted situation.”  Despite the regional differences, the trend is pointing down practically across Finland, Lundqvist said to YLE.  “Some well-being services counties are doing slightly better than others, but when you look at the trend you can say that the situation has become more challenging in pretty much all well-being services counties compared to 2020,” she said.  “We have to think at the national level how we can improve the well-being of working-age people. Finnish society needs a population that’s healthy and able to function.”  THL will publish more results of the survey at the start of the summer and in the autumn.

A few months later in August 2022 after his friends came together to talk about how they could help their best friend Darragh who was going through a tough time, they were told Darragh had sadly died from suicide. The friends from Newbury who attended university in London, as well as working in the capital, had been friends since they were 15.  Alex told MyLondon: ""When Rebecca died, it was such a shock. I was in Barcelona doing my software engineering course so I wasn't able to come back or even attend the funeral so it was tough being on my own. I knew she was suffering from mental health but I never thought she was capable of doing something like that. Just one Sunday morning, she was gone.

We were at a festival and one of my mates sat us down and said 'Darragh has been going through it, we need to come together to help him out'. We all agreed and were thinking about what we could do to make him feel better.  ""When the music finished at 3am and we got back to our tents and got signal on our phones then got a text from his brother saying that they found him that evening dead.""  Losing one of his best mates sent shockwaves. Alex spoke of how he had never seen his best mates 'cry' the way they did. The mates all went round to Darragh's family home with permission from his mum who told them to be together and to celebrate Darragh's life. They spent a week together talking, crying and laughing with stories about Darragh that they shared.  (Image: Handout)  ""It was tough but beautiful to see how much love everybody had for each other. It's such a hard thing to come to terms with that he is gone forever but we wanted to personify the best parts of Darragh into the world. We wanted to be more like Darragh. He was such a smart guy, so academic and always loved reading. The one thing everyone said about Darragh was he always cared and asked how we really were - he took that time to care,"" Alex added.

The ride will be 205 miles and Alex hopes to complete the ride in under 16 hours. Critically, he will be raising money for the Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide (SOBS) in memory of Rebecca and Darragh.  He continued: ""I know the ride will be tough and I know there will be moments where I think this is long.

In letters sent to the joint parliamentary committee, it has been highlighted that the Bill, in the current form, would expose 50,000 acres of the Aravallis to commercialisation.  The environmentalists have demanded major changes in the Bill seeking it to be more exclusive for forests in Haryana. While the state’s forest cover is a mere 3.62 per cent, the effective legally protected forest area is only about 2 per cent.  The Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha on March 29 to amend the FCA, 1980, allegedly relaxes the regulatory safeguards of forests by diluting the requirements of forest clearances for vast tracts of land and activities that were previously regulated under the Principal Act and the Supreme Court direction in the TN Godavarman case (1996).  “Haryana has one of the lowest forest covers in the country and the highest air pollution and water stress. The FCA Amendment Bill, 2023, will open up 50,000 acres of Aravalli forests for real estate development and commercialisation since these forests have not yet been protected as “deemed forests” ,”says Neelam Ahluwalia, co-founder, Aravalli Bachao Citizens Movement.  Highlighting the findings of ‘The Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas-2021’, released by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the submission states that around 3.6 lakh hectares (8.2 per cent) of the state’s total land area had degraded and become more arid by 2018-19.

"suicide","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Rajgamar"", ""Chhattisgarh"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T00:02:00","They were going to burn the village and kill  In a frightening case of pressure, forced marriage, and suicide, a 14-year-old girl took her own life in Rajghar.  In the Dehri Jagir village, there are customs that the villagers must adhere to due to their low wealth and income.  One of these is daughters must marry young or at least be promised to another family.  This bond brings a dowry to the daughter’s family, which can come in the form of money, gifts, and goods.  In this incident, a father promised his two-year-old daughter to someone. But this was quickly broken off.  Then when the girl turned 11 years old, she was forcefully engaged to another boy, named Bablu.  At the time, Bablu’s father gave silver bangles to the daughter’s family and also said she wouldn’t have to stay with her in-laws until she was an adult.  Three years later, aged 14, the girl started getting pressure from her in-laws to stay with them.  When the girl’s father refused, he received threats that his village would be burned down, which didn’t go down lightly.  Suddenly, around 25 people showed up at the Dehri Jagir village.  Bablu’s family again forced their “daughter-in-law” to come with them otherwise they were going to burn the village and kill her father too.  As they left with the girl, they also took the silver they had given when the girl was aged 11. So, the family was frightened as to how they would survive and what would happen to their daughter.  Bablu’s family then sent a paper the next day saying a decision would be made. Whilst the police have not stated what this letter or decision referred to, many assume it was about the girl’s life.  However, worried about what would happen to her family and herself, the young 14-year-old girl made a decision.  She escaped early hours on the morning of May 18, 2023, and didn’t return home within an hour.  When people went searching for her, they saw the girl’s body hanging from a forest tree. She had committed suicide by hanging herself with her dupatta.  After getting the information about the incident, the Kalipith police reached the spot and took possession of the body.  Police got the postmortem done at Rajgarh District Hospital and handed over the girl’s body to the relatives.  Her parents were seen distraught and in tears outside the police station as they try to seek justice for their daughter.  The incident highlights what many families have to suffer and the sacrifices they have to make in order to survive.  It also shows what young women have to go through and how many of them have no say in what happens in their future.  Suicide is a massive problem within these deprived villages and many situations like this go unnoticed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2libGl0ei5jb20vY29udGVudC8xNC15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWNvbW1pdHMtc3VpY2lkZS1vdmVyLWZvcmNlZC1tYXJyaWFnZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T19:19:01","Thunder Rosa opens up about her time away from AEW.  The former women’s champion appeared on Busted Open Radio to discuss the injury that has put her on the shelf for nearly eight months. Rosa did show up on the May 10th episode of AEW Dynamite, but she has not been seen since and is still reportedly not medically cleared for action.  During the interview, Rosa spoke about how damaging her time away has been for her mental health and reveals that she’s had suicidal thoughts.  It’s a process, you have no control over it. When it comes with health, you have no control over it. For so many nights, I really kicked myself in the head and I was like, I should’ve just had one more match and just let it all out. If I got hurt more, whatever. But it was that one time and when I decided to do something because of my health and I decided to make that decision and I didn’t know what the consequences were gonna be and how people were gonna react. I was just thinking about my own physical health and at the time everything was happening, I was not in a good mental state too. I was trying to hide a lot of stuff because I was having some personal issues and being on top just exacerbates everything else that is happening in your life so I just feel like no matter what you do, you are always being criticized and you are always — nothing is good enough. You’re always doing something wrong and I feel like you put a loop over it and it’s just like it magnifies everything and being under that kind of pressure was very difficult and not having the time to just really let it go, because sometimes when people get injured, they take some time off and people are cool and they’re not saying anything, they’re not feeling attacked but I feel like when that happened, not only knowing I would have to relinquish something that I worked really hard for, it was hard enough but adding all the other levels of things on social media, the constant asking, ‘What’s going on?’ Like if you’re really injured or not, that really hurt even more. It made things much more difficult than they were mentally for me. There were days that I — I’m gonna be honest and I’ve said it on my YouTube channel, I wanted to kill myself. Everything stopped and there’s nothing you can do and I’m so thankful that I have a really good team and a really good family. My son, I think he’s the one who’s helped me the most and he helped me many times many nights, just telling me everything’s gonna be okay and I was lucky enough to have some resources and I was able to be in therapy. There were not good sessions at times. There was a lot of crying, there’s a lot of letting things go and accepting things that you cannot change and you’re just moving forward.  Rosa addressed fans not believing the legitimacy of her injury, which she believes is due to people not seeing the injury happen with their own eyes.  You know, it happened and going back and looking at things, it was very hard. Again, I think it would have been a lot easier just to relinquish the title and get the feedback that I got because people were gonna be upset no matter what because I think a lot of people thought I was making it up because they didn’t really see the injury happen in a match. Like some people break their legs or the knee gives up, the ankle gives up and it’s actually you can see it. This is something that happened and I start feeling the pain and then when you get MRIs and you get all the studies that you need to get done, that’s when they tell you that you are really injured, right? So, yeah, it was very unfortunate and I really didn’t want it to affect me and my psyche but it did, because like you (Dave LaGreca) mentioned, even when I was at home, it was constant text messaging or people asking me if I was okay and I didn’t know because I got off social media big time and people were just sending me links, people would send me articles, it was tough. I think that’s probably one of the toughest things that I have to go through because not only of what I was going (through) physically but I was mentioning, I was having some other personal issues that were pretty latent right there and I had to deal with that at the same time along with all the change that was happening, right? And I dealt with (it to) the best of my ability, I used my resources. I was in therapy with a regular therapist and a psychiatrist. I’m very open and I said it before, I started using medication because I didn’t want to medicate myself with alcohol or drugs and I did not use painkillers on purpose because I think that’s another way that you can go really down the rabbit hole or on the dark hole and you can’t get out of that because you become addicted to those things so, I became really well aware of that. Meditation was one of the things that I tried. I usually do it at night more than anything else because that’s when a lot of intrusive thoughts come in and at points and you know, people go through a lot of things in different aspects of their life. I think the best advice that I got was taking it, at points, minute by minute because one minute I was okay and then the next minute, I was just crying and being angry and having outbursts and it’s hard because there are certain things that are fulfilled in your life and you feel like you should be thankful but there’s other things and we’re just like, questioning why this is happening to you? Why is this disruption of your life happening? And knowing that you have to adapt and live in another reality and I think that’s the hardest part and so people can never really get out of that.  Later in the interview, Rosa says that her in-ring future is still uncertain but that she’s doing much better on the mental health front.  It’s hard to talk about it because there’s certain wounds that you can never really heal and I’m still in the healing process. Some days, especially in the last couple of weeks have been much better because I was able to find my voice and I was able to find myself again. But there is some days when I talk about it and right now, I don’t even know why I’m crying. I feel like I’m having therapy and it’s still hard because I’m not back in the ring and I still have to change a lot of stuff and I still feel like I’m in limbo because I don’t know what’s gonna happen, I don’t know if I need surgery, I don’t know if I’m gonna get back and I have to work extra harder to get back and not doing something that I love to do that I’ve been doing for 10 years, and this one thing that got me where I’m at right now is wrestling and all the hard work that I did outside of wrestling and right now, I’m not letting that affect me anymore because I think people said what they needed to say about me and they’re gonna believe whatever they’re gonna believe. They are gonna do that and I’m just gonna keep living my life and bettering myself and bettering my environment. But again, I told you, there’s certain wounds that you’re never gonna be able to heal, because I really let it hurt me so much and it hurt more because I’ve always been so caring for other people and I always tried to take my sweater and my jacket when somebody needs it because I want them to be successful because of X, Y and Z and then just feeling how I felt for that period of time, it really hurt, because I never tried to hurt anybody. I never tried to take advantage of anybody and it was painted like that and again, when I’m trying to heal physically, I was not able to heal mentally and that takes a big toll on everything in your life, completely.  In an older interview, Rosa explained why she paints half of her face for matches. You can read about that here.

According to the report, the country continues to have high non-natural death rates mostly in men.  Male suicide cases, according to experts, have been linked to socio-economic problems.  “In Mashonaland Central alone, 35 cases were reported in 2021 and the year 2022 saw an increase to 53 cases. The statistics indicate the need for urgency in interventions on suicides in the province,” says the report.  NPRC said the most affected groups were the 13 to 30-year age range.  “According to the research, 80% of victims signal their intention to commit suicide; in some instances, there have been reports of recurring suicides within families,” the report read.  The organisation said drug and substance abuse were among the factors contributing to an increase in suicide cases.  “There is need to intensify the fight against drug, alcohol and substance abuse. Youths must be taught to work hard to earn a living; the stigma on suicides must be removed. There should be control of the media content (both print and electronic), bring back ubuntu so that people are there for each other,” the report read.  “Opinion leaders should realise the impact of their actions on the society and there is a need for education, counselling and awareness campaigns.”  According to the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe, which painted a gloomy picture on suicides in the teaching profession, about 380 teachers reportedly committed suicide in the country from 2008-21.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY28uencvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMDAxMTg5NS9zdWljaWRlLWNhc2VzLXNwaWtl0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jby56dy9hbXAvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMDAxMTg5NS9zdWljaWRlLWNhc2VzLXNwaWtl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The accused, Abdullah Momin, was arrested based on the complaint filed by the deceased girl’s father.  The deceased girl lived with her family in Dakor and was pursuing nursing in Nadiad. His father works at Dakor police station, and she travelled to Nadiad from Dakor daily to attend nursing school. On May 10, the girl’s family had gone out of the village for a wedding and she stayed back at home due to her exams.  On May 12, the girl’s mother called and her phone was switched off. After several attempts, when the daughter did not pick up the phone, the mother informed the neighbour and asked her to go home and see her. The neighbour went and knocked on the door repeatedly but there was no response from inside. The girl was finally found hanging from the ceiling when the neighbours broke open the door. When the girl’s family was informed, they immediately reached Dakor and took the body of the girl to their native place and the last rites were completed there.  After all the last rites were completed, on May 18, when the girl’s father checked her phone, shocking details came to light. A person named Abdullah Momin was blackmailing the deceased girl. Several messages and recordings were recovered from the mobile phone of the deceased girl. It was clear from the conversation between the two that Abdullah used to harass and threaten the girl. It has been alleged that the girl took the final step after being harassed by the threats and harassment by Abdullah Momin.  The girl was earlier in a love affair with Abdullah. After some time, she put a full stop to the relationship. Enraged by this, Abdullah started harassing the girl. He was constantly harassing her on mobile as well as in college. The harassment did not stop even though she repeatedly asked him to stop it.  Recordings of the conversation between the girl and the accused made it clear that Abdullah had threatened to defame the girl in the society by saying that she had an affair with another youth and get her rusticated from the college. Abdullah also threatened the girl by saying that he would “ruin her life completely”.  The girl, who was tormented by the harassment, pleaded several times and asked the accused to stop the harassment. In the phone conversation, the girl also said that she may take the final step of suicide. The girl also told the accused that she would leave behind all the evidence. According to a report, on the phone, she was crying loudly and requesting Abdullah, saying ‘You killed me…’, but despite this, Abdullah continued to harass her and eventually she committed suicide by hanging herself.  On the basis of these recordings and messages, the father of the deceased Hindu girl lodged a complaint with the police, after which the Dakor police registered a case of abetment to suicide and arrested the accused Abdullah Momin. He was produced before the court after his arrest and remanded for two days.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5kaWEuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvZ3VqYXJhdC1oaW5kdS1naXJsLWhhcmFzc2VkLWJ5LWFiZHVsbGFoLW1vbWluLWNvbW1pdHMtc3VpY2lkZS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGluZGlhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2d1amFyYXQtaGluZHUtZ2lybC1oYXJhc3NlZC1ieS1hYmR1bGxhaC1tb21pbi1jb21taXRzLXN1aWNpZGUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T18:40:35","""Suicide"", this word is getting common day by day, not only in Kashmir but also in the whole world. People usually attempt suicide because of depression e. t. c. But this is not the only reason. So what are the reasons behind it? Why do people find it easy to do? Why don't they think that what will happen to their family, friends and society?  Suicide is defined as the motivation to be dead which leads to the initiation of an act that leads to the death of the initiator. Worldwide more than 800,000 people die due to suicide each year. Sometimes suicide is not reported due to its sensitive nature or the taboo that surrounds it. But as a society, we need to accept the real word suicide and talk about it freely and educate people, especially the younger generation. Suicide leads to adverse psychological and Socioeconomic effects on society. Youth suicide constitutes a measure of public mental health problems. Young people are by nature a vulnerable group for mental health problems. In Kashmir, as per the human rights Commission of India suicides are said to have claimed the second-highest number of lives after militancy. An increasing number of suicides is an alarming situation in Kashmir Valley and a matter of concern these days. Jammu and Kashmir are struggling with numerous issues from illiteracy to unemployment, family issues, divorce, and failure in examinations. People lack certain qualities like patience, and tolerance and have not gained emotional development. All this leads to stress which forces people to attempt suicide. Suicide is a multifaced problem and suicide prevention programs should also be multi-dimensional. Reducing suicide requires a collective concerted effort from all groups in society. It is high time for Jammu and Kashmir government to initiate mental health programs, psychiatric evaluation and treatment to people and social awareness regarding social affairs. Everyone can help prevent suicide by learning warning signs, promoting prevention and resilience and committing to social change.

"suicide","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Fairbanks"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T14:30:31","“The suicide hotline received more than 88,000 calls, texts and chats in March [2023] — the highest amount of monthly contacts it has ever had, new data shows.”  -NBC News  Rob and I, and our brothers and sisters-in-arms have seen this issue close-up, and in recent years watched some of the most resilient and “together” people choose to end their life. The impact of seemingly “strong warriors” taking their lives is particularly troubling for their families and the military community. We all are now guessing at what could have taken them down that path to an irreversible decision.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and it is supposed to shine a light on the critical need to understand and treat mental health problems. May is also Military Appreciation Month, and for the military community, many mental health problems can lead to suicide. Today, the military community is in the midst of a severe crisis and the nation is not doing enough to reverse it.  For years, the military community has grappled with a growing number of suicides. For the purposes of this article, we define the military community as both those currently in uniform and veterans, and their loved ones. We can remember the spike in suicides among active-duty members around 2005-08. While the Army took steps to try to address the causes of the increase, the numbers just kept growing and the suicide rate in the veteran community also grew over the last two decades.  For many years, advocates trying to raise awareness of this crisis used the number 22 a day to highlight the large number of military folks affected in comparison to the non-veteran population. In 2022 Duke University and the University of Alabama revealed that their studies put the number closer to double that number of suicides per day. Forty-four suicides a day in the military community is unacceptable.  Recent NBC news reporting on the dramatic increase in cries for help to the VA, should be a warning sign that we might be at the beginning of a storm, not the end of it.  A Call to Action  Jason and I, along with some friends are using music to try to help decrease the suicide numbers in the military. We are one small effort, and we know that the entire nation needs to step forward and put their combined efforts into understanding this crisis and finding solutions. The nation cannot expect veterans (and their loved ones) to be the main effort in helping veterans through this moment. The nation sent them to war, the entire nation should feel the obligation to help.  There are many ways everyone can help simply by funding organizations that help curb the military suicide crisis. Many of the most capable organizations getting ahead of the suicide moment, and treating the causes, are outside the government. Find them in your community and support them.  On our song’s website, we are compiling a list of organizations that are doing good works. Donate directly to any of the organizations we hope to support with our song. Or find another local effort that is offering assistance that might help to reduce suicide rates in the military community  If you do not have money to help organizations assisting the military community, consider volunteering with an organization that is working on this critical issue. They would appreciate your time. Many organizations countering the crisis are veteran-led and need your help, they are tired too.  You should also ask your local, state, and federal leaders to put more effort into understanding and solving this crisis. Find out if they are even aware of the issues and if they are engaged in forming solutions.  You can also try listening to our song with a member of the military community or their family and try to start a dialogue…and see if they can use help. Don’t wait for military members and veterans to ask for help…reach out and find out.  Remember that most people will not ask for help when they are in crisis. We hope they can hold on, while our nation tries to get help to them.  What We Are Doing  The band Over, Never Out was formed to raise awareness of the suicide crisis in the U.S. military community and raise money for organizations across America that are helping the military community to cope with the trauma and stress of service.  This is important to our 11 bandmates and five engineers/producers and to so many others. We’d like to see the song start more national conversations and spur some more efforts to slow this crisis of suicide in the military community.  Our new song called “Hold On, Reach Out” released this month. It takes on this issue in many ways. It is a call for help from the nation, a possible bit of support for military families. It is a fundraiser, and maybe it is even a letter directly to a veteran in need so they know they are not alone right now.  A critical topic that my bandmate and I discussed today is the ease in which many people expect the person in agony to drag themselves out of it. Simply telling them to call a phone number is not enough.  The song has many intended audiences and we want to be clear about them up-front. One audience is the veterans that are doing ok…we ask that they reach out and check on their buddies…use your skills and hyper vigilance to watch for those in trouble. Another audience is the non-veteran community…we need you to step up and help us curb this crisis in any way you can. Do your part, and don’t leave it to veterans and their families to solve this.  Another audience is the military member and veteran in that dark place…Hold On, we are coming to help you. Reach out if you can, but we know this is hard.  Our band has pledged to give away over half of the profits of this song to organizations that are doing important work across the country to help our military community.  Here is how you can assist us in using this song to make an impact:  Purchase and download the song wherever you buy digital music  Ask your local radio stations to play this song  Buy this song on a vinyl record or CD  Stream the music on your favorite service  Tell your friends about this song and ask them to purchase a copy and tell their friends about it.  Doing our parts  Most of the effective nonprofits helping curb suicide in the military community are run by veterans, but most also struggle to fundraise and network in the community to get full support. We know this is where our song can help, and your fundraising efforts can help.  If you are a community leader, or want to be…find or start an organization that can bring the best techniques into your area to help veterans.  Remember we are helping veterans not victims. These patriots volunteered to serve the nation, and we need you to volunteer to serve them in return.  Please do not put the weight of this massive problem on the tired shoulders of veterans and their families.  Together we can reverse this crisis.  Thanks to everyone that is already in this fight, we know this is extremely hard and that often the very people helping are the same ones in need of help themselves. We hope to have some song profits soon to send your way.  Hold on, we are coming, and hopefully we are bringing even more help with us soon.

Well, they want us to talk. About mental health and suicide, the 12th leading cause of death in the US. On average, there are 130 suicides per day here.  AFSP research shows suicide is preventable if we work together. Since their public education program “Talk Saves Lives” launched in 2015, it has reached nearly 150,000 people across all 50 states with science-informed education about suicide and how we can all help prevent it. It can be as simple as reaching out to a friend.  Suicide is a topic that often hides in the shadows. In the dark. Many with depression or other mental health conditions that are unaddressed could lead to suicide and may feel ashamed or hesitant to ask for help. We can all make a difference. Learn the warning signs, know the risk factors and if you sense someone is struggling, be brave and talk to them. A few kind words can make a difference in connecting someone to help.  Now you’re thinking, “Could saying the wrong thing make it worse?” and worrying, “How do I begin a conversation?” You’re probably afraid of what you’ll do if they confess they are having thoughts of suicide. But research shows that asking someone directly if you suspect they may be thinking about suicide won’t put the idea in their head if it wasn’t there to begin with.  AFSP wants people to feel more confident in having a #RealConvo about mental health in general, and suicide when it comes up. Their #TalkAwayTheDark campaign page features a new short film highlighting some of the warning signs for suicide, #RealConvo Guides, and other tools, resources, and creative ways to help us overcome our fears of speaking up.  The #RealConvo Guides, which cover topics including general mental health conversations, how to reach out for help, how to respond if someone tells you they’re thinking about suicide, and how to sensitively talk to a survivor of suicide loss, contain an easy-to-follow step by step process, from opening lines to follow up. They include conversation starters such as, “What is one thing you are looking forward to?’ and ‘Who is one person who makes you feel seen?’ The guides offer ways to share your own experiences, how to follow the other person’s lead, when to take a break, and how to help them connect to professional support.  Suicide prevention begins with talking. Be open to discussions of mental health. Be watchful and be ready to speak up.  Learn more with #TalkAwayTheDark.  Always remember, if you, a friend or a loved one is in crisis, call or text 988, or text TALK to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor from the Crisis Text Line for free, 24/7.

House Bill 389, sponsored by House Ways and Means General Fund Chairman Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, would create a 988 Suicide and Crisis Call hotline for suicide prevention and crisis management.  It would also require the Department of Mental Health to develop, coordinate and administer Alabama's mental health care initiative, which includes supporting the 988 line.  The sticking point at a House hearing on the bill this past week was a 98-cent tax on cellphone lines to fund the program. The fee drew opposition from telecom companies at the hearing. The companies said the fee was too high.  Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kim Boswell said she could support a hardship waiver for individuals with lower incomes but also noted her department had gone a decade without increases for mental illness services.  Reynolds moved to hold the bill Wednesday, saying work still had to be done.  (READ MORE: National mental health 988 crisis hotline sees boost in calls from Tennessee)  Another bill, Senate Bill 328, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, was introduced in the Senate and passed the Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Development Committee on Wednesday on a 9-0 vote, with one abstention.  Reynolds said Thursday the bill in the Senate includes the amendments he's worked on with the telecommunications industry and the Alabama Department of Mental Health.  The Senate version, which the House may take as a substitute, sets the fee at 98 cents indefinitely beginning Oct. 1, 2024. The bill that as introduced initially would have allowed the 988 commission to establish the fee on a yearly basis at anywhere between 98 cents and $3.  The Senate bill also added more members to the 988 commission, including one representative from each of the following: the Alabama Fire College, the Alabama Association of 911 Districts, the Alabama Hospital Association and a rural telephone company. It would also include the director of the Alabama 911 Board, or his or her designee.  (READ MORE: A Georgia bill to increase funding for mental health failed to pass in the Senate. What happened and what's next?)  Cleo Washington, vice president of AT&T, said at Wednesday's Senate committee hearing the wireless association has been working with Reynolds on how to pay for the services that he said should be provided.  ""Whether this should be something from the wireless industry that, if it is a level of priority, and it is – funded through the General Fund as opposed to a separate fee, or separate tax,"" Washington said. ""That's our only issue that we hope the committee considers that, and we want to put that on the table.""  Reynolds said there are discussion that the bill could start in the Senate because there are other components to the bill than the tax portion, and that it was substituted with the House version.  The bill would also set up the 988 Commission, which would serve as an advisory body of the 988 Crisis Care Fund, and the commission would be responsible for developing a mechanism that would provide a hardship waiver process for individuals who cannot pay the 98-cent user fee.  ""Now, we've got 11 associations falling in behind the bill and supporting the bill,"" Reynolds said. ""We've still got some work to do.""  Reynolds said that the bill could be back in committee as early as this week.  Holly McCorkle, executive director at the Alabama Council for Behavioral Healthcare, said that in the years she's worked in the mental health space, this is the ""biggest piece of mental health legislation that's been before the Alabama legislature."" The bill could help achieve the goal of having some kind of 24/7 service in every county.  (READ MORE: Chattanooga summit to examine stigma around mental health in Black community)  ""With the amount of money that would be generated by this fee, this would be more than what's already been invested in crisis services through the legislature in the past few years,"" she said.  Five states have enacted legislation that funds these services via a telecommunication surcharge, and Alabama's would be the highest, at more than double the rate in Washington state (40 cents), the current highest fee.  Washington, however, also appropriated $23 million from its General Fund budget towards the lifeline implementation, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. Of the 13 states that have appropriated funds from the state budget, three also implemented a telecom surcharge.  But with less than one-third of the legislative session to go, Reynolds said that each day is an unknown.  ""We're winding down the days, and we're in a very critical time,"" he said.

"suicide","2023-05-22","10:00:00","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T22:31:00","A Labour government would reverse the rise in the number of deaths from suicide as part of a health plan to replace pain and anxiety with a “hope of a renewed NHS”, Keir Starmer will pledge.  In a speech on Monday, the Labour leader will say his plan for reforming the NHS will focus on the biggest causes of death in the UK including suicide.  He will point to coroners’ statistics showing that deaths from suicides have been rising since 2008, and reached a record high last year in England and Wales. If the party takes power Labour will reverse this rise within five years, Starmer will say.  A segment of his speech previewed by the party says: “Suicide is the biggest killer of young lives in this country. The biggest killer. That statistic should haunt us. And the rate is going up. Our mission must be and will be to get it down.”  Labour has not provided details on how it proposes to meet this pledge other than an aspiration to shift from “sickness to prevention”.  But setting out his vision for the future of the health service, Starmer will say it is based on “a mission that can lift the anxiety, the pain, the fear faced by millions of families across the country and replace it with hope of a renewed NHS”.  Experts and campaigners gave the suicide pledge a cautious welcome, but urged any future Labour government to focus on tackling the wider societal causes of mental illness including poverty and inequality.  Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “The focus on preventing mental illness is the right approach. Mental illness can in many cases be prevented with early intervention and by tackling root causes including inequality, racism and abuse.  “A long-term whole of government plan to improve outcomes for people with mental illness is urgently needed. Adults with severe mental illness are almost five times more likely to die prematurely than the rest of the population with two out of three deaths from preventable illnesses.”  Simon Blake, the chief executive of Mental Health First Aid England, said a determined focus on improving mental health and preventing suicide had “never been more important”.  He said: “Reducing the unacceptably high numbers of people that die by suicide requires strong political will and a multifaceted approach which tackles the wider factors that influence mental health such as poverty, housing, discrimination including racism, education and employment.”  Rishi Sunak is reportedly preparing to announce plans to allow patients to choose to receive treatment in private hospitals via the NHS app. The move is aimed at cutting the record 7.3 million-person waiting list, according to the Times.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And he will say Labour will meet all cancer targets and reduce waiting lists.  He will say: “The next Labour government will deliver an NHS that is there when you need it. No backsliding, no excuses. We will meet these standards again. We will get the NHS back on its feet.”  Labour remains coy on how this will be financed. Asked on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether the party was looking to raise taxes, the shadow health minister, Liz Kendall, said: “No.”  Pressed on the issue, she added: “Whilst extra investment is essential, what I would argue here is reform is absolutely part of it too.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIzL21heS8yMS9sYWJvdXItdm93cy10by1yZXZlcnNlLXJpc2UtaW4tc3VpY2lkZXMtaW4tZW5nbGFuZC1hbmQtd2FsZXMtd2l0aGluLWZpdmUteWVhcnMta2Vpci1zdGFybWVy0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjMvbWF5LzIxL2xhYm91ci12b3dzLXRvLXJldmVyc2UtcmlzZS1pbi1zdWljaWRlcy1pbi1lbmdsYW5kLWFuZC13YWxlcy13aXRoaW4tZml2ZS15ZWFycy1rZWlyLXN0YXJtZXI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-01","15:00:00","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T14:00:59","In a New York City subway car on May 1, a Marine Corps veteran named Daniel Penny put a homeless man named Jordan Peely into a chokehold for three minutes, cutting off oxygen to his brain and ending his life. Passengers on the train stated that Mr. Peely had acted aggressively toward them and appeared mentally ill.  One witness, who videoed the incident, stated that Mr. Peely said, “I don’t have food. I don’t have a drink. I’m fed up… I’m tired already. I don’t care if I go to jail and get locked up. I’m ready to die.” This singular incident, a needless death, is yet another reminder that it’s past time to address the other stereotypes, namely the ones regarding LGBTQ+, the homeless, and the mentally ill.  The father of general semantics, Alfred Korzybski, observed in his seminal text Science and Sanity that stereotypes are illogical and unprovable. One cannot say, “All X are Y,” or even attempt to modify that statement by saying, “All X are Y, except for my friend Z.” When speaking of a group of human beings, one can only speak of individuals within that group. No group is so homogenous that any one standard can be applied to all. So what happens to humor? What if someone refers to Mexicans as lazy, Asians as lousy drivers, Jewish people as penurious, the Scots as miserly, and the Irish as drunks?  Most Americans are worldly enough to know that these stereotypes are broad and inaccurate. As someone with Scots-Irish ancestry, I can take or leave most jokes about being a miser or a drunkard. And some of them do make me laugh. But some groups have been punched down for too long for it to be funny.  Stereotypes of LGBTQ+ behavior are still fairly commonplace. And this notion that teenagers and young adults are transitioning because it’s a fad is insulting and disgusting–as if assessing one’s gender identity and the life-changing effects of transitioning could be grouped with swallowing goldfish, streaking, or pouring cold water over your head. And it completely overlooks the incalculable costs to individuals and society if transitioning is stigmatized or sabotaged. Cold, hard fact: LGBTQ+ teens are much more likely to commit suicide or have mental issues resulting from their gender identities.  A survey conducted last year by The Trevor Project found that nearly half of young people identifying as LGBTQ have seriously considered suicide. In short, nothing to laugh at here.  The unhoused generally break down into four types: those who have no desire to work or cooperate; those who want to work and live independently but are broke; those who want to work and live independently but are broken; those who want to work and live independently but are broke and broken. All of these groups except the first can be worked with. And most of us, when we are rational and in treatment, genuinely want help–to quote the Waco Kid in Blazing Saddles, “all I can get.”  Those who want to dismiss the homeless are quick to point out their deficits, focusing on those whose physical and mental hygiene are subpar, persons like the late Jordan Peely, whose aggressive behavior can frighten those unfamiliar with mental disorders and their criteria for diagnosis. You can’t expect the average person to become an authority on such disorders and their treatment modalities. There are many non-lethal ways to subdue people.  The NY medical examiner’s autopsy determined that Mr. Peely’s cause of death was compression of the neck. When Mr. Penny applied his chokehold, he did so with such force that Mr. Peely could not breathe, which meant almost no oxygen was reaching his brain. He was unconscious and brain-dead within minutes. No one thought to grab Mr. Peely’s arms and legs until help could arrive. No one realized that simply sitting on him would have subdued him. In short, brute force was the only method put to use. The result: a fatality. A life that could have been spared, a patient that could have received life-changing mental and physical health treatment.  “But he was yelling! He was acting aggressively! He could have attacked people! He was suicidal!” None of that is contested. It is all a matter of record. But so is this: If the average citizen knew more about mental disorders and non-lethal methods of subduing suspects, Jordan Peely need not have died. He probably would, at this moment, be receiving treatment to deal with his mental disorders. Another needless death would have been prevented. But as the New York Intelligencer headline said, Jordan Peely was already dead. He was a blur, a nonentity for the people who saw him daily until he had enough and screamed out for help. For food. For drink.  “For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.” That is the lesson that we still have to learn.  Better days are coming… if we work for them.

"suicide","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T18:08:30","Pictured is Shannonbridge resident Gerry O’Sullivan.  Local man to complete 750km cycle for charity in memory of nephew  Shannonbridge resident Gerry O'Sullivan will undertake the Cycle against Suicide N2 End to End Challenge 750km cycle this week in Portugal over six days to honour the memory of his nephew Ben and to raise funds for suicide awareness.  Speaking about why he decided to take part in the challenge, Gerry explained: “My 20 year old nephew Ben tragically passed away last September. To honour Ben’s memory and to raise much needed funds for Suicide Awareness, I’m taking part in the Cycle Against Suicide. I think within a week or two of him passing I got a notification from Cycling Against Suicide on my phone. When I saw it I kind of wanted to do it to honour Ben's memory and then to raise funds.”  “There was a cycling challenge in it as well so I was kind of happy to take that on too,” added Gerry. A group of 60 people will take on the six-day cycle challenge, from May 20 to May 25.  Gerry has been training for the mammoth challenge since last January. Ben passed away in September 2022 and Gerry said he committed to taking on the cycle challenge last November. He trained for 62 days on the bike and covered an impressive 4,250km in that period.  Gerry previously completed a 1,000km cycle in 2021 from Ballinasloe to Mizen Head and then on to Malin Head. He also cycled from Mizen Head to Malin Head in 2018. Both cycles were in aid of Diabetes Ireland as Gerry's son and daughter have Type 1 Diabetes. He rasied over €8,000 from each cycle for the charity.  Gerry originally set a target of €3,000 for the upcoming charity cycle but said that he is going to exceed €8,000 again as he has managed to raise €7,877 to date.  The Shannonbridge resident commented on the support that he has received locally. “The support locally has been great. The priest put a note into the parish newsletter for me.”  Gerry continued: “I actually got a donation that blew my mind when I woke up one day and I saw a donation of €75 from the First Holy Communion class of Clonmacnoise National School.""  Gerry is the chairperson of Ballinasloe Cycling Club who have been hugely supportive along with Shannonbridge GAA Club and Ballinasloe Rugby Club.  Gerry's main goal in terms of the cycle is to complete the staggering feat. “It really is just to take on the challenge, to raise as much funds as we can and then to honour Ben's memory.”  “People have different reasons for doing it. Some people are doing it for their own mental health. Some ar  e doing it because they've been affected by suicide. It resonates with everybody.

"suicide","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Rockford"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T03:14:00","ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - Mental health on relationships. That was the topic at a local forum on Saturday where people can learn how to be more involved with their partner and not so involved with their own mind.  For the second year in a row, an organization shows the community the importance of taking care of their mental health.  This year, nonprofit MENtality Unchained hosted a forum that focuses on how mental health and past traumas can directly impact relationships and take a toll on families.  “Can you imagine two people coming from two different backgrounds, coming into a relationship, what they bring into the relationship,” asked Psychotherapist Kevin Thomas.  Thomas is with MENtality Unchained, a nonprofit which hosted a the forum titled, “The Family Reunion: The Impact of Mental health.”  “I wanted to bridge the gap between understanding what the traumas are and how it’s impacting the family,” Thomas said.  As part of this event, Thomas invited his close friends who are either single or in a relationship to participate in a panel discussion. Audience members got to hear real stories, real struggles and real breakthroughs.  “Just to really talk about their relationships and how their traumas and anything they had in the past kind of impacted their relationships,” Thomas said.  Two of Saturday’s panelists, Rebecca and Justin Francis say they’re a big supporter of therapy in their relationship.  “Communication they say is one of the main reasons why divorce happens, so I think therapy, openness is definitely great,” said MENtality Unchained panelist Justin Francis  “When we go to therapy, we go to separately and then we go together right so then you’re solving the mitigating the internals of yourself and healing past traumas and then coming together,” said MENtality Unchained panelist Rebecca Francis  Thomas says it’s important to educate the community on what mental health is and how to break the stigmas associated with it.  “Bringing Rockford together through mental health is important because it helps people to deal with, manage their relationships,” Thomas said.  MENtality Unchained offers several services to the community including keynote speaking, individual therapy and marriage and family therapy.  If you or anyone you know struggles with suicidal thoughts, call or text 988, which is a suicide and crisis lifeline that offers 24/7 service.  Copyright 2023 WIFR.

The former wife of Elvis Presley walked separately from the girls and their father, Michael Lockwood, on Saturday after leaving the middle school commencement.  In photos, the 14-year-old twins smiled as they chatted with their dad, who was recently granted full custody of them following their mom Lisa Marie Presley’s January death.  Keough, however, was not present for her younger sisters’ graduation.  Page Six has reached out to Keough’s rep but did not immediately hear back.  Harper and Finley Lockwood graduated from middle school on Saturday. BACKGRID  The ceremony came days after Priscilla, 77, and the “Lodge” actress, 33, reportedly settled the dispute over Lisa Marie’s trust, with the “Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad” actress being granted “millions” from her late daughter’s estate.  Details of the settlement were not revealed in court and both parties will reportedly file a motion to seal the agreement, per TMZ.  Following the hearing, Priscilla told Page Six in a written statement, “My family has resolved all confusion as it relates to our plea to the court and request for document interpretation after my daughter Lisa Marie’s untimely passing.  The girls’ father, Michael Lockwood, was also present. BACKGRID  Priscilla walked separately from her family. BACKGRID  “Although the media identified such a plea as a lawsuit, I want to make clear that there was never any lawsuit filed against my beloved granddaughter. As a family, we are pleased that we resolved this together. My family and I hope that everyone will grant us the privacy we have needed to properly grieve Lisa Marie and spend personal time together. We love and appreciate all of you and the Presley family is stronger than ever.”  For more Page Six you love …  Last week, Priscilla was reportedly granted “millions” in a settlement over her late daughter Lisa Marie Presley’s trust. FilmMagic  Keough’s reps did not respond to Page Six requests for comment about the settlement, however, her lawyer Justin Gold told CNN that his client was “very content.”  After Lisa Marie passed away at age 54 after going into cardiac arrest, reports surfaced that there were tensions brewing within the family over her estate.  Keough and her brother, Benjamin, were listed as the beneficiaries of their mom’s trust, however, when he died by suicide in July 2020, the actress became the sole living heir of Lisa Marie.  Priscilla contested her late daughter’s will, which caused her and Keough to stop speaking to one another. FilmMagic  After the “Lights Out” singer’s death, Priscilla contested her late daughter’s will, alleging that a “purported 2016 amendment” — which expelled her and business manager Barry Siegel as trustees — was not lawful.  A friend of Lisa Marie previously told Page Six that Priscilla’s efforts were a “money grab.”  However, the co-founder of Elvis Presley Enterprises claimed to us that she was only trying to keep their family “together.”  Lisa Marie passed away in January after going into cardiac arrest. FilmMagic  “From the first moment I held Lisa in my arms, I’ve protected, loved and guided her, as I have my son,” she said in February. “Our hearts are broken, and I am having to learn to live without my only daughter.”  Meanwhile, a source later told Page Six that Priscilla and her eldest granddaughter were not on speaking terms.  “Riley and Priscilla are not talking,” the insider exclaimed. “Their relationship is changing, that is true. … It’s just so sad.

"suicide","2023-04-07","10:00:00","{""Wampsville"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T20:04:06","WAMPSVILLE, N.Y. — Madison County’s Veterans Service Agency recently held its third annual 22KM Awareness Hike beginning at the WAVEM War Memorial.  Participants included county chair John M. Becker, county administrator Mark Scimone and county public information officer Samantha Field. The trek covered 22 kilometers, or 13.67 miles, throughout Oneida and Wampsville.  The hike’s goal since 2021 has been to help veterans around the county find friendship and support against negative influences hounding veterans.  “We hike to raise awareness about veteran suicide and to remind fellow veterans that they are not alone,” agency director Ron Raymer said. “We also walk to remember those that are currently deployed around the world and to help promote some of the services that our agency provides.”  Those services may be reached by calling (315) 366-2395.  “The most frequent thing we is advocate for veterans. We help veterans receive benefits made available by the Veterans Administration,” Raymer said. “If we can’t help them directly with what they need we will guide them in the right direction.”  Raymer said the hike covers 22 kilometers to acknowledge the tragedy of veteran suicide. An average of 22 veterans from all service branches commit suicide each day. A March 2023 study conducted by the Department of Defense suggests the number may be higher.  That is one veteran every 65 minutes. The rates for the active duty individual services per 100,000 according to the report, were 23 for the Army, 23.1 for the Marine Corps, 14.4 for the Air Force and 13.4 for the Navy. Causes include post traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury and military sexual trauma.  Veterans in crisis may call 988 and press 1. The national suicide hotline is 1-800-273-8255.  Other veterans services include the veterans homeless hotline at 1-877-424-3838. The women’s VA number is 1-855-VA-WOMEN, or 1-855-829-6636.  The hike was launched in response to the worldwide isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020.  “We used to go to certain public events and set up a table that explained which services we had available,” Raymer said. “The COVID hit and we had to evaluate how we reached out to people. I sat down with my team and we discussed our options. The hike allowed us to practice social distancing while getting the word out about what we do. It also helped re-establish camaraderie among the hikers.”  Lack of camaraderie and isolation are major issues facing veterans, Raymer said. “In the military we were always together, and if someone was facing an issue they had servicemen around them to help alert their squad leader to where they could get help,” he said. “Back in the civilian world you don’t have that.”  Raymer said that lack of purpose among veterans is another serious issue. “In the military you have a mission, and when you re-enter civilian life you no longer have that well-defined purpose,” he said.  Obstacles preventing veterans getting help include the perception they face while asking for help.  “You say veteran and sometimes people think of an angry, frustrated individual ready to blow a gasket,” Raymer said. “Getting past those ideas helps open the door to vets receiving assistance.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uZWlkYWRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2F3YXJlbmVzcy1oaWtlLWtlZXBzLW9uZWlkYS1jb3VudHktdmV0ZXJhbnMtc3Ryb25n0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25laWRhZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvYXdhcmVuZXNzLWhpa2Uta2VlcHMtb25laWRhLWNvdW50eS12ZXRlcmFucy1zdHJvbmcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Natalie Swann from Ahoghill is speaking out to mark Mental Health Awareness Month this May.  Over recent weeks, the 27-year-old has produced a leaflet focusing on mental health and suicide awareness and the help and support available for those who may be suffering in silence.  Read more:NI woman on overcoming childhood challenges and creating her dream business  Natalie is planning to distribute the leaflet in her local area in a bid to help spread the word.  She told Belfast Live: ""How this idea came about is that I have been attending a free college course in Ballymena, which is an OCN NI Level 2 Award in Awareness of Mental Health and Well-being.  ""The aim is to provide learners with the knowledge and skills to work in roles that support mental health and well-being. We also have to develop an awareness of mental health interventions and support strategies.  ""During this I had to illustrate a leaflet for suicide awareness. My tutor thought it was so good that she asked me to present it to the rest of our class to discuss. She said she was also going to show her manager in the hopes of possibly having it published on campus for other attending students. I also got great feedback from my classmates too when I was asked to present it to them.""  (Image: Submitted)  Natalie added: ""The front cover draws attention and gives a non-judgmental approach, reassuring others that there are many people who suffer the same way that they do and they aren’t alone.  “'It’s always good to talk' is a saying that is heard over and over when it comes to opening up about mental health and it's a good stepping stone to beginning any recovery journey. Information is then provided on whom to talk to.  “I'm also spreading suicide awareness and this is more for the family, friends and loved ones of those who suffer from poor mental health and/or suicidal thoughts etc. It provides helpful information and most importantly highlights signs of those whom may be suicidal. How many times has 'I didn’t know/see the signs' been said after someone has committed suicide? It helps make people more aware.  ""There's a focus too on practising self care and this explains what it is and ‘self help’ techniques. I think it is important to be open and ‘real’ whenever we talk about mental health and suicide as it may encourage others to speak up and seek help they need.  ""It also includes a list of the professional help based in Northern Ireland (local to my area in Ballymena) and this sign-posts sufferers and their loved ones.""  (Image: Submitted)  Natalie added: ""The Ballymena area has been hit recently with a number of suicides so it has been a really hard time for everyone, young people especially so I really want to do whatever I can to try and help. I've struggled with mental health issues myself since my teens with episodes of depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  ""You can find yourself in some dark places and thinking that you're never going to make it or feeling that there's no light at the end of the tunnel but obviously there is. Over the past few years, I've been working with counsellors, therapists and my GP and community mental health teams and I'm doing so much better as a result than I was.  ""People who are feeling low can reach out and avail of these services too and I want to encourage them to talk to someone, whether it be their family or a professional. Ultimately life is short and we're losing too many people to suicide.  ""Now I'm wishing to possibly have the leaflet printed myself to be able to have them spread out into the Ballymena area such as shops, libraries and possibly being able to post them through letterboxes of our local areas such as Cullybackey, Ahoghill, Galgorm and Ballymena itself.""

"suicide","2020-10-10","19:00:00","{""Caerdydd"", ""Cardiff"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T03:30:00","It all started with a conversation between two childhood friends. Roberto Simone, a business analyst, and Neil Driscoll, who works for the railway signalling programme, met up in 2020 after the first lockdown to play some football - but the joy of the reunion was tempered by tragic updates about people they knew.  ""Neil and myself were talking after a football session about our general concerns for mental health - sharing accounts of men that had either taken their own lives or weren't in a good condition mentally following the challenges of the pandemic,"" said Roberto, who is from Cardiff.  ""We just thought that there's got to be something out there that can almost curb this, or at least alleviate some of the issues that are prevalent."" This was the first seed of the idea for Brawd, Roberto and Neil's charity dedicated to men's mental health, which eventually came to fruition two years later.  In October last year, they started thinking more seriously about the venture and got the ball rolling. ""We'd never done anything like this before. Although I'm a business analyst, and I understand how businesses operate and work, a charity is a whole different ball game,"" said Roberto, 40.  Read more: Police helicopter over Cardiff in dramatic car c hase as fugitives swap vehicles repeatedly  Nathan Cox, James Thomas and Adam Virgin later joined the group to offer more support, and so Brawd was born. Brawd - which means brother in Welsh - strives to remove the bravado surrounding male wellbeing and give men an opportunity to talk openly about their issues without judgement.  Its main service is in-person support group sessions, the first of which was held in January this year. But the team also runs social activities, hosts a bi-monthly radio show for the mental health unit at Llandough Hospital and is planning on launching a podcast.  Men 18 and over from all backgrounds are welcome to join - and they don't need a referral, nor pay a penny. Roberto said: ""The one thing that really became apparent when I did a lot of research, before we decided to roll it out, was that no-one else is doing something similar to what we were envisaging.""  He added: ""We all know that mental health is something that's talked about quite extensively and has been for years, but my question as an analyst - and I was looking at this - is: why hasn't it changed? This is the one facet that really baffled and perplexed me to the point at which [I realised] we needed to do something different and unique than what's out there at the moment.""  (Image: Brawd)  The first session took place at Bro Coffi on Papermill Road at the beginning of the year. The sessions are now bi-weekly, taking place every Monday evening at the coffee shop and every Thursday evening at Ty Canna in Canton, with around 20 men ranging from their early 20s to early 60s attending.  The primary aim is to provide a safe space for men to offload their worries, and both find and offer support. But attendees are also encouraged to complete personal development exercises to help track their progress over time.  ""We're not a primary care or primary service for mental health - we're the secondary service that provides or prevents that next stage of referral or medical attention that's needed,"" said Roberto. ""Some of the stories that we've heard are that they feel like a burden talking to their friends and their family...And they may not want to talk, they may not want to share stories - and some don't, some just sit there and listen. You can see the changes though in their character and their behaviour.""  The transformation the team has witnessed in some of the attendees has been ""staggering"", he said. ""We've seen individuals that have turned up to these meetings, and been completely unrecognisable weeks later.""  Nick Loader, who is in charge of Brawd's marketing and joined the team about three months ago, added: ""Some really serious people have walked through Roberto's door with issues that you think: 'God, are we going to be able to make a difference here?' And they absolutely have...it's quite incredible.""  Brawd prides itself on its ""old school"" approach, as a walk-in, face-to-face organisation, rather than an online support group. ""One thing I think people are losing nowadays in the modern world is that face to face. So life is more virtual, dating is online, meetings are online. When do you get together and really have a chat?"" said Nick.  Describing the nature of the sessions, he continued: ""There is a lot of sharing, and there are moments to support each other. But there's also a lot of laughter and there's also a lot of positivity. So you very quickly move beyond the particularly deep stuff, and just get to sharing, enjoying each other's company, and then round to positive action.  ""And that positive action could be being aware of your mental health triggers and doing something about those; getting good exercise; eating a good diet; taking your mind off your worries; having a laugh with the other lads - and that's what Brawd does. It really puts a heart and a community around people that are suffering. And I think that's what attracted to me...I really wanted to help out once I saw that.""  Part of that positive action is getting attendees to put their talents and skills to use to grow the charity from within - in the aim they can ultimately overcome their individual issues in the process. One member of the group wrote a poem, which the others learnt off by heart and performed to camera. The result was a short film promoting the charity and its mission.  Group members also helped set up, sell tickets and sell merchandise for Brawd's official launch event at the Fairwater Conservative Club in April. Ahead of Mental Health Awareness Week (May 15 to May 21), the charity launched a rock single, named after its tagline 'You're Not Alone'. Written by close friend Martin Power and produced by the Studio 14 Collective, the song is now available on most streaming platforms, including Spotify, YouTube Music and Apple Music.  (Image: Nick Loader/Studio 14 Collective)  Throughout Mental Health Awareness Week itself, events Brawd is holding include wild swimming, a stress workshop, and a curry night. Asked how the charity had improved the wellbeing of the team itself, Roberto said he'd felt a ""dramatic"" change.  ""It's interesting now that I will not hesitate if I'm speaking to a friend or a member of the family to either recognise and mention that I think that either they should attend [the sessions] or at least take some take some time out...I wouldn't have done that a year ago, at all,"" he said.  ""Brawd has definitely shown me that sharing is strong, that sharing is positive, that sharing can lead to really, really good things. And if you do ask for support, it is given,"" Nick added. ""The message for men in Wales that are suffering from poor mental health is to get involved and see how it can affect your life positively. Our ambition really is to grow Brawd into a national organisation and have a hub in every borough of Wales.""  You can read more about Brawd here and follow them on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

"suicide","2023-12-05","Not Discerned","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T18:36:29","Shannon Hanchett, mother of two and owner of the Norman Cookie Cottage, died in the Cleveland County jail in December while waiting for a mental health evaluation. A health inspector found that jailers failed to perform safety checks while Hanchett was under suicide watch. (Oklahoma Watch photo illustration)  Cleveland County detention officers failed to perform required safety checks on detainees in critical care the same month two women died waiting for mental health evaluations in the jail, a health inspector found.  Jailers failed to follow a policy that requires them to observe detainees who are violent, suicidal or struggling with mental health problems at least every 15 minutes.  A state Health Department inspector reviewed logs for at least four people detained in December and January. Jailers missed scheduled checks on all of the unnamed detainees.  Logs from Dec. 5 and 6 reveal that detainees were left alone and unsupervised for up to 45 minutes at a time. Norman mother Shannon Hanchett was under critical watch on those days, according to a Health Department incident report.  Hanchett, 38, died in a medical cell on Dec. 8, hours before she was scheduled to receive a court-ordered mental health evaluation from Griffin Memorial Hospital. Her death raised questions from the community about the jail’s care of those who are locked inside. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has yet to rule on Hanchett’s cause of death.  Those 15-minute checks are the minimum standard for detainees in distress, said Richard Forbus, a former jail commander and spokesman for the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. They can’t be housed with other detainees because that could lead to a fight, he said. Isolating them can exacerbate mental health issues, he said, which is why it is important to check on them so frequently.  Forbus said 45 minutes may not seem like a long time, but it can be dangerous or even deadly for people in crisis.  A month after the inspection, Joe Allen Sims Jr. died by suicide, alone in a cell where he was under critical watch, according to a Health Department incident report. Video footage shows Sims hanged himself 16 minutes after an officer had last checked on him, according to the report. Officers found his body 77 minutes later.  The day Sims died was former Norman Police Lt. Cary Bryant’s second day running the jail. Bryant previously trained law enforcement officers statewide to respond to people experiencing mental health crises. He was hired at the jail Jan. 30 to evaluate mental health and substance abuse treatment and policies. Two weeks later, Sheriff Chris Amason hired Bryant to run the jail.  Amason was unavailable for an interview.  Bryant refused to talk about the inspection, saying he wouldn’t address anything that happened before he took over. Bryant replaced Deputy Chief Scott Sedbrook, who along with support services head Maj. Dennis Hansen, resigned in January, weeks after the deaths of Hanchett and Noble grandmother Kathryn Milano.  Milano was in a medical cell waiting for a mental health assessment when jail staff found her unconscious with blood dripping from her nose on Dec. 20. She was taken to Norman Regional Hospital, where she was removed from life support and died the following day. The medical examiner has not yet released her cause of death.  The state Health Department oversees living conditions in Oklahoma’s 93 jails. If a jail fails to correct violations, the commissioner of health can file a complaint with the county prosecutor or state attorney general who could file charges. Since 2019, the only complaint filed was against Oklahoma County.  The January inspection included investigations into the deaths of Hanchett and Milano, three serious detainee injuries, one attempted suicide and one complaint, according to the inspection report.  The inspection also found a faulty smoke detector and missed safety checks for detainees who were not under critical supervision. The Health Department mandates hourly checks during which jailers are required to view every detainee and all areas of each cell. Some of those checks were missed after Hanchett was released from critical care and fewer than 48 hours before she died.  An inspector cited similar violations at the jail in May of 2022. Detention officers missed dozens of 15-minute checks required for three detainees under suicide watch, according to the report.  In one case, the report shows jailers missed 50 of 73 safety checks needed over 18 hours for a detainee deemed a suicide risk.  A 2021 inspection of the jail found no violations.  Safety checks were the second most cited violation by inspectors in 2021, according to a Health Department analysis. Fire safety violations were the most cited.  The inspection reports include a plan of correction for each of the violations.  Each plan directs jail leadership to interview staff about why the violation occurred, review policies to determine if they need to be updated and adopt further corrective actions as needed. The requirements are vague and nearly identical for varying violations.  Health inspectors have no authority over disciplinary action. It is up to jail administrators to investigate the cause of the violations and determine disciplinary action.  An inspector is required to perform a follow-up inspection to ensure the jail has fixed deficiencies, according to the department’s website. There is no set time for the return visit. It is based on the severity of deficiencies and how busy inspectors are, the website states. The department has two inspectors covering the entire state. January’s report is the most recent inspection of Cleveland County’s jail available online.  An Oklahoma Watch review of past inspections found that violation follow-ups most often occur during the following year’s inspection.  Oklahoma Watch, at oklahomawatch.org, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that covers public-policy issues facing the state.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbHJlY29yZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9qYWlsZXJzLW5lZ2xlY3RlZC1zYWZldHktY2hlY2tzLWJlZm9yZS1pbm1hdGUtZGVhdGhzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-18","10:00:00","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T11:11:55","The Post’s national treasure, Tristin Hopper, filed a story earlier this week on a new Research Co. poll about Canadians’ attitudes toward legalized assisted suicide, an industry in which we are now in the vanguard of the world. Hopper’s piece emphasized surprisingly high levels of support for providing medical assistance with suicide to people whose problems might be described as primarily social.  Then again, maybe the levels aren’t surprising. The key question, which is reported with detailed crosstabs on page 4 of Research Co.’s PDF file , uses the “medical assistance in dying” euphemism. The results might have been different if the wording of the questionnaire had involved some plain-English query such as, “Should people be allowed to kill themselves for no other reason than that they’re poor?” Most people, it is easy to forget, aren’t active news consumers on the level of literally everyone reading these words. If you haven’t been following the rhetorical struggles over “MAID,” “medical assistance in dying” sounds like something you might expect as a matter of course. If you were dying, would you not want “medical assistance”?  The bottom line is that the poll found that a significant minority of Canadians are open to allowing MAID requests for reasons such as “poverty,” “homelessness” or “inability to receive medical treatment” (a useless phrase that might have all sorts of meanings, and which might easily be read to include incurable degenerative disease). It’s a very outnumbered minority. Only 27 per cent of respondents supported assisted suicide for poverty either “strongly” or “moderately,” but the “strongly disagrees” alone were 44 per cent of the weighted sample and the “moderately disagrees” add another 18 per cent. The numbers are about the same in the “homelessness” category. The figures vary surprisingly little by political affiliation or geography, but older people are much more opposed to legal euthanasia, as you would probably anticipate if you are one of those.  My takeaway from the poll is that this probably isn’t an issue that is best handled by means of a simple, and presumably automated, poll with a brute “agree”/“disagree” scale. Still, some people will be terrified and disgusted by the willingness of a few respondents to answer “Full speed ahead” to complicated questions about assisted suicide for social reasons. I would propose that somewhere around half the “agrees” are people who really do espouse a radical position that people have a right to dispose of their own lives for their own reasons. Poll that one, with that wording, and you’ll get lots of support! I’ll probably vote for it myself! — my problems with state-provided physician assistance in voluntary suicide aren’t really located in the “voluntary” part of this new legal phenomenon.  I would suspect a lot of respondents aren’t consciously radical about assisted suicide, but can imagine themselves considering suicide for reasons of catastrophic life failure, reasons nobody really thinks of as purely social. Everybody knows consciously that “homeless” people aren’t all crack-smoking street-defecators with hundred-page histories of violent crime, but if you are asked about “homelessness” as a phenomenon, what mental picture comes to mind? One finds oneself wishing the poll had rural/urban breakdowns; if you live in the core of a big Canadian city these days, you’ll see a few people on any day who would (and will) need 10 full-time social workers apiece to establish something vaguely resembling a decent, ordinary human future.  To put it another way, if you live downtown in Victoria or Regina or Winnipeg, you are confronted continuously with unassisted suicide in plain sight. If this is stoicizing the Canadian character or making some of Research Co.’s poll respondents more nihilistic, that ought not to be such a big surprise. And troubling crosstabs in a semi-competent poll about MAID aren’t going to be the only political side-effect.

"suicide","2019-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Perrysburg"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T23:13:55","By JULIE CARLE  BG Independent News  When it comes to mental health services in Wood County, residents have access to everything from prevention, promotion and intervention to treatment and recovery. A recent mental health conference, hosted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness Wood County, shared the mental health continuum of care accessible to Wood County residents from local agencies and organizations.  Prevention programs in Wood County schools are making a difference in behaviors such as alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, said Kyle Clark, director of Wood County Educational Service Center’s Prevention Education Program.  Based on the Wood County Youth Survey on Addiction and Mental Health that is conducted every two years with students in grades five through 12, alcohol, cigarette and marijuana use all dropped significantly in the 18 years since the survey started.  “Most recently, annual alcohol use and 30-day alcohol use were at 35.8% and 21.3%, respectively, down from 70.1% and 47.3% when the survey was first conducted. Similarly, current 30-day cigarette use fell to 1.7% from 27.2%, and annual marijuana use went from 30.3% in 2003 to 22.3% in 2023.  “The data is very good. It shows that over time, prevention has worked,” he said. “Student usage of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs in Wood County has decreased since 2003. The national data shows usage is also going down, but not at the rate ours is.”  Over the years, the survey has expanded to ask youth about mental health, bullying and relationship violence, gaming and gambling, and most recently, adverse childhood experiences.  Nine school districts and Penta Career Center work on prevention programs with the Educational Service Center. Each district has a prevention specialist for at least some amount of time each week, ranging from two days up to a full-time staff person five days a week.  “The full-time staff person is in the building as part of the school staff. Our people are there talking to teachers and seeing the relationships. That is what helps promote our programs,” said Angela Patchen, Prevention Education Program manager. “We served at least 4,000 individual, unduplicated students in the past year.”  Mental health promotion and education are the cornerstones of Courtney Rice’s work at NAMI Wood County. As manager of community education and marketing, Rice helps to market the different free programs, services and events that NAMI offers.  “A big part of promotion is education—educating the public about mental health, getting them started to have those conversations about mental health and to feel more comfortable talking about mental health and addiction,” she said.  NAMI programs often address the stigma surrounding mental health through advocacy and awareness. Billboards, events, and awareness messaging around different populations, are part of promotion’s efforts, she explained.  While NAMI doesn’t provide treatment, they advocate for individuals with mental illness, offer support groups to various constituents and help the public navigate the mental health system by referring them to the multitude of local service providers.  The Hope Institute, under the leadership of Derek Lee, is an outpatient facility that specializes in intervention and stabilization for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation, said Derek Lee, CEO of the Hope Institute and Perrysburg Counseling Services. They use two evidence-based practices that have been proven to treat suicidal ideation effectively.  Intervention is an action intended to interfere with and stop or modify a process to halt, manage or alter the course of any pathological processes of a disease or disorder. Treatment is the administration of appropriate measures, such as psychotherapy or drugs, that are designed to relieve a pathological condition. “Intervention changes a behavior and treatment takes care of or manages a condition,” Lee explained.  Crisis services in Wood County are available for children and adults. Children’s Resource Center provides mental health services, including crisis services, for children, said Danielle Kutan, director of emergency services at CRC. Unison Health has recently opened a crisis stabilization unit in Bowling Green for adults 18 years and up, said Jennifer Emahiser, Unison’s senior director of services in Wood County.  At CRC, family members, schools, law enforcement or clinicians can call to ask for a crisis assessment for youth who have suicidal ideation, aggressions, family conflict or are exhibiting self-harm. “We don’t turn anyone away,” Kutan said.  They have a 24/7 Mobile Response Stabilization Service that can assess the youth at any location in the county.  Unison utilizes a crisis line for adults in crisis—419-502 HOPE (4673)—to triage calls from clients or family members of individuals with mental illness. The service, staffed with licensed clinicians around the clock provide the initial assessment to determine if follow-up services are needed. Local law enforcement officials, clinicians and health care providers can call the unit directly.  Both CRC and Unison’s crisis stabilization unit said their response time is usually between 30-60 minutes.  After Denise Meine-Graham lost her teenage son to suicide in 2012, she founded LOSS Community Services, a nonprofit organization that supports individuals bereaved by suicide. She spoke about suicide postvention, which she called a form of prevention or intervention after a suicide.  As a consultant now, Meine-Graham advocates for LOSS teams in communities to be proactive and peer-based. “Their purpose is to install seeds of hope to those who are bereaved by suicide,” she said.  Crista Metzger-Leady and Amanda Like, both on the staff of NAMI Wood County, shared the agency’s recovery programs, especially highlighting the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) workshop. WRAP helps individuals identify their own wellness tools, create a daily maintenance plan, as well as an action plan for identifying stressors and early warning signs. NAMI will offer a WRAP workshop June 22-23 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the NAMI office. Details are available on the NAMI website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYmdpbmRlcGVuZGVudG1lZGlhLm9yZy9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtbG9va3MtYXQtbG9jYWwtY29udGludXVtLW9mLWNhcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-03-16","Not Discerned","{""Albuquerque"", ""NewMexico"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T22:51:06","Albuquerque police fatally shot a man who officers said was wielding a makeshift spear and having a mental health crisis Friday afternoon at an apartment near the ABQ BioPark.  Gilbert Gallegos, an Albuquerque Police Department spokesman, said the man was in his early 40s, and a relative told police he had behavioral health issues “dating back several decades.”  He said two officers shot the man, and no officers were injured.  It was the second time Albuquerque police shot a person in less than a week and the fourth time this year, but the first incident that has been fatal.  In 2022, Albuquerque police tallied a record-high 18 police shootings, with 10 being fatal. Several of those shootings involved people in the midst of a mental health crisis, often threatening to kill themselves.  Gallegos said Friday’s incident began around 3 p.m., when a woman called 911 to report that her brother was threatening suicide. He said police handled the suicide call partly due to the sister saying the man also threatened to kill her.  He said officers went to the man’s apartment at The Beach, a complex at Central and Tingley. He said police talked to the man through a door and back window but he wouldn’t come out.  Gallegos said officers requested a Mobile Crisis Team — which includes a behavioral health clinician — but one wasn’t available. Two of the officers at the scene did have enhanced crisis intervention training, he said.  Police determined the man was alone in the apartment and no one was in danger so they were planning to leave. Gallegos said the man suddenly came out armed with a homemade spear, a 6-foot pole with a knife taped to the end.  Gallegos said the man threatened three officers with the pole repeatedly at close range as they backed away. He said an officer tried to use a Taser on the man twice but was unsuccessful, once because the man knocked the prongs off.  He said the man eventually had two officers backed up against the balcony of a breezeway, with nowhere to go, and around that time both officers fired, striking the man. He died at the scene.  Gallegos said police learned the man had changed his Facebook profile hours earlier to say he was a “professional killer.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFicWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzI2MDA1NzIvYWxidXF1ZXJxdWUtcG9saWNlLWtpbGwtbWFuLWluLWNyaXNpcy13aG8td2FzLWFsbGVnZWRseS13aWVsZGluZy1zcGVhci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-03-14","Not Discerned","{""Rogers"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T07:06:45","    U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., and a bipartisan group of colleagues have introduced the Farmers First Act of 2023 to expand mental health services access for agricultural producers.  The Farmers First Act of 2023 would reauthorize the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN), which connects farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers with mental health assistance programs and resources.  ""Arkansas agricultural producers help feed and clothe the world,"" Boozman said in a news release Friday.  ""This responsibility creates unique stresses as they manage operations and face challenges that are often beyond their control. This legislation continues efforts to improve access to mental health services in rural communities and creates additional opportunities to connect agriculture workers and producers with behavioral health providers to enhance the quality of life for families and individuals throughout farm country.""  The rate of suicide for farmers is 3½ times higher than the general population, according to the National Rural Health Association; 61% of farmers and farm workers and 52% of rural adults also reported experiencing more stress and mental health concerns in 2021 compared to the year prior, per a Morning Consult poll.  The poll found that while stigma related to seeking mental health assistance has gone down, it's still a factor in agricultural communities.  The legislation would increase available funding for the network to $15 million per fiscal year through 2028.  [DOCUMENT: Read the proposed Farmers First Act » arkansasonline.com/520farmers1st/]  The 2018 farm bill included initiatives to improve rural mental health resources and expand suicide prevention programs in rural communities but this legislation would build upon such programming.  State departments of agriculture, state extension services and nonprofit organizations would receive funding to start helplines, offer suicide prevention training for farm advocates and establish support groups for agricultural workers.  Boozman, who is ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, added a provision to the reauthorization measure to enhance connections between FRSAN grantees and behavioral health medical providers like health centers, rural health clinics, critical access hospitals and certified community behavioral health clinics.  The legislation is led by U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa., co-sponsored by committee chairwoman, U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and a bipartisan group of senators.  Support for continuing and increased funding for the network is supported by the American Psychological Association Services and a number of agricultural organizations like the American Farm Bureau Federation, the U.S. Cattlemen's Association, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the American Soybean Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Corn Growers Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Young Farmers Coalition and more.  The committee has held multiple hearings this year and is currently in the process of writing the next farm bill, which is reauthorized by Congress every five years.

Jeremy Lake Bailey, 34, was arrested after allegedly shooting three family members and three of their four dogs in their home near 1800 E Gentile St. on Friday, May 19.  Authorities said around 9:45 a.m. Bailey called dispatch to report “there will be a murder-suicide” and provided his address. He allegedly told police multiple times on the phone the victims were already dead reportedly saying he had killed them around 20 minutes prior.  Police said Bailey called dispatch again when police arrived to tell authorities he was leaving the house to be taken into custody. He then reportedly complied with all police commands and was arrested without incident.  Authorities then swept the home reportedly finding the victims and deceased dogs in multiple areas of the house. On the upstairs level, police report finding one deceased victim in each of the three rooms.  The victims have been identified as his wife, Anastasia Stevens, and her parents Becky and Donald Stevens who were visiting.  Around the same time Bailey first called the police, he also reportedly posted through his wife’s Facebook account. The post read: “MASSACRE SUICIDE Jeremy Bailey JUST KILLED EVERYONE Becky Stevens Don Stevens AND 3 OF THE 4 DOGS 1832 EAST GENTILE STREET LAYTON.”  The post received dozens of comments from friends and loved ones reaching out, many of which asked Anastasia Stevens to call them back so they would know if she was safe and if the post was true.  Earlier in the day, police said one of the victims had sent a message to a therapist saying “I think we may have a very real problem,” according to the affidavit. The message reportedly said they had uncovered something and “it’s really bad. Like scary. I think it may be time for legal interference.”  The victim also reportedly told the therapist that they could not talk because Bailey was still in the house.  Police said Bailey told them he had stored his guns in a friend’s garage because he was “thinking of doing this a few days ago.”  He reportedly found another gun he had forgotten about that belonged to one of the victims on the day of the shooting. Police found evidence of him purchasing ammunition around 9 a.m. that morning.  Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.  While in custody, police said they overheard Bailey say “I can’t believe I did it” in an “excited” way. He also reportedly said he would rather have the death penalty than live his life in prison and asked if a firing squad was still an active punishment.  Bailey was booked in the Davis County Jail facing three counts of aggravated murder and three counts of felony discharge of a firearm, both first-degree felonies. He also faces three counts of aggravated cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4tdXRhaC9sYXl0b24tbWFuLWFsbGVnZWRseS1jb25mZXNzZXMtd2lmZS1wYXJlbnRzLWRlYXRocy_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmM0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoZXJuLXV0YWgvbGF5dG9uLW1hbi1hbGxlZ2VkbHktY29uZmVzc2VzLXdpZmUtcGFyZW50cy1kZWF0aHMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-10","22:00:00","{""Brampton"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T13:23:20","Editor’s note: If you or anyone you know is struggling with mental health there are a number of ways to get help, including by calling Talk Suicide Canada at 1-833-456-4566. A list of local crisis centres is also available here.  Amidst a global reckoning around the unregulated sale of sodium nitrite online for the purpose of suicide, Peel Region is reporting a 10 per cent increase in calls “involving either attempted suicide or suicide” in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.  Police response to those calls in some jurisdictions, sources allege, has been intense.  The uptick in suicide calls, which police say could also be attributable to a new internal coding protocol, comes at a time when police forces around the world are looking closely at recent suicides due to the sale and distribution of sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite is a potentially lethal substance with legal applications as a meat preservative, but the compound can be deadly if ingested even in small amounts.  In early May, Peel police announced Mississauga man Kenneth Law had been arrested and charged with two counts of counselling or aiding suicide due to his alleged online sales of this substance, along with other dangerous products which can be used for self-harm. Police forces across Canada have confirmed their cooperation with Peel police on the matter, and some, including the Durham Regional Police Service, have reassigned cases previously ruled as suicides to their homicide units.  The charges against Law have not been proven in court. Law is currently awaiting a bail hearing.  According to a representative from Peel Regional Police, calls relating to suicide or self-harm trigger a complex internal response, which can include the deployment of two metal health teams: the Crisis Outreach and Support Team (COAST) and the Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team (MCRRT). COAST is a plainclothes unit which performs follow-up services when individuals are referred to PRP by the Peel-Dufferin division of the Canadian Mental Health Association, while MCRRT provides a rapid response to urgent mental health concerns and ongoing crises, including a visit from a specially trained uniformed officer and a crisis support worker.  According to police, a crisis support worker will typically take the lead on MCRRT visits, relaying their findings to the officer as needed. Patrol officers attend mental health calls on their own only if the MCRRT is not available.  Users of a pro-suicide forum, which CP24 has monitored in the aftermath of Law’s arrest, claim Canadian police have performed dozens of wellness checks since the investigation of Law, which was first kicked off by a Times of London investigation in April.  Users of the site, which CP24 is not naming, have said police have shown up in the middle of the night without support workers, and some have alleged multiple visits in the span of a few days. Some site users say they purchased sodium nitrite from Law, while others say they merely filled out a form but never received the product.  One site user, who spoke with CP24 on the condition of anonymity, says they received two consecutive suicide checks from a police force within Ontario in the weeks following Law’s arrest. The source did not confirm if they reside in Peel Region or elsewhere in the province.  “I had prepared myself that this was likely to happen, but it still rattled me,” the source told CP24. They said they had disposed of sodium nitrite purchased from Law several months before his arrest.  “I was truthful, I was honest,” they said. “I answered their questions…and then they came again. Different officers, claiming the dispatch system hadn’t updated and showed my case as open/unresolved. I repeated what I told their colleagues, they had no more questions and left.  “By then I was physically sick. Shaking. Sweats. Nausea. Anxiety sky-high,” the source continued. “Living with a mental illness is like riding a wave. It takes a lot of energy and concentration to stay on that surf board and it doesn’t take much to kick you off into the cold water. The wellness checks definitely threw me off mine.”  The source claims their wellness checks did not include a social worker or plainclothes officer, rather uniformed officers who embarrassed the source and continued to “hang around” in their neighbourhood after checking in on them.  “Our mental healthcare system is overwhelmed and underfunded,” the source said. “Let’s please not make things worse for those who are one or two steps away from homelessness.”  Andrea Westbrook, manager of the Toronto Community Crisis Service, told CP24 that TCCS strives to reduce stigma and reduce “any unnecessary police involvement” in wellness checks when possible.  “We strive to tailor the response to the situation…we want to understand as much about that person as possible, and understand what they need to get back to what they define as their fullest ability to engage in their life. We really want to tailor our services to the individual, and give them space, and understand who they are and what their story is.”  Westbrook added that wellness checks are only a first step in ensuring a client’s well-being, and that an impactful check should include follow-up care and support.  “That’s a really essential part of our response model,” she said. “Not just one-time engagement, but ensuring people are connected to support. We want to work together with police to ensure that we’re able to contribute to what’s needed within the space. We want to respect each other’s roles and respect the individual and what their needs are.

"suicide","2023-05-18","14:30:00","{""Carmarthen"", ""Carmarthenshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-21T03:50:00","Losing her beloved son to suicide was difficult enough for Jenny Tancock to come to terms with. But then she discovered that one of the people who had found him took a video at the scene and posted it on social media for everyone to see.  This week, that man, 22-year-old Jacob Morse, was jailed for the sickening act that has added to the immeasurable grief Daniel Knott's family were already feeling. He was one of the first on the scene when Daniel's body was found but instead of calling the emergency services, he took a video and shared it on social media. Just hours after learning of her son's death, Daniel's distraught mother Jenny was informed that the video of her dead son was being shared on social media.  ""To lose a child is the worst thing anyone could experience,"" she says. ""To lose a child to suicide adds another level of pain. To then find out that some sicko has filmed our son there, so vulnerable, beggars belief.""  Morse, of Llysonnen Road, Travellers Rest, on the outskirts of Carmarthen, was arrested by police and charged with circulating a video on social media that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. It is an offence that does not often come before the courts. Documents show that the court found the offence so serious that ""only a custodial sentence can be justified"". It was described as an ""extremely aggravating offence and an immature act"".  On Thursday, he was sentenced at Llanelli Magistrates' Court to six weeks after pleading guilty. The video has been taken down but Daniel's family are angered that he was not sentenced to a longer jail term and want more regulations put in place to stop anything like this happening again to another family.  ""I haven't seen the video, I couldn't watch it but the thought of it is unbearable,"" says Jenny. ""It is worse than if he had walked into my house and hit me over the head with a baseball bat. It is hard to explain the pain but it is a physical thing.""  (Image: UGC)  For now Jenny wants to remember her ""beautiful son"", who she also describes as a ""simply a wonderful son"".  ""From the day he was born he was a larger than life character: hyper-intelligent, bright, funny, quirky, rebellious, sometimes naughty, but oh-so-full of energy and life,"" she said in a victim impact statement that was submitted to the court.  ""He oozed love and affection - he had a truly beautiful, kind soul. To say Dan saw the world differently would be an understatement. On the one hand it could be a scary place for him and he had his ‘demons’ as they say. On the other hand he saw the beauty in everything and everyone. He was always kind and generous.""  Unfortunately a car accident seven years ago was life-changing for Daniel, who suffered a fractured skull and broken back in the collision. He was struggling with severe pain and hated his mobility issues that had robbed him of many of the things he loved to do, and in March last year it got too much for him.  Jenny says: ""Daniel’s funeral was on Saturday, 15 April. Well over 200 people came to pay their last respects and we, his family and friends, have received countless messages of condolence. So many people that have known Dan from childhood to adulthood have taken time to contact the family with their own stories and memories. Every single one mentions his kindness, empathy and compassion for others.  ""Daniel was fiercely loyal to friends and always, always stood up for the underdog, always seeking justice. He could never tolerate a bully but, sadly, throughout his life he came up against quite a few of them. Unbelievably even in death, Daniel has had to face the indignity and callousness of a bully. Jake Morse has taken our grief and amplified it tenfold - he has tainted the memory of our lovely son in the most cruel and undignified way.  ""For this man to then share it online, where it has gone ‘viral’ for the world to see, is unbearable. I have not seen the video, I have only seen a screenshot, as I don’t think I could bear it - but imagination is probably just as unbearable. It is all I can think about. It is tormenting me every minute of every day. Countless numbers of people from our communities, as well as nationally and even internationally have seen it and all have expressed their absolute disgust and horror at what Jake Morse has done. We as a family have sadly learnt that the internet is no longer just something that is ‘out there’ - it has touched us in the here and now, deeply affecting us in the real world in a truly devastating way.""  Now, Jenny has pledged to campaign to stop anything like what has happened to her family happening again.  ""What this man has done to my son, his family and friends, at the worst time of our lives, is something I intend to campaign against in the future in order to raise awareness and deter others,"" she said.  ""Six weeks is not long enough for what he has done but that fact our justice system is also being seen to be condemning this man’s actions will go a long way towards ensuring that this sort of sick deed is never repeated again.""  * You can contact the Samaritans for non-judgmental advice 24/7, 365 days a year, by calling 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org.

The new list prepared by the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliate Jamaat-ul-Ahraar (JuA) also includes several other senior government officials, and has emerged a day after rightwing religious-political party Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq survived a suicide bombing in a remote area of Balochistan province on May 19, the News International reported on Friday.  ""The names of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and PML-N senior vice president Maryam Nawaz are on a 'hit list' of terrorist outfits TTP and JuA, which are planning to launch attacks on leaders of the armed forces, intelligence agencies and politicians,"" said the report.  Apart from making senior politicians their target, the TTP is also planning a series of attacks on the country's armed forces and check-posts of law enforcement agencies.  As per media reports, a terror group — which includes two suicide bombers — has entered Punjab under the supervision of JuA leader Rafiullah.  TTP commander, Sarbakaf Mohmand, praised those who participated in the countrywide riots on May 9 after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party chief Imran Khan was arrested and announced his support for the miscreants, the report said.  Terrorism incidents have risen in Pakistan in recent months, with security forces ramping up operations to defeat terrorists.  According to a report by the Centre for Research and Security Studies, more than 850 people were killed or injured in militant attacks and counterterrorism operations in the first quarter of 2023 — a figure that was half the total number of killed or wounded people in 2022.  The report stated that January 2023 was the most fatal one for security forces in more than a decade.  ""The fatalities of security and government officials almost doubled, from 88 in the first quarter of last year to 167 in the first quarter this year,"" the report said, adding that the TTP carried out at least 22 attacks during January-March, causing at least 107 deaths.  -With PTI Input","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29raW5kaWEuY29tL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvcGFraXN0YW4tbWFyeWFtLW5hd2F6LW1pbmlzdGVyLXJhbmEtc2FuYXVsbGFoLWluLXBha2lzdGFuLXRhbGliYW4tcy1oaXQtbGlzdC1zYXlzLXJlcG9ydC1uZXdzLTI4ODA1N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Renowned and influential British writer Martin Amis has died, aged 73, at his home in Lake Worth, Florida.  His wife Isabel Fonseca told media on Saturday that the author of searing and insightful works such as Money: A Suicide Note, London Fields, and Time’s Arrow, passed away on Friday after a bout with oesophageal cancer.  Amis was “one of the most acclaimed and discussed writers of the past 50 years and the author of 14 novels,” said the website of Booker Prizes, the leading literary awards for fiction in the United Kingdom.  In 2008, he was named one of the 50 best British writers since 1945 and listed for the Booker Prize twice.  Publisher Vintage Books said it was “devastated” by the death of Amis.  “He leaves a towering legacy and an indelible mark on the British cultural landscape, and will be missed enormously,” Vintage said on its Twitter account.  We are devastated at the death of our author and friend, Martin Amis. Our thoughts are with all his family and loved ones, especially his children and wife Isabel. He leaves a towering legacy and an indelible mark on the British cultural landscape, and will be missed enormously. pic.twitter.com/aFSg2u7MbJ — Vintage Books (@vintagebooks) May 20, 2023  The author rose to literary celebrity in the 1980s as British fiction boomed, bringing to fame Amis alongside novelists including Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Kazuo Ishiguro and Ian McEwan.  It was with Money, published in 1984 with a comic take on consumerism, that Amis burst more broadly onto the literary scene.  In addition to his novels, Amis published two collections of stories and eight works of nonfiction.  In 2008, the Times of London named the younger Amis one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.  In recent decades, Amis became a public intellectual, frequently appearing on television, sometimes alongside his longtime friend Christopher Hitchens, a British-American writer and renowned atheist who died in 2011.  In an essay around the fifth anniversary of 9/11, The Age of Horrorism, Amis wrote that moderate Islam had lost a civil war within the faith.  Amis drew outrage and was accused of Islamophobia when he said in a 2006 interview: “There is a definite urge to say, ‘The Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order’.”  “Not letting them travel. Deportation further down the road. Curtailing of freedoms… until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjAvYWNjbGFpbWVkLWJyaXRpc2gtd3JpdGVyLW1hcnRpbi1hbWlzLWRpZXMtYWdlZC03M9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzIwL2FjY2xhaW1lZC1icml0aXNoLXdyaXRlci1tYXJ0aW4tYW1pcy1kaWVzLWFnZWQtNzM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And yet, it’s easy to get lost in the greatness of the man and forget that he, just like everyone else, might go through the same problems and issues as a human being. It wasn’t until years later that people discovered Phelps’s mental health issues. He has been vocal about it and even opened up about his dangerous thoughts. He credits therapy as a lifesaver for him. In a recent interview, Phelps recalled how he felt after completing his first therapy session. It was as if he breathed a new life after it.  Michael Phelps went on to achieve numerous laurels whilst keeping his mental health issues to himself. It wasn’t until he nearly retired, that he first opened up about it. In an exclusive interview, he spoke even more frankly about the subject and its importance for everyone.  Michael Phelps cannot thank therapy enough  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  “Leaving the office that day, I felt like a different person”, said Michael Phelps to People magazine, about his first-time experience with therapy. Phelps explained how going to therapy, as in literally entering the elevator to the therapist’s door, was no lesser of a challenge to him than any of his swimming pursuits. He was skeptical, unsure, and doubtful about therapy at first, but little did he know it would change his life forever.  Phelps continued, “I’m sure I cried my eyes out. My shoulders were higher, almost like there was a weight that was taken off of my back”. The Baltimore Bullet opened up completely and felt a childlike vulnerability that has stayed with him ever since. He realized the grave importance of therapy that day, and he forwarded its value to millions of his fans on Instagram recently.  Phelps has been vocal about his mental health more frequently in recent years. He even shared how he once had suicidal thoughts during a period of depression. But it wasn’t until 2014 that he first talked about it.

He continued, “It took me becoming vulnerable to have a chance at this thing called life”. Micahel Phelps has since been regular with his mental wellness, and he vows every day to work towards it. As the first therapy session was a lifesaving experience for him, Phelps advocates the same to everyone, urging them to take that first step towards positive well-being.

GEORGE — The words National Mental Health Awareness Month mean something to 1 in 5 adults in Southern Utah and the nation. At least, that’s what data from the National Institutes of Health says.  But the area, and the state as a whole, has catching up to do.  Utah has the largest percentage of its population – 30% – reportedly facing some form of mental illness, according to the latest report by Mental Health America. The same report ranks Utah sixth-to-last for mental health care with half of those needing mental health care in the state not having access to it.  Mental health has been an ongoing project for Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, the congressman who represents Southern Utah. He sponsored the legislation that established the 988 National Suicide Lifeline and is the co-chair of Congress’ Mental Health Caucus.  Stewart said one of the reasons for a National Mental Health Awareness Month is to end the stigma that leaves those with well-being issues too ashamed to seek help.  “We’re in the middle of an unprecedented mental health crisis, and it’s necessary that we elevate the conversation around this all-important issue,” Stewart said in a statement. “We can end the stigma of mental health, improve critical resources for those in need, and find bipartisan solutions – the Mental Health Caucus is proof of our progress. But the fight is far from over, and we can only hope for a healthier nation if we all do our collective duty to raise awareness.”  The term mental illness applies to so-called “mild” forms of mental illness like depression and anxiety. It includes autism and attention spectrum disorders or more life-threatening hits to a person’s well-being like eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia and other psychosis.  Mental Health Awareness Month started as an initiative by the National Association for Mental Health, now Mental Health America, in 1949 but is now an act of both the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. But there are growing efforts locally to both draw awareness to mental health issues and help those afflicted by them.  This includes:  The under-construction Washington County Receiving Center in Hurricane that will serve as a one-stop facility for all Southern Utah residents in the five counties that need help with mental health or substance abuse crises. It will also be a place where local law enforcement can bring people with mental health issues causing public disturbances instead of jail or the hospital.

"suicide","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T09:16:03","(GA Recorder) — Georgians living in rural communities continue to call the national suicide prevention hotline at higher rates than other parts of the state as the one-year anniversary of the rollout of 988 approaches.  But there’s another alarming statistic causing concern in recent years about Georgia’s rural areas: The suicide rate increased even as the overall rate declined.  If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.  “We know the challenge in rural Georgia – and across really rural America – is a lack of access,” said Kevin Tanner, commissioner of the state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities.  “Many parts of our state are having to drive well over an hour to access care and services. We also know that stigma is much higher in rural parts of our state,” he said.  Tanner, a former Republican lawmaker who became commissioner late last year, called 988 a “catalyst” for reducing stigma. This July will mark the one-year anniversary of the national three-digit dialing code’s launch.  Georgia has an advantage over other states that are building call intake centers from scratch. The Georgia Crisis and Access Line, where 988 calls go, was established in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to assist evacuees.  The state is also seen as a leader when it comes to its mobile crisis program, which sends trained mental health professionals out across the state. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency overseeing 988, held a town hall event in downtown Atlanta Friday to spotlight Georgia, holding it up as a model.  “This state is a star, and this state is one that should be lifted up as an example – and it already is,” Monica Johnson, director of the federal 988 and Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office, said at the event.  But the attention comes as the state agency responsible for the crisis call center was dealt a setback earlier this month when Gov. Brian Kemp rejected a $2.3 million funding increase for additional support to manage the ongoing rollout. Kemp also nixed extra salary bumps for mental health professionals.  Those cuts were part of a long list of line items in the budget that Kemp struck down across several agencies as concerns about future state revenues grow. Revenues dropped 16.5% last month, but overall tax collections remained up slightly – 0.9% – for the year.  “Call volume has not increased to a level requiring additional administrative support over existing levels,” Kemp wrote.  Other funding increases for 988 survived, including the $6.2 million the governor originally proposed for mobile crisis teams that are part of the services someone who calls the hotline may receive.  The calls to Georgia’s crisis center have increased by about 12%. But a federal estimate projects those calls will double once the new three-digit number is promoted through a marketing campaign, which is coming later.  “There’s some folks who may be skeptical of those numbers,” Tanner told reporters Friday. “We want to be very careful that we lay out a very clear, distinct plan about what we expect to see in Georgia, and we don’t just base it on maybe national data.”  To test what impact intensive marketing may have on call volume in Georgia, Tanner said his agency is planning a monthlong marketing campaign this summer in two mid-sized communities. The results may help justify future budget requests, he said.  Harper: ‘It takes care of the rest of us as well’  Things aren’t getting any easier in rural communities, particularly for farmers.  Inflation has made already rising input costs higher, causing ag producers to spend more to earn less as they put in long hours at tasks that often risk physical injuries. And their income depends on the whims of the market, crop-killing diseases and pests, and, of course, the weather. Just recently, a late freeze devastated Georgia peach crops.  But seeking help to deal with stress does not tend to come naturally in a profession where farmers are hard-wired to be self-sufficient, says Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper.  “They go to work every day with one thing in mind and focus on doing the job that they feel they’ve been called to do, and they do a phenomenal job at it,” Harper, who is also a farmer, said in an interview as part of mental health awareness month.  “But at the same time, I think – as those of us in this arena – that’s part of our weakness, too. Because whenever we are presented with a problem, we always try to find a way to fix it ourselves first.”  Harper, a Republican who was elected commissioner last fall, said he is working to increase his agency’s focus on mental health awareness. Harper pointed to a survey that yielded troubling results last year.  Nearly 30% of farmers reported thinking of dying by suicide at least once a month, according to the report produced by the Georgia Rural Health Innovation Center at Mercer University School of Medicine.  And 42% of all farmers have thought about dying by suicide at least once in the past 12 months, according to the report.  Among first-generation farmers, 61% said they had thought about dying by suicide in the last year.  “What happens so often is that person bottles up their emotions until they can’t do that anymore, and that’s what we’re seeing in our agricultural community,” said Tanner, who owns a poultry farm.  Harper’s department has been promoting the hotline and other mental health resources as a way of encouraging farmers to reach out for help.  “By asking for help, you’re better able to take care of yourself, you’re better able to keep your nose to the grind, you’re better able to be self-sustaining and support your family, which in turn takes care of our state and takes care of our economy. It takes care of the rest of us as well,” Harper said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbm93aGFiZXJzaGFtLmNvbS9ydXJhbC1nZW9yZ2lhLXN0aWxsLWRpYWxpbmctOTg4LWF0LWhpZ2hlci1yYXRlcy1hcy1jYWxscy1pbmNyZWFzZS0xMi1vdmVyYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Phoenix"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T13:31:52","After trying to make his girlfriend's death look like a suicide, a Phoenix man was sentenced to prison for her murder on Friday.  Guillermo Diaz Jr., 43, was given a 20-year sentence by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Lisa Ann VandenBerg for his second-degree murder conviction in the death of Corina Leyva, 41. He accepted a guilty plea in March.  In 2021, Diaz shot and killed Leyva in his north Phoenix home after they had an argument, he confessed in court. He placed the gun next to Leyva's hand to make it look like a suicide, but his 7-year-old son saw the incident unfold and told the story that Diaz later admitted to.  Friday's sentencing was filled with testimony of who Leyva was, the domestic violence issues within Diaz and Leyva's relationship, the hardships Leyva's family has gone through after leaving behind six children and Diaz's character.  What happened in 2021?  The following account is based on court documents and testimony.  A little after 4 a.m. on July 3, 2021, Phoenix police were called by Diaz, who reported that Leyva had committed suicide by shooting herself in the head. When police arrived, they found Leyva lying on the floor of Diaz's bedroom with a shot to the head and a gun next to her right hand. They declared her dead.  The initial story Diaz told was this: Leyva, Diaz, and his 7-year-old son were lying in bed. Diaz told police that Leyva suddenly became upset, so she got up and said that she did not want to be there anymore. Diaz had a gun in his dresser drawer — something he was not supposed to have because a prior felony conviction prohibited him from possessing a gun. Diaz told police that Leyva pointed the gun to the back of her head, according to court records.  Diaz said he tried to take the gun from her, but Leyva ended up shooting herself before he could do so.  But that story didn't hold up. Diaz's son said he saw the whole thing and told family members, officers, and first responders that Diaz lied and actually killed Leyva.  In an interview with investigators, Diaz's son described how Diaz grabbed Leyva, hit her, and the son heard a shot. The son said he saw Diaz holding the gun after Leyva fell to the floor.  However, Diaz stuck with his story in his interview with police. He told investigators that he and Leyva had been drinking earlier in the night and began arguing about suspicions of infidelity. The couple continued arguing in Diaz's bedroom when Leyva became upset, got up, and grabbed the gun.  Diaz said he grabbed the gun, struggled, and fell. While he was falling and the gun was in his hand, Diaz said the gun fired a round and hit Leyva in the head. He first said he did not know how the gun ended up next to Leyva's hand, but later admitted to moving it there before police arrived.  Diaz said it was an accident and told police he lied because he was afraid. He was arrested the same day.  Arrest records show that a domestic violence incident had been previously reported between Leyva and Diaz.  A tormented relationship described in court  A total of 22 family and friends filled up the courtroom on Friday — 12 for Leyva and eight for Diaz. Diaz was in an orange jumpsuit and, from behind, looked like his head was tilted slightly downward for most of the hearing.  Leyva's family, specifically her sister, mother, and niece, dug deeper into the domestic violence issues between Leyva and Diaz. Leyva's mom told the court about seeing her daughter's bruises, despite Leyva trying to cover them up with makeup. Leyva's niece testified that the family knew about ""the beatings,"" and that they knew ""everything,"" with one of Leyva's daughters commenting from the gallery, ""Everything!""  Leyva's sister, Betty Leyva, spoke powerfully to the court about Diaz and Leyva's relationship, while occasionally casting glances in Diaz's direction.  ""I would like the court's records to reflect that my ultimate goal and presence here in this courtroom today is justice for my little sister Corina Leyva.""  She said that from the beginning, the family did not have a good feeling about Diaz after Leyva met him in January 2021. He was still living with his mother, had no job, was behind on his house, and made himself the victim for issues he wouldn't take accountability for, according to Betty Leyva.  So, Leyva helped him out. Betty Leyva said her sister helped Diaz out financially and helped him fill out unemployment paperwork and child support responsibilities — all for him to get back on his feet.  That ended up costing Leyva her life, her sister told the court.  ""What he (Diaz) did not expect was that this little act of his would wind up giving my sister Corina the upper hand in this toxic relationship. Now, he owed her money,"" Betty Leyva said.  She added that Diaz's insecurities grew, resulting in domestic violence situations with Leyva. She said Leyva told the family that Diaz once said he was going to kill her if she left him.  Betty Leyva said that Leyva finally broke up with Diaz the night of the incident. But, Diaz wanted to meet up with Leyva and threatened that if they did not meet, he was going to hurt her children, Betty Leyva testified. He accompanied that message with a picture of him outside of her home.  ""So my sister, the protector that she was for her children, agreed to meet him at his mother's house where he then took her life,"" Betty Leyva said.  Leyva's daughter, Maryann Lopez, also spoke. She praised Leyva not only as being a mother, but a sister, aunt, daughter, grandma, and friend. Lopez said Leyva was such a selfless person who would bend over backward for anyone who needed it. Lopez then turned to face Diaz and said, ""Like she did for you.""  Lopez said since her mother's death, she is a co-guardian for her three younger siblings with Betty Leyva.  Three of Diaz's friends made statements. One said he never knew Leyva to do things that were described by Leyva's family. He described Diaz as someone who was always there for him and that they attended the same men's Bible study where the group would try and talk through their problems together.  Another friend was one Diaz knew since childhood. He said he knew Leyva well because they all had dinner together often. He said he would give Diaz and Leyva relationship advice and had once told them that they might not be the best for one another because they were both strong-willed people.  Diaz's mother and sister were in the gallery but did not make a statement.  After the sentencing, Leyva's family gathered together in the hallway. At one point, a group of them hugged Betty Leyva because of her strong statement to the court.  Betty Leyva told The Arizona Republic she wished the state was more assertive with the sentence because of Diaz's past and because of what he did.  Diaz's plea agreement stated that the maximum sentence he could have received was 25 years.  But now, Betty Leyva says the family is just looking forward to moving on and turning the page.  Maryann Lopez said in an interview that it's important to be observant of the people in our lives. Leyva's niece said in her statement that Leyva hid from the family for two days because she was ashamed of her bruises. Lopez wants people to know they should support and love those who are in a tough spot, because it's never known what's happening behind closed doors.  Betty Leyva had a message for young girls, but it can apply to anyone.  ""If any young lady or young girl is in an abusive relationship, the first and immediate thing to do is to get away from it.""  This reporting follows crimes The Republic began to cover in 2021 and is part of our commitment to telling the story from start to finish.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemNlbnRyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGhvZW5peC8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3Bob2VuaXgtbWFuLWdldHMtMjAteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLWZvci0yMDIxLW11cmRlci1vZi1naXJsZnJpZW5kLzcwMjMyMzE1MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Listen to this article Loading audio...  Moscow's bloody tactics see them use soldiers they consider to be dispensable and throwing them into action on the frontlines after giving them amphetamines or other narcotics.  They are usually men conscripted from the occupied eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, chunks of which have been under the control of Russia or Russian proxies for almost a decade.  Wagner mercenaries recruited out of jail and under-trained civilians forced into service in Vladimir Putin's mobilisation also make up these so called ""disposable troops"".  Ukrainian defenders open fire at them, often wiping out entire units, but give away their positions to better-trained Russian forces that can assault them or call in a strike.

"suicide","2022-05-20","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T01:06:22","peterschreiber/Adobestock  CONFERENCE REPORTER  Increasingly, research has found a link between COVID-19 infection and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including psychosis. With that in mind, a poster presented at the 2023 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting examined the differences between new onset psychosis following COVID-19 infection as compared with patients without concurrent infection.1  The study included a systemic review of 57 case reports of new-onset psychosis in patients with COVID-19 infection; a first-episode psychosis study with 462 patients was used as comparison. The investigator also leveraged a study of 104 participants to ascertain effects of age of onset, and 8 unique case reports were examined for potential conclusions. All studies were identified as a result of searches via PubMed, British Journal of Psychiatry, BMJ Case Reports, Journal of the American Medical Association, and Psychiatric Times.  The investigation found symptoms differed between the groups, with paranoia, acute mania, and auditory hallucinations more common among the patients with infection. For those without COVID-19 infection, the symptoms trended differently between early- versus late-onset psychosis. Patients without infection and with early-onset psychosis displayed both positive and negative symptoms and greater levels of cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, less severe negative symptoms and less severe deficits in learning were found among the non-COVID infected individuals who had late-onset psychosis.  Antipsychotics were employed to manage acute symptoms across the patient populations. On the whole, treatment was required in the non-infected participants after stabilization, as symptoms tended to persist. In those with infection, long-term managed was determined based on need.  Importantly, the investigation found that psychosis did not necessarily resolve after recovery from COVID-19. “The psychotic symptoms tend to persist post-COVID–19 infection, highlighting the need for long-term psychiatric follow-up in these patients,” the poster concluded.  The interplay between infectious disease and psychosis is not new, with links found in patients with influenza, H1N1, and other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS.2 Yet, researchers have noted that associations are not causality.3 Nevertheless, this poster further emphasizes the need for vigilance in detecting psychosis in patients with COVID-19 infection as well as continued research in this area.

"suicide","2021-04-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T15:35:02","A handprint stained on the window at the Navajo Nation Detention in Shiprock, Tuesday, April 13, 2021. Sharon Chischilly / NPR  Despite promises of reform by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, inmates at tribal jails overseen by the federal agency continue to die, according to a new report released on Friday.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  At least four inmates died and 46 others attempted suicide from July 2021 through June 2022, according to the report by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. Three of the four deaths were from suicide. The report did not disclose the cause of the other death.  It is the most yearly deaths and attempted suicides recorded by the BJS since 2016. The number of attempted suicides nearly doubled from 2021, according to the study, which also found that more than half of all the inmates who were held in the jails during that same time period were never convicted of a crime.  The 15-page report also found that some of the beleaguered jails continued to wrestle with overcrowding and staff retention. At least six facilities faced chronic overcrowding and the number of correctional officers dropped by nearly 20% between 2019 and 2022 – a loss of 250 employees.  ""It's always saddening to see reports like this one, especially just a year after the Department of Interior promised to work on solving these issues,"" said Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. The committee provides oversight of the BIA, an agency of the Interior Department. ""Tragedies like these certainly warrant more investigation.""  The study, done annually, surveyed all 80 jails in Indian Country. Jail officials, who self-report the information, are not required to participate. Six jails did not, according to BJS.  Reforms were announced back in 2022, following investigation  In February 2022, the BIA announced more than two dozen reforms aimed at ""protecting the rights, dignity and safety of those in custody."" The proposed changes included beefing up staff training, improving recruitment and retention, and doing better ""interagency coordination with federal partners"" to guarantee that inmates are safe and hold correctional officers accountable.  It came on the heels of an investigation by NPR and the Mountain West News Bureau in June 2021 that found a pattern of misconduct, mistreatment and neglect that led to at least 19 in-custody deaths since 2016. Many of the victims had been arrested for minor infractions. BIA officials knew about the problems for years, the investigation found.  The examination by NPR and Mountain West News Bureau also revealed that many of the deaths occurred after correctional officers failed to provide proper and timely medical care, and that poor staff training led to several inmate deaths that could have been prevented. Officials have called the tribal jails program a ""national disgrace.""  Interior Department spokesperson Tyler Cherry acknowledged on Thursday that the BIA's corrections program has been ""under-resourced"" for decades, but said most of the reforms promised in 2022 have been implemented.  When asked, Cherry would not say which specific reforms have been put in place or are still being implemented.  ""The BIA will continue its work to reform the corrections system in Indian Country with available resources,"" he said in a statement.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Cherry pointed out that attrition rates within the BIA's law enforcement and corrections programs have declined by half since May 2022, but did not elaborate.  The agency is also working to boost salaries of BIA law enforcement, including correctional and police officers. A bipartisan bill – the Strengthening Tribal Law Enforcement Act – was introduced in the Senate earlier this year, which would allow the BIA to increase the minimum pay for law enforcement officers. Starting pay for agency cops currently is $46,000; correctional officers start at around $40,000. Cherry said that pay could increase by as much as $30,000.  Members of Congress say the findings are ‘troubling’ and call for accountability  Friday's report comes nearly a month after an Interior Department inspector general investigation found significant health and safety issues at three tribal detention centers in the Southwest. One facility on the San Carlos Reservation in southeastern Arizona had leaky plumbing, broken lights and, most significantly, a broken air conditioning unit in the female detention pod. Temperatures regularly hover above 100 degrees in the summer on the reservation. Staff at another jail told investigators they fear that their building could collapse due to severe structural issues, including falling cinder blocks.  The IG investigation also found that, in some cases, BIA building officials ignored these issues and rated the facility conditions as ""good.""  ""Several of these issues appear to have been exacerbated due to inaction over time and will likely require more funding and effort to repair than if they had been addressed in a timely fashion,"" according to the IG investigation.  Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, described the jail conditions as ""deplorable.""  ""This is not only a funding problem but also an accountability problem; we need to do more to address it,"" he said in a statement to NPR. ""No person should be subjected to these conditions, incarcerated or not.""  Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), called the reports ""deeply troubling.""  ""I'll be working with my colleagues to hold the BIA accountable and find a legislative fix,"" Tester told NPR.  Merkley and Tester successfully spearheaded an effort in December to appropriate $22.6 million to increase funding for the jails program.  During a budget hearing last week, Bryan Newland, the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, told Merkley's subcommittee that his agency is requesting more funding for maintenance and operations at the detention centers.  ""I think it's been well-documented – our jails across the BIA system are in poor condition,"" Newland said. ""We've also come up with an ability to rank them to prioritize which ones should be replaced, but we need the dollars to do that and to make sure the people in our care and custody get the treatment they're entitled to.""  The Bureau of Indian Affairs is asking lawmakers for a $62.1 million increase in funding for its public safety division, which includes jails and staffing  ""There is plenty of blame to go around on how we ended up in this situation, and these problems have been festering for decades,"" Merkley said. ""We must strengthen accountability and invest in staffing and infrastructure. Lives are at stake.""

"suicide","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T17:34:29","MOHAVE COUNTY – In 2020, the suicide rate among veterans living in Arizona was 2.6 times higher than their non-veteran counterparts.  According to preliminary data from Arizona Department of Health Services, 1,593 people in Arizona died by suicide in 2022 – the highest number ever recorded in Arizona’s history. Mohave County's overall suicide rate is the fourth highest in the state.  ""Awareness is the issue,"" said Pat Farrell, Jerry Ambrose Veterans Council president. ""People associated with someone who may be suicidal are reluctant to ask directly, 'Are you thinking of taking your own life?' and that needs to be done.""  It needs to be asked, Farrell says, because it starts the process for veterans to get help.  ""The new 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline), option 1 is for veterans,"" he said. ""It's available 24/7. All the resources available through the hotline are available at no cost.""  Additionally, Farrell said, veterans in crisis can go to any VA or non-VA health care facility for free crisis health care.  ""A veteran in crisis can go right to the emergency room and say 'I feel like committing suicide' and they will not be charged a penny,"" Farrell said.  The VA crisis care benefit went live in January; veterans do not need to be enrolled in the VA system to use the benefit, which includes inpatient or crisis residential care for up to 30 days and outpatient care for up to 90 days.  “Veterans in suicidal crisis can now receive the free, world-class emergency health care they deserve – no matter where they need it, when they need it, or whether they’re enrolled in VA care,” said VA Secretary for Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough at the program's launch. “This expansion of care will save veterans’ lives, and there’s nothing more important than that.”  Over the past year, Veterans Administration announced or continued efforts to end veteran suicide, including establishing 988 (then press 1) as a way for veterans to quickly connect with qualified crisis support.  ""Of all the resources available to veterans, suicide is the most critical issue,"" Farrell said. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. There is help available. I can't implore veterans enough to call the number and ask for help.""  Fifty percent of Mohave County veterans are over the age of 65, he said. That means for those who retired after 20 years in the service, if they went in at the age of 20, they retired at 40 and now have been retired at least 20 years. Financial pressure, loneliness and depression are key factors in suicide.  ""The cost of living in their pensions has not kept up with the cost of living in reality so they're out there with very little money,"" he said. ""Do they buy food this month or do they get their prescriptions or do they pay their electric bill? A lot of them are on the edge. They don't ask for help. They give up and guns are cheap; that takes care of it.""  For individuals and organizations wanting to help reduce veteran suicide, Farrell recommends taking the VA S.A.V.E. training, which teaches how to respond with care and compassion when encountering a veteran in crisis or experiencing suicidal thoughts.  ""The VA is willing to travel out and give this training to anyone who wants it,"" Farrell said. ""When we get our building open sometime in the near future, we're going to have weekly meetings just to talk about this and get the word out.""  Farrell also encourages checking on neighbors.  ""Welfare checks are so important,"" he said. ""Someone can be depressed, laying on a floor and living, but nobody knows they're there. So I would suggest a neighborhood watch club. Knock on doors. Get involved. Talk to people. Pay attention to what's going on around you.  ""There's a lot of great people out there working on this problem. It takes awareness and training, other people in your peer group – that just makes all the difference in the world.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8va2RtaW5lci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9yZXNvdXJjZXMtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXZldGVyYW5zLWNyaXNpcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Caitlyn was autistic and had become fixated on the 'headmistress' detention', which had been given to her after vodka and a tattoo kit were found in her music locker.  The 16-year-old had been so distraught at the prospect of the detention that she ran away from a choral performance at Eton College where she was due to sing shortly before the Easter holidays on Match 21.  Her last diary entry on the night before she died read: 'F*** the school. Running away was the best cry out for help I could give and you responded with we'd normally punish you but we know you're already getting punished. Safeguarding my arse.'  Her funeral is set to take place in Buckinghamshire tomorrow.  Caitlyn Scott-Lee, 16, took her own life in Wycombe Abbey's theatre the night before she was set to sit for a two-hour detention  Caitlyn was autistic and had become fixated on the 'headmistress' detention', which had been given to her after vodka and a tattoo kit was found in her music locker  Caitlyn's father Jonathan told The Times that: 'It never occurred to me that I should have asked whether my daughter would - very literally - leave school alive.  'Over the past week, I have been filled with compassion for the children who are sitting their GCSE and A-level exams. I pray that they will know that they are not defined by mere grades.'  The father told the publication that Caitlyn had made an appointment for herself at a High Wycombe GP for her 'anxiety, depression and having suicidal feelings'.  She attended the appointment on March 30 and was referred to Buckinghamshire's child and adolescent mental health services.  Then, four days later, on April 3, she was deemed 'low risk' following a phone consultation with the mental health nurse. A specialist appointment was made for her for almost two weeks time on May 16.  She killed herself on April 21.  Jonathan Scott-Lee told The Times: 'I want Caitlyn's story to lead to change, so that neurodiverse children get the help needed in schools and medical settings [and] also thrive in society.  'If she had been prioritised appropriately and obtained medical intervention, she might still be with us.'  Caitlyn's father has now started a campaign for all autistic children who disclose suicidal or depressive feelings to be seen by a specialist within 24 hours.  Autistic people are nine times more likely to kill themselves than people who are not autistic, research shows.  Caitlyn's father has now started a campaign for all autistic children who disclose suicidal or depressive feelings to be seen by a specialist within 24 hours  Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, director of Cambridge University's autism research centre, called the 'low risk' assessment and delay in receiving NHS specialist help was 'shocking and wrong'. He has backed a campaign Jonathan's campaign.  'The combination of being autistic and depressed makes that child high risk,' Baron-Cohen told the publication.  'We need a rapid response pathway when an autistic child [reports] suicidal feelings - and everyone involved, including teachers and doctors, should be a part of that rapid response. If you are trying to prevent a death, you can't hang around.'  Baron-Cohen also called on boarding schools - like Wycombe Abbey where Caitlyn attended - to make autistic people their highest priority due to their increased risks.  Caitlyn's father said he now hopes to publish his daughter's diary in the hope it will help others and give an insight into understanding how she was feeling.  The diary was retuned to them by the coroner ahead of an inquest. The family said the diary shows she was struggling with sleep as she appears to have written in it between 3am and 4am.  The family has since been given access to Caitlyn's medical notes. They say it shows she was worried about schoolwork ahead of sitting her GCSEs and detailed that not 'not spoken to the school about her concerns'.  Wycombe Abbey is a £44,000-a-year private school. Established in 1896, the school has around 650 female pupils aged 11 to 18 and each girl has her own 'House Mother', a girl in the year above in the same house who looks after her, especially in her early days at the school.

'We are well aware of the crucial importance of effective pastoral support for the young people in our care and our pupils know that staff are always available to listen to them and support them.'  The school said its pupils all have access to in-house counsellors, a chaplain, an on-site health and wellbeing centre. The school added that it was in close contact with family still and that their continued thoughts are with them at this time.  Likewise, a spokesperson for Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We were saddened to hear of the death of Caitlyn and are in touch with her family, the police, and the coroner to ensure we assist fully with the ongoing investigation.  'While that process is taking place we cannot provide further information, other than to send our deepest condolences to Caitlyn's parents, wider family, friends and all those who loved her.'

"suicide","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""York"", ""York"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T17:20:07","The chief of a northern Manitoba First Nation is sounding the alarm and calling on government to take immediate action to address the remote community's isolation from the larger world, which he says is playing a role in its youth either taking their own lives or attempting to.  Chief Darryl Wastesicoot of York Factory First Nation said recent suicides of two teen girls and attempts by five other community youth are a tragic symptom of the community being cut off because of how remote it is, combined with an overall lack of resources.  York Factory, located about 900 kilometres north of Winnipeg, becomes accessible only by aircraft or ferry after winter ice roads crossing Split Lake are closed.  But Wastesicoot told CBC News on Friday the ferry doesn't start until early June despite the lake having open water weeks earlier. As well, the airline servicing the community, Perimeter Aviation, has capped the number of seats for passengers to and from the community at six.  The seat cap limits the number of people able to get to and from medical appointments in major centres like Winnipeg and Thompson. People get stranded away from their homes as a result, the chief said.  ""We've been trying to call [Perimeter] and we have so many patients that need to get out and back in. And when they do get out, they get stuck and it falls on us to try and get them back,"" said Wastesicoot.  He said he's been unable to speak with anyone at Perimeter to try to find a solution. Charter aircraft are hard to come by, as many of them work only around larger provincial centres, he said.  Runway length too short in summer, airline says  The air carrier told CBC News in an emailed statement that Transport Canada regulations don't allow for a full load of York Landing passengers in the summer months.  That's in part because the community runway is under 3,500 feet, said Carlos Castillo, the carrier's northern division vice-president.  Castillo said ""multiple initiatives"" are underway with government, First Nations leaders and other stakeholders to deal with the issue.  In the interim, Castillo said frequency of flights to York Factory would increase.  ""For example, today we are sending additional aircraft,"" Castillo said Friday.  About 460 members of the roughly 1,600-member band live in the community and overcrowding is another major issue, Wastesicoot said.  ""A lot of the kids are staying in one room [and] especially with teenage girls who need their own space … it's not good for them to be with other kids in the room. So it's those kinds of things that become depressing for them,"" Wastesicoot said.  ""And maybe we don't know all the answers as to how this is happening, but we have a very, very good idea as to why this is happening,"" Wastesicoot said of the youth suicide problem.  The lack of access to the northern community compounds things as crisis workers can't easily get there to help, he said.  State of emergency  A year ago, York Factory declared a state of emergency after the startup of the provincial ferry was delayed due to repair work being done on the boat.  In March, the community was one of 11 Manitoba First Nations that signed a group declaration of emergency prompted by system-wide deficiencies in public safety, health services and infrastructure.  Walter Wastesicoot, Grand Chief of the Keewatin Tribal Council, is pictured speaking at a March 23 press conference. He introduced the idea of the prime minister enacting the Emergencies Act to deal with crises on the 11 First Nations represented by the council. (Stephanie Cram/CBC)  Wastesicoot said the small number of people living in the community means government doesn't see dealing with York Factory's issues as a priority.  CBC News requested comment from both the provincial and federal governments on Friday and did not hear back.  The chief said he traces the community's troubles back to the late 1950s when it was forced to relocate inland from the shore of the coast of Hudson Bay.  ""We have needs,"" he said. ""But those needs are not being addressed because we have a small population.… We want the government to come to our community and really work with us on all our issues.""

On Thursday, Sneha Chaurasia was shot dead outside the dining hall allegedly by Anuj Singh (20) who died by suicide later.  Police said that Anuj had purportedly sent a 23-minute video clip to the university authorities, recorded purportedly before the incident, in which he said he was in a relationship with Sneha but they were no longer together. He said he was “broken inside” and “could not trust anyone”. He also said that he had been “diagnosed with stage three brain cancer” but had not told his parents. He spoke about punishing the woman and sought the forgiveness of both their parents. Singh’s family had said they were unaware of the relationship between the two and that he was physically fit.  The FIR, filed by sub-inspector Manoj Kumar Rai of Dadri police station, names Anuj for illegal possession of a weapon. It states that after police were intimated about the suicide by a security guard at the university, they went inside the room on the third floor of the hostel where they found the man lying on his stomach with a .32 bore pistol under him.  A used bullet along with a cartridge case was also found. The weapon, along with Anuj’s phone and ID card, was collected.

Anil Chaurasia, Sneha’s uncle, said they will file a complaint with police on Tuesday. “We have some rituals on Monday, and we will lodge the complaint after that,” he said.  He added that Sneha last visited their home on Holi and she stayed back at the college during the summer vacation because she was interning at a firm.

This comes as the amendments to three legislation – namely the Penal Code (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2023, Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) (No. 2) 2023 and Mental Health Act 2001 (Act 615) – are set to be passed by the Lower House.  Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Legal and Institutional Reforms) Ramkarpal Singh confirmed that the government will be tabling amendments to several laws including the second reading of the Mental Health Act aimed at decriminalising attempted suicide.  “We hope to table the amendments for a second reading and conclude it at least by Tuesday. It is very important to be able to pass it in the Dewan Rakyat as suicide has become a huge problem,” he told The Star yesterday.  The first reading was conducted in the previous sitting. The three Bills consist of four main policies that include the abolition of Section 309 of the Penal Code rendering suicide a criminal offence, increasing penalties for those who instigate victims to commit suicide, and to separate the categories related to victims by enhancing Sections 305 and 306 of the Penal Code as well as establishing the role of crisis intervention officers.  Under the present law, a person who attempts suicide can face criminal prosecution and a one-year jail term, fine or both upon conviction.  Ramkarpal said it was important to find a holistic approach to the worrying issue.  “If persons are having a problem, they need to be sent to the clinic or hospital so that they can get the necessary medical attention,” he added.  The coming Dewan Rakyat sitting will last until June 15. According to Parliament’s Order Paper published on its website, the Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2023, Fees (Department of Broadcasting Malaysia) (Validation) Bill 2023 and Printing of Quranic Texts (Amendment) Bill 2023 will also be tabled.  Political analyst Dr Sivamurugan Pandian said he hopes the debates during this sitting will be more “civilised” with the new MPs having gained some experience during the previous sittings.  “We are hoping that a more functional Opposition will be observed to ensure they play an effective check and balance role,” he added.  He said he also hopes that the Prime Minister’s Question Time (PMQT) will be utilised by the Opposition to give better input to improve the current system and parliamentary institutions.  The role of Special Select Committees should also be strengthened, he added.  “This could also be the last sitting before the preparation for the six state elections. It will be interesting to see if both the government and the Opposition want to make national issues their agenda such as the cost of living, economy, job opportunities, education, unity, interfaith (matters), foreign workers issues and the sovereignty of the nation,” he said.  Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim of PKR said he expected the sitting to be lively and challenging.  “I also expect the government’s withdrawal of its appeal with respect to the case involving the ‘Allah’ issue (to be raised).  “Due to six state elections being called soon, Perikatan Nasional will capitalise on the issue to discredit the unity government, Pakatan Harapan and mainly Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim,” he added.  PAS’ Pendang MP Datuk Awang Hashim said the Opposition MPs had submitted their questions for ministers to answer.  “We hope to get proper answers from them,” he said.

"suicide","2023-05-20","14:00:00","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T03:36:45","SALT LAKE CITY — A group of more than 50 veterans hiked eight miles through Salt Lake City Saturday afternoon on a mission dedicated to an all-too-common problem.  “We can’t turn a blind eye to it,” said Jarvie Curtis, a Marine Corps veteran and an organizer of the hike. “We just have to recognize it, and we carry those that have passed.”  Curtis said the mission of the Irreverent Warriors Silkies Hike is to eliminate veteran suicide.  “You can see it on any headline and you can read in the newspaper day after day of veterans taking their own lives,” said Curtis. “We've decided not to raise awareness. We're setting out to stop it.”  It’s unfortunately a reality many know all too well.  “Everybody here has experienced some sort of form of suicide, whether it's they know somebody, a family member — it's all impacted us in some way differently than all other veterans, all of us together,” said Irreverent Warriors coordinator and Air Force veteran Michael Bower.  Bower said the tradition is a chance to bring veterans together through humor and camaraderie.  “Maybe some of these veterans will pick up some skills that people have talking to each other and exchange names and really just help be there for each other,” said Bower.  Bower said the hike is a chance for veterans who have the unique experience of serving in the military to connect with one another.  “The one thing that veterans miss the most when they separate from active duty is that family bond, that brotherhood that they have while you're in the field or you're deployed or whatever you're doing,” said Bower, “It's that surrogate family that you kind of latch to.”  Serving in the military is a sacrifice that can be hard to understand for anyone who has not served, which can make it difficult to reintegrate back into society when they return home.  “We are giving them that opportunity to open up to share those hard stories, to share their feelings without feeling like they're being judged, without feeling like they are going to be looked at differently,” said Curtis.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaXJyZXZlcmVudC13YXJyaW9ycy1ob2xkLWhpa2luZy1ldmVudC1pbi1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS10by1lbmQtdmV0ZXJhbi1zdWljaWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The truth, investigators learned, was far more sinister.  Utah Man Killed Wife In Their Backyard Fish Pond And Claimed She Drowned By Accident  On August 15, 1994, neighbors called 911 to report “screaming and howling” at the house next door in Salt Lake City, Utah.  How to Watch Watch Accident, Suicide, or Murder on Oxygen Saturdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.  When first responders arrived, a wildly distraught David Mead said his wife, Pamela, had fallen into their fish pond and drowned. He had dragged her body out of the water.  “The EMT there pronounced her deceased,” Salt Lake City PD Sergeant Mike Roberts told Accident, Suicide or Murder, airing Saturdays at 8/7c on Oxygen.  David was so hysterical he was restrained with handcuffs and put in a patrol car. Meanwhile, investigators processed the scene.  What Happened to Pamela Mead?  Pamela, fully clothed, was lying on her back near the koi pond that was about four feet deep and lined with rocks and bricks.  RELATED: Man Choked His Girlfriend To Death In Scrapyard And Staged The Scene To Look Like She Hanged Herself  “On the back of her head they found that she had a fairly small wound,” said Howard Lemcke, Salt Lake County Deputy DA. “It seemed to be from hitting one of those rocks.”  Neighbors who heard the noise from the Mead residence told investigators that it was pitch dark near the pond. They also said that the Meads appeared to be a happy couple. They had been married about three years and were new homeowners.  Originally from Colorado, Pamela, 29, was a flight attendant who was “very kind, very good-natured,” said her friend Saranya Davis.  Pamela had undergone bunion surgery shortly before died, which made walking difficult. Investigators believed that could have contributed to her fatal trip-and-fall.  An autopsy was performed the next day. The medical examiner observed indicators of drowning as well as the laceration on the back of Pamela’s head. He saw no defensive wounds.  “I ruled the cause of death a drowning and I ruled the manner of death as an accident,” Dr. Todd Grey, former Utah State Chief Medical Examiner, told producers.  But the unusual circumstances of Pamela’s death raised concerns with her family back in Colorado. They shared suspicions about David with Utah detectives. Her family also hired a private investigator, Roger Tinsley, to look into what they considered to be Pamela’s “incomprehensible” death.  Related  Tinsley began by interviewing the Meads’ neighbors. Some believed David’s behavior on the night his wife drowned was “over the top,” as though he was acting. While that raised a red flag, it didn’t prove guilt.  David Mead's Affair, Exposed  Then, on August 18, a woman reached out to police and told them that her friend, Winnetka ""Winnie"" Walls, had been secretly dating David. Winnie agreed to speak with the police.  Walls admitted that “she had been David’s kept woman for some time,” said Lemcki, but she claimed that she didn’t know he was married when their relationship began two years earlier. David timed his liaisons with Walls around Pamela’s work as a stewardess.  Investigators also learned that his aviation maintenance business was in financial trouble. Pamela’s family had secured a loan to bail David’s business out. If he divorced his wife, his relatives could recall the note and he didn’t have the means to repay it, detectives said.  David saw killing Pamela as a solution, Walls said.  Walls told police that David’s plan to murder Pamela involved her having a “nasty fall.” Then he’d collect on a $250,000 life insurance policy he took out a few months before she drowned.  When Walls gave David an ultimatum to leave his wife or lose her, he put his plan in motion, according to detectives.  RELATED: Man With Firearms Training Claimed He Fatally Shot His Wife By Accident While Cleaning Gun  Despite their suspicions about David, investigators didn’t have enough evidence to make an arrest. The fact that Pamela’s death had been ruled an accident was another hurdle.  Grey reviewed the case, and found that the wound on the back of Pamela’s head appeared to have been caused by a blow, not a fall.  He deemed the cause of her death “pending.”  Nine days after Pamela’s death, investigators finally interviewed David. He said he was working on the night of August 15 — and that he had asked Pamela to feed the fish.  David claimed that he returned home that night at 11 p.m. When he couldn’t find Pamela in the house, he went to the backyard, where it was dark because the outside lights weren’t on. He found her in the pond.  He admitted to his affair with Winnie, which he downplayed as “a fling,” according to police. David agreed to take a lie detector test the next day.  Related  In the meantime, detectives dug deeper into the life insurance policy. They learned that David’s brother had asked the company not to discuss the policy with authorities.  Pamela’s family then told police that David had also been involved with a woman named Stormy Simon.  They claimed that Pamela had overheard a phone conversation between David and Stormy. David had allegedly said he didn’t want to divorce Pamela and that “it would just be easier to kill her.”  As a result, Pamela went home to Colorado. But a month later, she returned to Utah to work on her marriage.  RELATED: Was A Campground Dispute Between 2 Deaf Men That Led to Death Self-Defense Or Murder?  More evidence accumulated when detectives learned that the lightbulbs in the outdoor lamps by the pond worked but had been unscrewed.  They also learned that David’s family members had since destroyed the pond. David told Tinsley he had the pond torn down so no one else would get hurt.  At this point the investigation stalled. David passed the polygraph, his work alibi seemed airtight, and Walls recanted about everything she’d told police.  David Mead Is Arrested and Convicted in Pamela Mead's Murder  David Mead, featured in Accident, Suicide, or Murder 417 Photo: Oxygen  Authorities were undaunted. “We just kept working on the case,” said Lemcke.  They caught a break when James Hendrix, David’s cousin, reached out. He told police that David asked him to kill Pamela.  “He gave him parameters,” said Roberts. “It has to be while I’m at work. It has to either look like an accident or a burglary or a robbery. I will give you $30,000 from the $250,000 settlement.”  Hendrix never acted and didn’t take David’s offer seriously. Yet days later Pamela was dead.  Armed with this new information, investigators returned to Grey. He acknowledged that he had made an error and changed the cause of death to homicide, according to “Accident, Suicide or Murder.”  RELATED: L.A. Businessman Claimed Girlfriend Accidentally Drowned — But Evidence Pointed To Murder  Although the D.A. needed more evidence to press criminal charges, Pamela’s family filed a wrong death civil case. The proceedings began in late 1996.  One of David’s coworkers told authorities that he had covered David’s shift the night Pamela died. That destroyed David’s alibi, but the civil case ended in a hung jury.  But the hole in David’s alibi allowed criminal charges to be made on August 15, 1997.  Stormy Simon reached out to the D.A., explaining that she had been afraid to come forward before. She agreed to testify at David’s two-week trial, which began in October 1988.  During it, prosecutors argued that David struck Pamela in the back of the head in their dark backyard and then drowned her in the pond.  David Mead, then 31, was found guilty and sentenced to five years to life. In 2016 his first parole request was denied. According to Accident, Suicide or Murder, his next hearing is in 2037.

"suicide","2012-07-12","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T09:00:00","Before Beyoncé, there was Donna Summer, an innocent church girl who catapulted to fame as music’s bad girl and ""Queen of Disco"" during the hedonistic ‘70s era.  But the pop star struggled behind closed doors — and at one point contemplated taking her own life.  ""In order to understand the greatness and magnitude of her triumphs, you also have to know the lows,"" the late star’s daughter, Brooklyn Sudano, told Fox News Digital. ""You also have to know what we had to work through and overcome in order to get there and why she decided to do certain things.""  Summer passed away in 2012 at age 63 from lung cancer. It was a shock to both fans and many friends as the singer kept her diagnosis a secret, only telling her husband and children. She is now the subject of a new documentary premiering Saturday on HBO and HBO Max titled ""Love to Love You, Donna Summer.""  The film, co-directed by Sudano and Oscar winner Roger Ross Williams, features never-before-seen home videos. It also highlights rare sit-downs with many of those who knew and loved the private icon.  Summer, born LaDonna Adrian Gaines in Boston, was one of seven children who began singing in the church choir. In the ‘60s, she joined the Munich company of the rock musical ""Hair"" and headed to Germany. In 1972, she married Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer, a union that lasted until 1976. Two years before the couple called it quits, Summer released her debut album ""Lady of the Night"" in Europe. But it was 1975 when the track ""Love to Love You Baby"" skyrocketed her to fame. She kept her ex-husband's name, slightly changing it her way.  ROY ROGERS' 'WEIRD' HOLLYWOOD MAKEOVER LEFT WESTERN FANS STUNNED, GRANDDAUGHTER SAYS  Summer recorded the breathy, lovemaking anthem while lying on her back on the studio floor with the lights out, The New York Times reported. According to the outlet, she imagined Marilyn Monroe cooing the lyrics. The 17-minute single contained more than 20 simulated orgasms. She soon released two albums, ""A Love Trilogy"" and ""Four Seasons of Love."" With songs like ""I Feel Love,"" ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls,"" Summer was promoted as a sex goddess.  ""I think in order to portray something like that and own it in the way that she did, it has to be a part of you,"" Sudano explained. ""So I don’t think that part of it was fake. It was just one part of her, one facet of her ability and charm. I think the struggle was that she was then put in a box as a performer… I don’t think she realized how big [things would get], but she understood that there was a door there.""  As Summer’s highly erotic tune was played in nightclubs, she often thought of her religious upbringing. According to reports, her father once smacked her for wearing red nail polish because ""that’s what whores wore.""  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  In the film, Summer is heard saying, ""You’re looking at me, but what you see is not what I am. How many roles do I have to play in my own life?""  Privately, Summer was carrying with her the pain of having been sexually abused by her pastor as a child. As her fame grew, so did her depression. In 1976, Summer nearly jumped out of a window of her New York hotel room. Her foot became entangled with a window curtain. As she approached the ledge, a maid walked in.  ""Another 10 seconds, and I would have been gone,"" Summer later admitted. ""I felt God could never forgive me because I had failed him. I was decadent, I was stupid, I was a fool. I just decided that my life had no meaning.""  Sudano said it was important to address her mother’s trauma in the film in the hope it will encourage others struggling to speak out.  ""It was multiple years with the pastor,"" she said. ""This was stuff I had heard about as I got older about my mother. As we said in the film, there were a lot of secrets. There were a lot of things we didn’t talk about. But you’re dealing with the trauma, whether you know what the trauma is or not. And so, it was really important to flesh that out, for the audience to understand what she was carrying and had to overcome… I thought it was very important to tackle those things and show our family working through some of those things… If we can talk about it, maybe that will permit somebody else to talk about it as well.""  ANN-MARGRET DESCRIBES HER ELVIS PRESLEY CONNECTION, REMEMBERS NIBBLING ON PAT BOONE'S SHOULDER  ""The experience has been very healing for us,"" Sudano continued. ""It’s important to talk about these difficult things, things that may not be so easy to face. You’re never going to heal if it’s kept quiet or swept under the rug. Hopefully, this film will inspire other families to have those kinds of discussions.""  Summer also endured an abusive relationship with artist Peter Mühldorfer, which is explored in the film. One beating resulted in Summer being left unconscious with a black eye and broken ribs.  Sudano and Williams tracked down Mühldorfer, who spoke out in the film.  ""I hit her, and I never could forgive myself,"" he is heard saying.  ‘50S STAR TERRY MOORE RECALLS ‘CRUEL’ EX HOWARD HUGHES: ‘HE DID SO MANY THINGS THAT HURT ME’  Williams told Fox News Digital that he was shocked Mühldorfer was willing to participate in the documentary.  ""I was really surprised,"" said Williams. ""It took a while to get him to agree to do the interview, and it took a while to find him. But I think he really wanted to get this off his chest. And I think Brooklyn gave him the permission to do that because she’s Donna’s daughter. And it was a pretty amazing interview. It was pretty revealing. I’m sure it was quite emotional for Brooklyn. Even for me.""  ""I had spoken to my aunts and I knew that my mother had forgiven him,"" Sudano chimed. ""So there was a certain permission that I felt in talking to him and having that part of this story in a real way. My mother… was somebody of great forgiveness. Even when people didn’t deserve it, she was very generous in spirit. And I think that through forgiveness, there’s healing. And through some of these hard conversations, there’s healing.""  When the decadent ‘80s era rolled in, Summer focused on family. She married Bruce Sudano in 1980 and welcomed two daughters. She was already a mom to one daughter from her previous marriage. Summer also became a born-again Christian.  Despite her ongoing popularity, Summer became the subject of scandal when she was quoted as describing AIDS as punishment for homosexuality. Many of her LGBTQ+ followers boycotted her music as Summer repeatedly, and at times tearfully, denied making the statement. She later reconciled with gay organizations, The New York Times reported.  ""The gay comments were a misconception,"" said Williams. ""Donna had a lot of gay friends. I remember interviewing one of her close friends whom she knew from back from her days on ‘Hair.’ I remember him saying that she had gone through her religious reawakening, but she also took him out to gay bars… Donna loved everyone... I think people see this glamazon, but… she’s not at all what you think.""  '50S STAR ANGIE DICKINSON ON FRANK SINATRA AND WHY SHE NEVER MARRIED 'LOVE OF MY LIFE'  Over the subsequent years, Summer continued to record and perform. She and her family moved to Nashville and also kept a home in Florida.  ""We had a really normal, but abnormal childhood,"" Sudano chuckled. ""We would go on set, and then we would go to Sophia Loren’s house for dinner. It was definitely not normal, but our experience was also very grounded… Whenever we would go out, people would come up to her and thank her for her music or share stories of their lives with her.""  Summer’s last dance, as it were, was 2010’s ""To Paris with Love,"" her final single.  ""I was a huge Donna Summer fan, [but] I only knew her as the 'Queen of Disco,'"" said Williams. ""What surprised me the most was that she was so much more than that… She was this complex artist and disco put her in a bit of a box. She continuously broke out of that box. She doesn’t necessarily get the credit that she deserves. It was like discovering a whole new artist that I thought I knew.""

"suicide","2023-03-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T21:45:00","By LOLITA C. BALDOR (Associated Press)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A Navy investigation prompted by a spate of suicides is recommending widespread improvements in housing, food, parking and internet for sailors as well as changes to mental health and other personnel programs. The much-anticipated report lays out a sweeping condemnation of living and working conditions at naval shipyards that had languished for years but were brought to light by the deaths.  “We let our people down.” Navy leaders said in response to the findings.  The inquiry concluded that several suicides at the Newport News shipyard in Virginia last year were not connected or caused by any one issue. But the deaths underscored pervasive problems and poor living conditions, particularly among young enlisted sailors doing long-term ship maintenance at that base and others around the United States.  “The focus on the maintenance mission has degraded our ability to take care of our most junior and at-risk sailors,” said the investigating officer, Rear Adm. Bradley Dunham, in his findings released Thursday. “This was not one seminal event, decision or individual’s action, this was a series of actions and decisions shared by many that resulted in the wholly unnecessary conditions and challenges our sailors face.”  Navy leaders said they have taken a number of steps already to improve conditions at Newport News. Additional planned changes are broader and call for similar moves at other shipyards where the same problems exist. Recommended increases in sailor pay, housing benefits, food, health care, job choices and counseling would affect service members across the board.  In a memo accompanying the report, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Adm. Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, concluded that “collectively, Navy senior leadership, officer and civilian, let our standards slip — and in doing so we let our people down.” They blamed it on “organizational drift” and a slow erosion of conditions over time that became unacceptable.  ___  EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. This is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a trained listener, call 988. Service members and veterans can call 988 and then press “1”. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org  ___  The investigation began last year after seven service members assigned to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington died over a 12-month period ending April 2022, including three in one week. The carrier was docked for overhaul at Newport News shipyard.  Of the seven deaths, three were health-related or accidental, but four were suicides, including the three during the week of April 9-15. A Navy investigation released last December found that the suicides were not connected, but that poor quality of life onboard the ship was a “contributing factor” in one of the deaths.  As that investigation was going on, four more sailors died by suicide between last Oct. 30 and Nov. 26 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center in Norfolk, Virginia, setting off a second examination. All four sailors had been assigned to limited duty jobs there due to injuries, health or other issues. A review concluded that those deaths were unconnected, but cited factors such as family, finance and career issues, alcohol use and access to personally owned firearms.  That review recommended improvements to the system that puts sailors into limited duty slots when they are unable to perform their regular jobs due to issues ranging from injuries and pregnancy to mental heath and other problems. It also called for expanded mental health care and increased staffing, which are similar quality of work and life concerns reflected in the shipyard report. In their memo, Del Toro and Gilday outlined needed changes in limited duty assignments as part of the broader effort to improve sailors’ quality of service.  “Every sailor unable to perform normally assigned duties deserves full, direct support,” said Del Toro and Gilday, adding that sailors must be assigned “in the right numbers, to the right commands, with access to the right resources.”  They acknowledged that the shipyard and personnel problems “will not be corrected with the stroke of a pen,” but will require a long-term effort with more money, resources and policy changes.  Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of the Navy’s Fleet Forces Command, said improvements to housing, parking and other services at Newport News have been made, and mental health facilities have been set up away from the ship, where crew are more likely to seek help. He said Navy leaders will be seeking more money from Congress; they had no specific totals or timelines for the changes.  “We’re going to have to do what’s right, whatever the costs,” Master Chief Petty Officer James Honea added in a call with reporters Thursday.  The Navy said it has requested $258 million in the 2024 budget for housing, parking garages and recreation facilities. Other changes, including pay and additional personnel for counseling and health care, could take years to get congressional approval and funding.  The shipyard report dug deeply into sailors’ work and living conditions when they are assigned to a ship that is undergoing major overhaul or maintenance in a Navy shipyard. The George Washington, for example, was brought to Newport News for a four-year overhaul that includes refueling the nuclear reactors and other intensive repair work.  In one case, a young sailor who later died by suicide had been sleeping in his car due to noise on the ship. The investigation noted that he was counseled on the matter, but there was no evidence of any follow-through by leadership. In other cases, sailors complained that lack of nearby parking and the difficult commute were adding hours to their days. Depending on the location, sailors could face a three-hour commute from the time they left home, drove to the parking lot, took the shuttle bus and then walked the final stretch to the ship.  Since 2021, there have been five suicides among George Washington crew members. One death earlier this year is under investigation. Across the Navy, there were 70 suicides last year, compared with 59 in 2021. There have been 25 this year, as of April 30.  One key change, Caudle said, will ensure that young sailors do not spend the bulk of their first enlistment term on a ship docked for maintenance.  “We definitely want a sailor who joined the Navy to go to sea, to get that opportunity to see the ocean, get into a port call, experience why that person joined, and not spend that entire tour in a maintenance facility where the ship’s being repaired,” Caudle said.  Del Toro and Gilday said shipyard assignments are essential but should not consume a young sailor’s early years. They endorsed recommendations allowing sailors to seek other jobs after one year, and limiting shipyard duty to two years.  Asked if anyone was disciplined as a result of the problems, Caudle said no one person was liable. Instead, Navy leadership was accountable and must ensure no other ships endure the problems the George Washington had.  Honea, the Navy’s most senior enlisted member, said leaders must be empowered to make changes. “I can’t write good enough policy to replace bad leadership,” he said. “But I can place good leadership that will overcome bad policy every single day.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJhbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvbmF2eS1wcm9iZS1wcm9tcHRlZC1ieS1zdWljaWRlcy1jb25kZW1ucy1jb25kaXRpb25zLWF0LXNoaXB5YXJkLXdlLWxldC1vdXItcGVvcGxlLWRvd24tMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

THE reality of children voicing their fears about being raped is alarming enough but, according to youth advocates, to have said children say unflinchingly that they would commit suicide if they fall victim is another dimension of dread.  Children's Advocate Diahann Gordon Harrison said it is ""very sobering"" to hear but noted that it exposes, in very real terms, just how much of a violation rape is.  ""It violates the victim's body and also affects them emotionally and psychologically. These children clearly understand that and don't want to live through the pain of such an ordeal,"" she told the Jamaica Observer.  Nonetheless, Gordon Harrison said it is troubling that children see committing suicide as a viable option.  ""This is not a good indication and calls for continued engagement with these youngsters and their peers. It's a part of the mental health conversations that need to be had as a matter of urgency so that these and other children can get the support that is clearly needed,"" she said.  A group of 11 teenagers in Arnett Gardens, when asked to say how they feel about children being raped, said they would rather commit suicide than live with the trauma of such an experience.  The children, aged 12 to 18, participated in a Jamaica Observer/Rise Life Management session conducted in partnership with the Trench Town Development Committee, in a section of the community called Mexico, on Thursday, May 11.  Kayla Wright, youth advocate and policy assistant at the Jamaica Youth Advocacy Network (JYAN), told the Sunday Observer that while all agree that children are to be protected from neglect, abuse, harm and threats to harm — including that of sexual abuse, assaults and threats of sexual abuse — it is equally ""alarming and heartbreaking"" that children as young as 11 years old have significant fears of rape and are minded to end their lives if they ever fall victim to the heinous act.  ""The unfortunate reality is that incidents of rape and assault are very common, and it is understandable why children would be fearful of something like that happening to them when they see it happening to their peers and other women in their communities and across the island, such as when reported in the news,"" she said.  ""It is a blatant failure of our duties under the Child Care and Protection Act that our children are not only being exposed to risks of sexual abuse, but that they live in constant fear of being victims. A paramount objective of the Act is to promote the best interests, safety and well-being of children. In light of the ever present threat of sexual assault and abuse of our children there needs to be sufficient resources and preventative measures in place to ensure that this objective, specifically, is being met,"" Wright added.  Wright said such resources and preventative measures may take various forms, which aim to ensure that children are able to readily access mental and physical care in the event that they are sexually abused or witness sexual abuse.  ""As such, emphasis must be placed on the need for psychosocial care to our children, especially given the sentiments expressed by the group of 11-year-olds.  ""These resources and measures may look like implementing functional helplines — specifically for children and adolescents — which are manned by experts who can navigate these issues at an age-appropriate level and support parents and guardians in getting additional help for their children; upskilling of guidance counsellors to properly identify issues associated with sexual abuse and to offer support to children in navigating the feelings associated with these acts; and ensuring that professional psychosocial care is available to all affected children and their support systems — at little to no cost,"" Wright said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGFybWluZy1hZG1pc3Npb24tb2Ytc3VpY2lkYWwtdGhvdWdodHMtYW1vbmctY2hpbGRyZW4v0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFtYWljYW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FsYXJtaW5nLWFkbWlzc2lvbi1vZi1zdWljaWRhbC10aG91Z2h0cy1hbW9uZy1jaGlsZHJlbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-03-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T20:45:00","The government of pillage is pushing on with its sell-off of the state. The coalition of the ultra-nationalists and the Haredim forgoes requiring ultra-Orthodox schools to teach core subjects and at the same time advances what Bezalel Smotrich calls “core missions.”  Smotrich, who is the finance minister and a minister in the Defense Ministry, ordered all relevant government ministries to prepare for the absorption of an additional half- million settlers in the West Bank within two years. He calls this bizarre plan, which will eliminate any possibility of territorial compromise and peace with the Palestinians, once and for all, and bring the wrath of the international community upon Israel, a core mission of the government.  Doubling the number of settlers, as Smotrich proposes to do, requires infrastructure work. He ordered the improvement of infrastructure for all types of Jewish settlements in the territories, large and small, those the State of Israel – and only the State of Israel – considers legal as well as illegal outposts. This includes the areas of public transportation, education, employment – everything that is needed.  In any case the government plans to legalize the illegal outposts in the months to come.  Jurists say efforts to implement the plan will face immediate challenges in the High Court of Justice, which is unlikely to approve it in its current form. But who knows whether the court will survive until then in its current form. The judicial coup has not yet been shelved.  And who will pay for all this plenty?  The estimated cost of the plan runs into the billions. The draft budget for 2023 and 2024, the time frame proposed by Smotrich for his program, does contain funding for construction and for new infrastructure in settlements, but in a much smaller scope than what is needed to handle the population increase that he envisions. Money isn’t a problem, Smotrich said, promising to come up with funding sources. From where, exactly? Perhaps he’s counting on the help of God.  And who will provide the security for the hundreds of thousands of new settlers?  The defense establishment has not received enough information to draw up an opinion on it. When they do so, they are expected to object to much of it, particularly those parts involving unauthorized settlements in locations with a high potential for friction with Palestinians. But what do such trifles have to do with Smotrich’s messianic project? The military and Israelis living inside the Green Line who just want a normal life are all Messiah’s donkeys.

In a video, which went viral a couple of days ago, the man — who had been recently deported from Mexico — was seen apologising to his two sons, who are living in the US with their mother, and saying that he was going to commit suicide.  The police identified the man as one Balwinder Singh of Sarain Jattan village in Kapurthala’s Sultanpur Lodhi sub-division. The said that he had killed his mother-in-law last week (on Thursday) in PUDA colony where she was staying alone. She was a widow and her son and daughter were living in the US.  As per the police, late on Friday night, Balwinder was found in an unconscious state near Mithra village by some passers by. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.  DSP of Sultanpur Lodhi sub division, Babandeep Singh, on Saturday confirmed that Balwinder had died by suicide, adding that the body has been kept in the mortuary of Kapurthala Civil Hospital for postmortem.  The wife of the deceased, Rajwinder Kaur, who lives in the US, told the media that Balwinder had been lying. She claimed that Balwinder would call him almost daily and ask him to arrange for him to get to the US as soon as possible.  “I had told him to wait for some time as I was trying to arrange work permits for him here. I never ignored him, as he claimed. Instead it was my mother who used to give him money for his day-to-day survival,” she said.

""Every night when I see a shining star I say, 'I love you, Nathan,'"" Ybarra-Bryan said. ""With that, it fills my heart, I'm happy, knowing that he is the brightest star.""  Resources for those who suffer in silence  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that 45% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth considered suicide, compared to 15% of heterosexual teens.  But there are resources to prevent another death and for this community of the population to continue suffering in silence.  ""We can help anyone who is having a crisis, suicidal thoughts, or simply looking for help for anyone else,"" said Karla Centeno, the bilingual coordinator for the 988 Crisis Line.  The 988 Line has been around for many years but recently changed to that number to be easier to remember.  ""We want the person to open up, tell us what is happening at the moment,"" Centeno said.  Many of the calls come from LGBTQ youth  ""Some of the reasons LGBTG youth are calling out is depression, isolation, peer problems at school,"" said Franklin Romero, of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.  Bullying at school and in social networks further affects LGBTQ youth who already have risk factors.  ""But just being LGBTQ isn't what puts you at risk, it's the environment, your family, school, peers, the community where you live,"" Romero said.  The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has hired specialized counselors for the past two years.  ""At any time, 24 hours a day, any child in our community can call and speak directly with a person who has the training to speak with them and then refer the student to another professional,"" said Alberto Carvalho, LAUSD superintendent. ""LGBTQ kids are under pressures that other kids don't understand and don't get past.""  Reducing the risk of suicide  Specialists highlight the importance of eliminating myths around this problem.  ""Many times we think that if we talk about suicide, the thoughts increase,” Centeno said . ""It's the other way around, if the person tells us about what's going on, we can reduce the risk, and that's our goal.""  Regardless of the numbers, just one death by suicide is already a great loss that could have been avoided.

"suicide","2023-05-05","10:00:00","{""LakeBenton"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T14:04:36","GIOVANNA DELL'ORTO  Associated Press  LAKE BENTON, Minn. (AP) — With traces of winter’s unusually heavy snow still lingering but a warm sun finally shining, farmers were out dawn to dusk in early May on their tractors, planting corn and soybeans across southwestern Minnesota fields many have owned for generations.  The threat of losing these beloved family farms has become a constant worry, affecting many farmers’ mental health and raising concerns of another uptick in suicides like during the 1980s farm crisis. Much of the stress stems from being dependent on factors largely outside their control – from the increasingly unpredictable weather to growing costs of equipment to global market swings that can wipe out profits.  More:Sturgis residents get first look at Sturgis Adventure Park designs  “You’d be surprised how many people are suffering with depression. Farmers have been a group of people who keep problems to themselves, proud and private,” said Bob Worth, a third-generation crop farmer who with his son works 2,100 acres of rich, black soil near the hamlet of Lake Benton.  “The more you talk about this, the more you realize it can be fixed,” added Worth, who credits his wife with saving his life in the 1980s when he got so depressed that he wouldn’t budge from bed even for the harvest. At least three neighbors and fellow farmers killed themselves, Worth said.  Increasingly aware of agricultural workers’ struggles with mental health, states such as Minnesota and South Dakota, a few miles west of Worth’s farm, are offering suicide prevention training to clergy – who are a crucial, trusted presence in rural America.  In Pipestone, the bigger town down the dirt road from Worth’s farm – with 4,200 residents and a dozen churches – pastors from three Lutheran parishes are taking the four-week suicide prevention program for clergy that Minnesota’s departments of agriculture and health launched this spring.  “I want to learn to help. This could be anybody,” said the Rev. Robert Moeller, recalling his first realization of the scourge of suicide among farmers, when a customer in the feed business he worked at before being ordained killed himself.  Moeller plans to introduce suicide prevention in his 5th through 8th grade catechism class at Our Saviour’s Lutheran Church, and is eager to learn about supporting surviving family members and those who attempted suicide without the stigma and shame often attached to it.  ___  EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. The national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.  ___  While rising levels of stress and anxiety are affecting Americans from students to service members, the dynamics are different in the farmland – and so is the strength of the clergy’s role in rural communities, where churches are essential social gathering points.  “Every farm family I know has a relationship with a house of worship,” said Meg Moynihan, a dairy farmer in southern Minnesota who’s been developing the clergy-focused training programs as a senior advisor to the state's agriculture department. “There’s a huge sense of pride.""  More:From secrets of songwriting to how to land a gig, Levitt at the Falls starts music workshop series  The evident satisfaction that farmers take in growing crops and raising livestock to feed the country – and beyond, as corn for example is also often sold to China – makes the fear of being unable to keep going a key factor in mental health distress.  “It’s not losing a job or a place. There’s a sense of threat to one’s identity and generational legacy across time,” said Sean Brotherson, professor and extension family science specialist at North Dakota State University. “People treat the farm as a member of the family – and the longest-living member of the family.”  The question, he said, becomes who is going to be the one to decide it's time to let the farm go.  With financing tapped out and feeling they might not be able to pay off more equity in their middle age, Keith and Theresia Gillie started talking about finding jobs away from his homestead in northwestern Minnesota.  “I never realized that in the midst of us quitting farming, that was his identity,” said Gillie, who found her husband of more than 30 years dead on a gravel road. Six years later, she’s still farming wheat, soybean and sunflowers with two neighbors’ help, and has spoken out about Keith’s suicide to get more farmers to open up about their struggles.  Male agricultural workers’ suicide rates are more than two times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are several issues that play a role, including increased isolation and exacerbated family tensions during the pandemic, the difficulty in rural communities to find in-person mental health counseling or to access broadband for tele-health, as well as the disruptions brought by climate change-driven unpredictable weather patterns, inflation and international trade disputes.  As the average age for farmers inches toward 60, the pressure of passing on a life-defining legacy to new generations is a growing problem, said Monica McConkey, a rural mental health specialist contracted by Minnesota’s agriculture department to provide counseling at no cost.  Driving his tractor and planter, some $750,000 in machinery, Todd Sanderson reflected on how farming has changed in the 42 seasons he’s been planting corn outside Flandreau, South Dakota. An eye to the sky is still foremost – Sanderson decided to get the seeds in the ground the first week of May even though frost still covered the tractor’s windshield in the morning, because later planting means meager yields.  The physical demands have diminished, with technology in his tractor resembling a cockpit more than an agrarian tool, but the uncertainty of making enough to keep the land only grows as the capital investments rise. Sanderson, 61, hopes a nephew will take over from him eventually.  “That’s what’s keeping me up at night, the transition,” he said. “We out here in ag are pretty solitary. If your mind is going in the wrong direction, it’s pretty easy to end up in a bad place. The more I get stressed, the more I get quiet.”  Breaking farmers out of that proud reserve is a big challenge, even for clergy, said the Rev. Alan Blankenfeld. He is the rural ministry liaison for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's South Dakota synod and Sanderson’s former pastor in Flandreau, where they started a suicide prevention program that includes Spanish information, since many dairy workers there are immigrants.  “As a pastor, you don’t always have to have something profound to say. It’s just, show up,” said Blankenfeld, who likes to visit farmers and ranchers so they don’t have to come to a church, where their parked vehicle might be recognized by everyone in town and start a rumor mill. “They’ll share on their terms. Our place is not counseling, but we can walk with them.”  More:She'd be 14: Authorities release new age-progressed images of Serenity Dennard  Back across the state line in Pipestone, the Rev. Ann Zastrow of First Lutheran Church, who’s taking the Minnesota online prevention course, hopes to build up her confidence to remind those struggling with mental health that “God is still in the picture.”  In many farm families, faith and struggle have long coexisted. First Lutheran’s council president, a retired hog farmer who now raises lambs from 500 ewes outside town, said he still remembers when his mother asked him to take guns out of the house because she was worried about his father.  “Stress and depression and suicide in a farmer is part of it. You just hope that it isn't your part,” Craig Thies said as newborn lambs tottered around him. “I remember the look on (my father’s) face when they sold his cows. Realistically, they’re like your children. But somebody is eating tonight because of you.”  Seeing themselves as part of a crucial creation plan cements farmers’ faith and involvement in church activities, which have historically forged bonds in otherwise isolated homesteads.  That in turn makes the clergy potential lifesavers when given the right tools to help with compassion and without the moral judgment that many still fear about suicide.  “One place we struggle within the church is if we treat suicide as shameful, then they won’t share they’re not okay,” said the Rev. Kelly Ahola, a Lutheran pastor in the Red River Valley, where springtime flooding can wreak havoc on farmland in Minnesota and North Dakota. “We need to say the words. We need to learn to ask, are you thinking of suicide? We need to train the congregation too to know when and how to intervene.”  More:Rounds makes third attempt at congressional charter for Native American veterans  How to tackle suicide from the pulpit and how to approach it theologically when many consider it a sin was one of the first questions raised in the four-week training course that Minnesota is running. Most of the 80 clergy from across the state who enrolled in it had encountered suicides in their ministry.  For one of them, the Rev. Jillene Gallatin, the call to prevention is excruciatingly personal. It was her pastor who drove her to the hospital when, at 15, she tried to kill herself a year after her mother took her own life. And it was in her church that she met comfort instead of the deafening silence and averted eyes elsewhere in her community.  “People need to tell their stories and struggles that are not so visible. That’s a gift we can bring as church, being a safe spot,” Gallatin said in the sanctuary of Grace Lutheran Church in Waseca, about an hour south of Minneapolis.  Later that spring day, she visited the dairy farm of a church member. Two brothers, along with their wives, children, and father, run the farm that their German immigrant ancestors founded in the 1870s.  There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when the relatives discussed the option of stopping the milking operation, Jason Eldeen recalled.  But they persevered, which makes them among the 1.3% of U.S. workers with direct on-farm employment, according to a podcast he likes to listen to when out in the fields – and to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2023 data.  “How lucky we are that we get to farm,” he said, as some of the cows reached out to lick his and Gallatin’s hands in the spring sunshine.  —-  Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

We need to ask at every visit, every person.”  Grumet says when interventions are used properly, hospitals can reduce suicide rates of people in their care by up to 75%.

"suicide","2017-12-19","Not Discerned","{""Urumqi"", ""Xinjiang"", ""China""}","2023-05-20T16:39:57","Meryem Ismayil was distraught over father’s detention and mother’s interrogation by police.  A view of Xinjiang University in Urumqi, capital of northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in an undated photo.  Meryem Ismayil was a law student at Xinjiang University when she took her life five years ago.  The 22-year-old Uyghur from Aqerik village in Xinjiang’s Shayar County was distraught over the detention of her father, a Chinese Communist party cadre and member of the village’s People’s Congress.  Chinese authorities sentenced to nine years behind bars in 2017 for “threatening national security.”  Meryem and her father, Ismayil Mijit, are among the hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs listed in police records that are part of a larger cache of documents and records known as the Xinjiang Police Files.  The files, published in May 2022, were obtained by a third party from confidential internal police networks. They provide inside information on Beijing’s internment of up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in northwestern China’s Xinjiang region.  Meryem Ismayil, who began her law studies in 2013, hung herself in her student dormitory at the university in Urumqi on Dec. 19, 2017.  The police files indicate that her father’s arrest earlier that year and continuous police interrogation of her distressed mother, a retired village secretary, were the factors that caused her to commit suicide. The files also say that her father died in prison.  In 2017, Chinese authorities intensified their crackdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim Turkic minorities in Xinjiang and began detaining them in prisons or “re-education camps.”  While they targeted Uyghur intellectuals, prominent business people and Muslim clerics in a wider effort to erase Uyghur culture, they also arrested ordinary people for alleged illegal religious activities and other infractions deemed contrary to national security and regional stability.  According to the file, two police officers, Wang Wei and Ömerjan Mamut from Xinjiang University, recorded information about Meryem and forwarded it to relevant authorities.  Fresh information  A Radio Free Asia inquiry into the deaths of Meryem and her father yielded fresh information about the tragedy.  A Xinjiang University police officer confirmed that Meryem died five years ago, but that the incident was a sensitive case that he could not discuss. Another police officer said it wasn’t possible to provide a comprehensive account of Meryem and her family in a short time.  RFA also contacted police officer Ömerjan Mamut who had been assigned to monitor the vicinity of Meryem’s dormitory. He had reported that apart from her death, police did not observe any abnormal situations at Xinjiang University during that time.  But Mamut declined to answer RFA’s questions and noted a specific directive prohibiting the disclosure of such information.  “I can’t discuss it,” he said. “We are prohibited from talking about it on the phone if anyone calls to ask about it.  Another police officer contacted by RFA who wanted to remain anonymous because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media, said Meryem had used her father’s mobile phone during the vacation and watched what was deemed “illegal information” on the device.  As a result, authorities interrogated her father, who took responsibility for the incident to protect his daughter, the officer said.  Consequently, authorities charged him with “threatening national security” and sentenced him to nine years in prison, he said.  A police officer from the Gulbagh township police station in Shayar county said Meryem’s father died in prison in June 2022. He had been arrested for “watching illegal content,” the policeman said.  “He passed away in prison due to an illness,” he added, saying that the body was turned over to the family.  The police officer said he was responsible for overseeing five critical individuals, including Meryem’s mother, and could summon them at any time to come to his office. He also monitored the comings and goings of people close to them.  “We’d pay attention to their conversations with others and their daily activities,” he said. “They needed to get a pass from the office if they wanted to leave the village.”  Translated by RFA Uyghur.

""Sean always wanted to help others,"" she said. ""I want this to be something where another family doesn't have to go through what I went through.""On Saturday, Cloutier hosted her second-annual 22 No More event. The name notes the average number of veterans who die by suicide in the United States every day. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, suicide rates among U.S. veterans are significantly higher than that of the general population. In 2020, there were 6,146 veteran suicide deaths, according to the VA. Sen. Maggie Hassan, who attended the event on Saturday, noted that suicide among military members was an ongoing crisis. ""Those who serve are injured and affected in a number of ways, and like all of us, they need the support and health care necessary to get better,"" Hassan said. Hassan pointed to some recent progress in addressing mental health issues and suicide, including the new 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which offers a prompt specifically for military members and veterans. The crisis line is available at all times for those experiencing a mental health crisis. Cloutier was presented with an Honor and Remember flag dedicated to her son's life and service at Saturday's event.

"suicide","2021-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:00:00","On May 12, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) released the Suicide Demographics and Trends 2021 Report indicating that after a two-year decline, the number of Ohio suicide deaths increased. Deaths increased in 2021 by 8% over the previous year to a total of 1,766 deaths. However, the number of deaths remained below the 10-year high of 1,836 deaths in 2018.  The data means that five Ohioans die by suicide every day, and one youth dies every 34 hours.  “Suicide is a human tragedy, and any increase is of course deeply concerning,” said ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff, MD, MBA. “This puts more emphasis on the importance of Governor (Mike) DeWine’s efforts to prioritize the expansion of Ohio’s mental health services. All of us, though, need to pay attention and recognize when someone is struggling and know where they can turn to for help.”  Other key findings of the 2021 report include:  • In 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans 10-34 years of age and the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio, overall.  • From 2020 to 2021, white non-Hispanic males and females had the largest increase in the rate of suicide at 7%.  • In 2021, adults 25-44 years of age had the highest rate of suicide, which increased by 13% from 2020, compared with 5% increases among other reported age groups.  • Among males in 2021, those 75 years and older had the highest rate of suicide.  • Among females in 2021, those 45-54 years old had the highest number and rate of suicide.  In 2020, RecoveryOhio — the governor’s initiative to coordinate mental health and substance abuse programs — and the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) partnered with the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation to create the Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio, a blueprint to mobilize and align efforts to prevent suicide.  Since then, state officials have taken aggressive action to address mental illness and to reduce suicide deaths.  Key strategies underway  • Helping Ohioans recognize the warning signs and risk factors of suicide and respond appropriately. This is being accomplished through awareness campaigns such as Be Present Ohio and Life is Better with You Here; continued support for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for first responders; Mental Health First Aid Training (more than 95,000 Ohioans now trained); and Question. Persuade. Refer (QPR) suicide prevention trainings.  • Launching the new 3-digit 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Since July, Ohio’s 988 call centers have responded to more than 10,000 call/chats/texts a month from citizens in all 88 counties. This number is expected to grow as it becomes more widely known and used. Governor DeWine’s budget proposal for SFY 2024-25 includes $46.5 million for the continued operation of 988.  • Reducing stigma, a common barrier to reaching out for help. In recognition of May as Mental Health Awareness Month, Ohio’s Beat the Stigma campaign, a partnership with the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance, will soon be launching a new round of Public Service Announcements focused specifically on common misperceptions associated with mental health.  • Concentrating efforts on integrating suicide prevention practices and care into high-impact systems, including healthcare, public safety, education, and employers. OhioMHAS and the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation support awareness trainings in the workplace and recently partnered with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce to release a Suicide Prevention Employer Toolkit to educate and equip employers with tools to address mental health and suicide concerns in the workplace.  • Building resiliency and promoting lifelong well-being of students. In his first budget, Governor DeWine created the Student Wellness and Success Fund for schools to join community partners to help meet the physical, mental, and behavioral health needs of their students. Through the $1.2 billion program, nearly 1,300 mental health programs have been funded in almost two-thirds of the state’s school districts.  • OhioMHAS and the Ohio Department of Education have also partnered with Ohio schools to provide Sources of Strength and Signs of Suicide programming. Research suggests these students will be less likely than their peers at other schools to struggle with mental health problems, bullying, violence, drug misuse, or to die by suicide – all as a result of efforts in 2021 to expand this evidence-based program to their school. Ohio also launched the Ohio School Wellness Initiative with 70 pilot schools across the state implementing a Student Assistance Program focused on prevention, early intervention, and treatment supports, and targeted state resources to provide mini grants to college campuses for suicide prevention initiatives.  • Building suicide prevention capacity and infrastructure at the organizational, local, and state levels. Ohio has taken action to increase the number of suicide prevention coalitions that are aligned with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s best practices and established the Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Prevention and Promotion at Ohio University and a School-Based Center of Excellence at Miami University to focus on prevention and early intervention among Ohio’s K-12 students. These Centers provide best practice, evidence-based training to the behavioral health workforce and serve as resources for communities and suicide prevention coalitions across Ohio.  • Focusing prevention efforts on groups that are considered at high-risk for suicide, including youth (ages 10- 24), Adult males, Ohioans who are racial and ethnic minorities, Veterans/Military members, and Ohioans in living in predominantly rural/agricultural. To help reduce and prevent suicides among these high-risk populations, OhioMHAS supports Be Present Ohio (youth and young adults), Life is Better With You Here (communities of color), Life Side Ohio (direct, suicide prevention outreach dedicated to the firearms community), Got Your Back (Ohio’s agricultural communities), and the Governor’s Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Military Members, Veterans, and their Families.  The governor’s 2024-2025 budget proposal prioritizes mental health and significantly invests funds to prevent and treat mental illness, including:  • $8 million each over the next two fiscal years to continue and expand proven suicide prevention programs and strategies outlined in the 2020 Suicide Prevention Plan.  • $100 million for the creation of an innovative State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network – or SOAR Network – to develop, evaluate, and implement increasingly effective mental health and addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery strategies.  • $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce, integration of behavioral and primary health, and development of Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTF) — a specialty, secure residential option that is part of the State’s OhioRISE (Resilience through Integrated Systems and Excellence) initiative led by Ohio Medicaid.  “Most of this funding is sent directly to local communities and will be used to increase the number of Ohioans trained to help people build skills to bounce back from difficult life events and to reduce stigma so people can ask for help without shame,” said OhioMHAS Director Lori Criss. “It will also support pediatric primary care screenings, grief support groups for loss survivors, and local coalitions who convene partners around unique community needs.”  Story submitted by the Ohio Department of Health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGdhemV0dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvc3VpY2lkZS1yYXRlcy1yaXNlLWluLWxhdGVzdC1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-12-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T05:27:06","Erik M. Plakun, MD  CONFERENCE REPORTER  Leveraging Alliance-Based Interventions to Address Suicide Risk  Heidi Anne Duerr, MPH  Developing and maintaining a therapeutic alliance is key, especially for patients with self-destructive and suicidal behaviors, Eric M. Plakun, MD, told attendees of the 2023 American Psyc  hiatric Association Annual Meeting. Plakun, medical director and chief executive office the Austen Riggs Center, shared his clinical experience and lessons learned in describing the 9 practical principles of the Alliance Based Intervention for Suicide (Table).  9 Principles of ABIS 1. Differentiate therapy from consultation 2. Differentiate lethal from non-lethal self-destructive behavior 3. Explain it is the patient’s responsibility to stay alive as part of the therapeutic alliance 4. Contain and metabolize the countertransference 5. Engage affect 6. Non-punitively interpret the patient’s aggression in the decision to end treatment via their actions 7. Hold the patient responsible for preservation of the therapy 8. Search for the perceived injury from the therapist that may have precipitated the self-destructive behavior 9. Provide an opportunity for repair  First and foremost, set the foundation of the therapeutic relationship by differentiating between consulting and the therapy phase, Plakun commented. The consultant phase allows the patient and clinician to understand and negotiate the terms of an alliance. He might spend a few sessions exploring their background and what may have brought them to care. “I need you alive to do the work,” he tells them. “Can you agree to this? If so, we can see where this takes us.” The self-destructive behavior should also be noted in the contract.  Next, it is important to consider the meanings of any self-destructive behavior as well as their impact on others. Possible meanings include atonement or self-punishment, fusion with another, aggressive assault, marking a boundary, or even a substitute for actual suicide. He spoke of a patient with suicidal ideation and self-cutting behaviors. As part of the initial treatment discussion, her therapist asked her to cease cutting in addition to being safe from suicide. Unfortunately, the patient was using the cutting behaviors as a substitute for suicide, and without that outlet, the patient was lost.  Plakun also detailed the story of “Daisy,” a patient he encountered who had attempted suicide seemingly out of nowhere after a family event. Daisy was raised in the Bible Belt, and she had limited education (ie, high school degree). She reported being unhappy at home as a teen and said she would often go to hang out with friends and others in the woods. Daisy reported being hospitalized in high school following a panic attack. Eventually she moved north, got married; at time of presentation, she had a 14-year-old son. She was place on 150 mg amitriptyline and therapy continued.  Treatment continued and was not remarkable until Plakun the patient was a no-show on Christmas eve—the last day of work for him before a holiday break. This was unusual for Daisy, who never came to the office that day. Instead, Plakun received a call from Daisy’s husband looking for her, as she was late for a date with him. The police were alerted and, shortly thereafter, Daisy was found in a van in a parking lot, somnolent after overdosing on her medication.  Plakun’s initial reactions included fear and being terrified and even angry with the patient. He then pulled in 1 of the ABIS’ principles: to contain and metabolize the countertransference to resume empathetic neutrality; he engaged Daisy in the hospital. “We had an agreement to keep yourself safe,” he said. “You seem to have made a decision to end our work,” he added, referencing the attempt. “I can continue to consult with you, by our commitment to weekly sessions has ended.” Unhappy with this, Daisy explains he was not available when she needed him, so she will find someone else.  Two months later, after trying other clinicians, Daisy returned, and they began to process the events. At that point, Daisy shared new and vitally important information about her previous psychiatric hospitalization: She had been drugged, beaten, and gang raped in one of her outings as a youth. Afraid to discuss this with her religious parents, she kept it to herself. She was later triggered in high school when a boy cornered her to ask her out.  The resulting panic attack landed her in the hospital. As part of outpatient treatment, the therapist asked Daisy to show him the sexual experimentation she had encountered in the woods, which further victimizes Daisy. Scared and ashamed, she considered cutting the therapist, but was unable to do so. Instead, she convinced her family she no longer needed those sessions.  Flash back to present time, and Daisy explained those negative experiences came crashing down on her shortly before the holiday as a result of a few things: Her husband asked her if she was sleeping with Plakun; a seemingly benign comment from Plakun—although they were not making progress about understanding the suicide attempt, they had a good connection, and that Plakun would be unavailable due to a family holiday gathering. Thus, her panic attack.  The benign comment falls in line with another principle, Plakun told attendees, and one that psychiatrists often overlook: consider a perceived injury from the therapist that may have precipitated self-destructive behavior.  Plakun mentioned resources from the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry as well as the American Psychiatric Association’s Psychotherapy Caucus for clinicians who want to learn more. For those who want to “work at the top of their license,” these psychotherapeutic tools are essential, Plakun noted.  Are you attending the annual meeting?

"suicide","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:09:00","Max Liu: ‘Britain’s answer to Hunter S Thompson is fizzling out into fear and loathing’ (Photo: Getty Images Europe)  My first thought on reading Will Self’s 2,300-word diatribe about Adrian Chiles was: where did it all go wrong for a writer who was once considered one of the most ambitious and original of his generation?  Self takes issue with Chiles’s Guardian column, which has acquired a cult following, and attributes its success to his relationship with the paper’s editor, Katherine Viner. He also speculates at length about Chiles’s penis.  Self criticises Viner’s editorship but she would have done a much better job than whoever ushered this self-indulgent mess into the New European – although no amount of editing could have saved such a silly piece.  It has been shared widely on social media by people appalled by its puerility, misogyny and colons. But I wonder how many actually made it to the end. It took me a few attempts to get past the multi-clause sentences, digressions and general lack of focus. But I got there eventually, so you don’t have to.  Readers of Self’s fiction have always needed powers of endurance. I tried to read his novella Cock and Bull on a coach from Leeds to Cornwall but had to put it aside around Leicester because I felt like my head was going to fall off and roll down the aisle.  His journalism, however, used to be a pleasure. His “Real Meals” column in The New Statesman was a must and, as a cultural critic, he could enliven any subject whether it be politics, pasties or Alain de Botton (“Alain de Bum-Bum”, as Self dubbed the philosopher in another example of his childish sense of humour).  Self’s capacity to divide readers used to make his work exciting, but reactions to his piece about Chiles have been unanimously negative. It feels desperate and reminded me of his son Luther Self’s tweet from 2018 about his father’s habit of declaring the death of the novel: “He’s a novelist who hasn’t sold any of his last two books so he assumes that the whole medium is dying.”  Is Self’s column about Chiles an attempt at committing professional suicide? Certainly, the chances of him writing for The Guardian again look slim, but the sloppiness of the piece suggests a general weariness.  Clarity has rarely been Self’s forte, but here his prose is incontinent, veering all over the place to critique Chiles’s column, pontificate about his relationship with Viner and tell us about the time Self went for a “clap test”.  Self’s maximalist style previously set him apart from his peers and had readers looking up the meanings of words such as “matitudinal” and “phlogiston”. It was often worth the trouble and he was hailed as Britain’s answer to Hunter S Thompson due to their shared enthusiasm for long sentences and drugs. After he died, Thompson’s ashes were fired from a canon but, on the basis of his piece on Chiles, Self’s career is fizzling out into fear and loathing in south London.  Self, who once said his own face resembled “a bag full of genitals”, wants you to find his fixation on Chiles’s penis deranged, as he refers to “Chiles lightly holding his guttering cock” and exclaims, bizarrely: “O! How your cock, Chiles, leavens this heavy dough of unwanted concupiscence!” But this stuff is just daft and made me feel both embarrassed for a writer who thought this was worth filing to his editor and impatient for it to be over.  There is a part about circumcision which, to put it mildly, crosses the boundary that separates the strange from the downright weird.  No doubt Self thinks his critics humourless, but that is often the last defence of the unfunny. He claims Chiles’s columns are dull, but perhaps he is jealous of their popularity. Chiles’s writing is clear, understated, surprising – the opposite of Self’s overbearing and congested bilge. Self, who says he only read two of Chiles’s columns, calls one an “advertisement for himself”. He’d know.  Self accuses Chiles of having an “engorged sense of entitlement”, which is surely an act of Self-parody too far. He knows that is what he displays in banging on so long and impenetrably about, well… what exactly? Self’s column is not really about Chiles – its true subject is Will Self. “Why would someone do that, and why would they write about it for a daily newspaper?” Self asks his reader. My thoughts exactly.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvb3Bpbmlvbi93aWxsLXNlbGZzLWNvbHVtbi1hYm91dC1hZHJpYW4tY2hpbGVzLWlzLWFuLWFjdC1vZi1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtc3VpY2lkZS0yMzUzMzUx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Quitman"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:05:53","If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.  Georgians living in rural communities continue to call into the national suicide prevention hotline at higher rates than other parts of the state as the one-year anniversary of the rollout of 988 approaches.  But there’s another alarming statistic causing concern in recent years about Georgia’s rural areas: The suicide rate increased even as the overall rate declined.  “We know the challenge in rural Georgia – and across really rural America – is a lack of access,” said Kevin Tanner, commissioner of the state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities.  “Many parts of our state are having to drive well over an hour to access care and services. We also know that stigma is much higher in rural parts of our state,” he said.  Tanner, a former Republican lawmaker who became commissioner late last year, called 988 a “catalyst” for reducing stigma. This July will mark the one-year anniversary of the national three-digit dialing code’s launch.  Georgia has an advantage over other states that are building call intake centers from scratch. The Georgia Crisis and Access Line, where 988 calls go, was established in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to assist evacuees.  The state is also seen as a leader when it comes to its mobile crisis program, which sends trained mental health professionals out across the state. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency overseeing 988, held a town hall event in downtown Atlanta Friday to spotlight Georgia, holding it up as a model.  “This state is a star, and this state is one that should be lifted up as an example – and it already is,” Monica Johnson, director of the federal 988 and Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office, said at the event.  But the attention comes as the state agency responsible for the crisis call center was dealt a setback earlier this month when Gov. Brian Kemp rejected a $2.3 million funding increase for additional support to manage the ongoing rollout. Kemp also nixed extra salary bumps for mental health professionals.  Those cuts were part of a long list of line items in the budget that Kemp struck down across several agencies as concerns about future state revenues grow. Revenues dropped 16.5% last month, but overall tax collections remained up slightly – 0.9% – for the year.  “Call volume has not increased to a level requiring additional administrative support over existing levels,” Kemp wrote.  Other funding increases for 988 survived, including the $6.2 million the governor originally proposed for mobile crisis teams that are part of the services someone who calls the hotline may receive.  The calls to Georgia’s crisis center have increased by about 12%. But a federal estimate projects those calls will double once the new three-digit number is promoted through a marketing campaign, which is coming later.  “There’s some folks who may be skeptical of those numbers,” Tanner told reporters Friday. “We want to be very careful that we lay out a very clear, distinct plan about what we expect to see in Georgia, and we don’t just base it on maybe national data.”  To test what impact intensive marketing may have on call volume in Georgia, Tanner said his agency is planning a monthlong marketing campaign this summer in two mid-sized communities. The results may help justify future budget requests, he said.  Harper: ‘It takes care of the rest of us as well’  Things aren’t getting any easier in rural communities, particularly for farmers.  Inflation has made already rising input costs higher, causing ag producers to spend more to earn less as they put in long hours at tasks that often risk physical injuries. And their income depends on the whims of the market, crop-killing diseases and pests, and, of course, the weather. Just recently, a late freeze devastated Georgia peach crops.  But seeking help to deal with stress does not tend to come naturally in a profession where farmers are hard-wired to be self-sufficient, says Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper.  “They go to work every day with one thing in mind and focus on doing the job that they feel they’ve been called to do, and they do a phenomenal job at it,” Harper, who is also a farmer, said in an interview as part of mental health awareness month.  “But at the same time, I think – as those of us in this arena – that’s part of our weakness, too. Because whenever we are presented with a problem, we always try to find a way to fix it ourselves first.”  Harper, a Republican who was elected commissioner last fall, said he is working to increase his agency’s focus on mental health awareness. Harper pointed to a survey that yielded troubling results last year.  Nearly 30% of farmers reported thinking of dying by suicide at least once a month, according to the report produced by the Georgia Rural Health Innovation Center at Mercer University School of Medicine.  And 42% of all farmers have thought about dying by suicide at least once in the past 12 months, according to the report.  Among first-generation farmers, 61% said they had thought about dying by suicide in the last year.  “What happens so often is that person bottles up their emotions until they can’t do that anymore, and that’s what we’re seeing in our agricultural community,” said Tanner, who owns a poultry farm.  Harper’s department has been promoting the hotline and other mental health resources as a way of encouraging farmers to reach out for help.  “By asking for help, you’re better able to take care of yourself, you’re better able to keep your nose to the grind, you’re better able to be self-sustaining and support your family, which in turn takes care of our state and takes care of our economy. It takes care of the rest of us as well,” Harper said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VvcmdpYXJlY29yZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3J1cmFsLWdlb3JnaWEtc3RpbGwtZGlhbGluZy05ODgtYXQtaGlnaGVyLXJhdGVzLWFzLWNhbGxzLWluY3JlYXNlLTEyLW92ZXJhbGwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2020-09-26","15:00:00","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T04:14:11","Washington [US]: Teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to commit suicide, and as boys become men, they are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. After years on the frontline of teaching and observing, first-hand, a decline in teenage mental health, a teacher has warned that we need to deal better with male anger, friendships, and attitudes towards sex in order to combat the male suicide crisis.  Official statistics for England, Scotland, and Wales show that in 2020, 264 people aged 10-19 died by suicide - 72% of these were boys. In England, suicide is the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45. They are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. While statistics surrounding male suicide paint a bleak picture of the future of boys in our schools, teacher Matt Pinkett thinks all is not lost.  What can be done? Pinkett has gathered evidence from teachers and school staff, wellbeing experts and therapists to create a powerful guide to helping boys, in Boys Do Cry, released next month. The practical and engaging guide, backed up by the latest research from the fields of psychology and education, suggests that teachers must stop stigmatising anger and instead help angry boys understand the neurological and physiological reasons for their feelings.  Pinkett says: ""Anger isn't an inherently bad thing and telling boys it is just leads to shame and hiding away. Instead, how about we teach them that anger is a feeling as natural as joy or sadness, and give them ways to manage it and the words to talk about it?"" He also suggests that teachers need to make loving, male relationships the norm, and to assume that every social interaction that takes place in a classroom is being watched and internalised.  He advises male teachers to compliment male colleagues openly, to talk lovingly about other people, and praise and salute male emotional vulnerability wherever and whenever possible. ""I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists - that would never work,"" Pinkett explains, ""but the fact is that we are in front of these children for massive chunks of their life. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing.""  Also read: Men deserve 'Tender Loving Care' too!  Talking isn't enough: In Boys Do Cry, Pinkett advocates the benefits of the 'bromance', suggesting that teachers and schools harness this relatively recent phenomenon of male-to-male relationships. He argues that in teaching boys about bromances, teachers can equip young men with the skills to actively listen and display compassion and affection towards each other.  He suggests teachers can help facilitate emotional connection between boys and help build friendships that are supportive. He explains: ""The problem isn't encouraging young men to talk - it's teaching their peers to listen. Research suggests boys don't listen as well as girls. There is so much conversation about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through listening effectively?""  Demonstrated through research and case studies, Pinkett argues that boys crave emotional intimacy and the freedom to express themselves without being mocked, but that toxic ideas about masculinity are preventing these fruitful peer relationships. ""We need to teach boys to be kind, and that it is OK to be vulnerable and emotionally articulate,"" he says.  Benefit to society: With his research-backed tools and tips, Pinkett hopes the book will give teachers confidence to engage with really difficult topics - to the benefit of all. ""This isn't just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to get rid of those harmful and outdated expectations of what it means to be a man, all of society will be better off,"" Pinkett says. ""It is only through education of young people that the scourge of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.""  Boys Do Cry examines key research on factors impacting boys' mental health, including topics such as body image, pornography and self-harm, and provides teachers with practical strategies to start enacting positive change. With his extensive research, he has created advice on intervening when a child may be in danger, to tips on how to set up group working so friendships can be made while learning. ""This isn't about turning teachers into therapists,"" Pinkett adds, ""It's just about being brave enough to intervene and give boys a chance to learn another way of being.""

Every Life Matters is launching a suicide alertness training called 'Orange Button' to work with Ormsgill residents to explore the role that communities can play in a grassroots approach to suicide prevention.  The Orange Button Community pilot launched in Ormsgill (Image: Every Life Matters)  This 3.5-hour training session is aimed at anyone who wants to understand more about suicide, how to know when someone may be having thoughts of suicide, how to talk directly and comfortably about suicide, and what we can all do to offer practical support.  Trained volunteers will be able to signal to anyone struggling with their mental health that they are suicide aware and ready to listen.  Shaun Blezard, Suicide Safer Communities Coordinator of Every Life Matters, said: ""There is a lot of work to be done in Barrow and Cumbria. Barrow is twice the average of death by suicides, and it is the fifth highest suicide rate by district in England.  ""People don't have to be afraid to look after their friends and family. Ask directly if you are worried about someone, and don't be afraid to ask twice.  ""One of the big things with mental health is the stigma of not wanting to come forward and admit that you have a problem.

"suicide","2022-07-12","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T00:00:00","  Number of Persons in Indian Country Jails Increases for Second Year  The Bureau of Justice Statistics is announcing the release of Jails in Indian Country, 2022. A total of 2,250 persons were held in 80 Indian country jails at midyear 2022, a 3% increase from the 2,180 persons held in 80 facilities at midyear 2021. This marks the second consecutive annual increase in the midyear jail population since it peaked in 2019 (at 2,890 persons) and declined rapidly in 2020 (to 2,020 persons) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Indian country jails admitted 5,570 persons during June 2022, which was a 4% decline from 5,780 admissions in June 2021. Over the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022, the number of admissions dropped 55%, from 12,500 admissions in 2012.  “It is noteworthy that the number of admissions is sizably smaller in 2022 compared to 2012. Yet, the percentage of persons held for violent offenses has increased by over a third during the same period,” said Dr. Alexis Piquero, Director of BJS.  During the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022, the number of persons held for violent offenses increased 34%, from 710 to 950 inmates. The largest absolute growth was among persons held for aggravated or simple assault, from 200 inmates at midyear 2012 to 330 at midyear 2022. The percentage held for domestic violence increased from 14% at midyear 2012 to 18% at midyear 2022.  Overall, about 58% of all persons in Indian country jails at midyear 2022 were held for a nonviolent offense, down from 70% at midyear 2012. From 2012 to 2022, the share of inmates held for a drug offense increased from 5% to 11%.  Four persons died (3 by suicide) and 46 attempted suicide while being held in Indian country jails during the 12 months ending on June 30, 2022. Indian country jails reported a total of 24 deaths (9 by suicide) and 375 attempted suicides in custody from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2022.  “BJS remains one of the few agencies to report on crime and justice data in Indian Country, helping to bring attention to an important but often overlooked segment of justice data,” continued Dr. Piquero.

At least four inmates died and 46 others attempted suicide from July 2021 through June 2022, according to the report by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. Three of the four deaths were from suicide. The report did not disclose the cause of the other death.  It is the most yearly deaths and attempted suicides recorded by the BJS since 2016. The number of attempted suicides nearly doubled from 2021, according to the study, which also found that more than half of all the inmates who were held in the jails during that same time period were never convicted of a crime.  The 15-page report also found that some of the beleaguered jails continued to wrestle with overcrowding and staff retention. At least six facilities faced chronic overcrowding and the number of correctional officers dropped by nearly 20% between 2019 and 2022 – a loss of 250 employees.  ""It's always saddening to see reports like this one, especially just a year after the Department of Interior promised to work on solving these issues,"" said Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. The committee provides oversight of the BIA, an agency of the Interior Department. ""Tragedies like these certainly warrant more investigation.""  The study, done annually, surveyed all 80 jails in Indian Country. Jail officials, who self-report the information, are not required to participate. Six jails did not, according to BJS.  Reforms were announced back in 2022, following investigation  In February 2022, the BIA announced more than two dozen reforms aimed at ""protecting the rights, dignity and safety of those in custody."" The proposed changes included beefing up staff training, improving recruitment and retention, and doing better ""interagency coordination with federal partners"" to guarantee that inmates are safe and hold correctional officers accountable.  It came on the heels of an investigation by NPR and the Mountain West News Bureau in June 2021 that found a pattern of misconduct, mistreatment and neglect that led to at least 19 in-custody deaths since 2016. Many of the victims had been arrested for minor infractions. BIA officials knew about the problems for years, the investigation found.  The examination by NPR and Mountain West News Bureau also revealed that many of the deaths occurred after correctional officers failed to provide proper and timely medical care, and that poor staff training led to several inmate deaths that could have been prevented. Officials have called the tribal jails program a ""national disgrace.""  Interior Department spokesperson Tyler Cherry acknowledged on Thursday that the BIA's corrections program has been ""under-resourced"" for decades, but said most of the reforms promised in 2022 have been implemented.  When asked, Cherry would not say which specific reforms have been put in place or are still being implemented.  ""The BIA will continue its work to reform the corrections system in Indian Country with available resources,"" he said in a statement.  Cherry pointed out that attrition rates within the BIA's law enforcement and corrections programs have declined by half since May 2022, but did not elaborate.  The agency is also working to boost salaries of BIA law enforcement, including correctional and police officers. A bipartisan bill – the Strengthening Tribal Law Enforcement Act – was introduced in the Senate earlier this year, which would allow the BIA to increase the minimum pay for law enforcement officers. Starting pay for agency cops currently is $46,000; correctional officers start at around $40,000. Cherry said that pay could increase by as much as $30,000.  Members of Congress say the findings are 'troubling' and call for accountability  Friday's report comes nearly a month after an Interior Department inspector general investigation found significant health and safety issues at three tribal detention centers in the Southwest. One facility on the San Carlos Reservation in southeastern Arizona had leaky plumbing, broken lights and, most significantly, a broken air conditioning unit in the female detention pod. Temperatures regularly hover above 100 degrees in the summer on the reservation. Staff at another jail told investigators they fear that their building could collapse due to severe structural issues, including falling cinder blocks.  The IG investigation also found that, in some cases, BIA building officials ignored these issues and rated the facility conditions as ""good.""  ""Several of these issues appear to have been exacerbated due to inaction over time and will likely require more funding and effort to repair than if they had been addressed in a timely fashion,"" according to the IG investigation.  Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, described the jail conditions as ""deplorable.""  ""This is not only a funding problem but also an accountability problem; we need to do more to address it,"" he said in a statement to NPR. ""No person should be subjected to these conditions, incarcerated or not.""  Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), called the reports ""deeply troubling.""  ""I'll be working with my colleagues to hold the BIA accountable and find a legislative fix,"" Tester told NPR.  Merkley and Tester successfully spearheaded an effort in December to appropriate $22.6 million to increase funding for the jails program.  During a budget hearing last week, Bryan Newland, the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, told Merkley's subcommittee that his agency is requesting more funding for maintenance and operations at the detention centers.  ""I think it's been well-documented – our jails across the BIA system are in poor condition,"" Newland said. ""We've also come up with an ability to rank them to prioritize which ones should be replaced, but we need the dollars to do that and to make sure the people in our care and custody get the treatment they're entitled to.""  The Bureau of Indian Affairs is asking lawmakers for a $62.1 million increase in funding for its public safety division, which includes jails and staffing  ""There is plenty of blame to go around on how we ended up in this situation, and these problems have been festering for decades,"" Merkley said. ""We must strengthen accountability and invest in staffing and infrastructure. Lives are at stake.""

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T00:35:04","It is “not fiction” to suggest that many vulnerable people would be pressured to end their lives if the UK legalised assisted suicide, a senior columnist has said.  Writing in The Times, columnist and former editor of The Sunday Telegraph Dominic Lawson said that the film Plan 75 “confronts its audience with a disturbingly realistic glimpse of a morally bleak future”, which could come to pass in the UK.  The film sees a future Japanese government instigating ‘Plan 75’ to manage its ageing population, where over 75-year-olds can be killed by euthanasia in exchange for $1,000 to be used by either themselves or their family.  ‘Far from impossible’  Lawson commented: “I have been concerned for many years about how an ‘assisted dying’ law in this country might affect the disabled — and attitudes towards them.”  A state-sanctioned solution like Plan 75 is far from impossible in a country that is growing ever more intolerant to socially weak people: the elderly, the disabled and the people who have no money. Chie Hayakawa  He highlighted that his youngest daughter, who has Down’s syndrome, is “highly suggestible, which in this context is a great worry”.  Chie Hayakawa, Plan 75’s co-writer and director, told The Guardian: “A state-sanctioned solution like Plan 75 is far from impossible in a country that is growing ever more intolerant to socially weak people: the elderly, the disabled and the people who have no money.”  ‘Image of God’  Rhys Curnow, Senior Researcher at The Christian Institute, said: “Assisted suicide campaigners will not like the chilling portrayal of incentivised euthanasia in Plan 75. While the film may be fictional, it has an important lesson to teach us.  “When a society accepts assisted suicide or euthanasia, it is denying the intrinsic value of human life. If certain lives are deemed not worth living, the ‘right to die’ will soon turn into a duty to die.  “Already in our individualistic age, elderly, disabled and terminally ill people sometimes find themselves treated as a burden. This film should make us think much more deeply about human dignity and the value of life made in the image of God.”  Parliament  Earlier this year, MPs were warned that legalising assisted suicide would undermine the culture of caring for the vulnerable.  Speaking in the House of Commons, former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Baroness Hollins said everyone needs to know they will “be directed to the right support”, but introducing assisted suicide would change the “culture, the attitude and everything”.  The House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee is currently hearing evidence on access to palliative care, the role of medics in assisted suicide, and eligibility criteria for such services in England and Wales.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbi5vcmcudWsvbmV3cy9wbGFuLTc1LWZpbG0tc2hvd3MtYS1kaXN0dXJiaW5nbHktcmVhbGlzdGljLWdsaW1wc2Utb2YtYXNzaXN0ZWQtc3VpY2lkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Nevada State Legislature Building at the state Capitol complex on Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021, in Carson City, Nev. (Benjamin Hager/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @benjaminhphoto  CARSON CITY — Scores of bills, including legislation legalizing physician assisted suicide and a bill capping certain prescription drug prices, advanced ahead of Friday’s second house committee passage deadline.  Senate Bill 239, legislation that would give terminally ill patients over the age of 18 with less than six months to live the ability to end their lives with lethal drugs prescribed by a medical practitioner, was just one of several bills that survived the deadline.  The bill passed through the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee, with state Sens. Gregory Hafen, R-Pahrump, Gregory Koenig, R-Fallon, Brian Hibbetts, R-Las Vegas, and Ken Gray, R-Dayton, voting against advancing the measure.  Lawmakers also voted to advance Assembly Bill 250, a bill that would cap the price of certain drugs at rates negotiated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. All of the Republican lawmakers on the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee voted against it.  In the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, lawmakers voted to advance a bill meant to increase safeguards against train derailments. State Sens. Ira Hansen, R-Sparks, and Scott Hammond, R-Las Vegas, voted against advancing Assembly Bill 456.  But not all bills faced split votes. Senate Bill 322, legislation that would increase the penalty for reckless driving causing bodily harm or death to a term of six to 10 years, passed unanimously by lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee.  An evening meeting of that committee also advanced an amended version of Senate Bill 35, a bill aimed at addressing mid- and high-level fentanyl trafficking. Assembly members Ken Gray, R-Dayton, Danielle Gallant, R-Las Vegas, Alexis Hansen, R-Sparks, Toby Yurek, R-Henderson, Melissa Hardy, R-Henderson, and Erica Mosca, D-Las Vegas, voted against advancing the measure.  But a fentanyl-related bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro did not receive a vote Friday, effectively killing the legislation.  And other bills weren’t so fortunate, either.  Assembly Bill 387, a bill meant address water rights conflicts, did not receive a work session vote. Senate Bill 394, a bill that would cap the amount the Governor’s Office of Economic Development can approve for a tax abatement at $500,000, also didn’t receive a committee vote.  Senate Bill 215, a bill that would require counties and cities that choose to stop using electronic voting machines purchased with state funds to repay the state, also failed to get a committee vote. Senate Bill 427, a bill which would have required employers to create a heat mitigation program to protect employees on days when temperatures reach 105 degrees or hotter, also failed to receive a vote.

Instead, the transgender teenager took his own life in November, after what his mother said was intense bullying on the basis of his gender identity.  Now, Fitzpatrick’s family has filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, the board of education and the borough of Manville. MyCentralJersey was first to report about this lawsuit.  According to the civil complaint, school officials ignored a ""hostile"" environment and failed to intervene as the teen was physically bullied and showed signs of self-harm in school.  The Somerset County Office of Education was also named as a defendant, filed on May 2 in Somerset County Superior Court by Myles’ mother, Danielle Warshefski.  Manville High School (Google Maps) Manville High School (Google Maps) loading...  Lawsuit says NJ teen transitioned during remote learning, returned to bullying  Fitzpatrick entered Manville High School as a student in the 2018-2019 year.  Everyone switched to remote instruction during the 2020-2021 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit.  That same year, Fitzpatrick came out as transgender and began transitioning to being a male, taking on the first name Myles, according to the complaint.  The following school year, instruction switched back to hybrid and it was then that Fitzpatrick became the target of severe harassment, intimidation and bullying by fellow students due to his gender identity, according to the lawsuit.  Among the interactions, according to the suit, the teen was pushed into lockers, had items thrown at him, was kicked and had his hair pulled.  The lawsuit also said other students made “constant comments and disparaging remarks during the school day, including but not limited to, the use of certain slurs, including “f****t” referring to him as “she” as a form of mockery and other derogatory references, including that he would never be a male.  On several occasions, harassment, bullying and discrimination was carried out in the presence of teachers and/or staff members without intervention, according to the lawsuit.  Myles Fitzpatrick (Fucillo & Warren Funeral Home) Myles Fitzpatrick (Fucillo & Warren Funeral Home) loading...  Fitzpatrick experienced severe depression and anxiety, engaged in acts of self-mutilation and/or self-harm and attempted suicide, the complaint says.  Warshefski said in the complaint that she made several complaints to school district personnel, but “nothing sufficient was done to address the complaints,” including “an apparent lack of intervention or enforcement” of district or state policies and procedures.  In 2021, Fitzpatrick had asked and was permitted to use a restroom in the faculty lounge or the nurse’s office to go to the bathroom and change for gym due to his transitioning and because he was being bullied in the locker room, the complaint said.  However, by 2022, the school took away that “privilege and/or accommodation without explanation,” the complaint said.  Manville NJ (U.S. Census, Google Maps) loading...  Warshefski said in her lawsuit that she continued to complain about the bullying and lack of intervention, and at some point asked whether Fitzpatrick could receive some “accommodation through virtual and/or homeschooling,” but the school did not offer any such accommodations.  On or about Nov. 7, 2022, Fitzpatrick committed suicide.  The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on grounds of gender ID discrimination, negligence, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and wrongful death.

Sign up to the MySalford newsletter to keep up with what's happening in and around the city  The family of a young mum who was stabbed to death by her ex-partner in a horrific murder-suicide have hit out at delays to her inquest - which have left them still waiting for answers nearly four years on from her death.  Regan Tierney, 27, was found dead by her father at her home in Salford in June 2019. Her former partner Daniel Patten, 31, was found with critical injuries at the address following her death and died two days later. Police said they were treating the tragedy as a murder-suicide following the pair's ten-year relationship, during which Regan was subject to coercive and controlling behaviour, intimidation, verbal abuse, physical violence and threats, at the hands of Patten.  At a pre-inquest review at Bolton Coroner's Court on Friday (May 19), a representative for Regan's family said they had 'immense frustration' at the delays which have plagued her inquest.  READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp community  Opening the pre-inquest review, area coroner Peter Sigee apologised to the family, citing a lack of court resources as the reason for the wait.  He said the case had last been in court for a pre-inquest review in May 2022, and he 'regretted' that there had not been the 'progress there could and should have been'.  ""I am sorry that we have not been able to make more progress with this inquest,"" he added.  Representing Regan's family, Emma-Louie Fenelon said: ""On their behalf, I'd like to outline the immense frustration with the delay with this case. Regan has been dead for now almost four years and they have had no explanation of the delays.  ""They have had to pause their grief until this legal process can be concluded.""  (Image: MEN Media)  A 2022 Domestic Homicide Review commissioned by Salford Community Safety Partnership found that just days before her death, Regan made a phone call to police reporting that Patten had threatened to 'put her head on a stick,' believing she was in danger.  But due to a three-day delay to record the report by GMP, by the time the force made contact with her, Miss Tierney had 'lost confidence' and decided not to take the matter further.  The report found that a number of opportunities were missed by services including GMP, GP practices, Bolton NHS FT services, Greater Manchester Mental Health Foundation, and Salford Royal NHS Trust.  In a statement released following her death, her family called her a young woman with 'everything to live for'.  They said: ""She was a loving mum who loved family life, she will be greatly missed by her two children and family.  ""Regan was taken from our lives too soon. She was a beautiful daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, and an amazing mother. We will forever cherish the memories.""  Coroner Sigee set the next pre-inquest review for September 6.

The case centres around sodium nitrite, a substance widely available that can be used to cure meats but can also be lethal. Here’s what we know so far about the local case that could have international ramifications.  If you are thinking of suicide or know someone who is, there is help.

Read more  “When did you start throwing up?”  My 13-year-old patient arrived at our adolescent clinic complaining of “menstrual problems” and was now repeatedly vomiting. A careful history revealed that she had intentionally overdosed, trying to end her life several days ago.  “Thank you for being open with me, I know that can be hard. I do need to tell your mom about your overdose,” I gently reminded her.  “Oh, she already knows, Doc. She just told me to keep throwing up again.” My patient’s mother had grown accustomed to her daughter’s depression and now third suicide attempt. She thought she knew the drill: overdose, throw up the drugs, drink water. Wash, rinse, repeat.  Advertisement  Although I was more than halfway through my pediatric residency at the time and had cared for countless suicidal teenagers, this patient visit has stayed with me. Even her mother had become desensitized to her own child’s suicidality while awaiting a psychiatrist appointment. How could I blame her? Since I started my training in June 2020, I have admitted nearly as many adolescent suicide attempts as asthmatic patients, and asthma is one of the most common reasons for admission to our hospital.  Adolescent depression and suicidality have quickly become the “bread and butter” of pediatrics. Teens without signs of depression or suicidal thoughts or attempts are so rare in our well-visit clinic that they are memorable. I can’t recall a single shift in our emergency room without multiple listings of “intentional overdose” or “behavioral/mental health problem” on the patient tracking board.  I am a pediatrician in an underserved, poverty-stricken community in Philadelphia. But I am not alone in what I’m seeing.

In the last decade, the mental health of high school students in the United States has continued to worsen, with 40% of high school students feeling so sad or hopeless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year. The percentage of high school students who reported making a suicide plan has also increased from 13% in 2011 to 18% in 2021. During COVID-19 lockdowns, from mid-March through mid-October in 2020, the percentage of adolescents across the U.S. who presented to the emergency room for mental health crises increased 31% compared with the same time period in 2019.  The data are clear. We are failing our adolescents.  The current screening, referral, and management process leaves our teens’ mental health issues unrecognized and untreated. Despite the ubiquity of adolescent mental health conditions, less than two-thirds successfully access treatment, and those who do wait an average of 50 days for psychiatrist intake appointments.  But pediatricians are not yet trained to pick up the slack. According to an American Academy of Pediatrics survey, 65% of pediatricians say they feel they lack training in identifying and treating mental health issues, as did more than 50% of pediatric residents. In my own residency program, both residents and attendings often say they feel unequipped to deal with depression and suicidality among our teens. Changes in pediatric training are overdue.  There are legitimate concerns that psychiatrists — not pediatricians — are best qualified to provide proper mental health care to adolescents. This is certainly true for complex diagnoses such as psychosis, schizophrenia, or treatment-resistant depression or suicidality. But with the overwhelming rise of adolescent mental health needs and the scarcity of adolescent psychiatrists in the U.S., the current system must adapt.  It is essential that we incorporate basic mental health care as a core element of pediatric training and practice, so we can fill the gap and provide the care our teens need to survive. Pediatricians have the opportunity to reach patients prior to crises — to stop the cycle of wash, rinse, repeat. Teens’ lives are at stake.  Rose Bayer is finishing her pediatrics residency in Philadelphia and applying for an adolescent medicine fellowship. She continues to pursue her passion and research in adolescent mental health as well as resident wellness and burnout prevention.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvdGVlbi1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLXN1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudGlvbi0yMDIzMDUxOS5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5xdWlyZXIuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFyeS90ZWVuLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLTIwMjMwNTE5Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T13:49:57","To mark the climax of Mental Health Awareness Week 2023, the company of the Olivier-nominated international stage sensation THE CHOIR OF MAN announces details of a year-long fundraising partnership with mental health and suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM).  The aim of the partnership is to raise over £10,000 for the charity's vital work - which is enough to fund over 1000 conversations via CALM's life-saving helpline.  Every week in the UK, 125 people take their own lives. 75% of those people will be men, making suicide the biggest killer of men under 50. CALM exists to change this by offering life-saving services, provoking national conversation, and bringing people together to reject living miserably. The Choir of Man is an uplifting celebration of community and friendship, with one of the key messages being the vital importance of men coming together to open up and share their struggles, whilst enjoying a pint and a chat.  Audiences will have the chance to support the partnership in various ways - both whilst purchasing a ticket, with QR code donation points in the Arts Theatre, collections on select performances and a Text2Donate opportunity that will be highlighted during The Poet's closing monologue.  The company of the show will also be offered support and advocacy opportunities by the charity, with a CALM Champion workshop.  Simon Gunning, CEO of Campaign Against Living Miserably said ""We're absolutely thrilled The Choir of Man are flying the CALM flag and raising money to fund our lifesaving services. Although the show is incredibly entertaining, it also contains a poignant message about the importance of men looking out for each other and how the pub provides a wonderful sense of community. It's a message we're passionate about because too many men are dying by suicide and this needs to change. Asking a mate out for a pint really can make all the difference.""  An uplifting celebration of community and friendship with something for everyone... including free beer! Enjoy 90 minutes of feel-good, foot-stomping entertainment unlike anything else in the West End.  Brimming with hits from artists such as Queen, Luther Vandross, Sia, Paul Simon, Adele, Guns & Roses, Avicii and Katy Perry to name but a few. A wildly talented group of incredible instrumentalists, world-class wordsmiths, and sensational singers; this cast of nine (extra)ordinary guys serve it all...live!  THE CHOIR OF MAN has previously played three sell-out seasons at the Sydney Opera House and multiple sold-out US and European tours. Following its last run at the Arts Theatre from October 2021 to April 2022, it received an Olivier nomination for Best Entertainment or Comedy Play, and then went on to play in Coventry as part of the City of Culture Assembly Festival season and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  BEN NORRIS - who wrote the monologues for The Choir of Man and originated the role of 'The Poet' said, ""The show is so unapologetically feel-good that whatever kind of mood you arrive in at the theatre, it's impossible not to leave with a smile on your face and a spring in your step. And that goes for the cast as well as the audience!  Whether we're conscious of it or not, when we meet a friend in the pub for a pint, it's often simply the company we're after. This is especially true, I think, for men. Although things are starting to shift, we still find it much harder to open up and to ask for help. We're still taking our own lives at a far higher rate. The lockdowns and the helplessness of the pandemic hugely exacerbated this, and the imminent cost of living crisis will only worsen it further.  As a male voice choir, we wanted to make a show that brings joy to people - a show that is fun and frivolous and silly and a bloody good night out, but also one that speaks to some of those difficulties we face, and that gently questions what masculinity might look like in 2022.  Above all, we wanted to make a show that puts an arm around people, of all genders, and invites them to either forget their troubles for an evening or to share them. Sometimes it's literally life-saving.""

"suicide","2017-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T11:00:00","This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).  Videos by American Songwriter  For those that knew him, Seattle-born rock singer Chris Cornell was a kind, even gentle person. His biography, Total Fucking God Head, describes him as a thoughtful person and a friend to many.  But even he had demons.  Indeed, Cornell’s life is a prime example of what is going on inside may not match the reality outside. On the outside, the singer was a rock god, the frontman for Soundgarden and then for Audioslave. Also known for his solo work, Cornell boasted the voice of a crooner and a banshee, the best of both extremes.  Born in the Emerald City on July 20, 1964, Cornell’s life was cut short. He died in Detroit, Michigan, on May 18, 2017.  The MGM  At the Detroit MGM Grand Hotel in the early hours of May 18, 2017, the 52-year-old bodyguard found him in the bathroom of his hotel room, unconscious. The night before, he performed a gig at the Fox Theater. The bodyguard reported that a resistance exercise band was around Cornell’s neck and there was blood in his mouth. He was pronounced dead on the scene by a doctor at 1:30 a.m.  Police reported that they reviewed surveillance video from the hotel and it didn’t show anyone coming or going from Cornell’s suite after the bodyguard left at around 11:30 p.m.  Police also reported that medication was in Cornell’s system, but, they said, not in any toxic amount. Though deemed not the cause of death, ultimately, Cornell did have a number of substances in his system, including Butalbital, lorazepam (a sleep aid known as Ativan that was prescribed to him), a decongestant, caffeine, and naloxone, which was given to him by emergency responders on the scene and is meant to reverse opioid overdoses.  Vicky Cornell  Cornell’s wife blamed the sleep aid drug, Ativan. She said she spoke to Cornell after his show and noticed he was slurring his words. Worried, she said she called Cornell’s security to check on him.  After Cornell’s toxicology report came out, Vicky released a statement. “Many of us who know Chris well noticed that he wasn’t himself during his final hours and that something was very off,” she said. “We have learned from this report that several substances were found in his system. After so many years of sobriety, this moment of terrible judgment seems to have completely impaired and altered his state of mind.  “Something clearly went terribly wrong and my children and I are heartbroken and are devastated that this moment can never be taken back. We very much appreciate all of the love we have received during this extremely difficult time and are dedicated to helping others in preventing this type of tragedy.”  Wasted Time  When the details of that night were released to the public, there were obvious problems and mistakes.  The problems began to arise a little after 11:30 p.m. in Cornell’s hotel room after his show that night. According to reports, his bodyguard had gone to see him around then to help him with a computer issue. A few minutes later, Cornell talked with Vicky on the phone. According to her, he kept saying he was tired and eventually just hung up the phone. Worried, she called his bodyguard to check. This was 12:15 a.m.  The bodyguard, Martin Kristen, couldn’t get in the room. He called hotel security, he says: “I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key.” When Kristen told Vicky the update, she advised him to kick down the door. When he did, after six or seven tries, Kristen saw Cornell’s feet through the bathroom door. He loosened the athletic band from his neck and tried to give him CPR.  Professionals arrived at 12:56 a.m. but could not revive Cornell. He was pronounced dead 34 minutes later, some 75 minutes after Kristen was called by Vicky.  The Conspiracy Theories  Police were questioned by The Detroit News about why it took 41 minutes for medical professionals to get to Cornell but the police said the gaps in time and response were not as big.  But in the wake of that night, others have investigated the tapes and call logs and determined that, in fact, the police were late. This has led some, including Vicky, to think that foul play is afoot.  The Detroit News reported: “Authorities determined within days the death was a suicide, although wife Vicky Cornell told People magazine she thought the ruling was premature because it came before the toxicology or autopsy results were complete. She said the drugs in her husband’s system may have altered his mental state. Among the theories: Cornell was killed because he was about to expose a child sex ring allegedly associated with Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor some claimed was a front, although Washington police said that theory was ‘fictitious.’”  ‘We investigated all possible angles, and there were no signs this was anything but a suicide,’ Detroit police media relations director Michael Woody said. ‘But we’ve been getting inundated with different theories.’”  Vicky has since brought up the fact that Cornell reportedly suffered from a head injury that was mentioned in two clinical reports, but was not on the final autopsy.  “This has left me and my family still looking for answers, but at the same time, set off this whirlwind of conspiracies,” [Vicky] told The Detroit News. “Some of the people are just fans looking for answers, but some of them are conspiracy theorists who have said the most vile things to my children and me.”  The Lawsuit  With many nagging questions in her mind, Vicky filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that Dr. Robert Koblin “negligently and repeatedly” prescribed Cornell “dangerous mind-altering controlled substances” that “impaired Mr.Cornell’s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.” The suit also said Koblin did so for 20 months, without properly checking on Cornell.  While Cornell may have been aware of the risks of the drugs, that doesn’t mean he should have been taking them. The singer long had a history of depression, and even spoke publicly about it. He even traced it back to when he was a kid and inhaled PCP, which, he said, put a “scar” on his “psyche.”  In his defense, Koblin said Cornell was of full mind and body and aware of what he was doing and the risks. The medication was for his anxiety and, Koblin says, he did everything he could to help Cornell with his depression. In 2021, the two parties settled confidentially.  The Legacy  Thursday (May 18), Cornell would have been 58 years old. He remains a seminal figure in rock music and, especially, in grunge music.  His former band Soundgarden and his widow Vicky recently settled their own issues and now Soundgarden has control over its social media accounts and the handful of songs Cornell recorded with the band before he died. The group is likely to release those in the coming months or years. And Cornell’s legacy will continue to live on.

Picture: FILE  Fiji and Pacific island countries have some of the highest rates of suicide and mental health challenged populations globally, says psychology discipline co-ordinator at The University of the South Pacific, Dr Annie Crookes.  To commemorate mental health awareness week, she was among a group of female panellists during the Women In Media Mental Health Panel Discussions recently.  Dr Crookes said the official suicide statistics indicated high rates of suicide and mental illness were prominent among young people and adolescents, particularly in the West in Indo-fijian communities.  However, she said there were rising rates among older adults within the indigenous Pacific islander communities too.  “This suggests breakdowns and changes happening to the traditional strong community and religious support systems, likely due to urbanisation and economic changes,” she said.  “However, we also know there are many socio-cultural elements such as traditional gender norms and patriarchy leading to gender-based violence, high sexual assault and increasing drug use among others.  “Then we have issues around very high stigma, ignorance, disinformation about mental health and mental illness.  “So people do not seek help when they start to feel psychological symptoms.”  She added there was a need to significantly enhance and invest in mental health budgets from government.  “The best thing is to have interventions that foster community.  “This should be done in the national school curriculum such as emotional awareness training, problem solving, coping skills development, interpersonal relationship and sexual education.  “This is not to say the culture is bad or doesn’t care about each other, not about the country simply not caring.  “It is just the product of miseducation and lack of understanding about mental illness and a lack of normalising mental health and emotional distress and normalising help seeking.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20vaGlnaC1yYXRlcy1vZi1zdWljaWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-17","15:00:00","{""Newton"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:30:44","Right about now, America’s Red States are fast on their way to becoming…dystopias. “Open carry” laws have led to dramatic…wait for it…open…violence. Women are second class citizens. Basic freedoms are going up in smoke. Teachers are criminalized. Kids are demonized. The LGBTQ are smeared as groomers — and then attacked legislatively. Books, banned.  The fanatics have taken over.  What does the future hold for America’s Red States? I won’t mince words, it’s not going to be pretty, and it’s a warning to the world. A world which is turning to its own Red-State-America-style demagogues and fanatics for a measure of security in a troubled world. It’s — emphatically — not worth it.  What happens as Red States begin to erase modernity itself? As they become places that resemble “third world countries”? As their polities, hijacked by extremists, theocrats, lunatics, turn authoritarian? And they go on a crusade to simply annihilate anyone they regard as inferior, first rhetorically, then legislatively, and then by inciting and licensing maniacs with guns? Giving those kinds of people badges and titles? Perhaps you’ve already forgotten the last massacre. I haven’t.  The classical vicious cycle of self-inflicted ruin is what’s already beginning to happen.  There’s an open secret about Red States. They’re broke. They take in more from the federal government than they collect. That’s not true for every Red State…but it will be soon.  7 of the 10 states most dependent on the federal government were Republican-voting, with the average red state receiving $1.05 per dollar spent.  The notable exceptions are, for example, Florida and Texas. And you can already see what’s happening there. Ron DeSantis has begun to politically attack…Disney. The State’s most historic employer. Disney just pulled out of a billion dollar investment package. Pretty simple, right?  What tends to happen as societies collapse is what we economists call “capital flight.” America’s Red States didn’t have much capital to begin with. And where that capital is still in Red States, it’s already beginning to flee. If DeSantis continues his crusade against Disney, how long do you think it’ll take before Disney just…packs up…and moves? You can see the theme writ large in that example, and it’s an illustration of the larger effect.  Why does capital flight take place? Well, picture yourself as an investor. Maybe even just…I don’t know…buying a home. Would you want to live in a Red State, if you had a choice? Probably not. That’s because you’d take on all kinds of risk. The risk of…being shot by some violent maniac with a gun. The risk of having a gay kid, and them being persecuted. Your straight kid getting in trouble for…reading books. You getting in trouble for “aiding and abetting” a woman. That’s all leaving aside the emotional climate of intolerance and rage. All those forms of risk are very real.  They’re even larger for investors. Who knows when a government that’s turned authoritarian is going to…attack your company? Your investment? For God knows what? Maybe one of your execs is gay. What a crime. Maybe your CEO gets pictured on a plane reading the wrong book. Maybe your latest ad campaign says everyone’s a person. Bang. They start to attack you. They pass whole new laws and appoint “oversight committees” to start political witch hunts. Sane money avoids political instability for a very good reason: it carries with significant, usually lethal, amounts of risk.  So. There Red States are. America’s dirty secret is that their lunacy, their extremism, LOL, is being funded by…Blue States. Remember, apart from a handful of exceptions, Red States are subsidized by the government. Now, Blue States don’t resent that, because by and large, people in them think everyone should have basics like roads, schools, hospitals, books, libraries, and so forth. But as this cycle of capital flight continues…what happens?  The already barely extant public purse of Red States will shrink, as capital flees, for friendlier climes. And as it does, what little in the way of public services Red States have will shrink. Their economies will go into a tailspin, sooner or later, thanks to all this fanaticism and authoritarianism. And as it does, what kinds of places will they be left to live in?  Then you’ve got the combination of a climate of bigotry, fear, rage, hate. The gun violence. And now you’ve also got…not a lot else. Maybe cheap housing. But everything else is broken. Another Red State illustrates that pretty well, and that’s Texas. Texas is a rich state — for a reason called oil and gas. But Texas hasn’t spent that money wisely. It’s got poor to nonexistent infrastructure. It’s power grid and its water system are decrepit. Its school system is ranked 40 out of 50. That’s about all the infrastructure it has. It’s not exactly renowned for boulevards, town squares, and high speed trains, after all. All that wealth — squandered.  What happens as societies enter this vicious cycle — as political fanaticism causes capital flight? Well, sadly, that very capital flight tends to solidify and entrench fanaticism. Because as people get poorer, they get more desperate. The demagogue’s Big Lies catch hold and catch fire. Violence spirals. The rule of law stops functioning. And in that way, authoritarianism crystallizes into a newer, harder phase.  Where does that leave Blue States? In a very, very precarious and difficult position. There they are, subsidizing Red States. Paying for all this lunacy. Red States, Blue States are going to eventually say, don’t carry their weight. What do they really contribute to the common wealth, anymore? Not a whole lot. Bigotry and violence — when you don’t even pay your way? Is that really what we should be subsidizing?  At the same time, there’s not a lot that Blue States can do about it. The position they’re in is that Red States have disproportionate representation in the polity — and for that reason, effectively get subsidized. Short of a national breakup, there’s not a whole lot Blue States can do about this, which looks like one history’s rawest deal.  That brings us to the paradox of Red States. They get subsidized, but they don’t want a functioning government. LOL. That’s illogical, and it’s baffling, and people tear their hair out about it. You don’t need to overthink it. It is what it appears to be, which is plain foolishness. You probably think, having considered that, that it’s a pretty self-destructive thing to do. Even for a lunatic. I mean, do you want to really bite the hand that feeds you?  This is how societies implode. That level of self-destruction. One that says, yes, here I am, getting subsidized, by a thing that I want to destroy. I guess there won’t be more for me. Why would anyone do that? Out of sheer vengeful spite, and ignorance, to boot. I’ll take you down with me, and that way, hey, we both won’t have anything, but at least I’ll have the satisfaction of having ruined you.  There’s a simpler way to put that. Red States are turning America into a suicide pact. Who wants to live beside states that…ban books…demonize kids…criminalize teachers…let violent maniacs carry weapons of war? Not a whole lot of people. Who wants to subsidize them? Even fewer. And yet Blue States are trapped in this suicide pact, because for Red States, the goal is destruction — the destruction of democracy and modernity. How many Red States can you see out there that aren’t erasing basic rights faster than you or I can blink an eye?  Certainly, not every Red Stater feels that way. And many sane, kindhearted, democratically-minded people live in Red States, and can’t afford to pick up and leave. But unfortunately Red States are where they are. And that is turning increasingly fanatical, at a pretty startling rate, even for them. Red States have this grim reputation, and sadly, right about now, they’re not living up to it, they’re exceeding it.  Capital flight isn’t just about money. It’s about people, too. “Human capital” (to use an ugly term) flight. That’s another facet of social collapse. That means fleeing the climate of authoritarianism — but also more than that. It means that as authoritarian reaps the economic whirlwind, people have little choice but to leave.  Right about now, Red States are in a strange position — one which makes them seem stronger than they are. They’re seeing an influx of migration, because the cost of housing and living is cheaper. Of course, it’s cheaper for a reason. Living standards are often dramatically lower. Still, right now, there are still jobs in Red States. But as this new fanaticism carries on, there won’t be.  Think about what happens when Disney shelves a billion dollar investment package, or simply walks away for good. As investment dries up, it takes jobs with it, which impact the public purse, drying up funds for what little there was in the way of schools, hospitals, libraries, and suddenly, authoritarian societies look far less attractive to live in. Even if the housing’s cheap.  All of that will come to pass, but it’ll take some time. Half a decade or so, maybe more. Right now, Red States are riding high, because an influx of migration is letting fanatics basically grow drunk on power. Look at all the people moving here! We must be amazing! But really, there are two futures for Red States.  One goes like this. All those new residents from (often far more populous Blue States) begin to vote, and demand sanity, nonviolence, equality, truth, and justice, which are the fundaments of democracy. They kick the fanatics and lunatics out. The States turn…if not Blue…then maybe Purple. But not the Red they are right now. The Red of emergency, alarm, rage, hate.  The second one goes like this. Those new residents didn’t amount to enough to really change much. And so said state goes into a spiral of decline. As it does, authoritarians demand more and more. More book bans, more rights erased, more social groups persecuted and demonized, more professions and social roles criminalized. What sane people are left must go. To place where sanity still exists.  Which state will fall into which category? It’s hard to say, and you can make your own judgments.  The bigger problem, and the bigger picture, is this. Blue States are wasting money — and time — on Red States. And at some point, they themselves are going to demand a fairer accounting. That money is needed now, after all, for far better things than lunacy, violence, and bigotry. It’s needed for infrastructure, fighting climate change, giving kids an education — the very things Red States keep on blocking America from doing as a country. Sooner or later, Blue States are going to have take matters into their own hands, and just begin doing it. That means clawing back both power and money from central, federal government.  America’s becoming a suicide pact. I’m sorry if that sounds harsh. I don’t mean to insult anyone or make you feel bad. There’s enough of that in the world. My point is simple. It’s hard to break one. Blue States can’t break off the country. But they will eventually do what happens in destabilized societies. Take some form of power back, and resources with it, so they can do what the self-destructive parts of society won’t. Of course, as they try to, Red States will scream to high heaven. That they’re the persecuted ones, that they’re under attack, being replaced, all the torrid cliches, by now, you can hear the GOP screaming every day. That’s what the next decade of American politics will be about, sadly. And it’s going to be uglier than many of us yet think.

"suicide","2011-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T09:00:37","[MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  So before we jump in today, I want to tell you about something The New York Times has been working on for a while. And I’m going to level with you — that when they started telling me about this project, I was very skeptical of it, which made for a couple of awkward internal conversations, because what I understood them to be working on was a podcast app. And I thought to myself, who needs another podcast app? There are plenty of them on the market already. None of them are great, but they’re fine. And then they gave me the new app as a beta tester, and I realized that I was wrong about what they were building, at least partly wrong, because what they actually built is something nobody has created yet, which is a portal to the world of audio journalism. There are podcasts, including this one, but also stories, essays, profiles. You can listen to digests of the news, and to full news stories, and to full magazine stories. You don’t have to choose anymore between listening to a podcast and actually getting the news. You can get the news you used to read, but done in a really, really strong, really professional audio format, and not just from The New York Times. There are stories there from other publishers too. So the app, again, is called New York Times Audio. It’s an iOS app. You get it from the App Store. And it is for New York Times news subscribers, which — come on, if you’re listening to this show, I hope you’re a subscriber for that by now. So check it out. It really is something new. It really is something worth trying. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m going to start today’s show with some numbers. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of teens and young adults with clinical depression more than doubled — more than doubled. Between 2007 and 2019, the suicide rate for those in their early 20s rose by 41 percent. And the suicide rate for 10 to 14-year-olds — 10 to 14-year-olds, think about how young that is — it tripled, and it nearly quadrupled for girls. A C.D.C. survey found that in 2021, almost 60 percent of high school girls experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year, and nearly 25 percent — I just, this number, man — nearly 25 percent made a suicide plan. Something is going terribly wrong for teenagers. Whatever it is started well before the pandemic. And this is important enough and big enough that we’re going to do a couple of episodes exploring it. But I wanted our first one to really try to dig into these numbers. What do we know is happening here? Why is it happening? You can’t begin to solve a problem like this, until at least you have a theory of what has been causing it. Jean Twenge is a research psychologist who has been deep in this data for years. She was one of the earliest to see something going wrong with teen mental health. And then in her 2017 book, “iGen” and her new book “Generations,” she’s put together reams of charts and graphs and theories and tests to try to understand what it is, what has happened here. And the leading candidate, in her view, is smartphones and social media. And if that’s true, if they really are doing this level of damage to kids today, then we need to be thinking about interventions here on a whole different scale than most policymakers have been willing to touch. And I want to say this episode obviously deals a lot with suicide, and if you or someone you know or love is struggling here, get help. There is a lot of help out there. So call or text 988 to reach the suicide and crisis lifeline. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jean Twenge, welcome to the show.  jean twenge  Thank you.  ezra klein  So in your new book, “Generations,” you write, “that there’s a full blown mental health crisis among young people, and it was building long before the Covid-19 pandemic.” So walk me through some of the data — and your book is really chock-full of data and graphs, which I really appreciated about it. Walk me through some of the data that persuaded you of that.  jean twenge  Yeah, so I work with these large national surveys, often of teens. And I’ve been doing that for a number of years. So when I first started to see these trends, they were surprising, because they were so sudden. So around 2012, more and more teens started to say they felt lonely and left out. And more started to say they felt like they couldn’t do anything right, or that they didn’t enjoy life. Those last two are classic symptoms of depression. Then, other data started to pop up. Clinical level depression that requires treatment started to rise. Emergency room admissions for self-harm started to rise in C.D.C. data. Same thing for suicide attempts and completed suicides. So at first, I thought it might be a blip, a year or two of data. But it kept going. So for example, between 2011 and 2019, well before the pandemic, clinical level depression among teens doubled. Emergency room admissions for self harm tripled in 10 to 14-year-old girls. So this is why I say we know it’s not just the pandemic.  ezra klein  And those objective measures of behavior, is that one of the ways we know? Because I think this is a common suspicion at about this point in the conversation, that we’re not just dealing with a rise in reporting or a decrease in stigma — maybe it’s much easier to say and admit that you’re depressed than it was in 1985.  jean twenge  So exactly, that’s how we know it’s not just about more willingness to report, is that these objective measures, like the emergency room admissions for — not just for self harm, but also for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, have gone up. And the pattern is extremely similar to the self reports. I mean, the other thing that has to be kept in mind about these self reports is these surveys are anonymous. Many of them also ask about drug and alcohol use, all of which is illegal in these age groups. So these surveys better than anybody know how to make sure to get across to young people how confidential. It is.  ezra klein  What are we seeing in terms of the demographic differences here between boys and girls, among races, classes, geographies? Are there patterns being picked up there that are worth noting?  jean twenge  So the biggest difference is boys versus girls, and it varies a little bit from one measure to another. So for clinical level depression, it’s doubled for both girls and boys. But because teen girls’ rates of depression are and were always higher, the number of people that this affects is larger for girls. And then in many of the other measures we’ve been discussing, the changes are considerably larger for girls than for boys, so self-harm behaviors is one of those where there’s not as much change for boys as there is for girls. Same is true for the suicide rate, that it has changed for both, but it has changed more and increased more among girls than among boys.  ezra klein  I want to zoom in here on suicide itself. You compare the actual suicide rate increases between 2007, not that long ago, and 2019. And you say of the increase, quote, it’s a total of 17,677 additional young lives lost, averaging more than 1,300 a year, enough to fill nine planes. Imagine if nine airline flights filled with 10 to 24-year-olds crashed every single year, killing everyone on board. That’s a really profound and shocking rise. So how do you understand the rise in suicide itself?  jean twenge  So I think we have to look at the pattern across all of the measures, so not just suicide, but also those ER admissions for self harm, the rise in depression, the rise in anxiety, the rise in unhappiness. And across the board, all of these indicators have gotten worse in terms of mental health. And the pattern is fairly similar, that around 2010 or so, these indicators start to get worse. Now, the exact time when they start to increase varies a little bit from one measure to another, sometime between 2009 and 2013. It’s right in that time period. So you have to ask, what happened during that time period, because we’re not trying to explain all of the causes of mental health issues among teens. We want to know why it increased so much over such a short period of time. So it has to be something that changed around that time, and then kept going in the same direction over the next decade or so. So when I first started to see these changes, I had absolutely no idea what the cause could be. It was pretty clear it was not economics, because the U.S. economy finally started to improve after about 2011, after the Great Recession. It was difficult to think of any major event that occurred around that time and then reverberated throughout the decade. And then one day, I came across the results of a poll from the Pew Center for Research. And it showed that the end of 2012 was the first time that the majority of Americans owned a smartphone, and these same surveys of teens, that time period was also when social media use moved from something that about half of teens were doing every day — it was in 2009 — to by 2015, 2016, about 80 percent of them were doing it every day. So then basically, what happened is social media use moved from optional to almost mandatory among teens. So that’s when I started to think maybe that had something to do with it, that teens were spending so much more time online — also, because this lined up with other things. Like, they were also sleeping less. The trend isn’t exactly the same pattern. That started to increase after 2011 or 2012. And they also started spending less time with their friends in person, so that had started to decline just a little bit after about 2000 and then it really falls off a cliff after 2010. So you put this together, there was a fundamental change in the way teens spent their time outside of school starting in that same time period, early 2010s. And that coincides, with pretty good precision, with when mental health started to suffer.  ezra klein  So before we go deep into the smartphone thesis, I want to zoom in on something you said there about the data, which is that we’re trying to explain a change in the time series — right, there’s this very sharp — just, the line goes almost straight up, starting, as you say, around like 2011, 2012. But something that was striking when we were doing prep for this was, I saw this figure from the researchers Will Rinehart and Taylor Barkley. And they found that if you go back to the late 1960s and you graph the teen suicide rate, it looks more cyclical, rather than a trend just going upward. So it’s higher in the ‘80s than now, than it falls for a long time until about 2008. And then it picks up again, getting us to where we are now. So if we’re kind of explaining the rise, how do we also explain the fall that preceded it? I mean, there are no smartphones in the 1980s. So what do you understand as having gone on in the ‘80s that led to such a high suicide rate, and then stopped happening, such that it went down to what we’re now thinking of as a more normal baseline?  jean twenge  So it is true that the suicide rate for teens in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s was very high. It was much higher than it was, say, for Boomer teens in 1970. So one thing we have to keep in mind here is just the greater cultural context, that there was a big rise in violent crime around this time. It was kind of a disordered time in the culture, so this — there was a recession. This is around the time that Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign kept talking about change because it was such a pessimistic time in the country. And for teens in particular, and we’re talking about suicides in particular, there’s another element — so there was a huge availability of inexpensive guns around that time. So they were called Saturday Night Specials. And when you break it down for firearm suicides versus non, non firearm suicides went down or didn’t change a whole lot during that time period when it was the Gen X-ers who were teens. It was really that increase in the firearm suicides, so it may have had a fair amount to do with the preponderance of cheap guns.  ezra klein  So one of your big thesis throughout generations is that generations are technologically mediated, that more than they’re defined by cultural events, they’re defined by the technologies they have accessible to them. So your thinking on this is that technology that was mediating that was guns. But then why would it fall?  jean twenge  Well, the folks that looked at this concluded that there were more restrictions starting in the mid ‘90s. And what I do know for sure, the violent crime rate definitely started to go down after about — 1993 was the peak, and then things started to improve. And they kept improving for a really long time. So I still think that general atmosphere of that time — it was really a tough time to be a teen, particularly if — you know, depending on the neighborhood were in, but particularly if you were in a place that was impacted by this very, very high level of violent crime.  ezra klein  Violent crime actually gets at why I wanted to ask this before we got into smartphones, because I’m much more familiar with the debate over crime than I am over the debate over suicide trend lines. And the thing that has always striking to me, and I think really underplayed in our national discourse over crime, is that we don’t really understand it, that if you go into the ‘80s and the ‘90s, you see crime goes way, way up in the 70s, way, way up in all kinds of different jurisdictions, more or less all at the same time. And then it begins going way, way down in all kinds of different places all at the same time. So you have stories that people know, like there’s New York with Rudy Giuliani and broken windows policing and stop and frisk. But it also goes down in all these places that didn’t do what New York City did. It’s so widespread, both the rise and the fall, that you end up having researchers trying to think of even broader explanations, like whether or not lead and the amount of lead in young kids’ bloodstreams — and thus, the effect on their executive function when they got older, maybe that’s the causal mechanism. And it made me wonder if there isn’t a chance that suicide and teen mental health is like that, that it has this kind of all the way up, all the way down in all places, and we don’t really understand why pattern to it.  jean twenge  Well, I think — and I think your point is very well taken about crime rates, that they are a little bit of a mystery. It’s also true, sure, that for mental health, we can’t randomly assign people to be born at different times and then see what their mental health looks like. That would be the gold standard of or random assignment experiment. And it’s literally impossible. So we have to go on the data that we have. But I think for the recent rise in mental health issues, we can look at it this way, that this is a generation where violent crime is a lot lower than it was in the early ‘90s. Teen pregnancy was lower. They’re even less likely to get into car accidents or get into physical fights at school. Incomes were up for that period. There’s all these things that were going right, yet still, mental health among teens suffered. So there must have been some big mechanism. The reason why I think the smartphones and social media explanation has held up is because that is what had the biggest impact on the day to day lives of teens. It wasn’t something that happened to their parents. It wasn’t a single thing they read about in the news. It completely restructured their time outside of school because social media is social. It impacts even people who don’t use it. And it had a huge impact on the way teens spent time with their friends, that they started spending a lot less time with each other, face to face. And you think about what’s important for mental health overall, it’s relationships. Then, you think about teens in particular, that is what makes or breaks mental health for a teen, is their relationships, particularly their friendships. And the way those friendships were conducted changed completely.  ezra klein  So I want to dig into this piece of it more, because smartphones sound like a singular cause. But when I read you on this, and when I read others, it decomposes into something very multi causal. So tell me the different mechanisms. You talk about time displacement, and social effects, and time spent with friends, and sleep. What are the different mechanisms that you understand smartphones as triggering that contribute to this for you?  jean twenge  There are a lot of different mechanisms. It’s another reason why it is such a plausible explanation. So as we’ve already talked about, there’s the time displacement — not just with in person interactions with friends, but also with sleep. Sleep is absolutely crucial for mental health. Not sleeping enough is a huge risk factor for depression and suicidal thoughts. And sleep deprivation among teens in two different surveys shows exactly the same pattern as the mental health issues, which is around 2012 or so it starts going up. So that’s our first couple of mechanisms.  ezra klein  And just hold on that one for a minute. What makes you certain that that isn’t just correlation with the take off in smartphones? What makes you think that smartphones are directly leading to less sleep for teens?  jean twenge  So there’s many correlational and experimental studies, say, in sleep labs showing that, for example, people have their phones in their bedrooms overnight, that that disrupts sleep, that looking at a device before bedtime leads to less sleep and less quality sleep. So because — for a number of reasons. First, they’re psychologically stimulating. Pretty much everything people do on the phone is psychologically stimulating, particularly for teens, where the number of likes they got on their Instagram post, or whether they’re crush texted them back is very important. These are not relaxing thoughts, yet many, many, many teens are looking at their phones right up until they go to sleep. Plus, there’s a physiological element. The blue light on those devices shines into your eyes, tricks your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. And then you don’t make as much melatonin, the sleep hormone that you need to fall asleep quickly and get a good night’s sleep. And this is correlational, experimental — that piece of the research literature is extremely solid, on that connection between spending time on the devices and not sleeping enough.  ezra klein  All right, so that is smartphones and sleep. What are the other mechanisms?  jean twenge  So there’s all of the things that happen when a teen uses social media. So we can start with things like social comparison and body image issues. So this is what Facebook’s own research shows, as well as plenty of external academic research as well, that looking at, say, these ideal bodies on Instagram, or even the people you go to high school with, and they look more glamorous, and you’re comparing your body to theirs, and your appearance to theirs and coming up short. So that’s the social comparison piece, and lots of studies on this, that people that spend more time, and especially those who spend more time looking at those images on Instagram, if they have that tendency towards social comparison, that’s where you get the body image issues, appearance issues. And then those — mediated, those can then lead to depression. And in Facebook’s research, they had a bunch of focus groups as well as large surveys, and they found this over and over. And the focus group quotes, some of them were really stunning. They would talk about a grief spiral, and they start looking at these images, feel inadequate, then get depressed. Then, there’s all of the other things that people have discussed about the influence of social media, that it means popularity becomes a number — how many likes do you have, how many followers do you have. And it’s never enough. Then, cyberbullying — some of the rabbit holes that people end up going down, that has been documented. If you start looking for healthy eating, you might end up on pro anorexia sites, and there’s no way to reset that. And that negative material keeps showing up. Same thing for a lot of things around mental health. And again, it just becomes a spiral.  ezra klein  One thing about smartphones is they’re an international phenomenon. So is social media. So what do you see in the international data here?  jean twenge  So in the international data, we see exactly the same pattern as we see in the U.S. for teen mental health, that in 36 countries around the world, adolescent loneliness began to increase after 2012, just like it does in the U.S. data. We have solid data on depression and unhappiness in English speaking countries — again, exact same pattern — so in the U.K., in Australia, in Canada, exact same pattern for teens for anxiety and depression, self harm, unhappiness. It’s very, very consistent. And that also suggests some cause that was worldwide. That helps us rule out more U.S.-based explanations, like worries around school shootings, which tend not to happen in other countries, and certain political events.  ezra klein  How does the smartphone thesis map on to — not just the observation, the reality, that this has been much worse among girls than boys?  jean twenge  Well, girls spend more time on social media. And time on social media is more strongly linked to depression than time spent on, say, gaming, which is where boys spend more of their screen time. So those two factors, they spend more time on it, and it’s more strongly linked to depression for them — might explain the gender difference.  ezra klein  I found that pretty striking. Why do you think gaming is not as linked to some of these negative outcomes?  jean twenge  These days, the way most teens and adults game, it’s often interactive. So they’ll play games with their friends. They aren’t there face to face, but it’s often in real time. And they’ll often talk to each other as they’re playing the game. So not the same as running around outside playing football, say, but still in real time, and still interaction with friends, where on social media, only some of it is interaction with friends. A good amount of it is watching TikTok videos from people you’ve never met, or scanning through the pages of Instagram influencers.  ezra klein  This is one thing I was trying to sit with as I read the book, and thought about this data, that gaming has this tendency to be not just interactive, but it’s you doing it, it’s you doing something, where social media has this weird tendency to put you outside yourself, looking in. I mean, you’ve talked about it as comparative, but it’s also — you’re posting pictures, you’re writing things, and then seeing how people respond. You’re always putting yourself out for judgment. And you begin to inhabit the judger in a weird way. I mean, I’ve certainly felt this myself. And I did not get social media when I was a 13-year-old. Is there something to that, the way that gaming keeps you in yourself, and social media it takes you outside yourself?  jean twenge  I think so. It reminds me of some of the research on what’s called self objectification in terms of appearance, that particularly for women, there’s the pressure to focus on how your body looks to others, rather than what your body can do, say, in terms of sports or other things. And it’s somewhat of the same element, because in gaming, you can do things. And maybe you’re going to fail, and maybe your friends will make fun of you. But still, you’re doing something. You have at least some perceived level of control. And in social media, there is that same perceived level of control. However, there’s only so far you can go to modify your appearance and try to measure up to all the perfect people who you see online. And you’re right, it’s about — so much more about the judgment of others than it is about what you’re doing.  ezra klein  How much is social media also simply a vector for contagion of antisocial behaviors themselves, or depressive and anxious and self harming thoughts and patterns themselves? And I mean something very specific here. So back in the day when I covered more school shootings, there was an argument not to use the names of school shooters, sometimes not even — you would actually get the argument not to cover them, because there is a well known copycat effect. There’s also a well known effect like that around suicide. People know that the more they hear about suicide, the likelier suicide is to occur to others. There’s a Netflix show about the suicide of a teen called “13 Reasons Why,” and there was a big debate, including some research, about whether or not that itself increased suicide among teens. And so there’s an argument out there that as people are exposed to simply the knowledge that other people are doing these things — killing themselves, killing others, hurting themselves, hurting others — that that itself is enough for more people to do it. And anybody who’s spent time on social media also sees a lot more just discussion of anxiety, discussion of depression, those feelings as interpretive frameworks for your own feelings becomes more at hand. So how much is it just possible here that you’re seeing contagion as a force gathering its own momentum, that people are more connected to others having these kinds of experiences, and so they’re having more of them themselves?  jean twenge  I think that might explain some of the acceleration in the trend, or part of it. I don’t think it can explain why it started to begin with. So yeah, I think we have to consider that there was an origin to this, because — you know, why couldn’t it be that people are talking about how optimistic or happy they are online, and that becomes contagious. So I had to start somewhere, because there was that very sudden shift from millennials being self confident and optimistic as teens to Gen Z being not. And it happened very quickly. It was a much more stark generational difference than I’ve really documented in my whole career.  ezra klein  So I want to note that there are some studies that have looked at this and found very little effect, or no effect, or reverse effect. There’s a 2019 study in Nature Human Behavior that found, quote, the association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4 percent of the variation in well-being. There’s a 2018 study in Psychiatric Quarterly that also found very unremarkable results. You’ve kept, along with Jon Haidt and some others, this online compendium of studies on teen mental health. So when you see these studies, and there are a good number of them that come out and say, we checked into this, and we just can’t find anything significant or big here, how do you interpret what’s happening in them? And if they do, how do they change your priors?  jean twenge  So that 2019 Nature Human Behavior study has been pretty thoroughly debunked, because three other research groups analyzed the same data and found there was actually a very strong link between social media and depression, especially among girls, in that same data. It was very interesting. The same month that study came out, another research group in the U.K. used the same data set and found that three times as many heavy users of social media were depressed as non-users among girls. That’s not small. So then I and then another research group from Spain, who I have no connection to, later used the same, more sophisticated statistical technique that those authors did in the Nature Human Behavior paper, and we both independently came to the same conclusion, that first, there was some very strange methodological choices in that 2019 paper. And also, that if you zero in on social media, and if you zero in on girls, there are definitely significant and impactful differences. If — I know the 2018 “Psychiatric Quarterly” paper that you’re discussing. I reanalyzed that data for a paper recently — same thing. And it also turns out if you take that data and look at it in a more intuitive way, of — let’s just look at the percentage who are depressed at every level of social media use, it’s extremely common to find that pattern, that those who don’t use social media or use it only lightly compared to those who use it heavily, that there’s twice as many in the heavy use group, particularly among girls, who are depressed, compared to the light or no use group. So these papers that say, you know, oh, there’s nothing here often are just are looking at screen time overall. That 2019 paper included owning a computer. It also included watching TV, so they often don’t zero in on social media. They often don’t break down the data by boys versus girls. And they take correlations that translate to that doubling of depression and say, oh, that’s small. And I just don’t see how you could consider that small, to have twice as many who are depressed.  ezra klein  Tell me a bit more, actually, about that screen time question, because one thing you’ll hear in this conversation is we had a big moral panic about television. And it turns out that a lot of us grew up watching a lot of television, and many of us at least think we are fine. Maybe we are not.  jean twenge  I would argue that point, actually, but that may be a whole other discussion.  ezra klein  I sort of agree with you, that I think, actually, a bunch of the TV people were right about this, but tell me about that, because there is nevertheless, in the data as I understand it, a finding at this point that television does not seem to have the level of significant negative effects on mental health that social media does. But — so I’d first like to hear your point on, maybe we’re not fine because television messed with our brains. And then, I’d like to hear the difference between what you see in the data on using a screen for television and using it for social media.  jean twenge  So the impacts of television, is not quite as much for mental health, per se, as it is for things like the feeling of community, materialism, the amount people read, the national discourse and how tolerant it is of more complex arguments. These are all a lot of the things that we lost to television — social skills, I mean you can go on. Robert Putnam’s book “Bowling Alone” basically says, yes, it’s television, that’s why we don’t have all these community groups like we used to. But for mental health, for the moment, yes, if you spend a lot of time watching TV, you are more likely to be depressed. That is still true. It’s just that link is considerably smaller, so spending three hours watching TV is not as linked to depression as spending three hours on social media, for example.  ezra klein  So there’s an observation here, as you just mentioned, that how much people use is very highly correlated to what the effect of their use seems to be. But something you’ll hear about that is that maybe that goes the other way, maybe you watch a lot of TV because you’re depressed, because you don’t have other good options. Maybe you’re on social media all the time because you don’t have other friends. Maybe the causal arrow is going in the other direction, and particularly social media in this case, though TV in another era, and for some people even now, that you’re on there a lot because things are not going well for you already. It’s not that things are not going well for you because you’re on there a lot. How do you think about that?  jean twenge  So there’s two different questions here. So one is that overall pattern of, say, teen depression increasing so much after 2012. So there, it seems pretty clear that it’s technology leading to depression, rather than the other way around, because if it was depression causing technology use, you’d have to say this. You’d have to say, OK, teen depression started to increase for some completely unknown reason nobody’s been able to figure out yet. And that’s why teens started to buy smartphones and spend a lot of time on social media. Like, it just doesn’t work. So it seems pretty clear that at the generational level, we’re not getting reverse causation. Now, at the individual level, sure, that’s a more plausible explanation. But we have a good amount of experimental data now to suggest that at least some, and probably most of the causation is going from the technology use to depression. So a couple of examples, there’s been several studies that have asked people to either give up or cut back on their social media use. Those who gave up social media are happier and less depressed than those who continued their normal use. There’s also a really cool study that takes advantage of, basically, a natural experiment that Facebook rolled out at different times on different college campuses. And they documented that as a campus got Facebook, the mental health among the students on that campus started to suffer. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  So I want to look at some of the other broad theories, because you can buy the smartphone thesis broadly, and I do, and still wonder if there’s not other causal mechanisms happening here. One you will hear a lot is that we’re not seeing a mental health crisis. We’re seeing — let’s call it a reality crisis. One version of this is that teens today are upset and depressed and anxious because of economic prospects, because they’re coming-of-age in an era when capitalism is going awry, because they’re coming-of-age in an era of climate crisis, and wars, and Donald Trump. Tell me how you take that argument, that this is in some ways, a rational response to a declining reality.  jean twenge  So first, I think we have to take a step back and look at the broad picture. Is living right now, in 2023, really worse than it was, say, in March 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic? Is it really worse than, say, the millennials graduating from college during the Great Recession? Is it worse than 1992 or ‘93, during the height of the violent crime wave? Is it worse than in the ‘80s, when we thought Russia would drop the bomb tomorrow and the whole world would end? Is it worse than boomers getting drafted into Vietnam? A lot of people would say, well, when you think about it that way, no, it’s not. And then we can take the specific explanations — and I want to be clear. It is, I completely agree, important to consider these alternative explanations and see if they fit the data. So wars — well, if that were the case, wouldn’t you expect teen depression to have been the highest — well, especially, during World War II? No, it was lower by the measures we have then. And then more recently, then you’d expect teen depression to be the highest when we were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And instead, that’s when we had some of the lowest rates of depression and suicide among teens. Climate change — so one of the things that is in the Gen X chapter of “Generations” is the high school student surveys that ask about concern for the environment. Things like — government should change or ban products to help the environment, they should increase prices and taxes to help the environment, people are going to have to change their way of life to help the environment. So we have data on that between 1976 and 2021. And the peak of those attitudes was in the ‘90s, not recently. So that, I think, argues away from the idea that it would be worries around climate change. Plus, if it was climate change, what you would expect is that you’d see the biggest increases in depression among older adolescents and young adults, where these are issues that they’re talking about at school, they might be reading news. Instead, where we see the biggest increases is among 10 to 14-year-olds, so less likely to fall into that category of placing a lot of importance on issues that affect the nation and the world. All right, so that’s two of them. What were some of the others — economics, median incomes are at an all time highs, adjusted for inflation. The U.S. economy was on a tear between 2011 and 2019, and we see the biggest increase in teen depression. So most of these other things don’t fit the data all that well.  ezra klein  So if we look closer, though, at a kind of an individual issue here, you mentioned gun violence. And there — I think you’ve looked at data on school shooting incidents, times when a gun was brandished or fired on school property, those graphs really do begin to accelerate around your key data of 2012. And yeah, so smartphone use also rises then, but it’s when Sandy Hook happens. And I certainly remember Sandy Hook as a real, horrifyingly watershed moment in this. And you begin having more of these active shooter drills in elementary schools. So I mean Gen Z, kind of this generation that’s having a lot more safety focus and safety issues is coming-of-age routinely often drilling what will happen if somebody is there in their own school with a gun. So I could actually imagine maybe this ricocheting back and forth with social media as these issues are being picked up on smartphones and platforms, and becoming sort of more in the water. But it does feel to me like there is a different political dynamic that younger millennials and certainly Gen Z-ers are swimming in that might make politics more salient. And then, of course, a Trump era that might make politics more salient and fear more salient starting in the smartphone era, in a way that matches the data. I’m curious how you think about that interplay.  jean twenge  I think it’s really clear that it’s not school shootings, because if it were, then we wouldn’t see the increases in depression and self harm in countries where school shootings don’t exist, or are much, much less common than the horrific rate that we experience them in the United States. Yet, we do see that. We see the increases happening around 2012 around the world. So I think that does a pretty good job of ruling out that explanation. Plus, even though maybe if there was a turning point in 2012, well, school shootings were a really big deal in the late ‘90s, too, and teen mental health issues were improving at that time. So I think that also argues against that as an explanation.  ezra klein  While we’re on politics for a minute, one interesting wrinkle in the data here is that liberal teens are quite a bit more unhappy, have more mental health issues than conservative teens. In 2019 to 2021, liberal teens were nearly twice as likely to be depressed as conservative teens. You see this even swamping some of the gender data. So you see liberal boys being more depressed than conservative girls, if I remember this number correctly. So why are liberal teens less happy?  jean twenge  Well, that is a very, very interesting finding. So I dig into that in the book. And I think there’s a couple of possibilities. But the one that I ended up realizing fit the data the best, liberal teens spend more time on social media. And they have increasingly spent less time with each other, face to face. And there’s a bigger change among liberals in spending time with friends face to face. So back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, liberal teens actually spent more time with their friends, face to face, than conservative teens. And right around 2012, that flipped. So there’s a bigger decrease among the liberal girls, for example. So in the end, a good amount of that also is probably due to social media, because some of the other explanations don’t really fit quite as well — because you do still see an increase in depression among conservative teens. It’s just not as large as the increase among liberal teens. So some of the other explanations around politics don’t fit all that well. So here’s two things in that department. One is that if you look at the teens who say that they are interested in government and current affairs, so those are going to be people who are paying attention, you really don’t see a whole lot of difference based on those who are paying attention and those who aren’t. If you break it down by that, and by liberal versus conservative. The other piece is that you see the exact same pattern in loneliness. So loneliness isn’t really something you would expect to be that influenced by political ideology, per se, but it’s probably going to be influenced by how much time you spend with your friends versus on social media. And the pattern for loneliness and the pattern for depression look pretty much exactly the same if you look at it by gender and by political ideology, in terms of it increasing starting around 2010, 2011, and the increase being larger among liberals than among conservatives.  ezra klein  So why would liberal teens be more likely to use social media more than conservative teens? If liberal and conservative are basically picking up some other attribute leading to a disparate use of social media, what do you think is hiding in the correlation there?  jean twenge  Well, liberals, sometimes called progressives, are by definition more comfortable with social change. So liberal teens tend to have liberal parents, conservative teens tend to have conservative parents. Then — this is a guess, but perhaps liberal teens and their parents said, hey, social media, spending time online, that’s just what kids do now. And that’s cool. That’s just the change. That’s just what people do now. And conservative parents might have been more skeptical, and might have had more restrictions on their kids with social media. And that same thing could have interacted with the deface to face social interaction, because once teens start — as a group, anyway — start spending a lot more time online, then the norm shifts to doing that instead of getting together in person.  ezra klein  This gets to a set of broader ideas around parenting, which I associate not only, but substantially, with your co-author on some of this work, Jon Haidt, who’s made the point that we live in a parenting culture that’s increasingly oriented towards safety. And you’ve quite a lot of data about this in the new book, that parents today, much more so than parents a couple of decades ago, are trying to mow any obstacles out of their kids’ way. You have a great line where you talk about how it used to be the 13-year-old was a babysitter, and now a 13-year-old needs a babysitter. What do you see in both the data and the changes around parenting itself? How do you see that playing into this?  jean twenge  So I think it’s important in this case to start with the broader picture, that the theory that I really start with in the book is that technology is at the root of so much generational and cultural change, and that one of the outcomes of technology, because we have better medical care, is longer lives. When people live longer, you tend to get something that psychologists call the slow life strategy, that the entire developmental trajectory slows down from infancy to old age. Kids are less independent. Teenagers are less likely to get their driver’s license, to go out with their friends, to drink alcohol, to have sex, to have a paid job. Young adults take longer to get married and have kids and settle into a career. Middle aged people look and feel younger than their parents and grandparents did at the same age, so 60 is the new 50, this type of idea, because lives last longer, so that trajectory slows down. And that’s not all bad or all good. I mean, let’s focus on teens for a minute. Most parents are pretty thrilled that not as many teens are having sex or drinking alcohol. But it’s not all good, because if they also don’t go out of the house that much without their parents, don’t have a driver’s license, and never had a job, that transition to college or the workplace can be challenging. They just haven’t had as much experience with independence and decision making. So there’s trade offs. The slow strategy is not all good. It’s not all bad. It doesn’t mean kids are more responsible or less mature, it just means they’re taking longer to do these adult activities. But looking more at the edges, we can see some issues that if we have a shift in parenting that’s not just, OK, they’re going to take longer to grow up, but that’s in the mix — and we want to protect them from not just physical dangers, but experiences. Then, we’re starting to run into trouble. This is the observation that Jon Haidt and Lenore Skenazy have made with their organization, Let Grow, that parents who want to give their kids more experience with independence often run afoul of laws and norms that say, oh, a nine-year-old can’t walk a mile by themselves, or Lenore’s nine-year-old, she let take the subway in New York. Her kid loved it, and then she wrote about it and got all kinds of grief from people — that was dangerous, and so on. And this was a good 10, 15 years ago. So this is where you do run into trouble, when kids developing independence can be good and can be safe, but we have a parenting culture now that says you cannot let your kid out of your sight for one second. And that, I think many people have argued, and I would agree, takes things too far, and does a real disservice to children.  ezra klein  Well, there’s a weird disconnect here, between “you can’t let your kid out of your sight,” so there’s a lot less of independence out in the real world, but then this really expansive independence for fairly young kids, in the digital world, in part because it’s just harder over long periods of time to keep all the kind of parental blockers, and not let them be talking to their friends on Facebook Messenger or whatever. And so there is this distinction between the real world, which does have dangers — but I think it’s fair to say, in most of the data, they’re overstated in our culture, and the digital world, which the dangers are, if anything understated, it seems, for teens in our culture. But teens have a lot more freedom to traverse the digital world for hours and hours and hours a day with no supervision, while being out in the real world is much more heavily regulated.  jean twenge  I think that’s exactly right. And in my previous book, “iGen,” which is all about Gen Z, there’s one graph that I made which illustrates this. And again, it’s at the extremes — but that about 2011, the teen suicide rate exceeded the teen homicide rate for — it wasn’t the first time, but it was the first time it did it for years on end, where the two crossed. And that mirrors other trends that we see, that this generation is physically safer. They don’t get in car accidents as much, or fistfights as much, or drink alcohol as much. But perhaps because they are so unregulated in their time online, that’s why we have these record levels of depression and suicide and self-harm.  ezra klein  But there is something narratively weird about this. I mean, I grew up in the ‘90s and to some degree in the early aughts. And I remember the panics of that period, as I became a professional journalist in 2005. And I still remember that there was a lot of debate over teen pregnancy and abstinence only education and teen drug use. And there was a dumb panic over rainbow parties, which you can look it up if you’d like to know what those were, or what they were purported to be, at the very least. And we got all these numbers down. I mean, drug use is down, and age of sex is up, and teen pregnancy is down. And alcohol use is down, and smoking is down. And you would have thought, I think, from the discourse of the time, that that would have led to an overall improvement in teen well-being. And it seems like there’s been a very real “be careful what you wish for” here, that if you go back, I think, to the panics of the “why are the kids not all right” of 1999, a lot of that reversed. And now, the kids are in even worse shape. So what do you make of why so many things that we thought were a big problem for kids have gone down, and yet it turns out those were maybe correlates of things we actually wanted from them in the real world?  jean twenge  Yeah, and this is not at all to discount teen pregnancy and alcohol abuse and physical dangers — homicide, obviously — big problems, not that these are small —  ezra klein  Homicide is bad. Let’s put that on the table.  jean twenge  Yes. Let’s just make sure we’re being clear about this. These physical dangers are definitely bad, but they are correlates of teens getting together with each other in person. And yet, sometimes when teens get together with each other in person, trouble follows. That does happen. But the vast majority of the time when teens get together face to face, that’s good for mental health. They’re spending time together. They’re sharing about their experiences. They’re making sometimes lifelong friendships. At the very least, they’re having companionship through the journey of adolescence and high school, which is not always an easy time — usually is not an easy time. And trying to do that online is a pale shadow. It is not the same. And so yeah, we have a lot more kids that are at home not getting into these other types of teenage trouble. But that’s probably why they’re depressed, because they’re at home, in their bedrooms, on their phones, instead of being with each other in person.  ezra klein  I want to look at another theory here. So Derek Thompson had a piece in The Atlantic where he’s looking at a 2022 paper by Dirk Bethmann and Robert Rudolf that found, quote, higher standardized test scores and student assessments of academic competition were strongly correlated with teen anxiety. If you take two countries that are equivalent in almost every way, same G.D.P., inequality, life expectancy, air pollution, the nation with higher test scores and more student competition will have more anxious and depressed teens. What do you make of that?  jean twenge  Well, to really apply that principle to the stats in teen depression, we’d want to look at something that looked at academic pressure over time. And we can do that in these big surveys. So we can look at time spent on homework, for example. Did time spent on homework suddenly increase around 2012, right as teen depression started to increase, and did it keep increasing? In fact, the opposite is true. Eighth and 10th graders spend less time on homework in recent years, compared to previously. The pattern for eighth graders is particularly linear, and that’s the group where you see the biggest increases in depression and self harm. Other measures of academic pressure — so there’s a question on one of the big teen surveys, how much competition is there for grades at your school? That’s also gone down — goes up and down a little bit, it’s not as linear, but the overall pattern is teens are reporting less academic pressure in recent years. Then you could say, OK, well, let’s look at who’s doing the worst? And this is among individuals, instead of countries. So that’s one difference from that other study. So which group is most likely to be depressed? Is it the high achievers — say, those who have an A average and are planning to go straight to a four year college? Or is it those who do not have a stellar of a record and are not planning to go to a four year college? It’s the low achievers who have higher rates of depression, particularly the low achieving girls. So I think that theory falls apart pretty quickly, at least when you look at the U.S. data over time.  ezra klein  Well, let me try to steel-man at least the back half of that, because I take your point that a lot of things fall apart because they don’t explain the time series change. But they could be part of the background radiation of this, it could be good if you change them. It’s possible that what will reverse this is not exactly what caused it. So I don’t want to — I don’t want to hang literally everything on whether or not it explains 2012. And I think on the flip of that, you could imagine an explanation — and I’d be curious how you think about testing this or absorbing it — we’re in a world where there is a lot of competition, and where particularly post-2008 recession, and a much broader societal sense of economic insecurity and precarity, that yeah, if you’re a teenager who’s not doing great, that it’s actually getting scarier and scarier for you. And that to be in that position — and particularly to be in that position in a place where there’s a lot of pressure on it, right? You’re in a school that does send a lot of kids to four year colleges, to say nothing of really highly competitive ones, and you’re one of the kids not doing well, that the sense that you might just be screwed forever is going to be a lot heavier than it would have been at other times because the literal structure of the American economy is making it more likely now that if you don’t have a four year college education from a pretty good school, you’re at a much higher likelihood of being in real economic despair over time. I mean, it does feel to me when you look at the American economy overall that the sense of — of education is structuring your entire life — is reasonably going up, because it reasonably does, in fact, seem to structure a lot of your future earning potential. And so the fact that you’re not seeing the worst of the effect among the highest achieving kids would I think be natural there.  jean twenge  Yeah, and you can definitely see it that way. And there’s probably multiple confounding factors, too, that the kids who aren’t doing well could have a terrible life at home, not have any friends. That could also lead to depression. So there’s all kinds of possible things going on there. But the general idea is absolutely worth considering, and it is true. You look at median incomes of those who have a college degree, it’s considerably higher than those who don’t. I’m not as convinced, for a couple of reasons, that Gen Z teens are really feeling that, though. I saw a poll the other day. There’s been a decline in the number of young people who think a college education is completely necessary for doing well. That may be because of labor shortages out there right now. It could be because they see other potential opportunities in other types of careers. I also think it is really important to keep in mind what the reality is for college admissions, because I think there’s a really common perception that things are so impossibly competitive now. Well, you know what, that is true for the Ivy Leagues and Ivy adjacent schools. It’s a very small percentage of kids who are aiming to go to those schools. So if we’re talking about changes in averages, it’s not really a group that we’re going to want to focus on. What we’re going to want to focus on is the kids who maybe do OK in high school. Well, I can’t completely speak to other areas of the country, but where I live in California, the high school my daughter goes to — my oldest daughter — if you get a 2.5, you’re pretty much guaranteed admission to Cal State San Marcos, which is a perfectly good, even really good school to get your undergraduate degree. So if you get some mix of Bs and Cs, you can go there. And then let’s say you don’t, you can go to community college. There are opportunities. It’s not that it completely shuts off.  ezra klein  Is there any evidence of downward contagion here? So “Generations” has a lot of data on each of the different generations. And I’m curious if you’re seeing rises in — because I think there is some evidence of this — rises in anxiety and depression among Gen X-ers, among elder millennials — I’m an elder millennial, I have young kids now. I definitely think that I am part of the cultural dynamic where ideas and structures and frameworks of things like anxiety are more easily at hand. And I worry sometimes when I talk to my four-year-old that because I am practiced at recognizing something like anxiety in myself, I am, if anything, too practiced at offering it as an explanation to him, which will make it easier for him to grasp at. Is there any concern or evidence that something happening here is that the parents are in worse mental health or have more of these ideas or just have culturally been taught to be that much more responsive to kids’ feelings, and as such are beginning to create more contagion? And again, recognizing maybe that doesn’t explain the 2012 turn, but if you imagine that you could have a 2012 turn coming from smartphones and then different cultural dynamics amplifying it? If kids are getting a bit more depressed, and then parents who are more depressed are freaking out about their kid’s depression much more quickly and then embedding that idea of that story into them — like, you could see something like a feedback loop kicking off.  jean twenge  Or the alternative explanation would be if they’re more sensitive to it, they might be more likely to get their kids’ mental health treatment, and then the depression should be lower, because mental health treatment does usually work. So yeah, there is a generational story here to mental health, but it’s a little bit of a different one from what you’re telling. So when I first started looking at the data on, say — let’s just say clinical level depression, it was showing up for teens. It began to show up for young adults a couple of years after so 2013, 2014. You’re seeing it up to the age of about 25. For a while, it was not appearing among those ages 26 and over. Then it did. So after about 2015 or 2016, then you also start to see a rise in clinical level depression among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t really appear among those 35 and older, just basically not a whole lot going on in terms of rates of clinical level depression between 2005 and 2021. But there’s a pronounced increase among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t equal the increase among teens and young adults, but it’s still there, and it’s still very striking. This is in the millennial chapter of “Generations.” And this is a little bit of a mystery, because why would it be just these cohorts? Why are we seeing this primarily among those younger than 35? And in another data set, it’s more that we see it more among those 39 and younger. And why does it start to increase the most after 2015? So I go through a few explanations in the book. But when I posted some of this on Substack, I asked people for their ideas, because it’s very hard to figure out exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t look like it’s Trump’s election, because you see the same pattern in, for example, blue state of California versus the red state of Texas. And it happens right before he’s elected, not after. My pet theory was that millennials are disappointed by adulthood, given their childhood of optimism and confidence. And I think that may have some validity here. But if that were true, what you’d expect is pretty much all millennials — say, let’s take the first group born in the early ‘80s — that they would be depressed pretty much as soon as they hit 30. And that’s not really what happens. You see that much more with those born in the late ‘80s and especially the early ‘90s. So that made me think it had something more to do with what was happening in the overall culture around that time. And I think if you really look back on it, that was the time when social media and the culture at large really started to turn much more negative, and the negative news was getting more clicks, and it was spreading more. And misinformation was starting to gain hold. And it just wasn’t — I don’t know, I think if you look at, like, the kind of critical mass of pessimism in the country, the mid 2000s is where that seems to have begun. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  One set of solutions you often hear have to do with individual or even parental restraint around smartphone use, so grayscale your phone, or set limits on the screen time app or utility, or no phones after 7 p.m., that kind of thing. How do you think about that set of individual — either hacks or constraints — as an answer to this?  jean twenge  I’m of two minds about this. I think on the one hand, there are things individuals can do. On the other, it’d be even better if we had more regulation, particularly around social media. So there are things that we can at least try to do, so no phones in the bedroom overnight is my favorite one. And that’s not just for teens, it’s for adults too — tons of sleep lab studies, as we talked about, that you’re not going to sleep as well if that phone is in your bedroom. People have a tendency to, when they wake up in the middle of the night, look at it, and then that whole process starts over again with poor sleep. And many people’s protest to this is, yes, but I have to have my phone in my bedroom overnight because it’s my alarm clock. I have some advice for you. Buy an alarm clock. They’re cheap. You can buy two or three if you’re worried. Then there’s other things to say, but — so I have three kids. We have tried to delay the smartphone as long as possible and to delay social media even further. And I do think that is a good idea. If the kid really needs a phone, get him a flip phone. Get him a pared down smartphone, like a Gabb phone, where you can text, talk, and take pictures, and that’s it. There’s no ability to download social media or access the internet. So there are some things that we can try. The difficulty is parental permission isn’t needed to get a social media account. And kids are supposed to be 13, but age isn’t actually verified. School laptops have YouTube on them, at least ours do. So there’s only so much that individuals can do. Social media is extremely unregulated. And I think the time has come to regulate it more so we can have more of these solutions that are at a group level. So just as one example, if we raised the minimum age for social media to 16 and required age actually being verified and enforced that, social media would be out of middle schools. That’s already a time — developmentally, that’s very difficult, and social media makes it worse. And then kids would not be able to make the argument, which so often happens, but everybody I know has Snapchat, Mom. Then they wouldn’t.  ezra klein  So Republican Senator Josh Hawley has actually called for a ban on social media use for kids under 16. He cited your research, partially, in calling for that ban. It hasn’t gotten, I think, a ton of momentum, but your view is that’s actually worth it, that this is bad enough that we should just lock it out for kids under 16.  jean twenge  Yeah, I do think that. There are safer ways, better ways for kids 15 and under to communicate with each other than social media, which is not designed for children. It’s not even designed for teens. It’s designed for adults. Plus, then there’s the whole element of, why does social media exist? It exists because it makes money. We think it’s free. It’s free in terms of money. But us and our children are paying with our time. We’re paying with our attention, and might even be paying with our mental health.  ezra klein  We’ve also seen some interesting policies now in the United States. So Utah has been, I think, particularly aggressive here. In late March, Governor Spencer Cox, he’s a Republican there, he signed two bills. So when you put them together, Utah now requires parental consent before kids can sign up for sites like TikTok and Instagram. It prohibits kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., requires age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state, tries to prevent tech companies from attracting kids to their apps using addictive features. What did you think of that? And if you’re following it, how is implementation going on that?  jean twenge  Yeah, so I think these are the types of things we need to be doing, Just common sense solutions that — no, we don’t want to eliminate social media. It certainly has some benefits, particularly for adults. But there are some steps that we can take to try to make it safer for kids and teens.  ezra klein  I was genuinely struck when we began looking at who has proposed what here — Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana have sort of similar bills that they’re thinking about to Utah — and so, I should say for this point, does New Jersey. But it really is, I think it is fair to say at this moment, red states and Republican members of Congress who are willing to be — to use the old term, more paternalistic on this, which goes back, I think, a little bit to our conversation about parenting styles, where there’s possibly a tendency for conservative parents to be more willing to say, no, I have a rule here, and you are a kid, and you don’t get to decide. I’m sure you get a lot of incoming from politicians, from governors. I’m curious what differences in style, in kind of quantity of interest you’ve seen among Republicans and Democrats here.  jean twenge  Well, it’s interesting. At least in the Senate, it’s been pretty bipartisan. So Richard Blumenthal, say, he’s done a lot of work on this. There’s some other Democratic politicians who have done the same. For states, it’s true. It seems to have broken down that way more commonly than not. But I mean, how much do we have right now where there is bipartisan support? This is one of the few things that falls under that.  ezra klein  One thing you’re seeing in a bunch of states — California, where I’m from is one — is an approach that’s less about what I would call parental rights, or paternalism, and more about this idea of holding tech companies accountable, focusing on the collection and use of data, on privacy. How do you think about that?  jean twenge  I think it’s long overdue. We have to start thinking a lot more about this business model, where on social media, you’re the product. And your data is the product, and is that really how we want to be doing things? Plus, then there’s all the other issues of how is social media and the internet environment overall affecting politics? How is it affecting the national mood? We were discussing this pessimism which seems to be so pervasive now, which I think is fairly out of step with objective reality, and why is it so negative? It’s all of these things, that’s what gets traction on social media and online, about any kind of political discussion, regardless of any facts about positive things.  ezra klein  Are there other major policies you would want to put into place for mental health? And here, putting social media to the side, let’s say we banned it for everybody under 16, and kind of did everything else on the list that you would be interested in. What other things do you think we could do that would be good for teen mental health?  jean twenge  Well, I mean, that would be a huge step, and who knows if it’ll ever happen. But I have my hopes. I think that would make an enormous difference. You know, I think a lot of the other solutions are less straightforward. But if there are ways to combat the pervasive negativity that we’ve been discussing, I think that would make a big difference, too, because obviously, the mental health of young people is an enormous concern. But in doing further analysis for this new book, the other thing that started to really concern me was the extremely high levels of pessimism among young adults — not just about their own prospects, but about the world. It was really stunning to me. There was a poll that asked about — do you think America is a fair society or an unfair society? And the majority of young adults said unfair. And do we need to make fundamental changes to American government? Again, the majority of young adults said yes. And then there was a question, do you believe that the founders of the United States are better described as heroes or as villains? And four out of 10 Gen Z young adults said villains, and only 10 percent of boomers said villains.  ezra klein  This is a conversation I’ve had at different times with Jon Haidt. And something I sometimes hear in data like that is a way of thinking that, while harder for the individual to bear, may in some ways be better for a society. So to take the other side of that argument, I mean, American society isn’t fair. It’d be, I think, ridiculous to look at American society, with these levels of inequality, these levels of intergenerational racial dynamics, and call the society here fair. How you think of the founders, I think people can differ on that. And I probably wouldn’t call them villains. But I don’t know. I think you could say that there has been in America, like in a lot of countries, a pressure to sign on to various societal myths that make change more difficult, because if you have to agree that everything is good, then why change anything? And so maybe in the same way that trends that looked bad when I was a kid, like teen pregnancy, ended up having correlates that later on we sort of felt a little bit better about, like kids spending time together in person, I wonder if some of the pessimism that you’re talking about there doesn’t — in the more optimistic take — lead to a generation that, when it gets through the crucible of teenagerdom, is actually a little bit more open to changing or addressing pretty long entrenched inequalities that have been hard to change, you know, exactly in part because we’ve been pushed into the idea that to say something like America is not fair is to, in some way, insult America as opposed to observe something true about America.  jean twenge  First of all, that one item is probably a little less distressing than the others, the one about the fundamental changes. It depends on how you interpret that. I think this is the fork in the road. There’s arguably two ways that this could play out. So first, yes, we have a generation of young adults who want to change things. So if they do that by, relatively speaking, working within the system, we could have very positive outcomes here. And so far, there’s some signs of this. So Gen Z young adults are voting at a higher rate than millennials and Gen X-ers did at the same age. So if they are going to the voting booth and trying to change things to make it more fair, that can be a very positive outcome. Because yeah, if you see things as negative, then you take the steps to get things changed. Where I think a lot of people have more concern is if this ends up being more nihilism, just almost negativity for negativity’s sake, and there’s nothing we can do. And there’s some signs of that too, so — say, one of the big surveys of high school seniors has an item, ‘Every time I try to get ahead, something or somebody stops me.’ So that’s even more about individuals rather than politics. But the percentage who agree with that have gone up. So that’s an external locus of control. So whether you’re talking about individual prospects or politics, having that kind of defeatist attitude doesn’t tend to bode well. It is linked to all kinds of bad outcomes — poor performance at work and school being one example. And you can see that in the political arena, too. Everybody just throws up their hands, says, oh, nothing we can really do. It’s just the way it is. Things are just terrible and they’re getting worse. That may not be good.  ezra klein  But one thing I noticed there that I think is interesting, and I wonder if it points towards any other policies, is that when we started talking about social media, we talked a lot about time displacement more than negativity, right, that people aren’t seeing friends as much in person. Their social connections are weakening. They’re not sleeping as much. Sort of here at the end, we’re talking more about the stew of negativity. And I agree on the stew of negativity. I think it’s bad. But I’m curious on those other things. I mean, if we think those are powerful, it does feel to me like maybe there is more we can do on them. I don’t exactly know what it would be like, what a national program to help people sleep better would actually look like. But I wonder if you’re beginning to see this creep up the age scale if it doesn’t have some of the same effects. I mean, we’ve covered loneliness among adults on other episodes of the show. And that seems to be pretty bad. I mean, is that where you would begin to look?  jean twenge  Yes, depression is starting to creep up the age scale. So one thing I did in the book is look at time spent in person in a survey of adults, because I started looking at this in teens. And there has been a decline in in-person socializing among millennials, so in this case, looked at 27 to 41-year-olds. And there’s a little bit of a decline among those over the age of 50, for example, but not as much. So older generations, even though they also use social media, seem to have not cut back as much on their in-person socializing as young adults and teens have. So that might be one of the reasons why we’re not seeing as many increases in mental health issues among those ages 40 and over, or 50 and over, depending on the measure. But as an overall issue, yes, you know, loneliness is huge. So the surgeon general recently released a report on loneliness, with a number of solutions. And I think that would be a place to go, to start thinking about this. But it’s very difficult, because there’s not a whole lot of low hanging fruit, I think, in this area, in the way that there is around social media and teens. It’s a lot harder to solve loneliness in the society overall.  ezra klein  I think that’s a good place to end. So always our final question, what are three books that have influenced you, that you’d recommend to the audience?  jean twenge  All right, so my first two get to some of the issues that we’ve been talking about. They both have “problem” in their title. The first is “The Problem With Everything” by Meghan Daum, so I quote that a lot in “Generations.” She’s a Gen X-er like myself, and her observations about the changes in culture, particularly online culture, starting in the mid 2010s was very insightful and helped me codify some things that I had been noticing, in terms of the split between Gen X-ers and millennials. Particularly, the Gen X-ers pride themselves on being tough and resilient, and that is not as prized by later generations. Then, the second is called “What’s Our Problem” by Tim Urban. This is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in a very long time. It has a really amazing structure for understanding some of the polarization and division that we are really observing right now in American politics and culture. So — it has the really interesting rubric that’s not just right and left in politics, that there’s upper, in terms of talking about ideas, and lower, in terms of just kind of beating people over the head. That was a very fascinating way to think about the structure of American politics. And it goes much broader than that, into all the issues. So the third is for fun. It’s a fiction book called “Nine Ladies,” and it is “Pride and Prejudice” meets “Outlander.” And great plot and great consideration of what would happen if a 1987 born Elizabeth Bennet ended up in Mr. Darcy’s time, and then the author takes it from there.  ezra klein  Jean Twenge, your new book is called “Generations.” Thank you very much.  jean twenge  Thank you.

Get the latest Renfrewshire stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter  A Scots man who has turned his life around following two suicide attempts says he is now determined to help others overcome crippling mental health problems.  Martin Park from Paisley endured a 13-year battle with depression and anxiety before discovering the healing affects of Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).  The 46-year-old credits the personal development approach with giving him his life back and has recently trained to become an NLP practitioner in a bid to support others.  Martin, a carer at Kyle Court Care Home, has shared his story with the Express as part of his efforts to support other people in crisis this Mental Health Awareness Week. He told the Express: “This Mental Health Awareness Week I am really trying to get the message out there that things can get better, don’t suffer in silence.  “However bad things seem, there is help out there.”  (Image: Supplied)  Martin first began experiencing mental health problems in 2005 when his life crashed around him in a collision of despairing circumstances.  All within a short space of time he was made redundant, lost his beloved grandmother and was told he and his wife would not have biological children.  Struggling with the magnitude of the challenges in his life, he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  “My mental health went into major decline,” he said. “I bottled everything up inside. I didn’t speak to anyone, not even my wife knew how bad things had become.  “I had several suicide attempts and I always say that someone must have been looking over me as none of them were successful.  “I had stays in Leverndale Hospital. I was at my lowest point.” Receiving medical support, Martin started to recover and in 2009, he and his wife Christine adopted their eldest son Matty, with Taylor following in 2013.  Despite the absolute joy of welcoming new children to their family, Martin’s demons returned and his mental health plummeted for a second time.  (Image: Supplied)  However, a chance meeting with a fellow parent at his son’s football match proved to be Martin’s ultimate saviour as he introduced him to NLP.  “It was a miracle meeting Paul Elliott that day. After a few sessions with him I have never looked back,” he said. “NLP is like cognitive behavioural therapy but it focuses on the conscious and unconscious mind. The neuro element refers to the idea of thinking positively from the inside out – how you think about yourself and the world around you.  “The linguistics is about the language we use to talk about ourselves and others and the programming is how we align ourselves with the two.  “Some of the counselling I have had in the past didn’t really resonate with me but this just suited me so much better.”  The approach has had such a profound impact on Martin that he embarked on his own training to become a fully-qualified NLP practitioner and has completed a mental health first aid course.  In May 2022, he has used his new qualifications and lived experience to launch his own business, NLP with Parky.  (Image: Supplied)  He added: “I am trying to make a success of life by helping others and I think my lived experience of mental health puts me in good stead to help other people.  “Going from rock bottom to where I am today, it’s fantastic the journey I have been on.  “The moral of my story is that no matter how bad things seem, there is always hope and a light at the end of the tunnel and don’t be scared to reach out, someone is there to help.”  Running from May 15 to May 23, this year’s Mental Health Awareness Week aims to raise awareness of anxiety, what causes it and how to prevent it.

"suicide","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Cheyenne"", ""Wyoming"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:45:00","CHEYENNE, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - Jaidyn Cowley a junior at Wyoming Connection Academy has become an advocate for mental health after experiencing mental healht struggles herself.  Jaidyn recently delivered a suicide awareness speech at a veteran’s organization banquet after experiencing the death of a friend to suicide and connecting with Wyoming veterans to hear their perspectives on mental health. Through the banquet, Jayden raised $1500, which she in turn donated to Grace for 2 Brothers, an organization that supports both teenagers and veterans.  Her speech is as follows  “I thought the hardest parts of growing up would be learning to ride a bike, brushing my own teeth and doing my hair. Now as a 16 almost 17 years old I realize there is way more to it then my child self wants to hear. Suicide is a big part of being not only a teenager but also an adult. I have lost multiple people to suicide friends, family and others. As of a year ago I was struggling with depression, never getting out of bed and never taking care of myself, I lost a lot and didn’t know how to process it. I realized I needed help and I began therapy. It helped me immensely. As someone who has personally suffered through these thoughts and heartaches alone I would like to bring more awareness to the situation.  In 2022 the Veterans Administration released the National Veteran Suicide Prevention annual report and the data shown was around 6,000 or more veteran deaths by suicide per year. Veterans are 2 times more likely to die by suicide then non-veteran adults. Big factors of suicide can be financial problems, relationship problems, family, work or trauma. Men have a big stereotype when it comes to this subject. People assume that men can’t show feelings, they are big boys and can handle things themselves. Not saying that women don’t struggle with this too, but people expect women to show emotion and not men. Men need to know that you don’t have to be the big guy, you can have feelings and you can share them. You are not alone. Stress can play a big role in this too. Overworking and overthinking are stressful. Focusing on your mental health is exhausting enough but sometimes we still have to get out of bed and take care of the things that we have to do, like a job, kids or school. Mental health and physical health are big things to focus on, just because your body isn’t showing it doesn’t mean your mind isn’t thinking about it.  Did you know that 22 vets take their lives each day? Here’s an example the Wyoming National Guard gave me: Say your feelings are in an iceberg, what you can see on top may be baggy eyes from not sleeping, bad body language or bad hygiene. You don’t see what’s under the ice, under the ice there are all the feelings and emotions that are trapped and only you know what they are, only you can see them and feel them. Eventually, the ice will start to melt and more and more will begin to show.. Ever thought of tools to help or maybe even a battle buddy? A battle buddy can be there to prevent you when you most need it, say you’re having bad thoughts and you happen to have someone to call or someone to talk to so they can distract you. The longer your mind is taken away from the thought the more likely you are to not hurt yourself or others within that time period. Your mind gets different things to focus on and your brain moves to a different subject. Trauma, depression, and stress can be blind to you and especially to others.  Mission 22 provides support to veterans and their families. Mission 22 is a non-profit organization that involves outreach, events and programs for long-term healing, wealth and growth. Mission 22 helps veterans living with physical, mental and emotional trauma. The compact act will help with suicidal crisis, even if you are not within the VA. The VA will pay for therapy, transportation to a clinic or hospital or anything else within those needs. Go to the Mission 22 website or call one of the numbers I will give you in a minute!  I don’t want you guys to sit through the rest of this banquet and think to yourselves, “well why are you giving a speech about suicide awareness if we’re here for hunting?” Hunting with Hero’s gives people an amazing experience with safety, fun and laughter. All veterans matter and  hunting is a great way to learn new things, experience new things and do it with friends and family. Hunting with Heroes offers you opportunities no matter the situation you may be in.  There is always someone willing to help, and no one is ever alone. Someone in this world appreciates you and your life more than you know. Pay attention to the warning signs, and remember to always check on your friends or loved ones. If you or someone needs help call 1-800-273-8255 for the veterans crisis line. Call 988 for suicide and crisis lifeline. If you would like to talk to a veteran directly put a 1 in front of the 988 # and a veteran will assist you. You can call or text these numbers for help.  I want to give a big thank you to the Wyoming Primary Prevention workforce and the National Guard, the VA and my family and friends for helping me make all of this come together.”  Jaidyn let us know in an interview with her that her goals are to create spaces, platforms and voices for individuals who may be struggling. She is active on social media sharing content that inspires others. She also said she thinks its extremely important to treat everyone with love and respect because you don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors.  She plans to continue to help people long term the best that she can.  Copyright 2023 KGWN.

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Pilibhit"", ""UttarPradesh"", ""India""}","2023-05-19T22:08:45","A 44-YEAR-OLD Dalit farmer in Pilibhit district died by suicide on Tuesday night after the police allegedly refused to take action in a case related to the alleged abduction and rape of his 15-year-old daughter. The girl (15) was allegedly abducted on May 9 by three men and taken to a place where she was allegedly raped by one of them.  She had returned the next day, after her father submitted a complaint at the local police station, but no FIR was registered, the family has alleged.  Speaking to mediapersons after his father’s suicide, the farmer’s son told mediapersons, “Three-four youths kidnapped my sister, and they kept her for one night… We went to get a case registered, but the police didn’t take action. No one heard our pleas. We had submitted a complaint on May 9 night. My father killed himself on May 17.”  The latest complaint submitted by the girl’s brother says, “On May 9, three men abducted my sister. They took her to a relative’s house and locked her in a room and one of them raped her. A relative of the main accused then dropped her at our village and put pressure on us to not lodge a case. The accused also said that if we pursue the case, they will get us framed in a false case. On May 16, they even filed a false complaint against my father in which they claimed that the youth (main accused) had consumed poison. Troubled by this, my father killed himself on May 17. My father was forced to commit suicide by the four people.”  A total of four people — the three youths who allegedly abducted the girl — and a relative of the main accused have been named in the FIR. The case, lodged on Wednesday evening, against the four has been lodged under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape), 306 (abetment of suicide), 342 (wrongful confinement), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), and under relevant sections of the POCSO Act and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The accused belong to the OBC community.  Asked about allegations levelled by family members that the farmer died by suicide over “inaction” from police, Pilibhit Superintendent of Police Atul Sharma said, “We got information about a suicide on May 9. The local police reached the spot and conducted an investigation. It was found that a week or 10 days days ago, the man’s minor daughter had disappeared and the family had informed the local police. Within 24 hours, the girl and the youth she had gone with were brought to the police station by a relative of the girl. We have been informed that both sides reached a compromise. We have now been told that the two sides had an argument later. That may have been the reason the man ended his life. All reasons are being taken into consideration.”  He said that a complaint was submitted by the family after the suicide and a case has been lodged. “Regarding allegations that a case was not lodged earlier over the disappearance of the girl, I have told the Additional SP to investigate the issue, and he has been told to submit a report within 24 hours. Any officer found guilty of laxity… They will face strict action from me,” added Sharma.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2x1Y2tub3cvZGFsaXQtZmFybWVyLWRpZXMtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1raW4tYWxsZWdlLWluYWN0aW9uLWJ5LXBvbGljZS1pbi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcmFwZS04NjE5MTM5L9IBiwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2x1Y2tub3cvZGFsaXQtZmFybWVyLWRpZXMtYnktc3VpY2lkZS1raW4tYWxsZWdlLWluYWN0aW9uLWJ5LXBvbGljZS1pbi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcmFwZS04NjE5MTM5L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T11:19:42","MGNREGS & social protection schemes are the way out, paper notes  Climate change is making agriculture an extremely risky, potentially dangerous and loss-making endeavour for farmers, increasing their risk of death by suicide. Representative photo: iStock.  Farmer suicides were consistently higher in years with a rainfall deficit, a recent paper has found, establishing a clear link between climate change and suicides among India’s agricultural workforce.  The paper Urgent preventative action for climate-related suicides in rural India, published by the International Institute for Environment and Development in May 2023, analysed the association between how far rainfall deviated from normal levels and the number of farmers dying by suicide.  Climate change has increased the frequency and coverage of drought in India. In 2020-2022, nearly two-thirds of the country was drought-prone, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. Badly impacted states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which reported 62 per cent, 44 per cent and 76 per cent of land as drought-prone, respectively, also reported high suicide rates among farmers.  Also read: Nearly 600 farmer suicides in 8 months: Is Marathwada facing agri-distress  Researchers Ritu Bharadwaj, N Karthikeyan and Ira Deulgaonkar examined year-on-year data from Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana to understand the linkage. Data covering 2014-15 to 2020-21 showed a negative correlation for all five states — indicating that the suicide rate is consistently higher in years with a rainfall deficit.  For example, in a year when rainfall variation from normal was five per cent, the average number of farmers dying by suicide was 810. “Based on the predicted values of our regression modelling for a rainfall deficit of 25 per cent, the number of farmers dying by suicide in a year would increase to 1,188 individuals,” the document noted.  In states reporting the highest suicide rates, farmers are more heavily engaged in cotton cultivation, which requires significant investment in seed, pesticide and insecticide, forcing farmers to borrow money from formal and informal sources. If drought or erratic rainfall cause the cotton crop to fail, farmers cannot make repayments.  This dominance of cash crops has contributed to the agrarian crisis. It has been linked to an increased risk of suicide among small-scale farmers. In 2021 and 2022, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, hundreds of farmers died by suicide after a pest called thrips parvispinus destroyed their chilli crop.  The change in climatic conditions during the cropping season might be responsible for the spread of the pest, Union minister for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament in February.  Also read: Excessive July rains destroyed 800,000 hectares of crops in Maharashtra  Farmers are among the most at-risk groups in India for death by suicide, accounting for 15.08 per cent of the country’s recorded suicides in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. While an estimated 75.5 per cent of the world’s suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries, India alone accounts for 26.6 per cent of all instances globally. The suicide rate in rural areas is almost double that of urban areas in India.  “Climate change is making agriculture an extremely risky, potentially dangerous and loss-making endeavour for farmers, increasing their risk of death by suicide,” the document said. This is a serious matter of concern, as in 2022, India reported the highest number of suicides since records began, it added.  However, the research also demonstrated that social protection programmes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) could effectively limit climate vulnerability in economies that largely depend on agriculture or seasonal work. MGNREGS aims to provide 100 days of guaranteed employment to every rural household each year.  In states where MGNREGS provided employment, the rate of farmer suicides was reduced, data from the five states indicated. When the number of work days taken up from MGNREGS increases from 50 million-150 million, the number of farmers dying by suicide drops from 1,800 people per year to 398 people per year, the analysis showed.  Such negative correlations between the number of days and the number of deaths by suicide were found in — Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana.  “This could be because wage employment helps diversify livelihood options, allowing households to maintain their income and consumption even in a crisis,” the paper noted.  In addition, if planned properly, water conservation and land development assets created through the MGNREGS employment scheme can deliver long-term drought-proofing and give farmers a chance to practice less resource-intensive cropping options, it added.  The findings also pointed to four preventative actions that could support farmers in coping with common risk factors by improving local climate resilience and mental health services. First was that the governments should consider social protection as a core strategy to protect farmers from the risk factors that can lead to suicidal ideation and from climate events that can precipitate this state.  “Governments must have suicide prevention in mind when designing social protection policies, including comprehensive risk analyses, anticipatory support via early warning systems, pre-agreed allocation and releases of finances at specific trigger points and other measures,” the paper said.

Police said that Jayakrishna’s wife T Durga Bhavani (26) was at their native place in Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh when the incident happened.During preliminary probe, police found that Jayakrishna’s friend A Chinni alias Chinna (23), a gym trainer from Chandanagar , was having an affair with Durga Bhavani since 2018.“After Jayakrishna said that he wanted to shift the family to his native place, Durga hatched a plan with Chinna to eliminate her husband to continue their affair,” said Jagadgirigutta inspector K Kranthi Kumar.Police said Durga alerted Chinna when Jayakrishna reached the city. Meanwhile, an unsuspecting Jayakrishna also called Chinna for help as his father had gone to a relative’s house.“Chinna made Jayakrishna consume six beers in three hours. After a drunk Jayakrishna fell asleep, Chinna doused him in petrol and set him on fire,” the inspector said.When police questioned Chinna, he told them that he had left the flat as Jayakrishna was drunk. He also claimed that the victim had financial problems which might have made him take extreme step.However, when police verified CCTV footage near the victim’s house, they found Chinna buying a matchbox and petrol from a fuel pump. Police said that as the fuel pump staff refused to give him petrol in a bottle, Chinna filled petrol in his bike and later took it out into a bottle at an isolated area near Jayakrishna's house.Bhavani and Chinna were arrested on Thursday and sent in judicial remand.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC9ub3Qtc3VpY2lkZS1idXQtbXVyZGVyLWd5bS10cmFpbmVycy13aWZlLWxvdmVyLWFycmVzdGVkL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDM2ODkwOS5jbXPSAX9odHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC9ub3Qtc3VpY2lkZS1idXQtbXVyZGVyLWd5bS10cmFpbmVycy13aWZlLWxvdmVyLWFycmVzdGVkL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDAzNjg5MDkuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Thursday, Sneha Chaurasia (21) was shot dead outside the dining hall allegedly by her classmate Anuj Singh who died by suicide later. A senior police officer said the duo were in a relationship and Anuj was angry that Sneha ended it and was with someone else.  In a 23-minute video recorded purportedly before the incident, Anuj had said she had filed complaints against him with college authorities stating that he was harassing her. SHO of Dadri police station Sujit Kumar Upadhyay said the woman had sent an email to the university in March stating that Anuj was allegedly harassing her. The university had called the duo for a counselling session after which they allegedly seemed to have reconciled, he said.  Police said Sneha had not spoken about this to her parents.  Police said they are also probing how Anuj came to possess a country-made pistol — the murder weapon — and smuggled it inside the university. “There is serious negligence on the part of the varsity,” said a police officer.  Police said the university gave differing statements during the investigation. “They initially said it was a case of dog bite, and refused to cooperate with the probe at first,” the officer said.  However, the university spokesperson denied the allegations. “The victim was first spotted lying on the ground by some of the students. Since none of them knew what was happening, they didn’t realise that she had been shot. Within a few minutes, a doctor at the site (campus health centre) identified bullet wounds as the cause of injury. We had narrated this to the police clearly. At no point did the university authorities try to mislead or misinform any officials regarding the cause of the death,” he said.  Advertisement  Sneha was later taken to a private hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.  Asked why Anuj was not kept under the watch of authorities after he allegedly shot Sneha, the spokesperson said they got an email from him titled ‘Suicide Note’ at 1.20 pm. “On receiving the note, the administrative head immediately initiated a hostel-wide concerted effort to locate Anuj. All possible resources were mobilised and he was found lying unconscious within 10 minutes from the time of being first reported,” he said.  The spokesperson also said a high-profile committee has been formed to probe the incident and how the student got the gun and brought it to campus.

Michelle O'Neill, who was a 54-year-old domestic abuse support worker from Eltham, died by suicide on February 28, 2020.  HM Assistant Coroner Michael Spencer ruled that Oxleas NHS Trust's failures to provide Michelle with appropriate mental healthcare coordination played a significant role in her death.  The Coroner found a lack of long-term care planning and care coordination, leading Michelle to be ""passed from pillar to post"" within the Trust without any individual assuming responsibility for her well-being in the medium to long term.  Michelle had her first mental health crisis in March 2019 around a year before her death.  Various life circumstances, including allegations of domestic abuse against a former partner and the subsequent financial strain resulting from the abuse, as well as an ongoing investigation by the Metropolitan Police, took a severe toll on Michelle's mental well-being.  Despite these challenges, the Trust failed to implement a comprehensive long-term care plan or provide the appropriate therapeutic intervention necessary to support her through these difficult times.  Michelle's mental state deteriorated significantly, leading to her voluntary admission to the Millbrook Ward at Queen Mary's Hospital in May 2019.  She was discharged on June 14, 2019 and Michelle’s sister, Deborah, testified that the family had to constantly keep a watchful eye on her, but they were unable to keep her safe.  Over the subsequent four months, Michelle made multiple suicide attempts and as a result of one attempt, she was hospitalised for a month.  Despite the escalating severity of her mental health, Michelle was discharged from the ADAPT team, a community service intended to provide long-term therapy, on three occasions without ever receiving the necessary assessment or therapy.  Story continues  She was also discharged from other community services, including the Home Treatment Team and Greenwich Time To Talk counselling service, without the provision of counselling, psychologist visits, or medical assessments.  In January 2020, Michelle's general practitioner referred her back to the Primary Care Plus Team, expressing concerns that her current medications were insufficient to manage her symptoms – she was noted to be “very, very manic”.  Expert evidence presented during the inquest indicated that Michelle should have been provided with an urgent appointment and assessment at this point, and Michelle herself requested that her next appointment be brought forward.  However, the Trust postponed her appointment missing the opportunity to evaluate and mitigate Michelle's risk to herself.  Michelle's final disappearance occurred on February 16, 2020, when she went missing and travelled to Hove, where she made a suicide attempt.  Despite the Metropolitan Police notifying Oxleas of the incident and healthcare professionals classifying her as ""high risk pending further assessment,"" the urgent contact made by a nurse through voicemail was never retrieved.  The nurse, assuming Michelle was safe due to being with her family, made no further attempts to contact her.  On the morning of February 28, 2020, Michelle's body was discovered on Camber Beach.  The coroner described the service Michelle received from Oxleas NHS Trust in the year leading up to her death as ""disjointed and reactive” and said that ""proper long-term care coordination, with appropriate therapeutic intervention, would have made a difference to the outcome for Michelle.""  Michelle’s son Connar Higgins, her twin sister Janet O’Neill and her elder sister Deborah O’Neill, said: “Michelle had helped so many others throughout her life, but when she asked for help herself she was consistently denied any meaningful assistance, which added to her suffering.  “It has taken far too long to reach this point but we are rightfully glad that the Assistant Coroner has made critical findings against Oxleas NHS Trust.  “We urge anyone in a similar situation to seek legal advice and fight for justice. Thank you to our legal representatives for their help in obtaining justice for Michelle O'Neill, a wonderful mother, daughter, sister and friend.”  Have you got a story for us?

Hayley Chapman, Solicitor at Hodge Jones & Allen, said: “It is dismaying to see how a woman in Michelle’s position kept asking for help, but was repeatedly discharged without receiving any therapy, care coordination or proper recognition of the risk she posed to herself.  “It is right that the Coroner has recognised the seriousness of the Trust’s failures in Michelle’s case. “Michelle’s family have fought for three years to get to this point, and we hope that during this time lessons have been learned so that no other family has to suffer like they have.”  Hayley Chapman and Alice Hardy of Hodge Jones & Allen, legal representatives for Michelle O'Neill's family, were present throughout the inquest.  Kirsten Sjøvoll of Matrix Chambers represented the family's interests in the proceedings.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VsdGhhbS13b21hbi1kaWVkLXN1aWNpZGUtbGFjay0xMjIwNTU0NDQuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL25ld3MvZWx0aGFtLXdvbWFuLWRpZWQtc3VpY2lkZS1sYWNrLTEyMjA1NTQ0NC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A schoolteacher in Washington state has been arrested after he allegedly groomed a teenage student and intimidated her to the point where she considered dying by suicide.  Police say that Jesse Webb, a 44-year-old chemistry teacher at Kentlake High School in Kent, Washington, has been charged with communication with a minor for immoral purposes as a result of an inappropriate physical relationship with one of his 15-year-old students, Fox 13 Seattle reported .  Court documents allege that the interactions took place between October 1, 2022, and December 15, 2022, and that Webb started off by messaging the student on Instagram, telling her that he missed her and that she looked ""hot"" wearing certain outfits.  NEARLY 350 K-12 EDUCATORS ARRESTED ON CHILD SEX CRIMES IN 2022  The communication then progressed to Webb calling the now-16-year-old student ""babe"" and ""cupcake.""  Webb then told the student that he wanted to have sex with her, according to court documents, and the victim said that he would kiss her on the neck and hug her behind the school and tell her that he loved her.  Court documents accused Webb of ""grooming"" the teen and giving her gifts.  NEW YORK DANCE TEACHER ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES INVOLVING STUDENTS: POLICE  In November 2022, prosecutors say the student was so distraught about the relationship that she called the King County Crisis Line and said she was having suicidal thoughts. She disclosed to the dispatcher that she was being groomed by her teacher and that the stress had become too much.  The student said that Webb told her to deny any knowledge of the relationship if she were asked, and instructed her to tell investigators she was high on LSD and hallucinating when she called the crisis hotline.

She said talk of homicide rattled the normally quite community nestled among the trees at the base of Strawberry Hill.  The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Acorn she heard six-to-seven gunshots from a sidewalk leading to the tennis courts at the development in the 29600 block of Strawberry Hill Drive around 9:45 p.m. on the 12th.  At first thinking the gunshots might have been kids with firecrackers, the woman did nothing, but eventually came outside and peaked over a brick wall separating her home from the community walking path. She said saw a man lying on the ground with a wound to the head and a black handgun near his feet.  Lt. Daniel Vizcarra, an investigator for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau, earlier told The Acorn the matter was being classified only as a male death and could not rule out homicide. The investigator also said no weapon was found at the scene. The lieutenant would not say if suspects are being sought.  But the resident wants to reassure the community that, in her opinion, there is no a killer on the prowl.  “The people in the community are already shaken up about it,” she said. “I think the dialogue was focused in the wrong area.”  Asked why she believes the man died by suicide when there was more than one shot fired, she said victims will sometimes pull the trigger several times before finally accomplishing what they intend to to.  She did say she saw a vehicle parked near the community area shortly after the gunshots were fired, and said that later the vehicle was gone, leading her and law enforcement to believe there might have been foul play.  The L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner is continuing an investigation and hasn’t made a final ruling on the death.  Over half of all suicide deaths in the United States occur with a firearm, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports.  Multiple, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are rare. And in a small percentage of the suicide attempts in which one or more shots are fired, the result is not fatal, the organization said.

For 15 years, my husband, Howard “Howie” Liebengood, was proud to serve as a U.S. Capitol police officer. He was dedicated to his work, enjoyed his connections with the community and was fond of his co-workers.  I could not have asked for a more loving or attentive husband. Even after nine years of marriage, he would send me messages of affection and joy nearly every day.  Opinions in your inbox:Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns  Jan. 6 Capitol riot changed everything for my husband  All that came to an end following his shift on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Howie was assigned to exterior patrol for the Senate office buildings during the height of the violent protests at the U.S. Capitol.  When Howie came home that night after a 15-hour shift, he recounted an upsetting interaction with a protester he approached, thinking he needed assistance, only to be given a Nazi salute and shouted at in German. Howie was disgusted by the attack on an institution that meant so much to him, but this particular exchange, in the shadow of the Capitol, obviously bothered him.  Following his 15-hour shift, Howie got two hours of sleep before returning to work.  The next day, Jan. 7, after more than 11 hours into his shift, Howie’s police cruiser was involved in a collision that caused him to briefly lose consciousness. The required paperwork forced him to extend his shift to 15 hours, all while functioning on only two hours of sleep.  By Jan. 8, some of his colleagues noticed that he seemed tired and quieter than usual.  When he returned home on Jan. 9, after yet another 12-hour shift, he was distant. Normally ravenous after a shift, he barely touched his dinner.  He was scheduled to return the next day for another 12-hour shift, but he never made it. That night, he died by suicide using his service weapon.  Howie’s story isn’t unique. Law enforcement is a dangerous profession. Job-related stress, trauma, physical demands and long hours have real psychological consequences.  Policing mental health:Police can't handle mental health crises on their own. Reform is critical for public safety.  'Where has this training beenall my life?' How healing trauma could actually reform policing  Police face significantly higher risk of suicide  Police officers face a 54% greater risk of suicide than the general population. Last year, 180 officers took their own lives, nearly three times the number shot and killed in the line of duty.  Repeated studies by the Ruderman Family Foundation found that police officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in all line-of-duty causes combined. Nevertheless, police departments are reluctant to talk about officer suicides, and only a few of them have suicide-prevention programs.  While the stresses are relentless, cops are supposed to be “tough.” The perceived stigma surrounding mental health problems, and the fear of being labeled “unfit for duty,” keeps many officers from seeking help.  Howie’s was the first death claim made pursuant to the newly enacted Public Safety Officer Support Act, which finally recognizes that in many cases, like Howie’s, law enforcement suicides are indeed service-connected and should be seen as what they are – deaths in the line of duty.  My husband died defending democracy:My husband's suicide after Jan. 6 riots was a line-of-duty death. He deserves recognition.  Taking action after Jan. 6 deaths:As police memorial adds names, union urges inclusion of officers who died by suicide  The Labor Department's Federal Employees' Compensation Program also recognized Howie’s death as being work-related, the first such suicide-related claim approved. Earlier this year, the U.S. Capitol Police also officially recognized his death as being in the line of duty.  Nevertheless, the stigma surrounding police officer suicides is intractable – and dangerous.  Since 1984, for instance, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has honored the names of fallen officers, but the memorial still does not include the names of officers, like Howie, who died by suicide in the line of duty. It’s time to change the policy.  One of the pillars of the Memorial Fund is officer safety and wellness. We must ask whether this policy reflects the safety and wellness of those officers who fall victim to psychological stress.  The Memorial Fund is dedicated to honoring fallen officers and to making it safer for those who continue to serve. It is time the memorial honor those who served and sacrificed alone and in silence.

Though he knows the family of Alexander Bello-Ortiz is devastated, he says they're wrong that the Embry-Riddle student's death was anything but suicide. Bello-Ortiz was found dead in his off-campus home in September 2020. Police say he took his own life using a rifle. This past March, Bello-Ortiz's family, with attorneys, held a press conference at the police station, claiming the police investigation fell short, demanding justice. They believe the young student was murdered by someone known to him and that others helped cover it up. “I'm very confident that my people made the right decision and that the investigation was conducted thoroughly,” Young said. The family claims police disregarded evidence, including inconsistent statements and Ring doorbell audio from the scene that captured voices, sounds of a struggle, then a gunshot. After closing the case once, police did reopen it to look into that.“There's nothing incriminating on the audio or video,” Det. Dave Dinardi said. Dinardi with Det. Jayson Wallace worked the case twice now. They didn't find anything, even after sending the Ring doorbell captures out for enhancement.“We sent that off to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to their audio/video experts and the same thing,” Dinardi said. “I'm absolutely certain that we're closing this the proper way,” Wallace said. Police say there is no statute of limitations when it comes to a death investigation. They say should the family or attorneys for the family come to them with new information or evidence, they would certainly look at it, but they say what they've seen so far does not suggest homicide.“If we have any form of evidence that led us to believe that this was an actual homicide, we would not be closing this investigation,” Young said. WESH 2 reached out to the family and attorneys but have not heard back. The family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against those people they believe are responsible for Bello-Ortiz's death.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc2guY29tL2FydGljbGUvZGF5dG9uYS1iZWFjaC1zdHVkZW50LXN1aWNpZGUvNDM5MzQyMjLSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXNoLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9kYXl0b25hLWJlYWNoLXN0dWRlbnQtc3VpY2lkZS80MzkzNDIyMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T18:02:19","The content of this article may be triggering for some. Reader’s discretion is advised.  In the mid-1990s, model and actress Karen Duffy had a contract with Revlon, a spot on People magazine’s list of the most beautiful people in the world and a date with actor George Clooney to the Emmy Awards. She also had a persistent, piercing headache that prompted her to see her physician.  Duffy was diagnosed with sarcoidosis of the central nervous system, an inflammatory disease in which the immune system creates lesions. Since then, Duffy has had these lesions form on her brain, central nervous system and lungs. In her book on dealing with chronic pain (CP), she writes of how she initially hoped that treatment would bring her body and life back to normal. The pain, however, has been endless and something she has had to confront continuously.  Sadly, many CP patients do not feel they can live with their ongoing agony. According to a 2009 study in the journal Pain Medicine, CP patients have a higher rate of suicide compared with people who have short-term pain or those who are pain-free. Clinicians struggle to classify CP; some scientists say pain management has been overlooked for too long.  Chronic Pain Examples  Experts typically consider CP to be pain lasting more than three months, or past the expected healing time. There are two types — primary or secondary pain. Primary is when the pain is the main or only concern. Examples include migraines, lower back pain and irritable bowel syndrome.  Secondary is when the pain is the result of a disease or condition. CP can be post-surgical, cancer-related or due to conditions like temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ). Many CP sufferers do not fit neatly into one category, which can make treatment more challenging.  As many as 1 in 5 Americans live with CP. Back, hip, knee and foot pain are the most common sources of CP. Globally, as much as 30 percent of people have CP, with back and neck pain being the most commonly cited sources of pain.  Some CP sufferers turn to massage or physical therapy for relief. But for many people, the pain is unmanageable and interferes with their quality of life.  Read More: Redefining Suicide in the U.S.  Living With Chronic Pain  Researchers are learning more about what it means to live with CP. A 2015 literature review in The British Journal of Clinical Psychology found that CP is associated with depression, anxiety and anger. CP patients also feared pain that was specifically related to their condition.  In their daily lives, people with CP are more likely to miss work. Others struggle to sleep and then have to battle to make it through their workday. The constant pain and exhaustion make it difficult for some people to carry out simple daily tasks like carrying a laundry basket up a flight of stairs or sweeping the kitchen floor.  In this 2022 study, CP patients described themselves as living a life they no longer recognize. Their lives feel fragmented into who they were before and who they were after the pain set in. Once vibrant people find themselves fatigued after work and desperate to go to bed. Others describe how they can no longer work and feel depressed by their empty days. Many mourn their lost joys, like the physical activities they used to do.  ""So, everything — my whole life changed to just being able to walk and ride a bicycle for a little bit. That’s about it. So, all my other sports and activities are gone out the window,"" said one of the study participants.  CP also disrupts patients’ social lives. Pain or fatigue forces people to cancel plans or decline invitations. As a result, many CP patients have smaller social networks and have to cope with social isolation.  Many CP patients admit that, as a result of their struggles, they have considered completing suicide as a way to end their suffering.  Read More: Chronic Pain Makes You Think Differently  Chronic Pain and Suicidal Ideation  CP patients are about five times more likely than people with no pain or acute pain to have suicidal ideation (SI) — a desire to die. Some studies have found that between 15 to 23 percent of CP patients have attempted suicide.  Although researchers are still trying to understand SI and CP, there seems to be a pattern in the type and intensity of the pain. Back pain, for example, is more associated with an increased risk for suicide than other CP-like neuropathic pain.  Understanding Risk Factors  Researchers want to better understand risk factors so they can develop targeted interventions. Two major risk factors involve whether the patient is depressed and has a tendency to catastrophize (meaning they see their situation as severe and unfixable).  An increasing concern among clinicians is whether restrictions on opioid prescriptions will harm chronic pain patients who depend on pharmaceuticals for relief. A 2017 study in General Hospital Psychiatry found that abruptly stopping opioid prescriptions increased the risk for SI.  In late 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance that acknowledged many pain patients could take opioids safely. The Food and Drug Administration has also warned physicians that cutting a patient off from their prescription can cause severe withdrawal symptoms.  While some advocates argue that safe opioid use must be protected, others say that pain management needs to be better researched so that clinicians are better able to identify sources of pain and offer treatment options that provide patients with both relief and hope.

But what you might not know - is that every year - more and more construction workers are dying by suicide.  ""The construction industry is one of the top five industries for suicide-related deaths,"" said John Huggett the vice president of central operations for the Boldt Company.  According to the Center for Disease Control, suicide rates within the construction industry is four times higher than the national average.  ""They have hundreds of decisions that they make every day that put either themselves at risk or their fellow coworkers,"" said Huggett. ""All of these demands create a significant amount of pressure.""  That stark reality is what pushed the Boldt Company, a Wisconsin-based construction firm, to change the narrative.  ""We started realizing throughout our organization that many of our employees were really struggling with mental health,"" said Huggett.  In 2021 they partnered with the QPR Institute, a suicide awareness and prevention program that teaches people how to become gatekeepers that can recognize when someone is in a mental health crisis and get them help.  ""Just getting people to open up is half the battle,"" said Cade Fitzgerald, a construction worker for the company.  Fitzgerald, who's passionate about mental health help and knows firsthand how it can save lives, jumped at the opportunity to become a gatekeeper.  ""Just last week a foreman came up to me and he was concerned about one of his own workers. I met with that individual and we talked about what was going on,"" said Fitzgerald. ""When you get them to open up and talk about what's going on, it makes it easier to tackle the problems.""  Since launching the program, more than 100 employees have volunteered to become gatekeepers within the Boldt company, which the firm sees as a positive sign.  ""We utilize a sticker that goes on the employee's office door or on the hardhat and that sticker says it's okay to ask for help,"" said Huggett.  Getting them one step closer to achieving their goal of breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the industry  If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

"suicide","2019-05-04","23:30:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:01:06","The 31 year old Google software engineer who took his own life on May 4 by jumping from the 14th floor of the tech giant’s New York City HQ in Chelsea was described by one college friend as brilliant mind who graduated from Carnegie Mellon but was prone to deep and debilitating depression.  Police this week identified the suicide victim as Kevin Rawlings a senior engineer at Google. He was a computer science major with a degree from the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University who spent seven and a half years working for Google over three different employement stints.  College fraternity brother Jesse Salazar said Rawlings was an outgoing, fun loving guy until a close family member fell ill in Rawling’s junior year, sending him spiraling into deep depression.  “He had a 4.0 straight through until then,” said Salazar. “He stopped going to classes, started drinking heavily, and not coming out of his room.”  He said frat brothers had petitioned professors to at least let him try to pass the final exams and he said they managed to get him to study intensely for a few days before he took the exams. “He got above a 3.9--a 3.98 or 3.99,” Salazar recalled. “He was brilliant.” He said his friend went on to graduate with a near perfect 4.0 and seemed to have gotten over the paralyzing depression for awhile.  But in 2019, his older brother Robert passed away suddenly at the age of 34 and then COVID-19 hit.  Salazar also said he was difficult to keep in contact with him in recent years and he had not learned about his friend’s passing until contacted by this reporter.  ”We had wild, spontaneous fun in his college years,” recalled Salazar, “He was very outgoing.”  ”I don’t know what to think about what happened there,” said Salazar. “I do know one thing, it would have had nothing to do with the workload at Google. He eats problem solving for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Google was like his safe place if that makes any sense.”  Rawlings had worked at Google for three separate stretches and in his last most recent stretch was there from August 2022 until he took his own life around 11:30 pm on May 4, by jumping off the 14th floor of Google’s HQ in Chelsea on Eighth Ave and 15th Street.  Police had discovered Rawlings unconscious in the street outside Google’s Chelsea Headquarters after responding to numerous 911 calls. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Prior to returning to Google in August, 2022, he had worked at Hudson River Trading for a year from Feb. 2021 until Feb. 2022. Executives there did not return messages seeking comment. He had spent two earlier stints at Google, from Jan. 2020 until Jan. 2021 and a three year stretch from November 2013 until December 2016, sandwiched around a year spent working at Mountain View, CA-based Waymo, which was the self driving car division at Google which it eventually spun off.  During his college years, he had interned for three years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD and in 2008 created a tool for real-time 3D visualization and measurement of nanostructures. It earned him the Issac Newton Award for Outstanding Projects from the Washington Academy of Sciences, according to Rawlings Linked in page.  “Growing up in the suburbs of Maryland, Kevin excelled at sports, including baseball and swimming,” according to an obituary posted on Legacy.com by his family. “He was an enthusiastic runner and weight-lifter, always trying to outdo his personal best records. Kevin enjoyed playing Texas Hold’em with friends, and recently started playing pickleball and kickball.”  The obituary said he is survived by his parents, Mark and Barbara Rawlings of Lake Frederick, VA, his paternal grandmother, Norma Rawlings of Ellicott City, MD, his sister Jennifer Wernly (Mark) of Norfolk, VA, and his three nieces, Anna, Eleanor, and Kara.  “Kevin was a wonderful son, sibling, and Uncle, and we will forever miss him dearly,” the obituary stated. Plans for a remembrance service were still being formulated at the time of publication.  He was the second Google worker to take his own life in NYC this year although the two do not appear to be connected.  On Feb. 16th, the NYPD discovered 33 year old Jacob Pratt dead after apparently hanging himself in his Chelsea apartment on the corner of W. 26th St. and Sixth Ave.  Straus News has reached out to Google for comment, but had not heard back at the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cnRvd25ueS5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0taWRlbnRpZmllZC1yZW1lbWJlcmVkLWFzLWJyaWxsaWFudC1lbmdpbmVlci1YQTI1MzQxMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T04:26:19","New Research Examines Firearm Culture in Families of Youth Who Died by Firearm-Suicide  San Francisco — A new study, released today at the American Psychiatric Association’s Annual Meeting, examined perspectives on firearms among the families of youth who completed suicide by firearm, and found that in many cases, youth who died by gun-related suicide had been introduced to these weapons through culturally rooted familial traditions. The researchers also examined family members’ perspectives on suicide prevention interventions, including the State of Maryland’s Extreme Risk Protective Order Law, passed in 2018.  The study involved 2.5-hour semi-structured psychological autopsy interviews with the loved ones of nine youths, aged 17-21, who died from firearm-related suicide. Next of kin were approached by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to request consent for contact by the research team. Clinicians on the research team conducted interviews and a team of two researchers analyzed the interviews and identified and reached consensus on interview themes.  Most families had some degree of familial engagement with firearms. In more than two-thirds of the families, the youth used family-owned firearms when completing suicide. Over three-quarters of the youth had received mental health care prior to their deaths, with many receiving care in the weeks prior to their passing. In many cases, parents shared that they had not considered their family-owned firearms to be sources of danger. Several parents noted that if a clinician had expressed concern about firearm risk, they may have acted to reduce the risk. Several also shared that they would have considered using Maryland’s Extreme Risk Protective Order Law if it had existed at the time and they were made aware of it.  Suicide represents the second leading cause of death among youth, with half of those deaths involving firearms. This study furthers understanding of diverse culturally rooted familial firearm narratives and suggests that these narratives influence parents’ thinking about firearm risk, including when their children show warning signs of suicide. The authors conclude that “successful suicide prevention interventions must work to help families rescript firearms from tools seen as markers of familial cohesion and conveyors of intergenerational history to instruments that pose a threat to youth with suicide risk factors.” The findings are part of continuing efforts to interview the next-of-kin, family, and friends of youth who died by firearm suicide, with ongoing results and analysis anticipated.

"suicide","2023-03-14","Not Discerned","{""CityOfTheDalles"", ""Oregon"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T23:51:39","PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – In a case that has little-to-no precedent in Oregon, a local man was charged with manslaughter in Wasco County for allegedly assisting a woman to commit suicide in The Dalles.  According to the county district attorney, 29-year-old Alexandra Cagle died in March from carbon monoxide poisoning after Joseph Newman, 60, allegedly helped her buy a gas-powered water pump and showed her how to start it in a U-Haul pickup truck they had rented.  Not long before her death, the DA says Cagle sent Newman an article about an infamous case in Massachusetts where a teenager encouraged her boyfriend to use a generator in his truck to create carbon monoxide poisoning.  Katie Early, Cagle’s sister, told KOIN 6 News she suffered from bipolar disorder.  “It really makes me sick because I don’t understand how you can treat another human being that way,” Early said. “She had a diagnosed mental illness.”  Newman was charged with manslaughter in the second degree.  District Attorney Matt Ellis said he was originally hesitant to take the case to the grand jury, but eventually felt he “owed it to the victim’s family to at least put this in front of the grand jury and let them decide.”  The relationship between Cagle and Newman is unclear. Her family says she was in a relationship with another man who helped her try to overcome her mental health struggles. Cagle’s sister says she only knew Newman for three months or fewer, and she may have been staying at his house after they first met at bar.  Ellis said he looked for precedent cases, too, and didn’t see many cases since the ‘70s on the theory of manslaughter in the second degree.  “It’s one of those areas where…this person’s behavior is quite disturbing and abhorrent that – to be in this relationship with somebody who’s suicidal – to give them the means to do something like this,” Ellis said. “It’s a very gray area of our legal system.”  Newman was assigned court-appointed Defense Attorney Sean Pank, who said Newman spent 20 years in the Air Force and is otherwise a lifelong resident of The Dalles. Pank also touched on how unusual the case is, calling it a “novel theory as far as manslaughter in the second degree.”  According to the county district attorney, 29-year-old Alexandra Cagle died in March from carbon monoxide poisoning after Joseph Newman, 60, allegedly helped her buy a gas-powered water pump and showed her how to start it in a U-Haul pickup truck they had rented.  “I have really tried to set aside my expectations and my wants and put my trust and my faith in the judicial system,” Early said. “Alex has always been very eccentric. She was loving, she was over the top, just loved people. And when she loved you, you were in her circle. She gave all of herself to you.”  Stay with KOIN 6 as this story develops.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2luLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3JlYWxseS1tYWtlcy1tZS1zaWNrLW9yZWdvbi1tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW1hbnNsYXVnaHRlci1mb3ItYWxsZWdlZGx5LWFzc2lzdGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kcy1zdWljaWRlL9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2luLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3JlYWxseS1tYWtlcy1tZS1zaWNrLW9yZWdvbi1tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW1hbnNsYXVnaHRlci1mb3ItYWxsZWdlZGx5LWFzc2lzdGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kcy1zdWljaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-09-24","22:00:00","{""WestChester"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:00:00","    A Prayer Against Suicide  By Emma Danzey  ""Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.""- Luke 12:7  We sat there in the women's retreat for college students, and after doing an activity to reveal our struggles, many began to share vulnerably that they have dealt with suicidal thoughts. My heart sank. I did not know. Within each young woman's personal life stories, somewhere along the way, life got so difficult for them, so overwhelmingly depressing that they had the thought to end their precious lives. Suicide is glamorized in culture. When celebrities take their lives, it trends. When tv shows come out on Netflix about suicide as a viable option for teenagers, it popularizes the horrific act. Today, we will take the time to pray against this horrible decision and those it affects.  Let's Pray:  Jesus,  By Your strong hand and powerful arm, nothing is too hard for You. You tell us all that we are made in Your image. You say that You created us and called us very good. Today we cry out on behalf of humanity in a sin-filled world. God, we ask that You protect the minds of those who are dealing with thoughts of depression and suicide. Life is so valuable, and we only get one here. Help them see the beautiful plan through Jesus You have for their lives. Father, help them to know that their lives are worth living because You gave Your life for them to have hope. Remind them that You are their living hope and that nothing in all creation can separate them from Your love.  Lord, we pray against the enemy's attacks and ask that You surround those who love You with Your armor. For those who have not accepted You as Savior and who deal with suicidal thoughts, open their eyes to the truth of Your gospel. For those who have fought many years and are weary from the constant battle, renew their hope in You today. Remind them that this is the day You have made, and they can rejoice and be glad. Give them the ability to see past their sadness and hopelessness. Reveal Your strength and goodness in their lives. You say that we are all more valuable than the ravens and the lilies and how well you care for them. We pray that the joy of having You as their Savior will be greater than the trials and suffering they face.  God, we pray a special prayer for the loved ones of those who struggle. Will you please help them to know that you care for them too? Would you provide them with support from the church body? Give them grace for the day and confidence in You. Father, remind them they are not alone, and You see them. Help them not to carry this burden alone but to allow you to come in and give them your yoke because it is easy and light. Remind those with thoughts of fear and worry that You are the Good Shepherd. You tell us that we lack nothing. You make us lie down in green pastures; You lead us beside quiet waters; You refresh our souls. We claim this truth today. We pray those who have kept quiet in shame will be broken free from this and share their challenges. God, prevent the enemy from silencing them in their pain. We pray for healthy boundaries within relationships. We ask for Your Spirit-led wisdom. We pray for those who have already lost loved ones due to suicide. Give them comfort and a voice to make an impact to help others. God, thank You for making us all in Your perfect image. Thank You for giving us a purpose and different skill sets in this life. We pray against the trauma and the oppression which can cause such devastation. We thank You for giving victory and that even in our losses and loneliness, we can find great comfort in You and your Church. Amen.

"suicide","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Chico"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T11:06:13","CHICO — When someone you love is showing signs of suicide, it can be hard to find the right words to say.  For church congregations, the topic may be difficult to bring up and stigma may prevent any discussion at all.  But a workshop to address suicide in church congregations aims to make that change.  Chico Police Department Chaplain Eileen Brown will be hosting Soul Shop, a suicide prevention workshop 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, May 20 at the Center for Spiritual Living located at 14 Hillary Lane in Chico.  The workshop aims to teach church leaders, or anyone interested, on how churches can help prevent suicide, said Brown.  “It’s teaching them to look for that and merely coming up and saying, “How are you doing? What’s going on in your life? Do you need help right now? Can we talk?’” Brown said. “It’s as simple as that, but people are afraid to do that.”  Brown said the workshop is spiritually based and encourages congregations to look for signs of disconnect and of avoidance; people going through a divorce or other characteristics shown by someone possibly thinking about suicide.  The workshop will also cover a history of suicide, instances of suicide mentioned in the Bible and how to integrate suicide prevention into church life and ministry.  Brown is a minister for the Chico Center for Spiritual Living, served 16 years as a Chico police chaplain and has been called to assist families dealing with suicide in more than 15 instances — including after the suicide of a 15-year-old daughter and 90-year-old grandfather.  She draws on her own experience at 13 when she was first exposed to suicide of a person who was a family friend.  “I didn’t know what I was supposed to do with death; I barely understood it. I reflect back on that because people don’t know what to do when somebody takes their own life,” she said.  When suicide is brought up, Brown says, what often happens in churches is people don’t know how to reach out and may ignore issues because of that inability of knowing what to say.  “They don’t know what to say; they don’t know how to approach it. Typically what happens is people don’t say anything at all,” Brown said. “They won’t mention your spouse, your child, your parent — whoever it was that took their own life — they won’t mention that person ever again because they think it will be too painful for you.”  Brown said the stigma that prevents people from talking about suicide may be attributed to outdated cultural and religious beliefs.  She said there is very little training for ministers for suicide prevention and how to work with survivors of suicide — and her workshop is the only one of its kind between Sacramento and south Oregon.  While some churches may not know how to deal with suicide, Brown says congregations and churches have the ability to lift up a person dealing with suicide or with the death of a family member.

Congregations can do that. They can be the one that shows up at the door — ‘Come on let’s have a cup of coffee. It’s time to talk,’” Brown said. “‘Tell me about … share with me … and all we have to do is listen.”  Registration for the workshop is $10 and registration information can be found at bit.ly/3zyNApS or by calling 895-8395.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50LXdvcmtzaG9wLWFpbWVkLXRvLWVkdWNhdGUtY2h1cmNoLWNvbmdyZWdhdGlvbnPSAWZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljb2VyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3N1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudC13b3Jrc2hvcC1haW1lZC10by1lZHVjYXRlLWNodXJjaC1jb25ncmVnYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T04:56:23","May 19, 2023 Tweet  The Conversation: Thanks to easy access, guns help drive suicide  More than half of all firearm deaths in the United States in 2021 were attributable to suicide, according to February 2023 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Suicide deaths involving firearms — the most common means of suicide in the U.S. — have increased 28% since 2012. Groups particularly at risk include men and veterans, who are more likely to have access to and experience with firearms.  Research also suggests alcohol use is a significant risk factor for gun-related suicides, as opposed to suicides involving less lethal means. This is particularly true for youthful and middle-aged adults.  Access to firearms is a key risk factor for suicide, due to their lethality. Studies show that suicide attempts involving firearms prove successful 90% of the time.  Suicide is often an impulsive act, and when a person has access to swift and lethal means such as a firearm, there is limited opportunity to intervene or allow for a suicidal impulse to pass.  It is a common myth that once a person has made up their mind to die by suicide, it isn’t possible to prevent them from doing so. In fact, most individuals who survive an attempt do not attempt suicide again, and those who survive an initial attempt using one method are unlikely to switch to a different method.  These findings underscore the importance of restriction of access to firearms as a critical suicide prevention strategy.  Research indicates that storing a firearm safely reduces the risk of the owner — as well as others, including any children living in the home — dying by suicide.  Firearm safety measures include gun safes, lockboxes, storage separate from ammunition and either voluntarily or involuntarily removal of firearms from the home when a person displays a mental health condition or suicide warning signs.  Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted so-called red flag laws. These allow law enforcement, family members and sometimes school administrators or health care professionals to petition the court to remove a firearm from the home of a person at risk of harming themselves or others.  In addition to these measures, policymakers and care providers can address other risk factors for suicide as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy. This includes screening and identifying people who are at high risk, treating underlying mental health conditions, improving access to mental health care and encouraging stronger family and community connections.  Prevention priorities also include reducing risk factors such as exposure to violence, financial strain and chronic illness.  Another strategy is training friends, teachers, clergy, coaches and other community members in assessing suicide risk and referring individuals to resources. This has been shown to increase both the likelihood that a trained helper offers needed assistance, as well as the likelihood that the person who is suffering seeks help.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T01:08:53","SALT LAKE CITY – After the Utah murder-suicide involving a doctor and his 16-year-old son, the boy’s mother and advocates are calling for changes to the state’s family court system to prevent similar tragedies in the future.  Parth Gandhi, 49, killed his son Om before taking his own life on May 13, Salt Lake City police said. They have not released any information about a possible motive.  The boy’s mother had raised concerns about the safety of her son, court records show. She’d long sought primary custody of the boy in the family court case that began more than a decade earlier with the couple’s divorce.  She’d also advocated for change at Utah’s Capitol, urging lawmakers to follow Pennsylvania in passing reform to help keep children safe as custody disputes play out in the legal system, Danielle Pollak said. She is the policy manager at the National Family Violence Law Center at George Washington University.  “It’s so tragic that only months later, her child was murdered,” Pollack said. She helped Moses and other parents get in touch with Utah lawmakers about potential reforms. “He should have been safely with his mom, who was calling out for help and protection.”  The Pennsylvania measure, known as “Kayden’s law,” directs judges to consider domestic violence allegations in family court cases. It was named for a 7-year-old child killed by her father, who then took his own life. It also became the model for a 2022 federal law.  Utah state Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, said he spoke with Moses and others who urged him to sponsor a bill in the 2023 Legislature. He called the tragedy “heart-wrenching.”  The proposal wasn’t ready in time to advance, he said, but he’s planning to bring it back next year. It would require certain training for judges and commissioners on domestic violence, specify credentials for expert witnesses, and restrict the use of reunification therapy that’s sometimes ordered in custody battles.  Asked whether the changes could have prevented Om’s death, Weiler said, “If this had passed two or three years ago, then maybe it would have had more of an effect. But I will say this as well: As tragic as the situation is, it’s impossible for a court commissioner or a district court judge to predict the future.”  More training on the dynamics of the family in the home and the effects of trauma on children can only help, he added.  “Not all of our judges have experience with domestic violence or the same amount of training,” Weiler said. “We’ve appointed several judges who were corporate attorneys, so they never really dealt with these issues at all until the day after they took the bench, and, you know, that’s quite a jump.”  Colorado lawmakers passed a similar measure this week, sending it to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk. California was also considering the move, while a Montana proposal failed this year.  In pictures from a rally on Utah’s Capitol steps in February, Moses is seen holding a sign reading “Children’s rights are human rights.”  Now she says she doesn’t want other families to endure anything like hers has.  “My son Om’s death was preventable,” she said in a statement. “The family court system professionals ignored my pleas for help to keep my son safe.”  A spokesperson for Utah’s court system declined to comment.  At a December court hearing, Moses’ attorney had raised concerns about the safety of her son, who was in his father’s custody, according to audio recordings released to KSL through a public records request.  “Your honor, we would prefer to have a change in custody just to make sure that Om is safe and in an environment that is safe for him,” her attorney Alan Dunaway said in Salt Lake City’s 3rd District Court.  Commissioner Joanna Sagers temporarily ordered the boy to stay with his mother. She allowed him to return to his father after the boy’s guardian ad litem – an attorney appointed to represent the child’s best interest – said the evidence didn’t indicate a change in custody was needed.  Sagers noted in the hearing that a custody evaluation recommended the boy speak with Utah’s Division of Child and Family Services, as well as a therapist.  Parth Gandhi’s most recent attorney, Jessica Couser, told KSL the decade-long case involved capable players in Utah’s legal system before the family’s “immeasurable loss” last weekend.  “I was only involved in this case for a short time, but, as is common in many lengthy custody cases, there were many competent and experienced professionals involved with this family over the years,” Couser said, “all of whom worked toward the common goal of protecting the Gandhi children.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzU1MTkxMy9tdXJkZXItc3VpY2lkZS1zcGFya3MtY2FsbHMtZm9yLXJlZm9ybS10by11dGFocy1mYW1pbHktY291cnQtc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2018-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T01:47:00","Enrique Echeburúa (San Sebastian, Spain, 72 years old), Professor Emeritus of Clinical Psychology at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), says that when a suicide occurs, there are other victims beyond the deceased, and they do not receive adequate support. “The first thing [we need to do] is make it easier for the family that has lost a child, or the person who has lost their partner, to unburden them, to be able to talk about it,” he explains. “Silence is the worst thing, because many people don’t talk to them, even their social circle of neighbors and friends, because they don’t know how to approach [them], which leads to social isolation,” Echeburúa continues in a video call conversation.  The psychologist just published a book entitled Death by Suicide. In just over 150 pages, Echeburúa summarizes the fundamental aspects of a particularly human and painful phenomenon. “We have a very high cognitive capacity that can make us experience suffering and disappointments very intensely, and it makes us aware that we can put an end to our lives. People who attempt suicide want to stop suffering, not stop living,” he says. In the book, he presents suicide as a public health problem and explains it so we can better understand it and combat the stigma that has made it difficult to take adequate prevention measures and increased the suffering of survivors.  Question: Can suicide be addressed as if it were a disease?  Answer. Suicide is not a mental disorder like depression or addiction. In a high percentage—70% to 90%—of cases, there is an underlying mental disorder but there are 10% to 20%, who are people who may reach a point where they make an existential calculation, see that their life no longer makes sense, that they do not have a life project, and they feel isolated and experience a certain tiredness of living. These people may be influenced by external factors, such as a financial setback. At a given moment, shame or feeling socially ostracized can also lead them to an impulsive act of desperation, because death is seen as the only way to escape suffering.  Q. At the moment, there’s a lot of concern about suicides among young people and adolescents in particular. Has the situation worsened?  A. In Spain, most deaths by suicide do not occur in young people. The highest incidence is in adulthood, between 30 and 59 years of age, and a second peak occurs in those over 65 years of age, who may account for approximately 25 to 30% [of the cases]. Teenagers and young adults, between 15 and 30 years of age, may account for about 13%. [Suicide] is much less common than in the elderly, but we are much more sensitive to suicide by a young person. Another important issue is that, in Spain, the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents has decreased dramatically in recent years, and those deaths affected mostly young people. Now, suicide seems much more relevant as [a cause of] unnatural death in this [age] group.  Q. There is also more concern about mental disorders other than suicide among teenagers.  A. There are other phenomena [that are] linked to suicide but are not suicide, such as self-harm in adolescent girls and suicidal ideation. There are many people who have suicidal ideation that, if not treated properly, can eventually translate into a fatal suicide attempt. In Spain, since the pandemic, there has been a clear increase in the number of people with suicidal ideation and teenagers who self-harm. On the other hand, with respect to the number of deaths by suicide, there hasn’t been enough time for us to be able to draw conclusions. In principle, suicide is relatively stable numerically. The most relevant fact is not the increase, but the fact that the numbers have not decreased, when [deaths] have been reduced in other areas, such as traffic accidents, homicides and femicides. It is also true that there is a much greater sensitivity to this phenomenon now, which is clearly a positive thing, because it can lead us to invest more resources [in stopping it].  Q. Why hasn’t the number of deaths by suicide decreased?  A. There is a lack of understanding, and suicide prevention programs, which are [just] starting to develop now, have not been done in a meaningful way. The situation is much better than it was five years ago. Suicide prevention programs are included in [Spain’s] National Mental Health Strategy, which has made this problem a priority issue. [Spain’s] autonomous communities also have suicide prevention plans at the school level. We are training the police, firefighters and professionals in [matters related to] this type of behavior. These [initiatives] will likely yield results in the medium term.  Psychologist Enrique Echeburúa recently published the book 'Death by Suicide'. Javier Hernandez Juantegui  Q. Is there anything that could be done to prevent suicide that is not being done yet?  A. If we’re talking about adolescents, for example, much more needs to be done. Many teenagers are very sensitive to emotional upheaval, which is experienced far more intensely in adolescence than in adult life; serious disappointments—in romantic relationships, with parents, with friends, school performance, being bullied for being different—can lead them to attempt suicide in a fit of impulsivity. The family and the role of the school play a very important role for teenagers. In the family, parents may not detect the risk of suicide, but they may see that their child has depression, or an anxiety problem, or stops eating or becomes addicted to social media. These are risk factors, and it is a good idea to get those problems checked out, not necessarily [because of] suicide. In the most serious cases, you can also involve the school, or educational psychologists who may work at the school, or a primary care physician to refer [the teenager] to a mental health center. And there are also hotlines that have been set up by the government, the ANAR Foundation, the Hope Hotline, the hotline set up by the Ministry of Health. All of this makes it easier to deal with crisis situations and makes it less likely for a fatal suicide attempt to occur. Then, we must also realize that sometimes suicide occurs impulsively and there is no [unusual] behavior to detect. But… controlling access to drugs, places like high bridges and access to firearms [can help prevent it].  Q. And are there general suicide prevention measures for people of all ages?  A. Additional risk factors should be monitored, such as having a family member who died by suicide, having attempted suicide [before], being male, being over 60 years old, living alone or having a chronic or debilitating disease. We should pay attention to these risk factors in order to provide extra medical, psychological and social support. As we have said, it is also important to monitor serious mental disorders, depression, psychosis…alcoholism or an eating disorder.  From the educational point of view, both in a family and at school, it is important to create what we call protective factors—[ways] to make these people resilient in the face of disappointments, trials and tribulations or setbacks that they may experience in their lives. [Such strategies are] based on building self-esteem. For example: do not ridicule them if they are not at the head of the class. In general, it is a matter of ensuring that they have emotional stability, that they are taught to solve problems and to manage emotions and stressful situations, to foster social relationships, to share their sorrows and joys with the people around them. All of that is very important protection for a person.  Q. Can we improve our knowledge about suicide to better address it?  A. There is something that is not usually done…called a “psychological autopsy.” Essentially, it was created at the request of insurance companies to determine whether a person’s cause of death was an accident or a suicide, because sometimes insurance policies do not cover suicides. Therefore, they were interested in determining the cause of death. Then, they wanted to see which circumstances in each specific case could have led to that person’s loss of life. And this was a study that was carried out with the [help of the deceased person’s] relatives, with the people who had been around that person; [the study took place] a few months after the death, when people were ready to provide information. Thus, we wanted to know more about the variables that lead to suicide to establish better prevention programs. This [study] is not done systematically, because it is very complicated to do so, but it would shed light on how to conduct better prevention campaigns and more specific treatments for different age groups.

(WMTV) - A group of southwestern Wisconsin women organized Lancaster’s first ever suicide prevention and awareness walk/run to honor their family members who have passed away.  The first ever You Matter Mental Health Awareness 5K will be held in Lancaster at the Grant County Fairgrounds Saturday, May 20, 2023 at 8 a.m.  Two of the organizers lost children to suicide in 2021 and the other’s brother-in-law died by suicide 21 years ago.  Mothers Tammy Crary and Denise Janssen want to spare others the same pain they’re still going through, so they’ll make mental health resources available at the race.  Southwest Wisconsin mothers honor children who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Tammy Crary)  “There’s anger because she should still be here today, there is an incredible amount of sadness,” Crary of Bloomington said. “I came across this saying that said, ‘I never wanted to leave you, I just didn’t know how to stay.’ And that fits her to a t because I know she never wanted to leave me.”  Crary’s daughter Harmonie Kay took her own life in September of 2021.  Kay was 16-years-old and would’ve graduated high school on Friday.  Southwest Wisconsin mothers honor children who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Denise Janssen)  Lancaster mother Janssen helped organize the 5K to honor her 18-year-old son Braeden Bausch who took his own life in December of 2021.  “I will miss him forever,” Janssen said. “I never knew that he struggled with adoption and being given up by his biological parents. We didn’t talk about it. It’s not something that we ever talked.”  Janssen said support groups and counselors helped her try to understand why her son passed away.  Janssen hopes people feel comfortable speaking to one another about suicide and reducing the stigma that surrounds mental health.  “It’s something I don’t think people take seriously enough, it’s here and it’s not going away,” Janssen said. “Don’t be afraid to talk and communicate what you’re feeling.”  Southwest Wisconsin families honor brother who died by suicide with walk in Lancaster (Missy Sperle)  Missy Sperle helped organize the race to honor her brother-in-law Jason Kammer’s memory.  She said he died by suicide 21 years ago and that Saturday’s race will mean a lot to his children whose lives were forever changed.  There will be 15 to 20 resource tables at the 5K including NAMI, Wisconsin AFP, hospitals and drug prevention and rehabilitation organizations.  The race/walk costs $30 for anyone six years of age and older. Check-in is at 8 a.m. at the Grant County Fairgrounds in Lancaster. People have until midnight to register online at the You Matter Mental Health Awareness 5K website.  You can register in person at the doors at 8 a.m.  The money raised will go toward scholarship money for Grant County high school students and to the Braeden Bausch Foundation.

"suicide","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Williston"", ""NorthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T06:00:00","Farming can be one of the most stressful occupations in the nation. Each season of the year brings a different set of worries.  This spring provides a perfect example of the challenges faced by farmers and ranchers. Because of the large amount of snow during the winter along with how long it took to melt, farmers were late getting into the fields.  Farmers are at the mercy of nature, so they can only wait until fields are dry enough to work. The late start will only add to the stress as the summer progresses.  If it’s not a late start because of a long winter there’s always the threat of drought, of hail ruining crops, of disease or insects attacking. There’s also the increasing costs of seed, fertilizer and gas.  Farmers are independent operators who are dependent on many things out of their control. The amount of pressure on farmers is immense, making them susceptible to suicide. Many farmers are stoic and bottle up their feelings.  North Dakota ranks 14th for the highest suicide rates in the nation. And farmers are dying by suicide at a higher rate than any other occupational group, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  That doesn’t bode well for North Dakota, where agriculture is one of the pillars of the state’s economy along with energy and tourism.  Farming and ranching is a lifestyle as much as it is a profession. When faced with the threat of losing a farm or ranch it’s more than the loss of a job — it’s the loss of everything.  This past legislative session lawmakers passed House Bill 1390, which creates a suicide fatality review commission to study prevention and to develop resources for people in need. Those in agriculture who need mental health help can call 1-800-273-8255.  Minnesota and South Dakota have a program that provides suicide prevention training to clergy. The states are focusing on clergy because they have close ties to farmers. For many in rural America, the church is the keystone of their community.  Clergy have the trust of farmers and ranchers, and if they detect signs of potential suicide it’s likely those in need of help will be willing to discuss it with them.  Those in agriculture love the land and the outdoors, but the nature of the business means they often work alone, or with just a small number of others. Many farmers and ranchers are used to keeping things to themselves.  Bob Worth, a third-generation farmer in Lake Benton, Minnesota, summed it up this way for The Associated Press:  “You’d be surprised how many people are suffering with depression. Farmers have been a group of people who keep problems to themselves, proud and private.”  Hopefully, the state’s new review commission can find ways to prevent suicide. The public needs to be aware of the signs of depression and potential suicide. It’s a difficult issue to discuss, but often what’s important is to listen to someone’s difficulties.  North Dakota ranks too high in suicides and needs to make a priority out of reducing them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL2Jpc21hcmNrdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9lZGl0b3JpYWwvdHJpYnVuZS1lZGl0b3JpYWwtZm9jdXMtbmVlZGVkLW9uLXByZXZlbnRpbmctZmFybS1zdWljaWRlcy9hcnRpY2xlXzdmNWUwODQ4LWY2NTAtMTFlZC05YTg4LTZmYTdmYzdmMDU1YS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-05-05","Not Discerned","{""LakeBenton"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T06:34:22","(EDITOR’S NOTE: This story includes discussion of suicide. The national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.)  LAKE BENTON, Minn. (AP) — With traces of winter’s unusually heavy snow still lingering, farmers were out dawn to dusk in early May, planting corn and soybeans across southwestern Minnesota fields many have owned for generations.  The threat of losing beloved family farms is a growing worry, affecting many farmers’ mental health and raising concerns of another uptick in suicides like during the 1980s farm crisis. Much of the stress stems from being dependent on factors largely outside their control – from the increasingly unpredictable weather to growing costs of equipment to global market swings that can wipe out profits.  “You’d be surprised how many people are suffering with depression. Farmers have been a group of people who keep problems to themselves,” said Bob Worth, a third-generation crop farmer near the hamlet of Lake Benton, who credits his wife with saving his life during a bout with depression in the 1980s. “The more you talk about this, the more you realize it can be fixed.”  States such as Minnesota and South Dakota are offering suicide prevention training to clergy – a crucial, trusted presence in rural America.  In Pipestone, the bigger town down the dirt road from Worth’s farm – with 4,200 residents and a dozen churches – pastors from three Lutheran parishes are taking the four-week suicide prevention program that Minnesota’s departments of agriculture and health launched this spring.  “I want to learn to help. This could be anybody,” said the Rev. Robert Moeller, recalling his first realization of the scourge of suicide among farmers, when a customer in the feed business he once worked at killed himself.  While rising levels of stress and anxiety are affecting Americans from students to service members, the dynamics are different in the farmland, where churches remain essential social gathering points.  “Every farm family I know has a relationship with a house of worship,” said Meg Moynihan, a dairy farmer in southern Minnesota who works on clergy-focused training programs as a senior advisor to the state’s agriculture  department.  The evident satisfaction that farmers take in growing crops and raising livestock to feed the country makes the fear of being unable to keep going a key factor in mental health distress.  “There’s a sense of threat to one’s identity and generational legacy across time,” said Sean Brotherson, professor and extension family science specialist at North Dakota State University. “People treat the farm as a member of the family – and the longest-living member of the family.”  Under financial pressure, Keith and Theresia Gillie started talking about finding jobs away from his homestead in northwestern Minnesota.  “I never realized that in the midst of us quitting farming, that was his identity,” said Gillie, who found her husband of more than 30 years dead on a gravel road.  Male agricultural workers’ suicide rates are more than two times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are several issues that play a role, including increased isolation and exacerbated family tensions during the pandemic, the difficulty in rural communities to find in-person mental health counseling or to access broadband for tele-health, as well as the disruptions brought by climate change-driven unpredictable weather patterns, inflation and international trade disputes.  As the average age for farmers inches toward 60, the pressure of passing on a life-defining legacy to new generations is a growing problem, said Monica McConkey, a rural mental health specialist contracted by Minnesota’s agriculture department.  Driving his tractor and planter, some $750,000 in machinery, outside Flandreau, South Dakota, Todd Sanderson, 61, said he hopes a nephew will take over eventually.  “That’s what’s keeping me up at night, the transition,” he said. “The more I get stressed, the more I get quiet.”  Breaking farmers out of that proud reserve is a big challenge even for clergy, said the Rev. Alan Blankenfeld, the rural ministry liaison for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America’s South Dakota synod.  “They’ll share on their terms. Our place is not counseling, but we can walk with them,” he added.  Back in Pipestone, the Rev. Ann Zastrow of First Lutheran Church, who’s taking Minnesota’s online prevention course, plans to remind those struggling with mental health that “God is still in the picture.”  In many farm families, faith and struggle have long coexisted. First Lutheran’s council president, who raises lambs from 500 ewes outside town, said he still remembers when his mother asked him to take guns out of the house because she was worried about his father.  “I remember the look on (my father’s) face when they sold his cows,” Craig Thies said as newborn lambs tottered around him. “Realistically, they’re like your children. But somebody is eating tonight because of you.”  Seeing themselves as part of a crucial creation plan cements farmers’ faith, which in turn makes the clergy potential lifesavers when given the right tools.  “One place we struggle within the church is if we treat suicide as shameful, then they won’t share they’re not okay,” said the Rev. Kelly Ahola, a Lutheran pastor in the Red River Valley between Minnesota and North Dakota.  For one of 80 clergy taking the spring training course, the Rev. Jillene Gallatin, the call to prevention is excruciatingly personal. It was her pastor who drove her to the hospital when, at 15, she tried to kill herself a year after her mother took her own life. And it was in her church that she met comfort instead of the deafening silence and averted eyes elsewhere in her community.  “That’s a gift we can bring as church, being a safe spot,” Gallatin said in the sanctuary of Grace Lutheran Church in Waseca, about an hour south of Minneapolis.  Later that spring day, she visited a church member’s dairy farm that’s been in the family since the 1870s.  There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when the relatives discussed the option of stopping the milking operation, Jason Eldeen recalled.  But they persevered, which makes them among the 1.3% of U.S. workers with direct on-farm employment, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2023 data.  “How lucky we are that we get to farm,” he said, as some of the cows reached out to lick his and Gallatin’s hands in the spring sunshine.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbGlnaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvc2F2aW5nLXRoZS1mYXJtZXItaGVhcnRsYW5kLWNsZXJneS10cmFpbi10by1wcmV2ZW50LWFncmljdWx0dXJlLXdvcmtlcnMtc3VpY2lkZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""Tupelo"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:28:05","Farmers stress over the uncertainty in weather, commodity prices, finances, and more. These are all factors that can elevate the risk of suicide.  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) article published in 2020, Suicide Rates by Industry and Occupation — National Violent Death Reporting System, 32 States, 2016, reports the suicide rate among males who work in farming and ranching was 43.2 per 100,000 among farmers and ranchers in 2016, compared to 27.4 per 100,000 among male working aged adults across all occupations.  Suicide rates among working-age people (ages 16–64) have increased by 40 percent over the last two decades, according to the CDC. Farming has the ninth-highest suicide rate among all major industries included in National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) data linking suicides with occupation. Medical doctors, dentists, and police officers top this list.  Experts say there are two main occupational factors that increase a person’s risk of suicide: job factors (like job stress, low job security, low pay), and increased access to lethal means (like medication and firearms).  James Barham, director of counseling at Living Well Professional Counseling says depression and anxiety are certainly the main diagnoses that we see in rural Mississippi Delta farming communities, but also throughout our state.  To combat this silent crisis, Barham uses the acronym F.A.R.M.:  F: Faith, family, and friends  A: Adjustments  R: Rythm  M: Mending your fences  Saying this helps take care of relationships so that you are not putting things off emotionally. Barham likewise advises farmers and others struggling with their mental health to not allow their anger to carry into tomorrow and to make sure to take care of the “homefront” — and what matters most.  If you, or someone you know, is considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 .  We can all help prevent suicide.

Both were B.A.(Sociology) students, in their final year. (Screengrab/CCTV)  Listen to this article Your browser does not support the audio element.  A 21-year-old student of Shiv Nadar University was shot dead, allegedly by her classmate who later shot himself, inside the university campus in Greater Noida on Thursday afternoon, police said.  The woman has been identified as Sneha Chaurasiya, and the man as Anuj Singh. Both were B.A.(Sociology) students, in their final year. While Sneha was from Kanpur, Anuj’s family lives in Amroha.  Police said they received a call from the university at 1.30-2 pm about a firing incident. “We received information that a student, named Anuj, had fired at his classmate outside the dining hall on the campus,” said a senior police officer.  According to police, after shooting Sneha, Anuj went to his hostel room and shot himself. A country-made pistol was reportedly recovered from his room. Police said they were still investigating the source of the weapon.  Late at night, police said that Anuj purportedly sent a video clip to the university authorities at around 1.20 pm, in which he said that he was in a relationship with Sneha but they were no longer together. In the 22-minute video, he said he was “broken inside” and “could not trust anyone”. He also said that he had been “diagnosed with third stage brain cancer” but had not told his parents. He spoke about punishing the woman and sought the forgiveness of his and her parents.  Police have recovered CCTV footage which shows the two students talking outside the dining hall. Anuj is seen holding a bag, from which he later pulls out a pistol and fires at Sneha. She tries to resist but is shot again and collapses. Police said Sneha was shot at least twice – in the chest and abdomen – and died on the spot.  “They were friends, students often saw them talking to each other. The two first had a conversation, and the accused later pulled out a pistol and fired at the woman,” said the officer, adding that the woman was taken to a private hospital, where she was declared dead.

We are questioning their classmates and teachers,” said DCP (Greater Noida) Saad Miya Khan.  While the college is shut for summer break, some students have reportedly stayed back for the convocation. “The convocation is scheduled to be held on May 26. Many students who will graduate this year have stayed back. The two students had met outside the hostel dining hall, which was shut, on Thursday afternoon. No one else was in the vicinity at the time. The police have recovered the CCTV footage and are analysing it,” said a university official.  He added that students are not frisked when entering the university.

The matter is currently under investigation by the authorities, and we are closely monitoring the situation. All other residents of the campus are safe. Our utmost priority is the safety and well-being of our students, employees, and the entire community. We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation. Our deep and heartfelt condolences go out to the affected families and we are supporting them in every way possible at this difficult time.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvZGVsaGkvc3R1ZGVudC1raWxscy1jbGFzc21hdGUtZ3JlYXRlci1ub2lkYS1jb2xsZWdlLXN1aWNpZGUtODYxNjg4Ny9saXRlL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvZGVsaGkvc3R1ZGVudC1raWxscy1jbGFzc21hdGUtZ3JlYXRlci1ub2lkYS1jb2xsZWdlLXN1aWNpZGUtODYxNjg4Ny9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-08-10","Not Discerned","{""Mayflower"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:09:07","While it’s bad enough the debunked dossier the FBI used to spy on the Trump campaign was paid for by the Clinton campaign and authored by a foreign FBI informant and his carousing researcher, the newly released report of Special Counsel John Durham strongly suggests a top Justice Department official and his wife had an early hand in shaping the political rumor sheet. According to the 306-page report, former Justice Department prosecutor Bruce Ohr’s wife Nellie Ohr first plowed the ground for the dossier with a series of research reports she wrote for Fusion GPS, the D.C.-based opposition research firm the Clinton campaign commissioned to dig up dirt on Trump and Russia. Obtained by Durham, her reports zeroed in on Sergei Millian and his connections to Russia and Trump, falsely portraying him as a key intermediary between the Kremlin and the Republican candidate. They would later provide the foundation for the dossier’s many fictions. ""Fusion GPS records demonstrate that Nellie Ohr first identified Millian,” Durham states in his report. ""All told, Ohr prepared at least 12 reports that discussed Sergei Millian."" She wrote her first Millian report in April 2016, the month before Fusion GPS hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to put his imprimatur as a supposed former “spy” and ""Russian insider"" on the dossier. ""This report was prepared just ten days after Fusion GPS was retained by [Clinton campaign law firm] Perkins Coie to conduct opposition research on Trump,” the Durham Report states, ""and prior to Steele being retained by Fusion GPS."" Durham suggests Nellie Ohr planted the seeds of sourcing for the most explosive allegations leveled by the dossier against Trump, including the oft-cited notion that he and his campaign were engaged in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin. The dossier attributed this, falsely, to Millian. Durham found that the Belarusian-American realtor was never a source for the dossier and was simply invented as one, along with the allegations attributed to him. In fact, Durham says that Millian initially wasn’t even on the radar of Steele and his dossier “collector"" Igor Danchenko, a former Brookings Institution analyst who's admitted much of the information he provided Steele was alcohol-lubricated gossip. Millian was called to their attention by Nellie Ohr, who the prosecutor said “implicated"" Millian through her own reports. Durham suggests Steele and Danchenko merely followed her leads. Meanwhile, the prosecutor added, Bruce Ohr, an anti-Trump Democrat, pushed his wife’s reports that cited Millian — 12 in all — onto the Crossfire Hurricane team at FBI headquarters that was investigating Trump and his campaign for possible espionage. Agents used her reports as a source of corroboration for the Steele reports they received in the summer and fall of 2016, even though it was circular reporting. ""The reports prepared by Ohr and others at Fusion GPS were ultimately provided to Crossfire Hurricane investigators by Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr,” according to the Durham Report. Durham notes that Danchenko was tracking leads on Millian from Nellie Ohr within “approximately one week” of Fusion GPS retaining Steele to compile the dossier. He concludes that this “strongly supports the inference that Fusion GPS directed Steele to pursue Millian.” In other words, Steele was not the catalyst behind the dossier’s central claims. Rather, it was Clinton's contractor Fusion GPS -- but more specifically, the wife of a senior DOJ official who worked for Fusion. So the FBI wasn’t really investigating ""Crown reporting,” as officials referred to Steele’s dossier, implying it was British intelligence. More accurately, it was investigating information from inside its own department that was laundered through Steele and his dossier. On page 97 of their book, ""Crime in Progress,"" Fusion GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch maintained that it was Steele who identified Millian as ""one of the key intermediaries between Trump and the Russians.” Durham’s report shatters their claim. The special counsel also found that Simpson worked with Bruce Ohr to pressure the FBI to investigate the dossier allegations. On Aug. 22, 2016, Simpson asked Ohr to call him. About an hour later, Ohr emailed the FBI agent handling Steele as an informant to, as he said, ""check in.” Ohr and the agent, Michael Gaeta, spoke over the phone on Aug. 24. During their call, Ohr inquired if the FBI was going to do anything with the dossier reports that Steele had passed along to Gaeta in July. In response, Gaeta “told Ohr that a group at FBI headquarters was working on them,” according to the Durham report. This undercuts the official FBI timeline of when HQ first received the dossier. For years, the bureau has insisted it did not receive the reports until a month later — Sept. 19, 2016. The Ohrs also appear to have directly influenced the dossier and the FBI’s investigation. Both Bruce and Nellie Ohr, who previously worked for the CIA, met with Steele in Washington at a critical time. Emails reveal that on July 30, 2016 -- the day before the FBI formally opened its overarching case against Trump, codenamed “Crossfire Hurricane"" -- the couple sat down with Steele and an unidentified “associate” of his at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C. to compare notes — Nellie and Steele literally passed pieces of papers back and forth — regarding their research into “suspicions that Russian government figures were supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump.” After their breakfast, Bruce Ohr reportedly contacted then-deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe to relay their concerns. Fusion GPS also pitched the press the false narrative that Millian was a key intermediary between Trump and Russia. For example, on June 27, 2016, Fritsch sent an email to Franklin Foer, a reporter at Slate magazine, stating ""this dude is key” and claiming ""he is clearly kgb.” The next month, Simpson reached out to ABC News producer Matthew Mosk about Millian. Mosk emailed Simpson and reported back that he was ""making arrangements to interview Millian on camera"" and that he and Simpson ""should chat."" On July 29, 2016, Millian ultimately was interviewed by Brian Ross, formerly of ABC News, who asked Millian whether he was a Russian spy. On Sept. 13, 2016, Mosk emailed Simpson and asked, ""What's the most official thing we have showing Millian tied to Trump? That would make it hard for the Trump org to disavow Millian?"" Ross later left ABC after being suspended for erroneous reporting on Russiagate, while Mosk has moved to CBS News. Throughout the summer and fall of 2016, Fusion GPS also promoted to the Washington media the false allegation the Trump campaign maintained a secret hotline to Moscow through Russia-based Alfa Bank. In an attempt to tie Millian to the Alfa Bank allegations, Durham found that Fusion GPS sought the assistance of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who in turn contacted D.C. tech executive Rodney Joffe to determine if Millian had any ties to Alfa Bank. On Aug. 20, 2016, Joffe emailed federal computer contractors at Georgia Tech a document titled ""birdsnest-1.pdf' that contained ""known associates"" of Trump. Included in the attached document was a description of Millian along with his past mailing addresses; various email addresses; websites; and IP addresses that were associated with him. Joffe, who was recently fired as an FBI informant, described Millian as ""the most likely intermediary"" between Trump and Russia. On Sept. 27, 2016, Simpson and Fritsch emailed IP ""look-up"" information for one of Millian’s websites to then-New York Times reporter Eric Lichtblau, whom Fusion was pressuring to write a story about the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations. In the email, Fritsch pointed out that ""Alfa"" was the website service provider for Millian's website. However, Durham determined that the relevant IP information did not indicate that ""Alfa Bank"" was the service provider, but rather Alfa Telecom — a Lebanese-based telecom company, which appears to have no affiliation with Alfa Bank.

The three youths were identified as Amanullah Khan(20), Muhammad Faizal(21) and Muhammad Asif Iqbal(20). They live in the Wattganj locality of Kolkata. They were very much active on the Social media platform Instagram. They allegedly duped a Chennai girl Mahalakshmi promising to give high returns on her investments.  As per information, a month ago of her suicide, the resident of the Seven Walls area, Mahalakshmi, received a message on her Instagram about an investment plan. The statement said an investment of Rs. 750 would get a return of Rs. 23,500. Believing this, she sent them a total of Rs. 37,500.  After several days, when she did not receive any returns or replies, she demanded her principal amount. This time too, she did not get any answers. Saddened by this, on April 2, Mahalakshmi allegedly died by suicide at her house.  According to the police, after investigating the mobile phone of the girl, they came to know about the Instagram conning. Later, the special investigation team went to West Bengal and traced the location of the accused and arrested them.  The arrested three are college graduates and have been duping people on Instagram, promising to give high returns. Till now, they have deceived people about approximately INR 17 to 25 lacs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaGluZHVwb3N0LmluL2NyaW1lL2NoZW5uYWktZ2lybC1tYWhhbGFrc2htaS1kaWQtc3VpY2lkZS0zLW11c2xpbS15b3V0aHMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZnJvbS1rb2xrYXRhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:48:22","Carissa Peckrul  On Mental Health Action Day, AmeriCorps alumna Carissa shares how national service empowered her to become a social worker.  It’s been four years since I sat across from my professor during my final semester of undergrad. The countdown had begun—I had a year to figure out my next move as a young woman entering the world with a psychology degree. While inquiring about opportunities, my professor mentioned AmeriCorps as a path. Interested, yet hesitant, I wondered what national service had to do with improving the mental health crisis.  Four months later, I boarded a plane to Chicago to learn how to teach mental health first aid as part of the Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program. I remember practicing the training content in front of my hotel mirror for hours. However, sitting in a room of professionals with a variety of qualifications, my voice shook when I introduced myself. I thought, “Can I really do this?”  During my time with the program, I quickly realized the transformative power of national service. I confidently trained groups of people and was enlightened by every class. I learned quickly the value of personal stories, the turmoil of mental health challenges, and the hope for recovery. It was no longer about an experience, but a lifestyle of conversing, listening, and offering support.  One encounter really stood out to me, and it remains my driving force to persevere in this field, even when there may be easier roads to venture down. A woman approached me after a training session and thanked me for teaching her the skills to ask someone if they may be thinking about suicide. This woman believed that this skill she implemented on her own may have saved her family member's life. My voice shook again in my response to her, but not because of nervousness, but because I realized the impact I have as a social worker. This was a direct result of the lessons I learned through my service with AmeriCorps.  Since my service term ended, the Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program has grown exponentially. With more members than ever serving across the country, the program is leading the charge to establish the critical role national service plays in responding to our nation’s mental health crisis. With the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline shifting to the 3-digit number 988, Healthy Minds Alliance now supports crisis call centers nationwide. The 988 Lifeline helps thousands of people overcome suicidal crisis or mental-health related distress every day. These AmeriCorps members are trained and supported in answering calls, texts and chats that come into local crisis call centers, recruit other volunteers for the crisis call center, and reach out to the local community to build awareness around 988. This new program model is made possible by Public Health AmeriCorps funding, a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and AmeriCorps.  The Healthy Minds Alliance AmeriCorps program is developing the next generation of mental health workers, which is critical to addressing this crisis. These AmeriCorps members have grit, determination, and hope for a better future. They show up every day, boldly taking action and saving lives. They are superheroes in every sense of the word.  If you are interested in serving to improve the mental health crisis head to AmeriCorps.gov/Serve to find your opportunity to make an impact.  If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljb3Jwcy5nb3YvYmxvZ3MvMjAyMy0wNS0xOC9hbWVyaWNvcnBzLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWNyaXNpc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Wilmington"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:50:03","WilmU’s Prevention Science offers solutions to societal problems  Kristen Wilson wanted to figure out how to combat the increasing mental health struggles seen in students as the COVID-19 pandemic stretched on. In her last semester in the Wilmington University Prevention Science program, Wilson has whittled that topic down to focus on community college students for her doctoral dissertation. Prevention science uses statistics and studies to create programs that will reduce risk factors in a community and help them protect people by helping them avoid elements that contribute to the problem. It’s a field that’s drawn much more interest since the pandemic began. Rather than reacting to or providing treatment in the aftermath of an issue, such as homlessness, preventive science can offer solutions to make those things more avoidable in the first place. Instructors said WilmU’s Prevention Science program is one of a kind because it’s exclusively offered online and can be completed in just two-and-a-half years. “It’s not your traditional PhD program because it’s more action research,” said Dr. Edward Guthrie, dean of the university’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. “You can look at a problem and in a shorter period of time have the skill set to empirically look at it, evaluate it, work with the community, build that coalition, and then make recommendations and implement them to help resolve that issue or work on it.” Dr. Debra Berke, director of psychology/organizational dynamics programs, likes to call it a “weed and seed” approach. Although the weed and seed approach originated as a Department of Justice program focused on crime control and prevention, Berke said, some general strategies can be adopted for other community-based prevention such as substance abuse prevention, suicide prevention, teen pregnancy prevention, and youth violence prevention. “We want to weed out those bad things in our society that aren’t promoting healthy growth and development, and we want to seed in positive predictive factors like knowledge and skills and attitudes, values, beliefs, policies and procedures, those kinds of things,” Berke said. Both Wilson and Berke described prevention science as a soft science. “I don’t mean that in a negative way,” Wilson said. “There are a lot of industries who are not familiar with this, or they’re uncomfortable talking about these sorts of things because culture change is scary. So our goal is to take some of this and translate it into a way that other industries can understand it and respond to it.” Another unique factor of the Wilmington University program, Berke said, is it’s a doctor of social science, not a PhD program. The program is meant for professionals, and the coursework is structured in a manner to fit into the schedules of students, who are often working full-time jobs while working on the degree. The program started in 2018 with the goal of preparing students to help bring prosperity, knowledge and nobility to the communities they live in. But the university sees “community” as something much more meaningful than just a set geographical location. “Community can include a neighborhood, a larger urban area, a particular demographic (i.e. looking at alcohol exposure with adolescents), a rural area, or a discipline/profession,” Guthrie said. “There are a number of communities and populations that experience challenges.” “WilmU’s Prevention Science Program gives you those enhanced durable skills, problem solving, critical thinking, collaboration and interpersonal communication,” Guthrie said, “but at a different level so that you can help build community coalitions to help work on community and neighborhood problems.” Examples of Prevention Science One example of the kind of work in the program is a student who worked on a project that looked at challenging childhood experiences such as poverty, domestic violence, abuse and homelessness, and how that can help programs that reintroduce incarcerated people into society be as successful as possible. One of the research points in this case was looking at which programs lower or increase the recidivism rate. The student evaluated how the state could adjust those programs to lower the rate. She said that one recent graduate has started an executive position in a community organization that positively impacts individuals re-integrating with family, friends and the community after incarceration, with one goal of preventing recidivism. Another graduate began a position with a federal organization that tracks and analyzes conditions that have resulted in childhood deaths to develop prevention interventions. Wilson, who’s also the director of social services at Rowan College of South Jersey, said a colleague of hers in the WilmU program is writing a dissertation about substance abuse prevention and how organizations who deal with that were impacted by the pandemic. Another example of what goes on in the classroom, Guthrie said, is looking at the opioid crisis and analyzing how it’s affecting various neighborhoods in the state differently. Say you’re in a rural area, like parts of Sussex County, Guthrie said, what services or resources are available for opioid prevention and education, and how can people get access to them? In this example, students research how many prescriptions for opioids are given and whether information/educational materials are given to the patient outlining the potential for addiction or abuse. Once that research is conducted, students in the program focus on how those resources could be improved to help more people addicted to prescription opioids. Those who study prevention science classes start with introductions into what the science is and how to build a foundation of research. They then work on applied research methods, choosing an area of interest to study using different approaches such as qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative approach focuses on personal accounts and documentation that show how an individual or group acts. A quantitative approach, on the other hand, relies on measurable data to form conclusions. During guided study classes, students work on their own project and learn independently with feedback from a mentor. They also study inquiry research, which gives the student the chance to research a topic they’ve chosen, create theories about how to help and present an argument to address that real-world issue. Students will […]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdG93bnNxdWFyZWRlbGF3YXJlLmNvbS9zdGF0ZS1wb2xpY2UtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZy1hdHRlbXB0ZWQtYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS0zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 07:00:00","Teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, and, when boys become men, they are three times more likely than women to die by suicide.  After years on the frontline of teaching and observing, first-hand, a decline in teenage mental health, a teacher has warned that we need to deal better with male anger, friendships, and attitudes towards sex in order to combat the male suicide crisis.  Official statistics for England, Scotland, and Wales show that in 2020, 264 people aged 10–19 died by suicide – 72% of these were boys. In England, suicide is the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45. They are three times more likely than women to die by suicide.  While statistics surrounding male suicide paint a bleak picture of the future of boys in our schools, teacher Matt Pinkett thinks all is not lost.  What can be done?  Pinkett has gathered evidence from teachers and school staff, wellbeing experts and therapists to create a powerful guide to helping boys, in Boys Do Cry, released next month.  The practical and engaging guide, backed up by the latest research from the fields of psychology and education, suggests that teachers must stop stigmatising anger and instead help angry boys understand the neurological and physiological reasons for their feelings.  Pinkett says: “Anger isn’t an inherently bad thing and telling boys it is just leads to shame and hiding away. Instead, how about we teach them that anger is a feeling as natural as joy or sadness, and give them ways to manage it and the words to talk about it?”  He also suggests that teachers need to make loving, male relationships the norm, and to assume that every social interaction that takes place in a classroom is being watched and internalised.  He advises male teachers to compliment male colleagues openly, to talk lovingly about other people, and praise and salute male emotional vulnerability wherever and whenever possible.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work,” Pinkett explains, “but the fact is that we are in front of these children for massive chunks of their life. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing.”  Talking isn’t enough  In Boys Do Cry, Pinkett advocates the benefits of the ‘bromance’, suggesting that teachers and schools harness this relatively recent phenomenon of male-to-male relationships. He argues that in teaching boys about bromances, teachers can equip young men with the skills to actively listen and display compassion and affection towards each other.  He suggests teachers can help facilitate emotional connection between boys and help build friendships that are supportive.  He explains: “The problem isn’t encouraging young men to talk – it’s teaching their peers to listen. Research suggests boys don’t listen as well as girls. There is so much conversation about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through listening effectively?”  Demonstrated through research and case studies, Pinkett argues that boys crave emotional intimacy and the freedom to express themselves without being mocked, but that toxic ideas about masculinity are preventing these fruitful peer relationships.  “We need to teach boys to be kind, and that it is OK to be vulnerable and emotionally articulate,” he says.  Benefit to society  With his research-backed tools and tips, Pinkett hopes the book will give teachers confidence to engage with really difficult topics – to the benefit of all.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to get rid of those harmful and outdated expectations of what it means to be a man, all of society will be better off,” Pinkett says. “It is only through education of young people that the scourge of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Boys Do Cry examines key research on factors impacting boys’ mental health, including topics such as body image, pornography and self-harm, and provides teachers with practical strategies to start enacting positive change.  With his extensive research, he has created advice on intervening when a child may be in danger, to tips on how to set up group working so friendships can be made while learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists,” Pinkett adds, “It’s just about being brave enough to intervene and give boys a chance to learn another way of being.”  Further information:  Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in Schools  By Matt Pinkett  Published 17 May 2023  180 Pages  Paperback: 9781032168692 | $22.95 USD | £16.99  Hardback: 9781032168685 | $155 USD | £120    About the author:  Matt Pinkett is an English teacher in Surrey with a personal and professional interest in gender and masculinity in schools.

Thirteen years. Almost 365 days a year. Countless hours on set, filming anywhere between 50 and 60 scenes a day. I can’t keep track of the birthdays, anniversaries and holidays I missed, all because of “Days of Our Lives.” When I look back, “Days of Our Lives” was the days of my life.  And it was worth it, because I got to do what I loved, every single day: act. Although it was a demanding and grueling job, I did amazing things while playing Gabi Hernandez — things I never would’ve been able to do on any other set, like being kidnapped eight times or causing a gas explosion that might destroy the entire town or doing my own stunts and getting tackled or blowing up a person’s wedding.  That’s what made walking away earlier this year such a difficult decision.  When I told my mom, sister and husband — who I call my “tripod” — I was thinking of leaving the show, they understood. They’d seen me come home from work crying because I couldn’t shake off something bad that had happened to Gabi. They’d seen me memorizing 60 pages a day and feeling like my head was going to explode. Their support is monumental and it’s what makes me feel safe enough to take this risk.  I did it for me and the dreams that surpassed “Days of Our Lives.” I did for my family: past, present and future. I did it for my dad, in honor of the person he thought I could be — but never could see me become.  Soon into my time on “Days of Our Lives,” I got the news no one ever wants to receive. I was in the parking lot of a dollar store with my mom, who was on the phone, when she started screaming. On the other line, she learned my dad, her ex-husband, had died by suicide.  Story continues  We were shocked and devastated. My dad had been a living whirlwind and human wild card. When he was on dates with my mom, women would leave him their numbers. He was an exuberant man; everyone wanted his attention. At that point, I didn’t realize his smile masked what I now think was a lifetime of depression.  When he died, I handled it the best way I could as a 19-year-old, which was … not to tell anybody. A couple of days later I returned to set and life moved on. I buried my grief, I buried my anger. I buried my sadness. I put on a smile for a long time.  My instinct was silence. Things got better, for me, when I started talking about my dad’s death. In fact, I talk about it all the time now! Some people get weird with me because I don’t have to be very close to someone to tell them about my father’s death, but not making it taboo is therapeutic for me.  Other things that helped: Therapy. My husband, who encouraged me to think beyond guilt and my last phone call with my dad, and the memories I cherished. “Days” was impactful, too: When my character became a mom, I took a parenting class to prepare for the role, where I reflected on how the parenting done to me has molded me into the adult I became. Meeting other families impacted by suicide through my work with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has helped me move forward as well.  I think losing my dad made me a more empathetic person. His suicide changed the way that I interact with people. I want them to know that I care. I want them to know they are wanted, important, needed.  I had always spoken to my dad about my dreams. He knew my ultimate goal is to create amazing stories and cultivate characters — to be on the big screen. That was part of why I walked away. He didn’t stay to see his dreams realized — the depression took over. I need to reach mine for him, and me, and our family.  “Days” was undeniably a dream job. But I hope it’s the first of many dream jobs. I want to leave a legacy for my family, honoring the sacrifices that my Cuban immigrant parents made for me so that I could pursue those dreams.  Now, in Florida, when I look at the water, I think of my dad. I feel his embrace. And I know: He would be so proud of me.

The agreement stems from allegations that between 2014 and 2020, jail officials treated inmates experiencing withdrawal and at risk of self-harm or suicide with “deliberate indifference,” federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The Justice Department alleged jail officials violated the Eighth and 14th Amendments of the Constitution by denying mental health treatment and medical assistance.  “The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country, and under our Constitution, jails and prisons must provide adequate medical care to incarcerated individuals,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. “Today’s proposed consent decree is a significant step toward improving the care of individuals incarcerated in Cumberland County who are struggling with serious mental health disorders, and toward protecting the civil rights that are guaranteed by our Constitution.”  The proposed consent decree, filed in federal court in Camden, still must be approved by a court, federal officials told reporters Wednesday.  The jail, located in Bridgeton, houses about 300 people. Jail officials should have been using medication-assisted treatment and therapies to treat opioid withdrawal, but instead routinely used treatment generally used for people experiencing alcohol withdrawal, federal officials said.  Philip Sellinger, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said each of the seven inmates who died by suicide exhibited signs of withdrawal from opioids at the time of their deaths, but jail officials refused to provide medication-assisted treatment.  “This was policy and practice. You can’t pick and choose whose rights matter — everyone’s do,” he told reporters Wednesday. “People don’t leave their rights at the jailhouse door.”  The agreement will require the jail to increase mental health staffing and implement assessments for mental health, opioid withdrawal, and suicide risk. It also calls for an independent monitor to ensure compliance and issue public reports, said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.  The federal probe at the jail began in 2018 following the deaths of six inmates in three years. Another suicide occurred one month after federal officials began investigating, according to a 2021 report from the Department of Justice.  In that report, federal officials informed the county of the allegations and gave written notice of what officials should do to resolve them. The Justice Department said the county “fully cooperated” with the investigation.  “This consent decree marks a significant milestone in the Justice Department’s efforts to combat discrimination against those with opioid use disorder and to protect the civil rights of people in our jails and prisons,” Clarke said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3amVyc2V5bW9uaXRvci5jb20vYnJpZWZzL2N1bWJlcmxhbmQtamFpbC10by1pbXByb3ZlLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtc2VydmljZXMtZm9sbG93aW5nLWlubWF0ZS1kZWF0aHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This came after the news Lola only had weeks left to live due to the fact her treatment had stopped working.  With the tumour spreading, Lola’s life was thrown into a different perspective once more as she told Jay that she wasn’t sure how many more good days she’ll have.  With that, they took off to the beach, ready for a very memorable day.  And what a day it was.  The couple enjoyed food and drink looking at the sea, reminiscing about when they first met, Lola stole a necklace from a shop for Lexi’s (Isabella Brown) 16th birthday and smiled as she told Jay that he’s the love of her life, who’s also secretly picked up some very impressive singing and guitar skills.  One thing that was hanging over Lola like a dark cloud was the fact she needed to tell Jay that she had asked Billy (Perry Fenwick) to help end her life when the time comes.  Of course, Jay was completely horrified when Lola broke the news.  Jay told Lola that he hates the world for taking her from him (Picture: BBC)  He pointed out that Lola has other options when it comes to her final days, but she argued that she wants to be Lola right until the end – not someone managed and completely controlled by medication, doctors and nurses.  Ultimately, this was the chance for Jay to tell Lola how angry he is at the world, he hated that someone ‘up there’ is taking Lola from him, and he despised that they won’t live the future he spends time imagining. He doesn’t want Lola to go – ever.  After time to calm down, Jay told Lola that if she wants to do it, then he should be there to help – not Billy.  Jay told Lola that he should help her die instead of Billy (Picture: BBC)  The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a police officer, who had discovered Lola stole the necklace from the shop.  As Jay took the fall for her, Lola’s mind started to change.  Back at the hospital, Lola explained to Jay that he could end up behind bars if he was to help her die, which would leave Lexi without him – someone she’ll definitely need when Lola isn’t around.  Lola decided that because of Lexi and the example she is continuing to set for her, she will be brave and die naturally.  She’s ready.

And you know, but she ends up owning my work,” she said of The Conners, ABC’s answer to Barr’s repeated public volatility which featured the rest of the Conner clan continuing on in a universe where Roseanne, not Dan, meets an awkward and untimely demise. “They just tried to kill me, and I felt like they killed my character and my character.”  Barr took the accusations one step further, asserting that Gilbert and ABC executives tried to literally kill her, saying, “I thought they were sending a message over the airwaves because they knew I had mental health issues. I thought they wanted me to kill myself.” Barr said that this isn’t just her own paranoia talking, claiming, “All my friends (thought that) too. They said, ‘They’re trying to push you to suicide.’”  Advertisement  Back here in reality, Gilbert’s decision to distance herself from her co-star’s hateful comments was one of hundreds of thousands of tweets criticizing Barr for her bullshit back in 2018.

Despite her decision to pin her firing on everyone who didn’t call a Black woman a Muslim ape, Barr claimed that accountability has never been an issue for her, explaining, “I never thought, ‘Hey, it’s not you.

Rising to prominence with her role in the hit TV series Fresh Off the Boat, Wu has demonstrated her versatility and garnered critical acclaim for her compelling portrayals on screen. The actress previously opened up about a tough phase in her life.  During an episode of Red Table Talk last year, Constance Wu shared her feelings of “betrayal” by the Asian American community at a December 2019 event hosted by Simu Liu. At the Unforgettable Gala, which occurred shortly after her tweets expressing disappointment and a subsequent suicide attempt, Liu made a joke about her social media behavior, despite prior assurances not to address the topic.

With deep affection for her co-stars, Wu wanted the event to be solely about their accomplishments. She clarified that she didn’t want anyone to make light of the situation since she was still emotionally vulnerable and unprepared to be subjected to mockery.  “They wanted me to come ’cause they wanted to celebrate the show and the kids on the show,” Wu explained. “At that time, there was so much controversy around me that I was like, ‘If I go, people are just gonna want to talk about the tweets, and like, I love my kids on the show so much. I want this to be a moment for them to celebrate.’ I told them, ‘I don’t want anybody to make fun of it, ’cause I’m still in a very raw place about it. I’m not ready to be mocked for it.'”  In her conversation with Jada Pinkett Smith, Willow Smith, and Adrienne Banfield-Norris on Red Table Talk, Wu revealed that the gala organizers were unaware of her suicide attempt. Nevertheless, they assured her that she would not become a target of mockery or ridicule during the event.  “They sat me in the front row and had all these cameras on me and within ten minutes, the show’s host made a crack at me,” she recalled.

The audience’s reaction was marked by raised eyebrows and audible “oooooohs,” indicating a mixed response to the remark. Following the event, Constance Wu said that Simu Liu privately apologized to her.  Later, Constance Wu took to her Instagram Stories to rectify her earlier statement, acknowledging that she had mistakenly identified the hosting organization of the gala. In the episode, she initially mentioned the Coalition of Asian Pacifics (CAPE) as the host, but it was, in fact, Character Media who led the event.  In the interview, Constance Wu delved into various sensitive topics, including her complicated relationship with her mother, her decision not to disclose her experience of rape at the age of 22, and the instances of sexual harassment she encountered on the set of Fresh Off the Boat. These profound and personal experiences are also explored in her memoir, Making A Scene.

This year she takes up a new role as a lived experience advisor for the NHS and is working on her latest idea – to launch an awareness and fundraising walk in Carlisle called Stride Against Suicide, which she plans to walk 5k around Bitts Park raising funds for Papyrus, Samaritans and Every Life Matters.  Lisa has achieved a remarkable personal turnaround over the past five years.  Diagnosed as bipolar, she struggled with her mental health from her late teens including periods of depression, eating disorder and a suicide attempt.  Lisa also survived the suicide of her only sibling, her brother Stephen in 2015.  At The Cumberland, Lisa is an operations team leader in the premises department but alongside that, she is also one of the building society’s Mental Health and Wellbeing Champions.  She works with 18 other volunteer colleagues to raise awareness and to  help anyone within the business who may be having difficulties.  Pictured Lisa Birdsall (Image: INTROPR)  “I’m hugely proud of what we have done as a team. And I’m proud of The  Cumberland for their forward thinking and a really quite pioneering approach.  “I have suffered, myself, with my mental health and I understand just how vital it is to have that support and for it to be recognized that people’s mental health is important,"" she said.  Outside work Lisa is even more busy. She takes part in a scheme called Suicide Safer Communities which aims to raise awareness and understanding across Cumbria as well as being a volunteer by Carleton Clinic mental health service in Carlisle.  Ahead of Stride Against Suicide, Lisa said: ""I’m in the planning stage, and would like it to happen in Carlisle. I’m thinking Bitts Park for a walk of five kilometers.  “It is so important to have that education out there and have people with real stories to tell and stories that show it’s a journey you can go on, but things will get better.  “Obviously losing my brother the way that I did plays huge role in why I do what I do. I want to make the issue of mental health more normal and less shameful and hidden.  ""It's always on my mind – what more can we do to help,"" she said.

The musician cum entrepreneur, who struggled to have a child for eight years after tying the knot in 2016, said she went through a series of complications that nearly caused her life and marriage.    Touching on the depressing ordeal, Mimi said, but for her busy schedules which she used as a façade, she would’ve committed suicide or even run mad.    She said people who did not know about her condition, peddled rumours that she was unserious about having a baby.    “When you are married and not giving birth, people have their own assumptions because you are lively and bubbly. Your problems don’t show on you so people think you’re alright. I was working on Golden Movie Awards and doing other things so people think I am not serious with giving birth.    “I have heard a lot about such stories but you don’t know what I went through. People don’t know that keeping myself busy with work was just a veil. I could’ve committed suicide or even gone mad. It is not a small thing,” she stated in an interview with Zionfelix.    Establishing the root cause of her childbearing complications, Mimi said she suffers a type of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) that makes it extremely difficult to ovulate unless her ovaries are poked.    “I have gotten pregnant three times, I had a chemical pregnancy. As for the miscarriage, I could go as long as five and four months to lose the pregnancy. A lot I can’t even share. I am that type of woman who ovulates twice a year or three times a year.    ""So, if I miss those times, I miss out on having a baby for the entire year. It’s called PCOS. Naturally, I could have eggs but I won’t ovulate. Unless they burst the eggs before I could ovulate and I did this process three times. The third time, I had to travel out to save my baby,” she added.    In March 2022, Mimi and her husband, Nana Michaels, welcomed a baby girl in Spain.

She posted it to Twitter and has seen a flood of responses in support.  She said: ""We always talk about how we can prevent and stop suicide but that might not always help. Until it happens we don't take it seriously enough, there is still so much stigma around it.  ""Why? Because people who want to talk and open up and say how they feel think they are going to get shut down just because of what they have said. No wonder it gets to the point where they try to take their own life and then people wonder ‘oh why did that happen?’ because you didn’t listen to them at their lowest when they needed that support.""

""It's stupid that we get told off for how we feel because you might go up to your friend or a family member and say I feel low, depressed, sad, then they go and turn around and say ‘what do you have to be sad about?’. You don't know what the individual might feel or be going through because they struggle to open up because they are anxious too.""  She also broaches the difficult subjects of self-harm and suicide.  She adds: ""The fact there is still so much stigma around mental health and we don't talk about the bits around it is awful. We should talk more about it.

"suicide","2023-12-01","22:00:00","{""Surat"", ""Gujarat"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:57:41","Cerbera odollam, commonly known as the Suicide Tree, is a plant species native to several countries in Southeast Asia, including India. The name ""Suicide Tree"" is derived from its dark reputation for being associated with intentional self-harm and suicides. Here's why Cerbera odollam earned this grim title:    1. Toxicity  Cerbera odollam contains potent cardiac glycosides, specifically cerberin and odollin, which are highly toxic to humans and animals. These compounds interfere with the normal functioning of the heart by inhibiting the sodium-potassium pump, leading to cardiac arrest and death. All parts of the tree, including the seeds, bark, leaves, and sap, contain these toxic compounds.  2. Ease of Access  The tree's widespread distribution in tropical regions and its accessibility in public areas, such as parks and residential areas, make it easily available to individuals in distress. This accessibility has contributed to its unfortunate association with suicidal acts.  3. Misconceptions  The toxic properties of Cerbera odollam were misunderstood by some individuals, leading to the misconception that it could be used for a relatively painless suicide method. This misconception spread through word-of-mouth and media reports, further enhancing the tree's reputation as a suicide aid.  Pixabay/Representational Image  4. Lethality  Ingesting even a small amount of Cerbera odollam seeds or other parts can be fatal. The seeds resemble small mangoes and are easily mistaken for edible fruits. This resemblance has tragically led to instances where people unknowingly consume the seeds, resulting in severe poisoning and death.  5. Lack of Antidote  Currently, there is no specific antidote or effective treatment for Cerbera odollam poisoning. The toxicity of the tree's compounds and the absence of a readily available antidote make it particularly dangerous. Prompt medical intervention, including gastric lavage, activated charcoal administration, and supportive care, is crucial in cases of ingestion.  Pixabay/Representational Image  6. Cultural Factors  Cerbera odollam's association with suicides is also influenced by cultural factors in some regions. In certain cases, stories or legends related to self-harm or suicides have been associated with the tree, reinforcing its reputation as a ""suicide tree.""  It is important to note that discussions surrounding the Suicide Tree should be approached with sensitivity and responsibility. Focusing solely on the negative aspects can perpetuate the association with suicide and potentially trigger vulnerable individuals. It is crucial to promote mental health awareness, provide support systems, and discourage the romanticization or glamorization of harmful acts.  Efforts are being made to raise awareness about the dangers of Cerbera odollam and to promote its conservation. Public education campaigns, signage, and initiatives to remove the trees from public spaces have been undertaken in some areas to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion or intentional harm.  It is essential to prioritize mental health support, suicide prevention strategies, and open conversations about mental well-being to address the root causes of suicide and provide appropriate care for individuals in need.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9nYXJkZW5pbmcvY2VyYmVyYS1vZG9sbGFtLXdoeS1pdC1pcy1jYWxsZWQtYS1zdWljaWRlLXRyZWUtNjAzMDQ1Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2dhcmRlbmluZy9jZXJiZXJhLW9kb2xsYW0td2h5LWl0LWlzLWNhbGxlZC1hLXN1aWNpZGUtdHJlZS02MDMwNDUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-01","10:00:00","{""Thiruvananthapuram"", ""Kerala"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:11:43","Had the state been supportive enough, a 17-year-old boy with mental illness would not have committed suicide inside the Social Justice Department's Observation Home at Poojappura in Thiruvananthapuram on May 13.    The boy, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, should have ideally been admitted and given prolonged treatment in the Mental Health Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. Instead, he had to be shifted back to the Observation Home after a brief stay at the Mental Health Centre. Eventually, the boy used a moment of isolation in the Home to take his life. He hung himself from one of the windows of the Home.  He was brought to the Observation Home last December by the Railway Police after he was implicated in a theft. Observation Home is a place where children in conflict with the law are placed before the juvenile court passes judgement.  At the Observation Home, the boy exhibited signs of serious mental illness, especially violent behaviour. The boy's was a fit case to be admitted.  The doctors at the Mental Health Centre, however, were faced with a dilemma. They realised that the boy could not be admitted.  The boy's parents were not with him. According to human rights lawyer J Sandhya, the boy's mother was grappling with multiple issues, including her husband's illness, that she could not be with her boy.  The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, states that if a minor has to be admitted then an attendant should be with the minor for the entire duration of the admission in the Mental Health Centre.  Nonetheless, if the parents are not fit to function as full-time attendants, the Mental Healthcare Act provides a solution. It states that the Mental Health Review Board should appoint a ""suitable individual"" who is willing to act as the ""nominated representative"" of the minor.  Even if a ""suitable individual"" is hard to appoint, the Act has a plan B. It states that the Mental Health Review Board should then appoint the director in the Department of Social Welfare or her nominee as the ""nominated representative"".  It is the duty of the Mental Health Review Board to find the right care giver for the minor. The Review Board, envisaged for all districts, should have as its members a district judge, a representative of the district collector, a psychiatrist, a medical practitioner and a representative of an NGO working in the field of mental health.  Tragedy is, this Mental Health Review Board, though constituted following a High Court diktat, is still not functional. No supporting staff or other necessary infrastructure have been provided to these boards. The board exists only on paper.  In other words, the state just abandoned the boy. Since there was no full-time attendant for the boy, it was not possible to admit the boy. If admission was not possible, there was just one option left for the Mental Health Centre: Shut the boy inside a solitary cell.  But this was deemed too cruel and primitive and shifting him back to the Observation Home after a short stay at the Centre was considered a better option. ""Even the doctors knew that it would have done the boy a world of good if he was given sustained treatment at the mental Health Centre. But without an attendant to serve him, it would have been unlawful for the hospital to keep the boy in the hospital,"" a senior doctor at the Mental Health Centre told Onmanorama on the condition of anonymity.  There is a feeling that the government could still have provided support. ""The Woman and Child Department, which takes care of the affairs of minor children, should have taken up the responsibility of providing the boy a bystander or caretaker,"" advocate Sandhya said. ""But we have still not worked out a rehabilitation plan for mentally ill children without parental support,"" she said.  In this case, it was also found that the boy who was first lodged in the Observation Home last December was kept in the Home for more than four months. The Juvenile Justice Act says that trials of children charged with criminal offences should not extend beyond four months.  It is said that the living conditions in Observation Homes are worse than in the Poojappura Central Jail opposite it. The convicts in the Central Jail, even those implicated in serious crimes like murder and rape, are allowed to spend at least a couple of hours outside. But the under-18 inmates of the Observation Home, most of them hauled up for minor offences like theft, are shut inside the airless house 24x7. More than enough to test any minor's sanity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubWFub3JhbWEuY29tL25ld3Mva2VyYWxhLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvc3VpY2lkZS1pbi1wb29qYXB1cmEtb2JzZXJ2YXRpb24taG9tZS1iaXBvbGFyLWRpc29yZGVyLXBhdGllbnRzLWhhbmdlZC5odG1s0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub25tYW5vcmFtYS5jb20vbmV3cy9rZXJhbGEvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9zdWljaWRlLWluLXBvb2phcHVyYS1vYnNlcnZhdGlvbi1ob21lLWJpcG9sYXItZGlzb3JkZXItcGF0aWVudHMtaGFuZ2VkLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Known for their bone-crushing sound and unrelenting energy, the band has once again unleashed their trademark intensity. In this review, we delve into the depths of their music, exploring the raw power and darkness that permeate their latest release.  Remember… You Must Die opens with an ominous, atmospheric intro that sets the tone for what lies ahead. As the first crushing riffs hit, listeners are instantly submerged in a sonic onslaught. The guitar work is relentless, churning out heavy, distorted chords and blistering solos that showcase the band’s technical prowess. The drumming is thunderous, driving the music forward with its relentless speed and precision. The vocal performance by Eddie Hermida is nothing short of fierce. His guttural growls and piercing screams cut through the mix, adding an extra layer of aggression to the music. The lyrics explore dark themes of mortality, existentialism and the human condition, reflecting the album’s title.  Suicide Silence has always been unapologetic about exploring these darker aspects of life, and Remember… You Must Die is no exception. One standout track on the album is “Capable of Violence.” The song kicks off with a crushing breakdown, instantly inciting chaos and unleashing a mosh pit-inducing frenzy. The relentless energy and razor-sharp guitar riffs, coupled with the gut-wrenching vocals, create an atmosphere of controlled chaos that will captivate fans of the genre. The track is a prime example of Suicide Silence’s ability to seamlessly combine heaviness and melody, keeping the listener engaged from start to finish.  Another highlight is the chaos charged “Alter Of Self.” The song showcases the band’s ability to craft dynamic compositions that incorporate moments of introspection and vocal style. The chunky guitar passages and haunting raw vocals add depth to the overall sound, complementing the brutality that permeates the album. This track serves as a testament to Suicide Silence’s evolution as musicians, expanding their sonic palette while retaining their trademark aggression.  In Remember… You Must Die, Suicide Silence has delivered an album that caters to their devoted fan base while also pushing the boundaries of their sound. The production is top-notch, capturing the raw energy and intensity of the band’s live performances. While the album maintains the band’s signature deathcore sound, there are moments where they experiment with different elements, showcasing their growth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbXVzaWMubXhkd24uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvcmV2aWV3cy9hbGJ1bS1yZXZpZXctc3VpY2lkZS1zaWxlbmNlLXJlbWVtYmVyLXlvdS1tdXN0LWRpZS_SAWJodHRwczovL211c2ljLm14ZHduLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L3Jldmlld3MvYWxidW0tcmV2aWV3LXN1aWNpZGUtc2lsZW5jZS1yZW1lbWJlci15b3UtbXVzdC1kaWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The opposition party also said demonetisation has come a full circle and added that the Rs 2,000 note was a ""band-aid to cover up the foolish decision of demonetising"" Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  A party MP said it was the beginning of a second demonetisation ""disaster"", in an apparent reference to the demonetisation exercise of November 8, 2016, when the legal tender status of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes was withdrawn by the Modi government.  ""Typical of our self-styled Vishwaguru. First Act, Second Think (FAST). 2000 rupee notes introduced with such fanfare after that singularly disastrous 'Tughlaqi firman' of Nov 8 2016 are now being withdrawn,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Twitter, targeting the prime minister.  Senior Congress leader and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram said a few weeks after demonetisation, the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were forced to re-introduce the Rs 500 note and he will not be surprised if the Centre re-introduces the Rs 1,000 note as well.  ""The Rs 2000 note is hardly a popular medium of exchange. We said this in November 2016 and we have been proved correct.

The Congress leader said that ""a few weeks after demonetisation, the government/RBI were forced to re-introduce the Rs 500 note"". ""I shall not be surprised if the government/RBI re-introduced the Rs 1,000 note as well. Demonetisation has come full circle,"" he said.  ""Rs 2,000 note was never a 'clean' note. It was not used by the vast majority of the people. It was used only by people to keep their black money, temporarily,"" the former finance minister said.  Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the ""ghost"" of November 8, 2016, has come back to haunt the nation once again.  ""The greatly propagated move of demonetisation continues to be a monumental disaster for this nation. The PM sermoned the nation on the benefits of the new 2,000 notes, today when the printing is stopped what happened to all those promises,"" he asked.  ""The government must explain its motive for such a step. The government continues its anti-people and anti-poor agenda. Hope the media questions the government on such a drastic measure and not attribute it to 'chip shortage' in the world,"" Khera said in a tweet.

"suicide","2023-05-14","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:36:26","The second season of the Irish crime drama aired last Sunday with dramatic scenes gluing fans to their seats.  Bren (Francis Magee) waits as Michael returns from the job in the Kin finale  A suicide prevention charity has defended RTÉ’s decision to include a warning before the season finale of Kin after viewers complained that it “spoiled” the twist ending.  The second season of the Irish crime drama aired last Sunday with dramatic scenes gluing fans to their seats.  The explosive episode saw the terrifying Bren Kinsella (Francis Magee) being shot between the eyes by his own brother Frank, played by Aidan Gillen.  And in the final seconds of the finale, Frank puts a gun to his own temple and pulls the trigger in a shocking turn.  However, RTÉ showed a warning before the episode, cautioning viewers about the use of strong language, scenes of violence, and “scenes involving suicide”.  But several viewers were left fuming as they thought the warning ruined the dramatic ending.  One person tweeted: “Loved season 2 of Kin but who in RTÉ thought it was ok to give that warning at the start of the episode and not think that it would be a massive spoiler.”  Another told Newstalk that such caution warnings paint viewers out to be “victims” - especially on a show about gangland and crime.  “The idea that people turn up hiding behind the couch eating popcorn through the splayed hands and fingers, so worried about what they might see, is just ludicrous,” he said.  He also argued that you can't “protect people” from negative experiences and “if they realise it's part of real life, they tend to be stronger for the experience"".  However, suicide prevention and awareness charity Samaritans believe that content warnings are necessary and urge broadcasters to include them where relevant.  Sarah O’Toole, Executive Director for Samaritans Ireland, said that warnings are helpful to viewers who may have lost a loved one to suicide.  “While we do appreciate some people may feel these trigger warnings are spoilers, it is important to alert viewers to any suicide and self-harm content as it allows them to make the choice of whether or not it is suitable for them to watch,” she told sundayworld.com.  “This is particularly important for some viewers who may have been affected by the issues, for example those who have been bereaved by suicide or someone watching who has experience of suicidal feelings or past attempts.  “Our guidelines are there for everyone in the media (news journalists and documentary makers, as well as those working on television dramas or films) to ensure a programme does not negatively impact on someone who may be vulnerable”.  “We would like to remind anyone impacted by this storyline, or anyone struggling to cope, to reach out for support to Samaritans on freephone 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.ie.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheXdvcmxkLmNvbS9zaG93Yml6L2lyaXNoLXNob3diaXovc2FtYXJpdGFucy1kZWZlbmQtc3VpY2lkZS13YXJuaW5nLXRoYXQtc3BvaWxlZC1raW4tZmluYWxlL2ExMzk2MTg4NTAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","1923-05-20","Not Discerned","{""SanAntonio"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 20:09:00","Tributes continue to pour in for Lance Blanks, a Texas basketball great and former NBA player and executive who died by suicide in May 2023, according to his daughter, Riley Blanks Reed.  For some, Blank’s death triggered feelings about dancer and reality TV star Stephen ‘Twitch’ Boss, who died by suicide on Dec. 13, 2022. He was 40 years old.  Researchers are sounding the alarm about rising suicide rates among black men in America in part due to the unique challenges they face, like structural racism, stereotypes and access to proper healthcare.  “Black men today are an endangered species. Black men today suffer more than any man in the country. The unemployment rate, black men suffer from a rise in mental health issues, black men suffer from police brutality, black men suffer from the breakup of homes and single parenting,” community activist Robert Muhammad said.  A recent study in the journal JAMA found that from 2000 to 2020, Black males had the highest increase in suicide attempts compared to any other race in the group, rising nearly 80%.  Among children ages 5-12, Black youth were two times more likely to die by suicide than their White counterparts.  Dr. Arthur Evans, CEO of the American Psychological Association, told Spectrum News one way psychologists are addressing these grim statistics is by creating space for Black men to open up and express themselves.  “One of the challenges that happens is that often African American men in particular don’t talk about how they’re feeling, don’t talk about what they’re experiencing. And one of the things that we know helps people is that we talk about these issues, we share what we are experiencing, we get feedback from, from other people,” Dr. Evans added.  Spectrum News also spoke with a group of Black men about what it means to be a Black man in America.  Because many suicidal acts are impulsive, suicide prevention hotlines can play a crucial role in de-escalating crises and saving lives.  Anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts or experiencing a mental health crisis can call the National Suicide Prevention hotline by dialing 988 to speak with a trained counselor for free 24/7 or visit SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL3R4L2F1c3Rpbi9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYWRkcmVzc2luZy1ibGFjay1tZW4tcy1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Manchester school superintendent Jenn Gillis sent an email to district families Wednesday night that said in part: ""It is with deep sadness that we inform you that one of our students has died unexpectedly.""  Gillis wrote that ""This loss may raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire school community, especially our students.""  For that reason, counselors from other Manchester schools and the state Disaster Behavior Health Response Team spent Thursday at the school ""directly impacted"" by the death, district spokesman Andrew Toland said.  ""Our focus in the coming days and weeks is to be supportive of our students, families and staff,"" said Toland.  According to multiple sources, the student is believed to have been trying to take their own life.  Suicide is a growing risk for teenagers, and help is available for anyone with troubling thoughts. The quickest way to get help is to call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. The Crisis Text Line is also available: text ""Hello"" to 741741.  The death took place at the Huse Road overpass, which bridges the I-293 highway just east of the Mall of New Hampshire. The bridge has chain-link fencing to prevent people from falling off.  It is a little more than a mile from Southside Middle School.  Emergency dispatch logs showed the person jumped just minutes before 3 p.m. and fell on the eastbound lanes.  The death caused a huge traffic backup in both directions. Within 20 minutes, New Hampshire State Police had opened the high-speed lane for traffic.  But traffic remained snarled for hours. It took authorities about two hours to reopen the entire highway.  State police did not release more information about the incident.  Story continues  Word of the death quickly spread throughout Manchester.  At Amoskeag Health's annual breakfast Thursday, board Chairman Christian Scott asked for a moment of silence for a 14-year-old who had died by suicide.  Manchester school officials said parents may have to face the sensitive job of discussing death with their children. They recommended the website FriendsofAine.com as one resource.

"suicide","2015-10-26","Not Discerned","{""SanAntonio"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:28:56","SAN ANTONIO – Paige Davis makes it perfectly clear that she doesn’t want to speak for every parent of a trans youth, only from her own experience with her now 19-year-old son.  When he first told her, Davis said, “I was devastated. I thought it was the most horrible thing ever.”  Davis spoke in length about the evolution her family underwent during an appearance on a KSAT 12 newscast two years ago, in hopes of helping other families.  She had testified before the Texas Legislature warning about the potential consequences of anti-trans legislation.  But Davis said the problem was, “Belief is belief. Truth is truth. We have to separate those two.”  Now, Davis is speaking out following the passage of SB14, the Children’s Gender Protection Act, sponsored by State Sen. Donna Campbell, a New Braunfels physician.  After it’s signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, the law will ban puberty blockers and hormone treatments for trans youth under the age of 18.  In a statement posted in full below, Campbell said, “Our children need counseling and love, not blades and drugs.”  However, Davis said instead of protecting children, she predicts the suicide rate among trans youth will go even higher.  As it is, Davis said her son who came out as trans when he was about 15, had been suicidal before he began his transition.  “Why would you want to live in a society that tells you that you’re an abomination and that you’re trash and not worth anything every single day of your life?” Davis asks.  She said thankfully, there are groups in San Antonio, such as Fiesta Youth, PFLAG and The Trevor Project that focus on the issues confronting trans youth and their families.  Following is Sen. Campbell’s full statement:  Our children need counseling and love, not blades and drugs. This bill is the compassionate solution to protect vulnerable children from these medically unnecessary and irreversible gender modification treatments. As a medical doctor, I am pleased that the Legislature has recognized the reality of the science of adolescent care and stepped in to protect young Texans.” “I am grateful to the House author of this bill and my fellow physician, Representative Tom Oliverson. He has been an indispensable partner throughout this process. My sincere thanks also go out to Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for making my bill his priority during this session, as well as my Senate and House colleagues who have supported SB 14 and fought to protect Texas children.

"suicide","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""WestDesMoines"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:00:00","Actions include $200 million to scale up 988 suicide and crisis lifeline and new resources for school-based mental health services  This Mental Health Awareness Month, we honor all those experiencing mental health challenges and celebrate the mental health professionals, families, and caregivers who support them. It is clear that our country is facing an unprecedented mental health crisis impacting people of all ages. In 2021, two in five American adults reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression and forty-four percent of high school students reported struggling with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, and gun violence. The Biden-Harris Administration is firmly committed to addressing this crisis.  As part of his Unity Agenda, President Biden released a comprehensive national strategy to transform how mental health is understood, accessed, treated, and integrated in and out of health care settings. Across the federal government, thanks to the President’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the Administration has already invested unprecedented levels of funding to expand access to mental health services. The President’s FY24 budget goes further, proposing tens of billions more to transform behavioral health services for all Americans.    Today, which is recognized as Mental Health Day of Action, and throughout Mental Health Awareness Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing additional critical actions to advance the President’s mental health strategy across its three key objectives: strengthening the mental health workforce and system capacity, connecting more Americans to care, and creating a continuum of support.    Strengthen the Mental Health Workforce and System Capacity  Addressing the mental health crisis requires that we confront the severe shortage of mental health professionals and strengthen the capacity of the behavioral health care system. As a result, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions this month to:  Increase the size and diversity of the behavioral health workforce. Thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the Department of Education (ED) has awarded more than $280 million in funding to bolster the pipeline of mental health professionals serving in schools and expand school-based mental health services and supports. Earlier this week, ED announced $95 million of this total was awarded in grants across 35 states to increase access to school-based mental health services and strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in high-needs school districts. Grantees from ED’s mental health programs project that these funds will create more than 14,000 new mental health professionals in U.S. schools – including school psychologists, counselors, social workers. This month, ED also announced new funding for a center that will provide technical assistance to grantees working to address the critical need in prekindergarten-12 schools for school-based mental health service providers. This summer, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) will announce a new Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) funding opportunity for approximately $8.4 million to support 16 awards to recruit and train providers to provide behavioral support to children and adolescents.  Expand access to peer support. A peer worker is someone with lived experience with a mental health and/or substance use condition, and who works with other people with similar conditions in a wide range of non-clinical activities including advocacy, navigation and linkage to resources, sharing of experience, social support, and more. In the coming weeks, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will release the National Model Standards for Peer Support Certification. The new standards are designed to improve consistency across peer certifications and promote quality of the growing number of peer workers across the nation.  Enhance crisis response. To ensure those in crisis have access to services, SAMHSA announced the availability of more than $200 million for states, territories, call centers, and Tribal organizations to continue strengthening 988 operations. Through the SAMHSA supported 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, the network receives approximately 100,000 calls, chats, and texts each week. Later this month, SAMHSA will also announce more than $9 million in awards in cooperative agreements for community crisis response partnerships. This funding will support mobile crisis response teams to ensure adults and youth experiencing mental health crises in high-need communities receive faster access to trained mental health professionals.  Expand proven models of care. To build capacity to meet the mental health needs of Americans, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded 15 one-year state planning grants to help states develop the necessary capacity to compete to participate in the Certified Community Behavioral Health Center (CCBHC) Medicaid Demonstration. CCBHCs provide 24/7, comprehensive behavioral health care – including crisis care – to the most vulnerable Americans regardless of their ability to pay. Thanks to BSCA, we are working to expand these clinics and help more states enter the program.  Connect More Americans to Care  Even when services are available, barriers like cost, cultural bias, and inconvenience often prevent people from accessing the care they need. On average, it takes 11 years after the onset of mental health symptoms for someone to seek treatment. To help remove these barriers, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to:  Make it easier to find help. It is simply too hard to know where to start when you or a loved one experiences a mental health challenge. That’s why HHS launched FindSupport.Gov, a brand-new, easy-to-access, free-of-charge, and user-friendly online resource for all Americans to learn how to get support for mental health, drug, and alcohol issues.  Provide mental health services in schools. To help address student mental health needs, today, CMS released an updated Medicaid School Claiming and Administrative Guide and ED released a proposed rule that would revise processes on Medicaid billing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, both of which are intended to make it easier for schools to provide health services to students with Medicaid. In addition, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) initiated a Behavioral Health and Wellness Program to provide indigenous focused, evidence-based, and trauma-informed behavioral health and wellness services and resources, including an expanded tele-behavioral health BIE specific 24/7 crisis hotline, to students and staff at all BIE-funded schools, colleges, universities, dormitories, and programs.  Support mental health of workers. Work related stress and burnout can lead to mental health challenges for America’s working families. To help address workplace mental health, earlier this month, the Department of Labor (DOL) launched a Mental Health at Work Initiative to promote key resources in support employees and employers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also rolled out the Workplace Stress Toolkit to provide guidance and tips for employers, training resources, and outreach materials to reduce stress and burnout among workers.  Reduce stigma for service members and veterans. Service members and veterans are at increased risk for mental health challenges. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a new policy that makes it easier for Service members to seek support by self-initiating a referral for a mental health evaluation through a commanding officer or supervisor. This policy, based on the Brandon Act, allows Service members to seek confidential help, reducing stigma associated with mental health issues. This month, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is also leveraging its Today I Am Campaign, to showcase veterans’ stories of getting help to inspire other veterans to proactively seek support and resources.  Deliver mental health services to caregivers. To help address the stress of family caregiving, this month, VA launched a pilot program to provide mental health services to caregivers enrolled in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. This new program will address the unique mental health needs of veteran caregivers by providing evidence-based services centered around couples, family therapy, and the individual needs of the caregiver.  Reduce disparities in maternal mental health. Too often, postpartum depression and anxiety go undiagnosed. This month, HRSA will announce awards for more than $65 million to 25 HRSA-funded health centers to implement innovative approaches to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce disparities for women from underserved backgrounds by supporting health centers to partner with patients and the community to develop and pilot innovative, patient-centered, scalable models of care delivery that address the clinical and health-related social needs of health center patients at highest risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. HRSA also just marked the one-year anniversary of the maternal mental health hotline. The 24/7 hotline, 1-833-TLC-MAMA, provides support before, during and after pregnancy and is currently staffed by more than three dozen call-takers, including nurses, doulas, and lactation consultants. During the first year, the hotline received more than 12,000 calls and texts.  Promote behavioral health equity. Earlier this month, SAMHSA launched a Behavioral Health Equity Challenge which will provide up to ten awards to community-based organizations for innovative outreach and engagement strategies that help members of underserved racial and ethnic communities engage in culturally and linguistically responsive services across the continuum of care for behavioral health, including mental health promotion, substance misuse prevention, and treatments and supports that foster recovery.  Create Healthy and Supportive Environments  In addition to investments in the health care system, we must also build environments that promote wellness and recovery and prevent mental health challenges from occurring in the first place. This month, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to:  Improve youth resilience. Unlike ever before, our kids are facing the consequences of multiple crises at once, from COVID-19 to gun violence among other key issues. HHS announced the new Children and Youth Resilience Prize Challenge, which will award $1 million to innovative community-led solutions to promote resilience in children and adolescents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters.  Promote the importance of social connection. Social isolation and loneliness are far too common. People from all walks of life have been forced to grapple with increase social isolation and loneliness, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the U.S. Surgeon General released a new Advisory on Addressing Loneliness and Promoting Social Connection. And, CDC also launched a new website for adults, which provides key suggestions on how to combat loneliness by improving social connectedness.  Invest in early childhood mental health. Like with physical health, it is important for us to start taking care of the mental health of our children as early in their lives as possible. Later this month, SAMHSA will award $9.7 million in grants through the infant and early childhood mental health program to improve outcomes for children from birth up to 12 years of age via improved interventions and treatment services.  Improve suicide prevention efforts. Beyond scaling up 988, the Administration is also taking additional actions to better prevent suicide. The Indian Health Service (IHS) will implement a system-wide suicide prevention training for all staff to increase recognition and response to suicide within American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Later this month, SAMHSA will award $6 million in suicide prevention grants across multiple programs to support states and tribes with implementing youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies in schools, institutions of higher education, juvenile justice systems, substance use and mental health programs, foster care systems, and other child and youth-serving organizations.  Launch public call-to-action to support research. This month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy called on non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, academic institutions, companies, and other research funders to share their actions and collaborations to help advance national mental health research priorities. This builds on the first-of-its-kind White House Report on Mental Health Research Priorities, which outlined a set of critical and timely needs and opportunities in mental health research.  Improve employee wellness. Americans spend much of their lives working, so it is critical that we foster healthy mental health practices even at work. Later this month, the Administration’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will release an Employee Wellness Program Guidance for agencies on best practices for providing wellness services to federal employees. The Administration also launched an interagency Mental Health and Well-being Community of Practice to continue to identify best practices and develop a government-wide toolkit for agencies containing metrics, data, insights, and options for agencies to use to understand and promote employee well-being and mental health.  Expand access to recovery. Treatment works and recovery is possible, and the Administration is committed to supporting all living in recovery. In the coming weeks, SAMHSA will announce $5.4 million in grant awards for building communities of recovery to support mobilization and connection of community-based resources to increase access to and quality of long-term recovery support for people with substance use disorders and co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWJpZGVuLWhhcnJpcy1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWFjdGlvbnMtdG8tdGFja2xlLW5hdGlvbnMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1jcmlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The office says Sean Armstead, 36, fatally shot Edward Wilkins, of Wurtsboro, in a parking lot and then killed himself last May. Police say Wilkins was having an affair with Armstead's wife. News 12 is told no evidence indicates that any other person was involved in the shooting.

"suicide","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""March"", ""Cambridgeshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:16:00","GUEST COMMENTARY - An acquaintance recently contacted me with a rumor that 2 students attending the high school I graduated from, Harvard-Westlake (HW), had recently committed suicide, and asking me if I had heard about that. So, I spent several hours on google and here is what I found out. Yes, that's true. One was a boy and one was a girl. Both were enrolled at the Upper School (HW has two campuses because it was a merger of Harvard and Westlake in order to become a coed school). Both suicides involved the use of guns. One occurred in March and the other in April. There was also a suicide of a good looking, academically accomplished, and athletic HW Alum in October, a Senior at Brown. And, finally, I already knew about the suicide of HW Alum Steve Bing in the middle of 2020, during the Covid Depression/Loneliness Era, a time of increasing suicide.  I graduated from Harvard Boys School or Harvard HS, one year before it became coed by merging with one of our sister schools, Westlake. I have been active in local politics and have run for office...hence my continuing frustration with the dominance of the LA Times in Los Angeles. LA Weekly used to be a strong news source...no more. The Daily News is a shell of what it once was, publishing a lot of CNS (City News Service) wire reports, although there has been recent improvement. Recently, the Times won the Pulitzer Prize, and I was left wondering: How long did the Times sit on the story/scandal?  Why didn't the Pulitzer go to Jon Peltz? Would the Times have released the audio if Peltz had not? Would the Times have run the story when they did if they didn't know that others were gonna publish on the same day?  Harvard-Westlake is the most prestigious school in the City of LA, btw, so sitting on the story of the suicides is not right. It's also not good for preventing other suicides. If you hide suicide, if you shame it, if you leave it to whispering and rumors, that's not healthy. What is best is to openly discuss it.  Perhaps if the March suicide had been reported and discussed openly (or even the 2 previous suicides by the accomplished Alums of the school), the April suicide could have been prevented. It is not healthy to shame Depression. Julia Wick, who worked on the HW Chronicle (the school's paper), just won a Pulitzer at the LA Times. The HW Chronicle did not mention suicide when discussing the deaths of these students/alums. Is that what we're teaching our future journalists? To hide the truth. Coincidentally, the Owner of the LA Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, is a HW Parent. His son Luke graduated from HW in 2014. It is wrong to suppress the news.  It has been reported that Dr Soon-Shiong's daughter, Nika, influenced the paper's endorsements (and its reporting) during the last LA City Election cycle. I remember a particularly unethical endorsement of Lindsey Horvath by the Times Editorial Board, which did not mention that she was buddies with Nika, that she had put Nika on the WeHo Public Safety Commission, or that Nika and Horvath both supported defunding law enforcement. That last very important position was not mentioned in the endorsement because it would have lost Horvath votes. The Times also endorsed Katy Yaroslavsky, who is now working under the radar to dismantle no camping zones in the City of LA's 5th Council District and throughout the Very Large City of LA (which has 15 council districts, each one of which is the size of a city)...she just voted against new no camping zones in Bob Blumenfield's Woodland Hills hood. She'll keep no camping zones for schools; she's not that stupid. But she's endangering us by attempting to get rid of all the non-school no camping zones that have been created...for good public safety reasons. Seemingly on a quest to repay a favor to Nika.  (Yuval Kremer is a former ballot candidate for Mayor of LA (not a fan of HW Alum and former Mayor Garcetti) and LA County Supervisor (ran against Sheila Kuehl, Katy's former boss. The opinions expressed by Yuval Kremer are his and not those of CityWatchLA.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHl3YXRjaGxhLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvY3cvdm9pY2VzLzI2OTYyLXN0dWRlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtYXQtaGFydmFyZC13ZXN0bGFrZS1uby1jb3ZlcmFnZS1pbi1hLW9uZS1uZXdzcGFwZXItdG93btIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thomas Hartwell, former Kane County circuit clerk, was found dead in his Palatine office Wednesday as a result of an apparent suicide, officials said. Hartwell had been facing several felony charges related to misusing county founds and receiving kickbacks. (Thomas M. “Tom” Hartwell campaign)  Former Kane County Circuit Clerk Thomas Hartwell, indicted last month on charges of misusing public money and receiving kickbacks, was found dead Wednesday morning in an apparent suicide, officials said.  Hartwell, 63, was discovered at his Palatine law firm office, according to the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office.  Advertisement  Kane County Sheriff Ron Hain said deputies were called to Hartwell’s home in unincorporated Elgin about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday by a family member who said Hartwell had been missing for about 24 hours.  At the deputies’ request, Palatine police checked the Collins, Radja & Hartwell law office, 330 W. Colfax St., where they discovered Hartwell had taken his own life, Hain said.  Advertisement  An autopsy has not been conducted yet and the cause of death has not been released. Palatine police said the investigation is ongoing.  In late April, Hartwell was indicted on felony theft and official misconduct charges in connection with the alleged misuse of nearly $120,000 in public funds while in he was in office, court records show.  He also was charged with several counts of committing wire fraud, money laundering, misapplying funds as a government employee and income tax fraud, according to court records.  The charges came after a two-year investigation by Illinois State Police and the Illinois Department of Revenue, officials said.  Hartwell was released from jail on a signature bond, and was next due in court May 26.  Hartwell’s brother, Todd, posted on note on Facebook about his brother’s death, encouraging people to “send prayers to his fiancé Liz and his two boys, David and Dan.”  “Tom was a man who followed Jesus Christ,” Todd Hartwell wrote. “A man of towering intellect and logic. Passionate about the things that matter and a mentor to many.”  The criminal investigation into possible wrongdoing started in January 2021, when Kane County State’s Attorney Jamie Mosser said she notified state police about what appeared to be Hartwell’s misappropriation of county funds.  Advertisement  It’s alleged that between December 2018 and November 2020, Hartwell may have steered $119,575 in public money to two companies run by Robert Gutierrez, of St. Charles, prosecutors said. Gutierrez, who served as president of the companies, allegedly gave Hartwell $15,000 in kickbacks.  Hartwell was also accused of failing to report income on his 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax returns, officials said.  It is unclear how the criminal case will proceed with Hartwell’s death. Gutierrez was indicted in April for theft by deception of greater than $100,000 and providing kickbacks, officials said.  Hartwell served as the circuit court clerk from 2012 to 2020, when he lost a reelection bid to current Circuit Clerk Theresa Barreiro. He ran unsuccessfully to be a circuit court judge in 2017.  Hartwell, a Republican, served as a Kane County Board member from 1996 to 2000 and was a former chairman of the Kane County Republican Party.  He was also a volunteer for numerous youth sports leagues and served as the former chairman of the board of the Elgin Recreation Center and Aurora Recreation Center. The youth programs were aimed at helping keep children from joining gangs.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Daily Press.  Newport News Shipbuilding workers and Navy sailors walk past the USS George Washington as it rests pier side the morning of Oct. 11, 2019. The aircraft carrier is about halfway through Refueling and Complex Overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. (Jonathon Gruenke / Daily Press)  After months spent investigating a series of suicides of Hampton Roads-based sailors last year, the Navy has concluded that it failed its own personnel on an individual and systemic level.  The Navy released Thursday the findings of a comprehensive investigation into command climate and sailor quality of life and details 48 recommendations. It is meant to address what Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea called “years worth of systemic shortcomings.”  Advertisement  “The tragedy of the suicides in the Norfolk area shows that the Navy can and must do a better job of caring for sailors and their families,” Honea said in a virtual media roundtable Thursday morning.  The investigation focused on the USS George Washington, which came under scrutiny after three sailors died by suicide within a week last year while the carrier was undergoing an extended overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. An initial investigation found “life stressors” contributed to the life-ending decisions of the three sailors, but concluded the deaths were otherwise not connected.  Advertisement  Less than eight months later, the Norfolk-based Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center reported four suicides within 28 days. A separate Navy investigation also released Thursday found those deaths were not connected.  But the investigations into both commands reflected a failure in maintaining a suitable Navy standard.  “In both cases there was an organizational drift — a slow erosion over time — conditions that were clearly not right became acceptable,” reads a memorandum signed by Adm. Michael Gilday, chief of naval operations, and Carlos Del Toro, secretary of the Navy.  [ Military given deadline to implement Brandon Act, aiming to help service members seek mental health care ]  The investigation into the Washington was launched with the purpose of evaluating the challenges unique to a shipyard environment. During the investigation into potential connections between the Washington suicides, sailors reported constant noise and cold temperatures aboard a shell of a ship that was periodically without hot water and power.  “The events of the past year have caused me to reflect on the ideas of ‘habitability’ versus ‘suitability.’ Our shipyard ships may be habitable and able to sustain life (a minimum standard), but not suitable from a quality of life standport (an acceptable standard),” Rear Adm. John Meier wrote in his endorsement of the investigation’s findings.  The Washington entered dry-dock in 2017 for its midlife refuel and complex overhaul. That process typically takes four years. But the pandemic lengthened it by two years.  Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces, said throughout the investigation, it was “pointedly obvious the Navy had failed the George Washington.” Since entering its maintenance period, the Washington has experienced nine suicides among its crew dating back to 2017.  The investigation recommends the Navy create a split-tour program that ensures first-term sailors are not assigned to dry-docked aircraft carriers for more than two years.  Advertisement  “We definitely want a sailor who joined the Navy to go to sea, to get that opportunity to see the ocean, get into a port call, experience why that person joined and not spend that entire tour in a maintenance facility,” Caudle said.  Meier also touched on this issue, writing in his endorsement letter: “These shipyard sailors hoped for more, to be part of something bigger than themselves, and be part of a team … Sailors joined the Navy ‘to see the world,’ accelerate their lives, or to be ‘forged by the sea,’ but not to see the shipyard or drive a bus.”  It is also recommended every sailor assigned to a ship in an industrial environment receives allowance for off-ship and off-base housing — a benefit that is not currently available to junior sailors.  “When not underway, no sailor should be required to live on a ship or barge, with the exception of the duty section,” Caudle said.  The investigation also recommends working with local government and industry to improve parking for sailors assigned to public and private shipyards.  At one point, the Navy partnered with Newport News Shipbuilding to secure 2,100 parking spaces across four Hampton Roads locations for Washington sailors. But the investigation found local infrastructure is still “insufficient” to support the crews of multiple aircraft carriers in overhaul and new construction in the shipyard.  Advertisement  “There remains inadequate parking, transportation, access to food and nutritional options, training space, physical fitness facilities and housing options available to support the number of sailors assigned to ships and submarines in the shipyard. This directly contributed to poor Sailor QoS and morale,” Caudle wrote in his endorsement of the findings.  Three of the parking locations are considered “too far to walk” and require a shuttle ride to the shipyard. Travel time from two locations, one in Chesapeake and one in Suffolk, averages more than 50 minutes one way.  A former executive officer of the Washington, who was not named, told investigators: “I said this was unacceptable but eventually saw the writing on the wall and stopped fighting because the discussion was going nowhere … I believe all RCOH carriers experience the same parking issues. This is a solvable problem and it’s really about money. It’s an issue of the burden we put on sailors versus the cost we are willing to pay for that parking.”  Daywatch Weekdays Start your morning with today's local news By submitting your email to receive this newsletter, you agree to our Subscriber Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy >  The Navy plans to establish a single, accountable senior civilian for the development of a long-term quality of service plan that is specific to Newport News Shipbuilding in an effort to improve the overall quality of life for shipyard-bound sailors.  “I am never going to try to give you a reason why it takes a large mishap incident, a 9-11 event, to make the Navy — my organization, which I love — wake up and attack a problem that we should have seen coming,” Caudle said.  In conjunction with the Washington quality of service investigation, the Navy released a “new course for Navy quality of service” memorandum.  Advertisement  According to the memo, the Navy will work for the next 90 days to identify a definitive timeline on when all recommendations would be implemented. But some long-term solutions will require congressional funding or authorization.  “The conditions experienced by those assigned to the USS George Washington and MARMC are not the result of any act or inaction by any single leader. Collectively, Navy senior leadership, officer and civilian, let our standards slip — and in doing so we let our people down,” the memorandum reads.

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Denpasar"", ""Bali"", ""Indonesia""}","Thu 18 May 2023 11:43:50","Indonesian police announced Wednesday that the deaths of a Chinese couple in tourist hotspot Bali was a murder-suicide, sparking widespread disbelief back home.  Police in Bali’s capital Denpasar said in a media briefing that 25-year-old Li Chiming beat then drowned his girlfriend Cheng Jianan, 22, in a bathtub at an InterContinental Hotel, local media NusaBali reported. He then committed suicide by stabbing himself with “a broken beer bottle in his neck and all over his body.”    There were no traces of anyone else in the room, local police said, adding that the conclusion was based on forensic investigations of the bodies and the crime scene.    The police said the incident was caused by “internal reasons” leading to a dispute, although an investigation into the exact motive is still ongoing.  The couple arrived in Bali on April 27 and had a dispute before arriving at the InterContinental hotel. They were found covered in blood and naked after drinking five bottles of beer ordered from room service, investigators said.    Back home, the investigation results have prompted more questions than answers for Chinese netizens. In response to a trending Weibo hashtag, which has received over 57 million views, a verified Weibo influencer questioned why the man crawled out into the corridor after stabbing himself.    In a Weibo poll, some 72% of more than 1,400 respondents questioned the investigation result, with only 13% of respondents saying that it is credible. In another Weibo poll that happened before the investigation result was announced, over half of the 36,000 respondents said they will not go to Bali again, while more than 6,000 respondents said that they had plans to go but not anymore.    Some netizens are calling for further investigation and even involvement from Chinese police.    With Chinese tourists’ enthusiasm for traveling to Southeast Asia already hit by dark rumors swirling online in recent months, the latest incident is likely to hit demand further. Li, a worker from Beijing, told local media Jiemian News that his wife’s company had organized a trip to Bali next month, but is now considering canceling or postponing.    Flight prices from Shanghai to Bali slumped more than 40% from an average of $575 in early April to around $383 over the past month, according to Google Flights data.    And it is not just Bali that could be affected. Zhang Yu, a tourist guide in Chiang Mai, Thailand, told Jiemian News that local travel agencies have seen their orders being canceled recently for safety reasons.    It comes after a Chinese businessman’s brutal death in Thailand on Tuesday jumped to the top of social media discussions. Local media reported that he was found with more than 20 knife wounds in a resort hotel room. Three suspects have been arrested.  Three Chinese tourists in Thailand were also robbed in violent fashion earlier this month.    Chinese tourists are a major source of income for both Thailand and Indonesia, which saw their local tourism industries suffer as a result of China’s COVID-19 restrictions on international tourism.  Following the lifting of these restrictions, more than 500,000 Chinese tourists visited Thailand in the first quarter of this year. However, April’s total of 237,000 travelers was “below expectations,” Thailand’s tourism bureau said recently.  Editor: Vincent Chow.

"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""Edinburgh"", ""Edinburgh"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:20:41","Scottish faith leaders urge Parliament not to legalize assisted suicide  Scottish faith leaders are making a joint plea to MSPs to reject the legalization of assisted suicide in Scotland.  The Moderator of the Church of Scotland General Assembly, the Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields, the Vice President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Scotland, Bishop John Keenan, and the Imam of Dundee Central Mosque, Imam Shaykh Hamza Khandwalla, held a meeting with MSPs at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday to express their opposition.  During their meeting, hosted by the Logos Scotland think-tank, they signed a statement voicing their ""deep concern"" over the proposals and urged MSPs to vote them down.  The statement says that assisted suicide undermines human dignity and puts pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.  ""Our faith traditions are united in the principle that assisted dying in itself inevitably undermines the dignity of the human person, and to allow it would mean that our society as a whole loses its common humanity,"" the statement says.  ""The Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques remain firm in their opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia.""  The latest campaign for the legalization of assisted suicide is being led by Liam McArthur, Lib Dem MSP for Orkney, whose Member's Bill would allow competent terminally ill adults to request assistance to end their life.  The faith leaders add in their joint statement, ""The ways in which similar laws in other countries are being applied, and the effect that its introduction would have on some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the disabled and the elderly, would be extremely detrimental.""  The statement ends with a call to MSPs ""to consider carefully the implications of this bill, to express their concerns, and to vote against it.""  Bishop Keenan said: ""Assisted suicide attacks human dignity and results in human life being increasingly valued on the basis of its efficiency and utility. Implicit in legal assisted suicide is that an individual can lose their value and worth.  ""Evidence from countries where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal shows that vulnerable people feel pressured to end their lives through fear of being a burden. In such situations, the option of assisted suicide is less about having a 'right' to die and more about feeling the full weight and expectation of a duty to die.  ""When vulnerable people, including the elderly and poor, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.""  The Rev. Greenshields said: ""Our opposition to assisted dying is based on our Christian faith, and involves concerns around the principle of assisted dying, around the application of the law in practice, the perception of the value of human lives, and also the effect which any change is likely to have on the provision of care — in particular, on palliative care.""

"suicide","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:15:00","While falls cause more worksite deaths than any other type of accident, prompting the Dept. of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to launch a new fall prevention program, there is growing recognition that there is another invisible jobsite danger in mental health disorders.  “Devastatingly, more construction workers die annually from suicide than from every other workplace-related fatality combined, making suicide rates in construction the second highest of any U.S. industry group,” wrote John F. Fish, chairman and CEO of Boston-based Suffolk Construction in a May 2 letter to the OSHA, urging it to include suicide awareness and prevention training as a core requirement in the OSHA 10 and OSHA 30 curricula.  Fish co-signed the letter with retired Brigadier General Jack Hammond, executive director of Home Base, a private clinic in Charlestown, Mass. that provides clinical treatment, wellness and other services for veterans and first responders.  An OSHA spokesperson says the agency ""recognizes that mental health stressors exist at work"" and noted that OSHA is ""currently exploring how we may better incorporate information to increase awareness and help employers recognize signs and symptoms of mental health concerns. Our goal is to better protect workers through education and outreach training programs.""      Sobering Statistics  Suicide rates were highest among males in construction at 53.2 suicides per 100,000 workers in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  A Construction Industry Rehabilitation Plan (CIRP) study found that 83% of construction workers have struggled with mental health issues although only a third said they would communicate this to their employers.  “Construction workers are four times more likely to commit suicide than any other occupation,” said Tim Stroud, Suffolk national chief operating officer, who recently hosted Suffolk's Mental Health Fireside Chat during Safety Week. While the industry doesn’t talk much about mental health, it is “a major issue in the industry,” he says.  Suffolk says it hopes to lay the foundation for providing workers with practical information about mental health awareness and strategies and approaches for managing it, he says.  Speaking during the fireside chat, Dr. Louis Chow, senior director at Home Base Training Institute and Network Development, says “one of the realities of the industry is that it is predominantly male, middle-aged and white … and easily associated with mental health outcomes including, unfortunately, completed suicides.” The focus needs to shift from remaining silent “to knowing when, where, and from whom to get help,” he says.      App-based Wellness  Firms across the country are coming up with new ways to battle the industry's mental health issues.  For example, Counslr.com on May 12 announced a partnership with Tri-Star Construction Corp. to provide Tri-Star workers with access to its platform providing unlimited access to mental health support with licensed counselors via its mobile app.  “When an organization partners with Counslr, their employees gain access to an unlimited number of live texting sessions with licensed counselors for one fixed price, all from within the Counslr mobile app,"" says Josh Liss, Counslr, CEO. “Licensed mental health professionals are on-call around the clock, so covered employees can hold a session any time or day, either on-demand or by scheduled appointment,” he says.  Douglas Dupas, vice president and director of operations at Tri-Star, says despite working in a ""stressful"" industry, they can better serve their clients, which include architects, subcontractors and vendors, ""by having access to licensed mental health professionals.""  He says that's ""key to helping us maintain our high standard of service. One of our core values is dedicated teamwork and having such a helpful resource like Counslr at our disposal helps the entire team stay on top of their game.”      Behavioral Changes  Lyra Health, a Burlingame, Calif.-based provider of global workforce mental health benefits, provides benefit-based wellness support to Suffolk workers.  Suffolk relies on Lyra wellness webinars to help employees learn observational skills that can help prevent suicide. Employees are encouraged to look for signs of change in teammates in four broad categories. The first involves changes in mood or behavior; the second, statements about their health and wellness such as not eating or sleeping; the third, any change in cognition, such as having trouble concentrating; and the fourth, any indication they are thinking about harming themselves.  ""It is valuable for everyone to be able to notice signs of distress in coworkers,"" says Dr. Joe Grasso, senior director at Lyra. ""The goal is not to turn everyone into therapists, but to recognize basic broad, high level signs that someone could be in a state of mental health distress, so they can check in and be referred for appropriate resources.""  Employees also learn about strategies for managing daily stress. This could include having a worker notice when they get stressed by monitoring tension in their body or deciding if they want to work on their stress by asking the question: Is stress serving or blocking you? Deep breathing and body scans are other strategies Suffolk offers in its mental health toolbox.  Lyra offers a range of care options. including in-person video conferencing, text messaging through a Lyra mobile app; and 24/7 access to their in-house concierge, a Suffolk spokesperson says. Typically, ""the first interaction will be with a care advocate who can transfer a member to a licensed care navigator if that member needs to speak with a licensed clinician to help with their search for care or provide in-the-moment support,"" he says.  Suffolk pays Lyra to have employees receive 16 free sessions per year, but the fee per session is not a fixed rate since every provider has different contracted rates based on factors such as experience, location, and specialties.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTY0NjQtY29udHJhY3RvcnMtYm9vc3Qtd2VsbG5lc3MtcHJvZ3JhbXMtdG8tcHJldmVudC1zdWljaWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Catoosa County Sheriff Gary Sisk says the woman was armed and suicidal, and raised a firearm in her driveway, which forced deputies to fire their service weapon ""four to five times.""  The incident happened at a home on Foster Lane a little before 6 p.m.  Sheriff Sisk says deputies responded to a call that a woman was armed with a handgun and threatening to kill herself.  While on the way to the scene, deputies were told shots were being fired inside of the home.  Arriving deputies found the woman in the driveway of the residence, holding the handgun in her hand, according to Sheriff Sisk.  A release says  Deputies took cover, observed the woman raise her gun toward them, and fired their service weapons four to five times.    The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) later described the situation this way:  The deputies gave verbal commands for [the woman] to drop her weapon. She refused to comply. [The woman] advanced toward the deputies with the handgun pointed directly at them. The deputies fired multiple times. [The woman] was hit.  (Though the GBI identified the woman, it is NewsChannel 9's longstanding practice to not identify people who are suicidal or have died by suicide).  Those deputies immediately ran to the woman to provide first aid, and an ambulance later rushed the woman to Erlanger hospital.  The GBI says the woman is now in critical but stable condition.  No one else was hurt.  All of the deputies involved are now in administrative leave with pay, as is standard procedure for incidents like this.

"suicide","2023-04-26","22:00:00","{""Lenexa"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:00:00","LENEXA, Kan. — The mother of Mikey Williamson, one of the victims in a high-profile double murder-suicide in February 2022 in Lenexa, is sharing her son’s story with KSHB 41.  She’s never spoken publicly about the incident until now.  “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t relive that in some way, but also I do a lot of things to heal,” said Melanie Williamson, Mikey's mother.  Police said an ex-boyfriend of Mikey’s friend, Sara Beck, tracked her with a GPS device. The KSHB 41 I-Team previously spoke with Sara’s father, Desmond Theel, about the case.  “As a father, it’s kind of hard not to look inward, look at myself, and ask myself, 'What did I do wrong?'” Theel said.  Since the double murder-suicide, state lawmakers in Kansas have taken action to strengthen stalking laws, with Gov. Laura Kelly signing a bill into law in late April.  The change comes after a series of reports from the I-Team about the case.  “With all of the technology now, it’s a stalker’s dream to be able to pinpoint the location of their intended victims, so I’m very glad we got this done,” Kelly said.  REMEMBERING MIKEY  Melanie Williamson  Melanie Williamson cherishes the tokens left for her son at his gravesite. It brings her joy when she visits him with family friends.  “It’s just important to know that they’re remembered and to see how loved they are or he is,” she said.  In February 2022, Mikey and his friend Sara were victims of a double murder-suicide. They worked together and knew each other for only a few weeks.  Melanie said they both enjoyed outdoor activities — Mikey loved fishing and Sara rode horses.  “She seemed like a really nice girl. I would’ve liked to gotten to know her,” she said.  WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT  KSHB 41  Lenexa police said Sara’s ex-boyfriend tracked her with a GPS device to Melanie’s house, where Mikey lived.  Police said the ex-boyfriend shot Sara and Mikey before taking his own life.  “I mean it was horrifying,"" Melanie said. ""I mean we woke up to gunshots, and then he was in the room right next to us.""  That night, Melanie said Mikey was out with his friends. When he got home, Mikey shut his parents’ bedroom door to let them know they could go to sleep.  Melanie later made the horrifying discovery.  “I immediately went into shock, and I think I stayed there for a good three to four months, truthfully,” she said.  FINDING JOY  KSHB 41  Time has helped Melanie heal. Still, she says she will never forget her son who was only 20 years old.  “He had a lot more to do,"" she said. ""It’s just horrible that it happened this way, but I have to be grateful for the good things.""  Melanie has fond memories of Mikey fishing at a nearby pond with his friends. Those memories are why the family chose a particular spot in the cemetery and etched a fisherman next to his name.  “There’s a lot of joy that lives alongside the grief, and you have to fight for that but it’s there,” she said.  Melanie’s focus is now all about finding joy, looking for glimpses in pictures she took of her son.  “He was so full of life and happiness,” she said.  CHANGE IN KANSAS LAW  KSHB 41  In late April, Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill into law that will strengthen stalking laws in Kansas.  “I just think that everything we can do to keep people safe, we should be doing,” Melanie said.  The bill makes clear tracking devices or tracking device data will be part of the stalking criteria. It also helps protect those who have restraining orders or protection orders by clarifying the law about tracking devices.  Kansas now joins more than 20 other states with laws on the books about the devices.  “I hope it’s enough,” Melanie said.  In Missouri, a similar bill was filed in the legislature. It would ban someone from putting a tracking device on someone’s car without the owner’s consent.  It did not make it through the legislature this session.  —","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2hiLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvaS1ob3BlLWl0cy1lbm91Z2gtbW90aGVyLW9mLWxlbmV4YS1kb3VibGUtbXVyZGVyLXN1aWNpZGUtdmljdGltLXNwZWFrcy1hcy1rYW5zYXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtc3RhbGtpbmctbGF30gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzaGIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy9pLWhvcGUtaXRzLWVub3VnaC1tb3RoZXItb2YtbGVuZXhhLWRvdWJsZS1tdXJkZXItc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0tc3BlYWtzLWFzLWthbnNhcy1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1zdGFsa2luZy1sYXc_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2021-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:25:28","(The Hill) — America faces a large and growing public health problem: suicide by men.  More than 38,000 men died by suicide in 2021, the highest number and rate of deaths in 20 years. Men die of suicide at four times the rate of women.  As a societal issue, male suicide has been somewhat overshadowed by the very real mental health crisis afflicting American women and girls.  Thirty-seven percent of women have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of men, and those rates are rising, according to Gallup survey data released Wednesday.  Paradoxically, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to die by suicide. The main reason is firearms.  A person who attempts suicide with a gun is many times more likely to die than someone who uses another method, such as pills or self-inflicted cuts. Firearms figure in only 5 percent of suicide attempts but in over half of deaths.  America may lead the developed world in suicide attempts, according to a 2008 study of suicidal ideation in 17 countries.  Many who attempt suicide are conflicted and irresolute. Too often, a gun makes the decision final.  “Even at the moment when the person has decided to make the attempt, there’s a lot of ambivalence,” said Elly Stout, a suicide prevention specialist at the nonprofit Education Development Center. “If you take a bunch of pills, there is a moment where you can change your mind.”  Between 2015 and 2020, federal data shows, 122,178 men died of suicide by firearm, compared to 19,297 women. Together, those deaths represented about 2.5 million years of lost human life.  The second most common method of suicide, suffocation, claimed 59,382 men and 17,088 women in that half-decade span. Suffocation typically means death by hanging, or by covering the head to cut off the supply of air.  Drug poisoning, which was the third most common, was the only significant suicide method more prevalent among women (16,678 deaths) than men (12,641).  The rise in male suicides mirrors the rise of guns in America. The nation purchased nearly 60 million firearms between 2020 and 2022, part of a larger cycle of panic-buying amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  More Americans died of gun violence in 2020 and 2021 than in any prior year on record. The majority of those deaths were suicides.  “Our suicide rates are very much tied to firearms,” said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina.  By age and gender, the demographic group most likely to die of suicide is elderly men. Men older than 75 died in suicides at a rate of 42.2 per 100,000 Americans in 2021, the highest quotient for men or women of any age.  “Some of that is kind of related to our stereotypes of masculinity,” said Julie Cerel, a suicide researcher at the University of Kentucky. “If you’re no longer in your prime, what’s the point of it all? People who are widowed, people who are no longer able to provide.”  Yet, over the past 20 years, suicides among elderly men are relatively flat.  More alarming, perhaps, is the swift rise in suicides among the young. The suicide rate for boys and young men in the 15-24 age group rose by nearly half between 2001 and 2021, from 16.5 per 100,000 people to 23.8.  The suicide rate for girls and women in the same age group more than doubled in the same span, to 6.1 per 100,000.  Suicides among girls ages 10-14, almost unknown 20 years ago, rose to 2.3 per 100,000 in 2021.  Girls and women, too, are dying by self-inflicted gunshot wounds in greater numbers than in years past.  “It used to be that firearms were rarely used by women,” Cerel said. “The myth used to be that women wouldn’t use methods of taking their life that would change how they look, essentially, and that doesn’t seem to be the case.”  The easy availability of firearms is an obvious factor in the prevalence of suicide among men. Other reasons speak to the essence of American masculinity.  Society encourages girls to open up about their mental health and to seek therapy for depression, a skill set discouraged in boys.  “Boys and men haven’t been socialized to talk about mental health concerns. They’ve historically been thought of as weaknesses,” Cerel said. “The expectation for males in this country is, they’re strong, they’re independent, they take care of themselves, they don’t need help.”  Women are twice as likely as men to seek mental health treatment, according to federal data.  And why are young people becoming more prone to suicide? One factor may be a sense of belonging, which, in recent years, seems to be slipping away.  Men, in particular, have struggled in recent years to make friends and form relationships.  “I think we don’t have as much of a sense of connectedness in our communities,” said Nadine Kaslow, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Emory University School of Medicine.  “When I was growing up, everybody in the neighborhood knew everybody,” Kaslow said. “That’s changed. It’s this sense of isolation and loneliness.”  Much was made of the nation’s collective ennui during the pandemic. Yet, suicide rates actually ticked down in 2020. Why? Because everyone was home.  “During the summer, during holiday breaks, during the pandemic, those rates actually went down,” Cerel said.  It’s true: People are actually less prone to suicide during the holidays. Suicide rates rise in spring and summer, “when people get away from each other and go out in the world,” Cerel said.  Solitude and suicide travel hand in hand. Humans don’t want to die where loved ones will find them, both because of the trauma such a discovery will inflict and because a loved one might try to save them.  Some of Cerel’s research focuses on exploding the myth that only a few loved ones suffer when someone dies by suicide.  A longstanding theory held that every suicide left roughly six people behind. Cerel found the number closer to 135, a massive circle of friends and loved ones who may need mental health support to endure the loss. Tragically, suicide can beget more suicide.  “For many people, losing someone to suicide opens the door to suicidality where it hadn’t been open before,” she said.  Social media plays an ambiguous role in suicide. Many reports have suggested a link between TikTok and Instagram and worsening mental health. But researchers see potential benefits in those platforms.  “Social media is a place where people who are marginalized can get help,” Cerel said. “And you can find online social support when you don’t have it at home.”  Our nation’s mental health investment stands in dire need, suicide experts say.  All Americans could benefit from an annual mental health checkup, on top of the standard physical checkup, Prinstein said.  Sadly, the mental health checkup isn’t really a thing, partly because of enduring stigmas around mental health.  Psychotherapists are spread thin. The nation spends hundreds of times more money training its medical workforce than preparing mental health providers, Prinstein said.  As a result, rural Americans may find themselves an hour’s drive from the nearest therapist, a scenario hard to imagine in medicine.  “There’s not as much access as we need,” Kaslow said.

Gwendolyn Bass-Kemp, 71, was killed in the May 11 murder-suicide that ended with a house fire allegedly orchestrated by her boyfriend, 71-year-old Richard McDonald.  Almost a week after the tragedy, the family broke their silence Wednesday by way of a poignant statement, expressing their grief and shock over the devastating loss of their cherished mother.  NBC6's Kim Wynne has more on the scene that resulted in two people dead.  Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.  ""We were robbed of our precious mother in the most egregious and heinous way imaginable,"" the family’s statement read, in part. ""Never did we think that a man we treated like family and with such kindness, would commit such a senseless, cold and calculated act with the intent to cause pain and suffering to us all.""  The gruesome incident unfolded in what neighbors said a normally quiet neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale on Northwest 27th Terrace.  According to police, McDonald fatally shot Bass-Kemp before setting their home on fire. The incident escalated into a tense stand-off with SWAT, ending with McDonald taking his own life.  Bass-Kemp had worked for Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue since 2005 as a billing specialist.  NBC6's Ryan Nelson has the latest after a long-time employee of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue was killed in what police are calling a murder-suicide.  The family recounted Bass-Kemp's aspirations to retire and move closer to her other children, a plan they believe might have upset McDonald.  ""Our mother was just weeks away from officially retiring and relocating out-of-state to be closer to her other children and grandchildren. She had planned to ultimately leave the relationship and likely expressed this to [him], which upset him,"" the family's statement read. ""Because she was the sole financial provider, this would have left him displaced, and we believe that he just simply could not fathom her leaving, and him being left to fend for himself.""  Bass-Kemp's family plans to honor her legacy by raising awareness about the danger of domestic violence, vowing to illuminate this issue that has now tragically affected their family.  They intend to commemorate and celebrate Bass-Kemp's life within the South Florida community, continuing the legacy established by her father, Dr. James Bass.  The family concluded their statement by expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received in the aftermath of this tragedy and requested respect for their privacy.  ""We want to extend our thanks to everyone for the outpouring of love we have been receiving, and many thanks you to those who are supporting our family,"" the statement read.

(KOIN) – A man was arrested Thursday for allegedly helping his girlfriend die by suicide in The Dalles in March – using an idea from an infamous Massachusetts case that made national headlines.  Joseph Newman, 60, will face charges for manslaughter in the second degree after investigators say he bought a gas powered water pump, fueled it up and showed Alexander Cagle, 29, how to start it.  Cagle then took the U-Haul truck they had rented together to a parking lot, where she started the machine and died, according to the Wasco County District Attorney’s office.  District Attorney Matt Ellis said he was originally hesitant to take it to the grand jury, but eventually felt he “owed it to the victim’s family to at least put this in front of the grand jury and let them decide. Ellis said he looked for precedent cases, too, and “didn’t see much case law that came after the seventies on this particular theory of manslaughter in the second degree.”  Ellis said Cagle suffered from mental health issues and had previously spent some time in the Unity Hospital in Portland, where Newman picked her up. According to Ellis, Cagle sent Newman an article about the infamous Michelle Carter case in Massachusetts and said she wanted to do something similar.  Carter had been convicted for texting and encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to use a generator in his truck to create carbon monoxide poisoning.  “It’s one of those areas where…this person’s behavior is quite disturbing and an abhorrent that – to be in this relationship with somebody who’s suicidal – to give them the means to do something like this,” Ellis said. “It’s a very gray area of our legal system.”  Stay with KOIN 6 as this story develops.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL25ld3Mvb3JlZ29uL2RhLW1hbi1mYWNlcy1hcnJlc3Qtd2FycmFudC1mb3ItaGVscGluZy1naXJsZnJpZW5kLWNvbW1pdC1zdWljaWRlLWluLXRoZS1kYWxsZXMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29pbi5jb20vbmV3cy9vcmVnb24vZGEtbWFuLWZhY2VzLWFycmVzdC13YXJyYW50LWZvci1oZWxwaW5nLWdpcmxmcmllbmQtY29tbWl0LXN1aWNpZGUtaW4tdGhlLWRhbGxlcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:18:45","The 31 year old Google software engineer who took his own life on May 4 by jumping from the 14th floor of the tech giant’s New York City HQ in Chelsea was described by one college friend as brilliant mind who graduated from Carnegie Mellon but was prone to deep and debilitating depression.  Police this week identified the suicide victim as Kevin Rawlings a senior engineer at Google. He was a computer science major with a degree from the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University who spent seven and a half years working for Google over three different employement stints.  College fraternity brother Jesse Salazar said Rawlings was an outgoing, fun loving guy until a close family member fell ill in Rawling’s junior year, sending him spiraling into deep depression.  “He had a 4.0 straight through until then,” said Salazar. “He stopped going to classes, started drinking heavily, and not coming out of his room.”  He said frat brothers had petitioned professors to at least let him try to pass the final exams and he said they managed to get him to study intensely for a few days before he took the exams. “He got above a 3.9--a 3.98 or 3.99,” Salazar recalled. “He was brilliant.” He said his friend went on to graduate with a near perfect 4.0 and seemed to have gotten over the paralyzing depression for awhile.  But in 2019, his older brother Robert passed away suddenly at the age of 34 and then COVID-19 hit.  Salazar also said he was difficult to keep in contact with him in recent years and he had not learned about his friend’s passing until contacted by this reporter.  ”We had wild, spontaneous fun in his college years,” recalled Salazar, “He was very outgoing.”  ”I don’t know what to think about what happened there,” said Salazar. “I do know one thing, it would have had nothing to do with the workload at Google. He eats problem solving for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Google was like his safe place if that makes any sense.”  Rawlings had worked at Google for three separate stretches and in his last most recent stretch was there from August 2022 until he took his own life around 11:30 pm on May 4, by jumping off the 14th floor of Google’s HQ in Chelsea on Eighth Ave and 15th Street.  Police had discovered Rawlings unconscious in the street outside Google’s Chelsea Headquarters after responding to numerous 911 calls. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Prior to returning to Google in August, 2022, he had worked at Hudson River Trading for a year from Feb. 2021 until Feb. 2022. Executives there did not return messages seeking comment. He had spent two earlier stints at Google, from Jan. 2020 until Jan. 2021 and a three year stretch from November 2013 until December 2016, sandwiched around a year spent working at Mountain View, CA-based Waymo, which was the self driving car division at Google which it eventually spun off.  During his college years, he had interned for three years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD and in 2008 created a tool for real-time 3D visualization and measurement of nanostructures. It earned him the Issac Newton Award for Outstanding Projects from the Washington Academy of Sciences, according to Rawlings Linked in page.  “Growing up in the suburbs of Maryland, Kevin excelled at sports, including baseball and swimming,” according to an obituary posted on Legacy.com by his family. “He was an enthusiastic runner and weight-lifter, always trying to outdo his personal best records. Kevin enjoyed playing Texas Hold’em with friends, and recently started playing pickleball and kickball.”  The obituary said he is survived by his parents, Mark and Barbara Rawlings of Lake Frederick, VA, his paternal grandmother, Norma Rawlings of Ellicott City, MD, his sister Jennifer Wernly (Mark) of Norfolk, VA, and his three nieces, Anna, Eleanor, and Kara.  “Kevin was a wonderful son, sibling, and Uncle, and we will forever miss him dearly,” the obituary stated. Plans for a remembrance service were still being formulated at the time of publication.  He was the second Google worker to take his own life in NYC this year although the two do not appear to be connected.  On Feb. 16th, the NYPD discovered 33 year old Jacob Pratt dead after apparently hanging himself in his Chelsea apartment on the corner of W. 26th St. and Sixth Ave.  Straus News has reached out to Google for comment, but had not heard back at the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0c2lkZXNwaXJpdC5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc3VpY2lkZS12aWN0aW0taWRlbnRpZmllZC1tYXJrcy0ybmQtd29ya2VyLWF0LXRlY2gtZ2lhbnQtdG8tdGFrZS1vd24tbGlmZS1pbi1jaGVsc2VhLXRoaXMteWVhci1YQTI1MzQxMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2022-07-27","00:00:00","{""Huson"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:19:39","Brandon Guffey's 17-year-old son Gavin died by suicide after he said Gavin fell victim to a sexual extortion scheme online, and now he's fighting to protect other kids from this crime.  Sexual extortion, or ""sextortion,"" is a form of blackmail where victims are lured into sending explicit images online and then threatened to do something they don't want to do, like send more photos or money.  ""I tell people all the time, Gavin was not depressed,"" Guffey told ABC News. ""He was, in my opinion, living his best life before he took his own.""  Now, the Republican state lawmaker from Rock Hill, South Carolina, is pushing through a piece of legislation (H 3583) that would criminalize sextortion in the state. It passed the state house and senate and will head to the governor's desk soon.  Under the proposed law, perpetrators who extort minors or at-risk adults could face up to 20 years in prison. According to Guffey, elevating these crimes to felonies will also give law enforcement the ability to cross state lines to chase down alleged perpetrators.  An increase in reported cases  Thorn, an organization dedicated to ending the sexual exploitation of children, started tracking this type of online grooming pre-pandemic and said it saw a ""dramatic increase in reports"" during the pandemic and in recent months.  Between 2019 and 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of reports made to its organization involving the sextortion of children or teens more than doubled.  ""I don't know that we necessarily armed our children with the tools that they needed to be safe in the face of this type of extortion or built our platforms in a way that would create a safe environment,"" Thorn's CEO Julie Cordua told ABC News.  In early 2023, the FBI issued a national public safety alert regarding an ""explosion in incidents of children and teens being coerced."" According to the FBI, law enforcement agencies saw 3,000 minor victims targeted in 2022, with the majority of them being boys.  In most reported cases, experts said the first contact is made through social media where young male victims are led to believe they are exchanging messages with a girl their own age.  Guffey told ABC News that Gavin received an Instagram message on July 27, 2022, from an account posing as a teenage girl, just around midnight. About an hour and a half after that first contact, Gavin took his own life.  Gavin Guffey, 17, from Rock Hill, S.C., seen here in an undated file photo was a one-of-a-kind guy his dad told ABC News. Courtesy Guffey family  ""I refused to believe it at first. There's no way that he could have been under that much stress that quickly that it would have caused this decision,"" Guffey said  In the weeks following Gavin's funeral, Guffey said various family members received dozens of threatening Instagram messages demanding money to keep the explicit images private. That's when Guffey connected the dots and uncovered what had pushed his son to suicide.  ""Did I tell you your son begged for his life,"" read one of the Instagram messages, according to Guffey.  Gavin's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, and Homeland Security.  ""We support legislation that empowers law enforcement to pursue those who commit the heinous act of sextortion and applaud Representative Guffey’s efforts on this bill. No family should ever have to experience a tragedy like this,"" a Meta spokesperson told ABC News. ""We want teens to have a safe experience on our apps, and we’ve built technology and tools to help protect our users from criminals and scammers of this kind.""  ""We encourage teens and adults to report suspicious or harmful content, activity or accounts in our apps if they feel unsafe, and we take action and will reach out to law enforcement in cases of imminent harm. Teens can also use NCMEC’s Take It Down, a new tool we supported that helps prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future,"" Meta's statement continued.  Experts said the number of young victims impacted is likely much larger than reported because many do not come forward.  ""I believe we've got to start wearing our shame as adults if we want our kids to understand that it's okay,"" to ask for help, said Guffey, who decided with his wife to share Gavin's story in order to raise public awareness.  And that's exactly what happened when Christina and Jason Scheffer, from Huson, Montana, heard about Gavin's case.  Waylon Scheffer is shown in this undated photo is described by his family as a true Montana boy who loved fishing and hunting. Kelsey Farago Photography  Their son, Waylon Scheffer, was just 16 years old when they say scammers drove him to take his own life on Dec. 14, 2022. The Scheffers said talking with Guffey helped them understand the intricacies of how scammers used social media to prey on their own teenage son.  ""I got your nude,"" reads one of the threatening messages sent to Waylon and reviewed by ABC News. ""I will start sending your nude and put it on the newspaper, and make sure I make life miserable for you.""  Waylon's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement.  Waylon and Gavin are among the more than a dozen American teenage boys who have lost their lives after being threatened and extorted online this past year, said the FBI.  ""The best advice that I give that I think to give parents is to not allow your children to have any of their devices in private rooms such as bathrooms and bedrooms,"" Guffey said.  Out of the darkness  ""The greatest harm will be if the perpetrator wins because the child is ashamed and afraid,"" Cordua said. She told ABC News that creating a blame-free space will help your child feel safe enough to come forward if something goes wrong.  ""Talk about this stuff,"" agreed Jason Scheffer, who had spoken to his son on multiple occasions about these types of scams.  And since Waylon's passing, Scheffer said his school will introduce a phone safety training class for both parents and students.  As part of Guffey's bill, school districts will also be required to educate students about sextortion on an annual basis.  ""This is the best part of the bill, in my opinion, because the hardest thing to do is to raise awareness to get parents and students talking about this,"" said Guffey.  What about the platforms  Experts said disappearing messages on WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat create a false sense of security. Because of these features, a teen may feel more comfortable sharing an explicit image, but experts said scammers often record the conversation.  Snapchat and Instagram notify users if another user takes screenshots or screen-recording their chat, but this doesn't stop perpetrators from finding workarounds.  ""Any form of sexual exploitation is abhorrent and illegal and we have dedicated teams that work closely with authorities, experts, and industry partners to combat it,"" a Snapchat spokesperson told ABC News.  ""We have extra protections in place on Snapchat for under 18s that make it harder for them to be discovered and contacted by people they don't know,"" the spokesperson added.  Gavin Guffey pictured with his dad Brandon, his mom, and his two younger brothers is seen here in an undated file photo. Courtesy Guffey family  Cordua said that platforms are sitting on troves of data that could help inform how to add more protections for all users. For example, if an account is flagged by multiple users, especially young users, that should raise a flag on the platform side.  ""There's a pattern in this data, and so platforms have the ability to see what is happening and identify where the risk factors are on their platform,"" she added. Cordua said they could consider adding a few more ""road bumps"" that would help pull young people out of conversations with adults.  Parents said they want to see the platforms do more to protect their children from online predators. ""I firmly believe they are letting this terrorism happen across their platform,"" said Jason Scheffer. ""They're not doing anything about it.""

"suicide","2023-04-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 04:20:00","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Alaska is number one in the country for youth suicide, according to numbers compiled by Alaska Public Health Analytics and Providence Hospital, and Alaska Natives are at highest risk according to a recent CDC study.  That study shows Alaska Natives and American Indians suffer more depression and cases of mental illness than any other group. Alaska Natives have long dealt with generational trauma, trauma that can begin before a person is even born and can be made worse through cultural influences or long periods of exposure to difficult home situations. Experts point out that difficult family situations are not unique to Alaska Native youth.  The Farrally family says they know this all too well, as raising their daughter hasn’t been easy.  “The anxiety, depression and then just the anger that she just doesn’t know how to control or deal with,” said Sonia Farrally, when speaking about her adopted daughter, Twilla. “She has scars up and down her arm from cutting.”  Farrally has been battling her daughter’s mental illness for years. Twilla was actually her niece and she adopted the child when she was just a baby. Born to alcoholic parents, Twilla was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome.  “Body weight, height, all the things doctors look at for her growth, she was below the chart lines,” Farrally said. “She wasn’t even on the graph.”  Twilla’s odds were stacked against her from the start. As she grew, even the simplest things seemed like major obstacles.  “Try to get her to take a shower, she would go two or three weeks,” Farrally said. “Or try to get a change of clothes and she’d wear the same clothes for two to three weeks.”  Twilla’s biological family lived in the village of Crooked Creek. Farrally, half Alaska Native herself, says she turned to Native hospitals for help with Twilla, but had little luck.  “She is Alaska Native and then we still can’t get into any of those programs that are Alaska Native based,” Farrally said. “The waitlist, because you just don’t have enough people.”  A study recently released by the Centers for Disease Control found the need is there. In 2021, Alaska Native and American Indian high school students registered the worst on key mental health markers including seriously considering suicide, making a suicide plan and attempting suicide.  By junior high, Twilla’s therapists feared for her safety as well. Farrally says Twilla kept most of her rage bottled up, choosing to hurt herself instead.  “She would find anything and everything to use to cut and she would, she would slice on her right arm mostly, and sometimes on one of her thighs,” Farrally said.  By 2020, Twilla was in her teens, had been kicked out of high school and was sent to a mental health facility in Texas for 11 months.  “One of the hardest things I’ve ever done,” Farrally said. “You don’t ever want to leave your kid behind at a facility you don’t know, and a state you don’t know.”  When Twilla returned home her parents say she also returned to her old ways. During a violent episode, she threw a hammer at her father.  “She needs to learn her actions are having a major consequence,” Farrally said.  Twilla was sent to a juvenile detention facility. On April 27, 2023, she spent her 18th birthday there. Her parents don’t know what will happen to her next.  “It does hurt,” Farrally said. “I mean the only thing we know; we can say is that she’s in a safe place, she can’t hurt herself.”  Experts say trauma and mental health issues, such as those suffered by Twilla, are common in Alaska Native communities.  “In terms of substance abuse and mental health, it’s going to be a multi-factorial story and trauma’s certainly a piece of it, the response to trauma, the desire to numb,” psychiatrist Lisa Alexia said.  Alexia previously worked with the Southcentral Foundation for over 10 years. She’s now in private practice. She has experience helping children throughout Southcentral and Western Alaska villages.  “Schools theoretically teach skills to help you survive in an urban setting but they don’t do that adequately in most village schools,” Alexia said.  Alexia says children in Alaska, and particularly in western villages, are also uniquely affected by the changes in sunlight through the seasons and school days that fail to match the body’s natural rhythms.  “Alaskan students and Alaskan youth are the most sleep deprived in the nation,” Alexia said. “This is an artificial structure that we’ve imposed, it’s an unconsented public health experiment and we have enough evidence to say sleep deprivation causes mental health issues, it increases risks of suicide.”  Every child with mental illness struggles with their own form of darkness. Twilla’s parents hope she’ll see the light before it’s too late.  “There is hope,” Farrally said. “That’s all we can keep hoping for is to give her everything that she needs and know that we love her unconditionally.”  Farrelly said though Twilla is still in a juvenile detention center, she is doing better. Presbyterian Hospitality House has completed Twilla’s intake process and she has been accepted. She is now at the top of the waitlist and hopes to have a bed available sometime in June.

"suicide","2019-04-16","10:00:00","{""Farmington"", ""NewMexico"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:05:23","Gunman removed body armor before gunbattle, said ‘shoot me,’ chief says  ×  At a news conference Thursday, Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe revealed that the investigation suggests suspected gunman Beau Wilson intended to commit suicide by cop at the conclusion of his rampage Monday morning on a neighborhood street.  Wilson began shooting at his father’s home in the 100 block of Dustin Avenue, using an AR-15 rifle and firing from outside the while moving around the property, police said.  The three victims killed were shot with the rifle in front of the shooter’s house. The first, Shirley Voita, was driving south on Dustin Avenue when she was shot. She exited her car, and Ring doorbell footage released by the police showed the vehicle continue to roll down the street with the driver’s side door open.  Hebbe said that citizens “who came out and were providing blankets and doing everything that they could for Shirley, who was lying in the street while officers were off dealing with the suspect.”  Footage also shows Ivie and Schofield’s car traveling north on Dustin Avenue, then slowing almost directly in front the shooter’s house and pulling to the curb.  Hebbe said they believe they might have seen Voita in the road and stopped. The shooter shot into their vehicle from in front of the car, killing both women.  The Ring footage perspective was from a home on the opposite side of the street from the shooter’s residence and several houses south.  The AR-15 was abandoned at the residence, and the shooter continued south on Dustin Avenue, shooting indiscriminately with a .22-caliber and a 9 mm handgun.  Along the way, the shooter discarded the .22-caliber handgun and removed his body armor.  New Mexico State Police officer Andreas Stamatiadas was traveling north on Dustin Avenue, opposite the approach of Farmington police officers. The shooter opened fire on the patrol vehicle, shooting Stamatiadas. He continue driving north and ultimately drove himself to the hospital for treatment.  ×  Four Farmington officers confronted the shooter at 713 N. Dustin Ave., where he was shot and killed.  All four officers fired on the shooter, with Sgt. Rachel Discenza being shot in the pelvic region. She fell to her knees after being shot, but still attempted to stand and continue toward the shooter before before falling again. Officers on scene rendered initial aid.  Watching the video, Hebbe said he knew there were a lot of shots being fired from reports, but actually hearing it “sounded like you were watching Afghanistan or Iraq, like you’re watching the sound of combat,” and he was “not prepared for that.”  When asked whether the shooter intended to commit suicide by cop, Hebbe said that while “it’s very difficult to be inside somebody’s mind,” the shooter had opportunities to leave the area and avoid police officers and did not take them. He instead appeared to take a stand with the 9 mm handgun.  That, along with the fact that he removed his body armor and at one point video footage captures him yelling, “Come kill me,” Hebbe said, “It is my belief that ultimately, in his head, he has made a decision that he is going to stand and fight it out until he’s killed.”  This story will continue to be updated with more news and videos from the scene.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mYXJtaW5ndG9uLWd1bm1hbi1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXN1Z2dlc3RzLXN1aWNpZGUtYnktY29wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2012-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:00:57","It begins with Donna Summer onstage, moaning through the breathy “Love to Love You Baby” and ends with her wiping tears from her eyes, decades later, during a poignant performance of “If There is Music There.”  The juxtaposition between orgasmic writhing and introspective balladry is indicative of Summer’s oft-contradictory life, explored in “Love to Love You, Donna Summer.”  The HBO documentary, co-directed by Summer’s daughter Brooklyn Sudano and Oscar winner Roger Ross Williams (“Music By Prudence”), arrives Saturday as a hopscotching overview of the woman dubbed the First Lady of Love.  But, as Summer says in a voice over, “I have a secret life. What you see is not what I am.”  So dim the lights and glimpse what the film reveals about Summer’s life:  Donna Summer had a complicated history: 'She just tried to keep her sanity'  The Summer documentary coincides with the 11-year anniversary of her death from lung cancer at age 63.  Throughout her career, which included pop-disco baubles “Bad Girls,” “Last Dance” and “On the Radio,” Summer was rightfully heralded as a trailblazer. The first artist to use a drum machine on a song (“I Feel Love”). The first Black female performer to have a video on MTV. The topic of a Broadway musical (“Summer: The Donna Summer Musical”). And, posthumously, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.  But Summer’s history is a complicated one that includes abuse, her struggles to adapt to motherhood, her music – which defined an era as she grappled with its sexual content – and her conflicted relationship with the gay community that revered her.  Along with Brooklyn and her father Bruce Sudano – whom Summer married in 1980 – other family members provide insight, including Brooklyn’s sister Amanda; Summer's daughter Mimi Dohler with first husband Helmuth Sommer; and Summer’s siblings Mary Ellen Bernard, Dara Bernard and Ric Gaines. (Summer, who was born LaDonna Gaines, took an Anglicized version of Sommer’s name as her stage moniker.)  Mary Ellen recalls how Summer “knew fame came with the territory…she just tried to keep her sanity,” while Amanda says Summer tried to shield her daughters from fame.  “We were never allowed in her room. We would find things (out about her) by reading newspaper articles,” she says.  Donna Summer almost died by suicide  In a sad, chilling voice over, Summer discusses in an interview her near-death by suicide in 1976. A combination of exhaustion, a broken marriage and disillusionment about the music industry and the fame she tried to duck, caused Summer to “break down” in a Central Park-area hotel in New York.  “I said, ‘I’m getting out of here.’ I put my foot out the window,” she says. But her foot got caught in the curtain and at the same moment she freed herself to step out again, a housekeeper opened the hotel door.  “Another 10 seconds and I would have been gone,” Summer says.  Donna Summer suffered abuse from minister, boyfriend  Summer’s brother, Gaines, confirms her allegations that a trusted minister sexually abused Summer as a teenager. The traumatic incident, Summer notes, “is something I have to always incorporate into my reality.”  Gaines has more forceful words for the minister: “He did the Devil’s work better than most.”  It was not the only abuse Summer would endure.  Boyfriend Peter Mühldorfer, an artist Summer met in Germany, was an abusive alcoholic who was jealous of Summer’s fame.  Summer’s manager, Susan Munao, recalls a middle-of-the-night phone call telling her that Mühldorfer had beaten Summer until she was unconscious.  “She was becoming a star and he could not handle it,” Munao says.  Mühldorfer admits in the film, “I hit her and I never could forgive myself.”  How Donna Summer angered her gay fans  Following a thriving career that populated dance floors across the country with pulsing hits such as “Hot Stuff,” “McArthur Park” and her iconic pairing with Barbra Streisand, “No More Tears (Enough is Enough),” Summer returned to her religious roots.  “That little church girl was foundational to who she was,” Bruce Sudano says.  After Summer allegedly made the comments during a concert that “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” and inferred that AIDS was “God’s punishment” on gay people, a community that had a kinship with the singer felt betrayed.  One of Summer’s bodyguards remembers angry fans disrupting a show of Summer’s art in Chicago, followed by a stream of concert cancellations.  Summer later denied making the comments, but for many, it was an empty gesture.  Donna Summer didn't want to 'give death power'  Bruce Sudano reflects on Summer's death, how she ""carried so much for so long"" until her body could no longer endure the lung cancer sapping her strength.  But Summer never talked about dying, Sudano says. ""There was a certain amount of non-acceptance ... She didn't want to give death power.'

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:32:46","Summary: Researchers have identified a potential marker in the brain that might indicate an increased risk of suicide.  They observed that veterans with a history of suicide attempts demonstrated distinct functional connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential thought-processing networks. This connectivity pattern was present both before and after a suicide attempt, making it a potentially crucial indicator of suicide-specific risk.  Further, the study suggests that suicide attempts could lead to brain changes, potentially escalating future suicide risk.  Key Facts:  The researchers found distinct brain connectivity patterns in veterans with a history of suicide attempts, specifically in networks involved in cognitive control and self-referential thought processing. This connectivity pattern was present both before and after a suicide attempt, suggesting it could serve as a novel marker for suicide risk. The study also found that a suicide attempt could lead to changes in the brain, specifically in the right amygdala, potentially increasing future suicide risk.  Source: Boston University  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  But new research has uncovered a clue, or marker, in the brain that could be used to identify people at a higher risk of ending their life.  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt. Credit: Neuroscience News  In a paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author on the paper.  “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma.  Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  Researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts.  They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders ​​(TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath.  Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  Jagger-Rickels says the findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says.  “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System.  “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  Funding: This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health.

Journal of Affective Disorders  Abstract  Aberrant connectivity in the right amygdala and right middle temporal gyrus before and after a suicide attempt: Examining markers of suicide risk  Functional neuroimaging has the potential to help identify those at risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, as well as inform neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to suicide.  Based on whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity, our previous work identified right amygdala and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) connectivity patterns that differentiated Veterans with a history of a suicide attempt (SA) from a Veteran control group.  In this study, we aimed to replicate and extend our previous findings by examining whether this aberrant connectivity was present prior to and after a SA. In a trauma-exposed Veteran sample (92 % male, mean age = 34), we characterized if the right amygdala and right MTG connectivity differed between a psychiatric control sample (n = 56) and an independent sample of Veterans with a history of SA (n = 17), using fMRI data before and after the SA.  Right MTG and amygdala connectivity differed between Veterans with and without a history of SA (replication), while MTG connectivity also distinguished Veterans prior to engaging in a SA (extension). In a second study, neither MTG or amygdala connectivity differed between those with current suicidal ideation (n = 27) relative to matched psychiatric controls (n = 27).  These results indicate a potential stable marker of suicide risk (right MTG connectivity) as well as a potential marker of acute risk of or recent SA (right amygdala connectivity) that are independent of current ideation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV1cm9zY2llbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vYnJhaW4tY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXN1aWNpZGUtcmlzay0yMzI3Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-10-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:45:00","A health system in Michigan says it has reduced its patient suicide rate by more than 70%, and that its high-risk patients have the “lowest documented rate” in the country.  Henry Ford Behavioral Health in Southeast Michigan made significant progress through a collaborative care model its team developed called “Zero Suicide.” They’ve even had some years with no patient suicides.  The model trains and calls for primary care physicians to screen all patients for risk of suicide at every visit. If the caregiver finds indicators of risk, they can assess the level of risk and come up with a pathway to treatment in partnership with behavioral health specialists.  “We believe that we have an opportunity to prevent every single suicide,” said Dr. Brian Ahmedani, director of research for behavioral health sciences at Henry Ford and a member of the founding team for the Zero Suicide model.  Ahmedani said 83% of people who die by suicide have a health care visit in the weeks and months leading up to their death. That provides an opportunity for caregivers to notice warning signs and intervene.  In recent months, the team behind the Zero Suicide model has teamed up with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to create a collaborative known as the Michigan Mental Health Innovation Network for Clinical Design -- or MI Mind.  The idea behind MI Mind is to train providers throughout the state, and beyond, on Zero Suicide and the techniques to assess and treat suicide risk factors.  “We realized that many people who are dying by suicide don’t ever get to behavioral health services, so we expanded our program to include the entire health care system,” Ahmedani said.  The care model begins with screening every patient that walks in the door for suicide risk factors. Clinicians are trained to not only ask every patient if they’ve had suicidal thoughts, but also to look out for warning signs that may indicate increased risk.  If there are indicators of suicide risk present, caregivers will then use a more extensive assessment and come up with a treatment pathway using interventions that have been shown to reduce rates. Some such interventions include:  Psychiatric evaluation  Advise to remove weapons and stockpiled pills.  Involving family  Promoting self-management  Community referral/support  Initiating an appropriate referral for follow-up therapy, where the timeline is based on the patient’s severity of risk.  “What we’re doing is pairing several evidence-based interventions that all have been associated with reduction in suicide attempts in either clinical trials or big research studies,” Ahmedani said.  “We use a safety plan and people who get a safety plan are about 20% less likely to attempt suicide than people who don’t get a safety plan. It’s a brief, about 15-minute intervention that you can do with a patient.”  In 2021, Michigan had 1,485 suicide deaths. Its 14.3 suicide deaths per capita ranked 34th nationally. Across the country, there were 48,183 such deaths, or about one every 11 minutes, according to the CDC.  It’s an alarming rate, and yet those numbers could have been worse. An estimated 12.3 million adults thought about suicide, and of them 3.5 million made a plan and 1.7 million made an attempt.  Contributing factors to suicide include mental health conditions, relationship problems or losses, substance use disorder, general health problems, and housing, legal, job or financial stress.  The Zero Suicide model was developed in 2001 at Henry Ford Health and showed immediate progress. The health system measures suicide rates within one year of a patient visit, and said it began experiencing 70% to 80% declines in the years that followed.  The system’s progress has continued for the better part of two decades, with typical rates for the system’s high-risk patients coming in line with the general population’s rates.  In its first year, MI Mind is partnering with five Michigan primary care and behavioral health practices. They include Oakland Southfield Physicians, Med Net One in Rochester, Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit, Trinity Health IHA Medical Group in Ann Arbor, and Answer Health in Grand Rapids.  Ahmedani, who is the program director for MI MInd, said the collaborative will add another two systems this year with the end goal of including all provider organizations throughout the state.

The state's Suicide Demographics and Trends 2021 report, published Friday, shows there were 1,766 suicides in 2021, an 8% increase from the previous year, according to the state health department.  That number remains below the 10-year high of 1,836 deaths in 2018.  Here are five key findings from the report:  Each day, five Ohioans die by suicide, and one youth dies every 34 hours.  In 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans ages 10-34 and the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio overall.  White people had the largest increase in suicide rates from 2020 to 2021 at 7%.  Adults ages 25-44 had the highest suicide rate in 2021, an increase of 13% from the year before, compared with 5% increases for other age groups.  Men 75 and older and women 45-54 had the highest rates of suicides in 2021.

Summit County suicide data  The Summit County Suicide Prevention Coalition, which was created in December 2005, works to reduce the number of deaths by suicide in Summit County, especially in the identified high-risk populations of youth, middle-aged men (ages 25-44) and older adults.  The coalition said that 2022 was Summit County’s worst year for Black suicide deaths, with the Black male suicide rate in Summit County at 31.6%.  For subscribers:'You all matter': Streetsboro parents who lost son to sextortion fight to save other youth  According to the suicide deaths data dashboard from the Summit County Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services Board and the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office, suicide deaths by year in the county were 91 in 2017, 88 in 2018, 91 in 2019, 91 in 2020, 93 in 2021, 80 in 2022 and 33 so far in 2023 (as of May 11).  The Summit County suicide death rate per 100,000 was 15 in 2017, 13.5 in 2018, 15.3 in 2019, 13.7 in 2020, 15 in 2021 and 13.7 in 2022.  The Black suicide death rate per 100,000 nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022, from 7.9 to 14.7 The increase was largely driven by the male rate, which more than doubled from 12.1 to 26.7.  The Black suicide death rate per 100,000 in recent years was 11.5 in 2017 (19.8 for Black males), 9.1 in 2018 (14.7 for Black males), 5.7 in 2019 (9.8 for Black males), 11.3 in 2020 (21.9 for Black males), 7.9 in 2021 (12.1 for Black males) and 14.7 in 2022 (26.7 for Black males). The Black female suicide death rate per 100,000 has remained relatively low throughout the same time period.  Honoring Kiki:Copley family keeps music, art flowing after death of daughter  The white suicide death rate per 100,000 dropped from 16 to 13.4 from 2021 to 2022, with the female rate increasing from 5.5 to 8.3, but the male rate dropping from 27 to 18.8.  The white suicide death rate per 100,000 in recent years was 16.4 in 2017 (25.6 for white males), 14.7 in 2018 (24.8 for white males), 16.8 in 2019 (27.8 for white males), 14.8 in 2020 (20.7 for white males), 16 in 2021 (27 for white males) and 13.4 in 2022 (18.8 for white males). The white female suicide death rate per 100,000 has remained relatively low throughout the same time period.  According to the dashboard, death rates are used instead of counts because they allow for comparison of the level of impact in different sized populations.  ""Suicide is preventable and everyone has a role to play to save lives and create healthy and strong individuals, families, and communities,"" the Summit County Suicide Prevention Coalition said in a statement.  What is Ohio doing to prevent suicides?  RecoveryOhio and the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services partnered with The Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation in 2021 to create The Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio.  Since then, the state has done the following to address the issue:  Gov. Mike DeWine included the following in his 2024-25 budget proposal.  $8 million a year for the next two years to continue and expand prevention programs and strategies.  $100 million to create a State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network to develop, evaluate and implement strategies.  $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce, integrating behavioral and primary health and developing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities.  The Summit County Suicide Prevention Coalition offers free training and consultation for community groups to raise awareness of suicide as a public health issue and to educate the public about how to recognize and respond to someone who needs help. To arrange for an educational program on suicide prevention, contact preventsuicide@admboard.org or call 330-376-9494 x211.  Suicide risk factors and warning signs  According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, there are several risk factors and warning signs for suicide.  The organization says that risk factors are characteristics that make it more likely that someone will consider, attempt or die by suicide. They can't cause or predict a suicide attempt, but they're important to be aware of, the lifeline said. They include:  Mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and certain personality disorders  Alcohol and other substance use disorders  Hopelessness  Impulsive and/or aggressive tendencies  History of trauma or abuse  Major physical illnesses  Previous suicide attempt(s)  Family history of suicide  Job or financial loss  Loss of relationship(s)  Easy access to lethal means  Local clusters of suicide  Lack of social support and sense of isolation  Stigma associated with asking for help  Lack of healthcare, especially mental health and substance abuse treatment  Cultural and religious beliefs, such as the belief that suicide is a noble resolution of a personal dilemma  Exposure to others who have died by suicide (in real life or via the media and Internet)  The lifeline said that some warning signs may help you determine if a loved one is at risk for suicide, especially if the behavior is new, has increased or seems related to a painful event, loss or change. If you or someone you know exhibits any of these warning signs, listed below, seek help by calling the lifeline, the organization said.  Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves  Looking for a way to kill themselves, like searching online or buying a gun  Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live  Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain  Talking about being a burden to others  Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs  Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly  Sleeping too little or too much  Withdrawing or isolating themselves  Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge  Extreme mood swings  Contact Columbus Dispatch reporter at Nathaniel Shuda at nshuda@dispatch.com and on Twitter @NathanielShuda.

"suicide","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Fairview"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:00:00","America faces a large and growing public health problem: suicide by men.  More than 38,000 men died by suicide in 2021, the highest number and rate of deaths in 20 years. Men die of suicide at four times the rate of women.  As a societal issue, male suicide has been somewhat overshadowed by the very real mental health crisis afflicting American women and girls.  Thirty-seven percent of women have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of men, and those rates are rising, according to Gallup survey data released Wednesday.  Paradoxically, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to die by suicide. The main reason is firearms.  A person who attempts suicide with a gun is many times more likely to die than someone who uses another method, such as pills or self-inflicted cuts. Firearms figure in only 5 percent of suicide attempts but in over half of deaths.  America may lead the developed world in suicide attempts, according to a 2008 study of suicidal ideation in 17 countries.  Many who attempt suicide are conflicted and irresolute. Too often, a gun makes the decision final.  “Even at the moment when the person has decided to make the attempt, there’s a lot of ambivalence,” said Elly Stout, a suicide prevention specialist at the nonprofit Education Development Center. “If you take a bunch of pills, there is a moment where you can change your mind.”  Between 2015 and 2020, federal data shows, 122,178 men died of suicide by firearm, compared to 19,297 women. Together, those deaths represented about 2.5 million years of lost human life.  The second most common method of suicide, suffocation, claimed 59,382 men and 17,088 women in that half-decade span. Suffocation typically means death by hanging, or by covering the head to cut off the supply of air.  Drug poisoning, which was the third most common, was the only significant suicide method more prevalent among women (16,678 deaths) than men (12,641).  The rise in male suicides mirrors the rise of guns in America. The nation purchased nearly 60 million firearms between 2020 and 2022, part of a larger cycle of panic-buying amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  More Americans died of gun violence in 2020 and 2021 than in any prior year on record. The majority of those deaths were suicides.  “Our suicide rates are very much tied to firearms,” said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina.  By age and gender, the demographic group most likely to die of suicide is elderly men. Men older than 75 died in suicides at a rate of 42.2 per 100,000 Americans in 2021, the highest quotient for men or women of any age.  “Some of that is kind of related to our stereotypes of masculinity,” said Julie Cerel, a suicide researcher at the University of Kentucky. “If you’re no longer in your prime, what’s the point of it all? People who are widowed, people who are no longer able to provide.”  Yet, over the past 20 years, suicides among elderly men are relatively flat.  More alarming, perhaps, is the swift rise in suicides among the young. The suicide rate for boys and young men in the 15-24 age group rose by nearly half between 2001 and 2021, from 16.5 per 100,000 people to 23.8.  The suicide rate for girls and women in the same age group more than doubled in the same span, to 6.1 per 100,000.  Suicides among girls ages 10-14, almost unknown 20 years ago, rose to 2.3 per 100,000 in 2021.  Girls and women, too, are dying by self-inflicted gunshot wounds in greater numbers than in years past.  “It used to be that firearms were rarely used by women,” Cerel said. “The myth used to be that women wouldn’t use methods of taking their life that would change how they look, essentially, and that doesn’t seem to be the case.”  The easy availability of firearms is an obvious factor in the prevalence of suicide among men. Other reasons speak to the essence of American masculinity.  Society encourages girls to open up about their mental health and to seek therapy for depression, a skill set discouraged in boys.  “Boys and men haven’t been socialized to talk about mental health concerns. They’ve historically been thought of as weaknesses,” Cerel said. “The expectation for males in this country is, they’re strong, they’re independent, they take care of themselves, they don’t need help.”  Women are twice as likely as men to seek mental health treatment, according to federal data.  And why are young people becoming more prone to suicide? One factor may be a sense of belonging, which, in recent years, seems to be slipping away.  Men, in particular, have struggled in recent years to make friends and form relationships.  “I think we don’t have as much of a sense of connectedness in our communities,” said Nadine Kaslow, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Emory University School of Medicine.  “When I was growing up, everybody in the neighborhood knew everybody,” Kaslow said. “That’s changed. It’s this sense of isolation and loneliness.”  Much was made of the nation’s collective ennui during the pandemic. Yet, suicide rates actually ticked down in 2020. Why? Because everyone was home.  “During the summer, during holiday breaks, during the pandemic, those rates actually went down,” Cerel said.  It’s true: People are actually less prone to suicide during the holidays. Suicide rates rise in spring and summer, “when people get away from each other and go out in the world,” Cerel said.  Solitude and suicide travel hand in hand. Humans don’t want to die where loved ones will find them, both because of the trauma such a discovery will inflict and because a loved one might try to save them.  Some of Cerel’s research focuses on exploding the myth that only a few loved ones suffer when someone dies by suicide.  A longstanding theory held that every suicide left roughly six people behind. Cerel found the number closer to 135, a massive circle of friends and loved ones who may need mental health support to endure the loss. Tragically, suicide can beget more suicide.  “For many people, losing someone to suicide opens the door to suicidality where it hadn’t been open before,” she said.  Social media plays an ambiguous role in suicide. Many reports have suggested a link between TikTok and Instagram and worsening mental health. But researchers see potential benefits in those platforms.  “Social media is a place where people who are marginalized can get help,” Cerel said. “And you can find online social support when you don’t have it at home.”  Our nation’s mental health investment stands in dire need, suicide experts say.  All Americans could benefit from an annual mental health checkup, on top of the standard physical checkup, Prinstein said.  Sadly, the mental health checkup isn’t really a thing, partly because of enduring stigmas around mental health.  Psychotherapists are spread thin. The nation spends hundreds of times more money training its medical workforce than preparing mental health providers, Prinstein said.  As a result, rural Americans may find themselves an hour’s drive from the nearest therapist, a scenario hard to imagine in medicine.  “There’s not as much access as we need,” Kaslow said.

The Boston College junior started the ""Kick it For a Cause"" charity kickball tournament when he was a junior at Woburn High School. It was a tough time for one of his best friends.  ""Around that time, Sam came out with his story of his battle with his mental health,"" Noah told WBZ-TV.  ""It's personal,"" said Sam Gerry, of the tournament and its goal to prevent suicide. ""Starting in middle school, but throughout high school, I experienced pretty intense suicidality,"" he said.  Wanting to find a way to help, Noah came up with the kickball idea to help raise awareness and money for suicide prevention programs. He brought the idea to Sam and asked if he wanted to join in.  ""He was on board right away,"" said Noah.  ""Oftentimes, I find that people tend to shy away from really anything regarding suicide and suicide prevention,"" said Sam, recalling that moment when Noah approached him with the idea. ""It was really, really encouraging, not just any random teen but one of my best friends reaching out to express interest.""  In four years, the friends have raised thousands of dollars for local organizations.  Sam got help, and now he wants to help others like him.  ""I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D. of some kind focusing on suicidology,"" he told WBZ.  He is currently a student at Bates College in Maine. He has an internship this summer working on a research project about mental health.  ""It can get pretty dark at times, but it's really fascinating, and I love every second of it,"" he said.  Even with high school long behind them, these two are passionate about supporting the mental health needs of people in their community.  ""It would have been easy to let it fizzle out, especially with COVID happening and when we graduated and left the area,"" Noah said. ""But we stayed strong all the way through and we have gained massive support from everyone.""  Sam knows that awareness is important but isn't going to solve the problem.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 16:26:00","SACRAMENTO — May is Mental Health Awareness Month, a time to break the stigma surrounding mental health.  A recent study from the California Lawyer's Association (CLA) and the District of Columbia Bar (D.C. Bar) revealed eye-opening data surrounding a group often overlooked in these conversations: practicing attorneys. The CLA is using its findings to spark change in the legal profession.  The findings were published in three parts. The most recent, released in February 2023, is titled ""Stressed, Lonely, and Overcommitted: Predictors of Lawyer Suicide Risk.""  A key finding from the study is that lawyers are twice as likely as the general population to experience suicidal ideation. The study assessed the link in factors such as stress, loneliness, work over-commitment and alcohol use with thoughts of suicide.  The number one predictor of suicidal thoughts in lawyers was perceived stress. Lawyers with high stress were found to be 22 times more likely to contemplate suicide than those with low stress.  Oyango Snell, the CEO of the CLA reveals just how devastating these numbers can be.  ""There's a little over 1.3 million attorneys in the U.S. so that's about 130 to 156 thousand people that think about ending their lives,"" Snell said. ""This is a serious issue. No matter how tough you think attorneys should be because it's par for the course or its part of the job, at the end of the day these are human beings.""  The CLA established a Health and Wellness Committee to spearhead change – an effort to not only make an impact, but save lives in this industry.  They launched several online campaigns and free toolkits for those in the legal profession. These resources tackle issues such as stress, anxiety and problematic substance use.  The CLA is continuing the conversation on their social media through ""Level Set Mondays"" – an effort to de-stigmatize the dialogue surrounding mental health in the legal profession.  Snell says community is an essential part of maintaining the well-being of these attorneys. Among their popular challenges are ""wellness walks,"" an opportunity to reap the physical and emotional benefits of walking regularly.  ""The problem that we've been seeing is that a lot of attorneys suffer in silence,"" Snell said. ""They want to be viewed as strong, they want to be viewed as a champion and a winner. The way to go is to have a keen self-awareness and understand when you need to take a step back and really focus on yourself so that you can show up authentically and at your best for others.""

According to the Salt Lake City Police Department, the bodies of 49-year-old Parth Gandhi and his 16-year-old son were found inside an office complex near Millcreek Common on May 13.  The son’s name was originally withheld by police, but the family later identified him as Om Moses Gandhi in a GoFundMe campaign .  The police investigation concluded that Gandhi killed his son before then taking his own life.  Om’s mother, Leah Moses, is heavily involved in Utah’s domestic violence and victim advocacy community. She’s on the board of the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition and works as a nurse-midwife who educates patients about domestic violence.  ‘My son Om’s death was preventable,” Moses said in a statement. “The family court professionals ignored my pleas for help to keep my son safe. My son’s father persuaded everyone that I was the problem, when in fact I was just trying to protect my child. I never want this to happen to another family, to another child. If the courts would listen to and believe survivors, this nightmare would stop.”  Court records show more than a decade of disputes between Moses and Gandhi since she first filed for divorce in 2009. Moses had twice filed for protective orders against Gandhi, in 2009 and again in 2011. The two were embroiled in a custody battle over their two children at the time of Om’s death. Records show Gandhi was granted sole custody of Om in February of 2022, while Moses was granted sole custody of their daughter.  A complicated system  Experts say family courts across the country are experiencing similar difficulties.  ”Unfortunately, Utah is doing the same things wrong in these cases as family courts are all around the country and actually all around the globe,” said Danielle Pollack, policy manager at the National Family Violence Law Center . “Court professionals are not adequately trained on the subject matter of child abuse, child sexual abuse, coercive control, trauma on children, perpetrator and victim behavior.”  A similar case occurred in January in Enoch, where a man killed his children, wife and mother-in-law before killing himself. In that case , the wife and family had voiced concerns to law enforcement beforehand.  Experts say family court cases can get messy because parents are often fighting for child custody.  If one parent is alleging abuse and seeking custody, Pollack said the other parent often claims that the allegations are false and that they are trying to “brainwash” their child against them. The defense is known as parental alienation syndrome.  ""Even though it's been rebuked by medical and psychological associations and experts all around the world, it's still used and introduced in these cases,” said Pollack. “When abuse is alleged, the cross claim is frequently alienation. We see this pattern everywhere.""  Critics of the syndrome say it lacks scientific evidence .  That’s not the only complication when it comes to family court. There can often be conflicting advice when an abusive situation is combined with a custody battle.  ""The victim advocate is like, ‘Call the police, report this violation,’’ said Anne Blythe, a longtime friend of Moses and the executive director of BTR.org , which provides counseling for victims of domestic and emotional abuse. “Her civil attorney will likely say, ‘no, no, no, no, no. Do not call the police for a violation, because in this divorce court or in this custody [case], they're just going to use that against you to paint you as high conflict, that you're causing problems.’""  Moving forward  According to Blythe, unless the way the courts function or the law changes, the outlook isn’t good.  ""If someone who is well-resourced and educated about abuse and does everything right cannot protect her kids from abuse, then is there hope? And the answer to that, I would say currently speaking, is minimal,"" she said.  There has been a nationwide push surrounding legislation called the Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act, also known as Kayden’s Law , which was part of the Violence Against Women Act passed by Congress last year.  The law sets aside financial incentives for individual states to adopt their own legislation that would help train family court judges and court professionals and put in place more strict requirements on who can give expert testimony on abuse.  Colorado was the first state to pass such legislation this year.  Moses has been part of the effort to pass similar legislation in Utah for the last year. Those efforts are ongoing and half of the proceeds from the family’s Gofundme campaign will go toward efforts to pass that legislation.  For Pollack, it’s important for people to understand that situations like Moses’ are not outliers.  ""Leah's case is emblematic, it's not exceptional,” she said. “It's what's happening all around the country. She alleged abuse. She had a lot of evidence of abuse. She brought that before the court. He cross-claimed alienation. The court awarded the child to him, the abusive parent, and the child was murdered. This is happening everywhere.""

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:46:09","An uptick of people in Routt and Moffat counties taking advantage of free and confidential counseling sessions funded through Reaching Everyone Preventing Suicide may be helping to lower the number of deaths by suicide in the Yampa Valley this year.  So far in 2023, one person in Moffat County has died by suicide, with none in Routt County, said Anna Allsberry, REPS marketing and communications coordinator. By this time last year, the Yampa Valley already had lost six people to suicide. During 2022, 13 people died from suicide in Routt and Moffat counties, including six people from Routt and seven from Moffat, according to REPS.  During 2021, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported 12 suicides in the Yampa Valley, including eight people in Routt and four in Moffat.  Overall, 1,370 people in Colorado died by suicide during 2021. For context, the three counties in Colorado that have the closest population size to Routt County showed suicide numbers in 2021 of six in Elbert, eight in Montezuma and 14 in Teller.  El Paso County in Colorado topped the suicide list in 2021 with 186 deaths, and multiple smaller population counties such as Jackson County reported no or less than three suicides. Less than three annual suicides in a county are not disclosed for privacy reasons, according to the CDPHE.  REPS continues with efforts to raise funds for free counseling sessions that are available through a variety of local counselors. Thanks to two local anonymous donors, REPS has a $10,000 matching donation challenge to the public during the month of May, which is also national Mental Health Awareness Month.  “I think part of the reason the suicide numbers decreased so much this year so far is because of our confidential and complimentary counseling program that provides five free sessions of counseling,” Allsberry said.  REPS-funded counseling hit a peak of 37 sessions during the month of March alone, compared to 97 sessions throughout 2022.  Get the top stories in your inbox every morning. Sign up here: steamboatpilot.com/newsletter  “The winter was really long and hard for a lot of people. It took a toll on our community and our seasonal employees,” Allsberry said. “It’s a good problem to have because we want people to be reaching out for help. Finding the counselors to meet that need is challenging, but we are happy to do that to make sure that people are getting the help they need and not suffering in silence.”  REPS is kicking off another five-week run of fundraising bingo nights at Otto Pint on Yampa Street in Steamboat to support the counseling fund. The weekly fundraiser, starting at $5 for the first bingo card, takes place 6-9 p.m. on Thursdays from May 25 to June 22.  The national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which started in July 2022, may also be helping to reduce suicide deaths, Allsberry said.  “Even just the awareness aspect that the phone number has changed to be like 911, I think people know that help is available for them,” Allsberry said.  REPS expanded its staffing levels to include a full-time communications coordinator plus five part-time staff that lead programs ranging from support groups to youth ambassadors. The Youth Ambassador Program, or YAP, is open to any middle or high school student interested in helping increase community awareness, build support and break stigmas. The next monthly meeting of YAP is 3-4:30 p.m. Sunday, May 21, at Johnny B. Good’s Diner in downtown Steamboat, and includes free milkshakes.  Earlier this year, REPS split its support group into two more specific monthly groups. The Grief Support Group for people who lost loved ones to suicide meets the second Wednesday evening of each month, and the Coping and Healing Support Group for anyone who has attempted suicide or struggled with suicide ideation, as well as their friends and family members, meets the fourth Wednesday evening of the month.

Rubu Zhao, 52, suffered a skull fracture in the fall Sunday in PACE mental health unit 8B at the George R. Vierno Center, multiple sources told the Daily News. He died Tuesday night at Elmhurst Hospital.  Advertisement  Zhao, a native of China, is the second Rikers detainee known to have died in custody this year. He was arrested in December on charges of murder and illegal weapons possession in Brooklyn and had a May 31 court date. He was accused of killing his girlfriend in their Sunset Park home.  Rikers Island's George R. Vierno Center (James Keivom/New York Daily News)  PACE units are supposed to have a higher degree of security and medical supervision to monitor the people held there than regular jail units.  Advertisement  A DOC source familiar with the incident said Zhao was not on suicide watch, and was allowed to move around within the unit.  The sources said Zhao swung his leg over a banister at a top tier stairwell, plummeted backwards down a set of stairs and landed on his head.  Officers responded immediately and called for medical help, officials said. Zhao was taken to Elmhurst hospital, where he died at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday, they said.  “I am saddened by the circumstances that led to Mr. Zhao’s passing and I offer my condolences to his family,” said Correction Commissioner Louis Molina. “The health and safety of everyone in our custody is a top priority and a full investigation is underway to determine how this unfortunate incident occurred.”  The incident remained under investigation Wednesday.  A copy of the preliminary incident report shows Zhao fell at 2:18 p.m. on Sunday, but the incident wasn’t reported until two days later, at 12:06 a.m. on Tuesday, according to a copy of the Correction Department’s 24-hour report obtained by The News.  The report is a carefully compiled log of major incidents in the jails. The reason for the discrepancy remained unclear Wednesday.  Advocates decried the death. “When is it going to stop? Rubu Zhao should be alive today,” said Victor Pate of the group HALTSolitary. “Relying on jails to address mental health needs is destined to fail. Yet, no one in a position of power has done a damn thing to release people to alleviate this crisis.”  Advertisement  The other detainee to die at Rikers this year was Marvin Pines, who died Feb. 4 after he was found unresponsive in a housing area at the North Infirmary Command.  Five correction officers were suspended in connection with Pines’ death.

(FOX 56) — According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 800,000 people die by suicide each year. That’s more than all wars and homicides combined.  With this in mind, The University of Kentucky’s nursing program is stepping up to teach students about the warning signs of suicide and what to do next.  UK is now offering a one-hour online program that teaches people a suicidal prevention tactic called “QPR”, which stands for “question, persuade, refer.”  QPR training teaches how to recognize early signs of suicide and how to respond.  The training program started as a class for just 30 nursing students at a time. It has now grown into an online platform to accommodate a larger demand.  Amanda Lykins, an assistant professor for UK’s undergraduate nursing program and she said, “We know that through this training, one little interaction can save a life.”  Lykins also said the university has seen demand go up for the campus “Mental health crisis hotline.”  “We are seeing an increase in students accessing that throughout the semester,” Lykins said. “We are seeing more and more students who are socially isolated and doesn’t have the ability to be able to cope with those difficult situations.  Lykins said one positive development in the last year is that suicide has dropped from the 10th leading cause of death in the nation to 12th.  “I think that the stigma around mental health and mental illness has definitely improved,” Lykins said. “I feel like we are providing more awareness that it’s ok not to be ok.”  However, even with the lower rates, the WHO reports there is one suicide death every 40 seconds; 15 people every 10 minutes.

"suicide","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 18:30:05","The quality of life among the working-age population has significantly deteriorated in recent years. Only every other working-age individual now considers their quality of life good, whereas four years ago, over 60 percent of working-age individuals felt the same way. Quality of life refers to a person's perception of their own situation, including their health, well-being, social relationships, and living environment.  These findings emerge from a comprehensive population study called ""Terve Suomi"" conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The survey data was collected between September 2022 and March 2023.  According to the study, one in five working-age individuals, aged 20 to 64, experiences significant psychological strain. Mental strain has increased markedly among both men and women compared to 2018: from 13 percent to 19 percent among men and from 13 percent to 20 percent among women. Psychological strain remains most prevalent among individuals aged 20 to 29, but there has also been an increase among those aged 30 to 49.  ""The results are concerning from the perspective of societal social and economic sustainability. While there have been indications of the declining well-being of the working-age population previously, the crises of recent years have likely further complicated the situation. During the upcoming government term, the well-being of working-age individuals must be placed at the core of decision-making, as an aging Finnish society requires a healthy and functional population,"" says lead researcher Annamari Lundqvist.  Suicidal thoughts have become more prevalent among those under 50 years old. While in 2018, one in ten individuals reported having suicidal thoughts, now the number has risen to one in eight among those under 50.  ""The implementation of suicide prevention programs is now particularly crucial. These programs aim to develop ways for anyone to address concerns and guide healthcare professionals on what to do after identifying suicide risk. Additionally, we encourage individuals to create safety plans in case of suicidal thoughts and promote the use of other effective treatment methods in social and healthcare services,"" explains research professor Timo Partonen.  An increasing number of working-age individuals report utilizing mental health services due to mental health-related problems. Currently, 20 percent of women and 12 percent of men in this age group state that they have used mental health services, compared to 15 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in 2018.  The study also reveals that access to healthcare services has become more challenging. Nearly one in four adults feel that they do not receive sufficient medical services relative to their needs. This means that over 800,000 individuals in Finland perceive medical services as inadequate. The proportion has increased by almost 10 percentage points among both men and women since 2018: from 14 percent to 23 percent among men and from 17 percent to 27 percent among women. These findings reflect the situation prior to the social and healthcare reform.  The most challenging situations regarding access to doctors are found in North Karelia, Central Uusimaa, and Kainuu, where over 30 percent of residents feel they receive insufficient medical services relative to their needs.  ""The new well-being regions face a difficult starting point that they must address. The poor development is likely influenced by several factors, such as the backlog of COVID-19 treatment, the delayed social and healthcare reform, and personnel shortages. Finland also allocates less funding to healthcare compared to Western European countries,"" states senior expert Anna-Mari Aalto.  ""There is no single solution to this complex situation. The new well-being regions now have the opportunity to develop the service structure of their regions and seek solutions to improve service availability,"" Aalto adds.  The survey portion of the ""Terve Suomi"" study invited 61,600 randomly selected individuals aged 20 or older from various parts of Finland to participate. The sample was constructed in a manner that allows for generalization of the results to the whole of Finland and the well-being regions. Of those invited to the study, 46 percent responded to the survey between September 2022 and March 2023.  Data from 2018 and 2020 is based on the FinSote study conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

During their meeting, hosted by the Logos Scotland think thank, they will sign a statement voicing their ""deep concern"" over the proposals and urging MSPs to vote them down.  The statement says that assisted suicide undermines human dignity and puts pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.  ""Our faith traditions are united in the principle that assisted dying in itself inevitably undermines the dignity of the human person, and to allow it would mean that our society as a whole loses its common humanity,"" the statement says.  ""The Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques remain firm in their opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia.""  The latest campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide is being led by Liam McArthur, Lib Dem MSP for Orkney, whose Member's Bill would allow competent terminally ill adults to request assistance to end their life.  The faith leaders add in their joint statement, ""The ways in which similar laws in other countries are being applied, and the effect that its introduction would have on some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the disabled and the elderly, would be extremely detrimental.""  The statement ends with a call to MSPs ""to consider carefully the implications of this Bill, to express their concerns, and to vote against it"".  Bishop Keenan said: ""Assisted suicide attacks human dignity and results in human life being increasingly valued on the basis of its efficiency and utility. Implicit in legal assisted suicide is that an individual can lose their value and worth.  ""Evidence from countries where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal shows that vulnerable people feel pressured to end their lives through fear of being a burden. In such situations the option of assisted suicide is less about having a 'right' to die and more about feeling the full weight and expectation of a duty to die.  ""When vulnerable people, including the elderly and poor, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.""  Rev Greenshields said: ""Our opposition to assisted dying is based on our Christian faith, and involves concerns around the principle of assisted dying, around the application of the law in practice, the perception of the value of human lives, and also the effect which any change is likely to have on the provision of care - in particular, on palliative care.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vY2hyaXN0aWFudG9kYXkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZmFpdGgubGVhZGVycy51cmdlLnNjb3R0aXNoLnBhcmxpYW1lbnQubm90LnRvLmxlZ2FsaXNlLmFzc2lzdGVkLnN1aWNpZGUvMTQwMjI5Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Lakhimpur"", ""UttarPradesh"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:17:54","Dramatic twists and turns and a series of accusations adding more suspense to the unfortunate death of Sub-Inspector (SI) Junmoni Rabha, who lost her life in a fatal road accident on Monday night.  The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2xpdmV0di5jb20vbmVpdGhlci1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1ub3ItYS1zdWljaWRlLWp1bm1vbmktcmFiaGEtd2FzLW11cmRlcmVkLWNsYWltcy1wb2xpY2UtaW5mb3JtYW50LWhhc2luYS1iZWd1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The man was a temporary employee at the bank.  The incident happened at around 5.30 pm at the headquarters of the bank near Mascot Hotel.  Sreeranjini (38), widow of Prakash, from Nediyamkode, Dhanuvachapuram, Parassala, threatened to jump off the wall into the nearby 30 foot-deep cemetery compound as the authorities continued to neglect her demand.  Prakash, who had served as a temporary watchman for 14 years at the Karakkonam, Vellarada, Udayankulangara, and Balaramapuram branches under the District Co-operative Bank, committed suicide three years ago. Sreeranjini had applied for compassionate appointment at the bank and visited the bank’s Udayankulangara branch and headquarters numerous times but in vain.  She reached the bank's headquarters on Tuesday as a last-ditch attempt. However, the security pesonnel refused to let her in. An upset Sreeranjini then began to cry uncontrollably, stating that she has no other means to take care of her two children. She waited in front of the bank. Finally, when the employees came out and locked the entrance after the day’s work, she suddenly scaled the high compound wall and threatened to jump.  The shocked employees tried to pacify her, but she ignored their pleas. Finally, police and fire force personnel rushed in and brought her down half an hour later after assuring her of appropriate action.  “There is no means for me to earn a living. Both my children are currently at asylums. I am frequenting the office desperately to get a job for the last one year. Initially, they assured to give me the job without any delay. Now they have gone back on their words. I have to bring back the children and take care of them. My struggle is for the same,” she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbm1hbm9yYW1hLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tlcmFsYS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3RlbnNpb24tZ3JpcHMta2VyYWxhLWJhbmstaHEtYXMtd29tYW4tdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXN1aWNpZGUtZGVtYW5kaW5nLWNvbXBhc3Npb25hdGUtYXBwb2ludG1lbnQuaHRtbNIBkgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbm1hbm9yYW1hLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tlcmFsYS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3RlbnNpb24tZ3JpcHMta2VyYWxhLWJhbmstaHEtYXMtd29tYW4tdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXN1aWNpZGUtZGVtYW5kaW5nLWNvbXBhc3Npb25hdGUtYXBwb2ludG1lbnQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Guests who dined at Applebee’s had 20% of the cost of their meal donated back to the American Foundation For Suicide Prevention, resulting in a $700 donation as part of the Applebee’s Dining to Donate program. Other donations were received from raffle ticket sales.  LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT  Performers came together to showcase their talents, while spokespersons from community organizations offered information about resources available for those who are struggling with mental health.  The goal of the evening was to put suicide and mental illness in the spotlight and to encourage conversations about how to come to the aid of those who are who need assistance.  Performers for the evening included local stand-up comedian Jane Joan Costagliola, violinist Comfort Cat, singers Madison Burkhart, Joey Escribano, Thomas DeVito, Christian Gueits, Miss Richmond County Madison Gattullo, Miss Staten Island Outstanding Teen Nadia Anwar, Jenny Pisani, Victoria Billalba, and poets Alana Light, Matt Germoso, Andrew Littlefield and Thomas Fucaloro.  Organizations in attendance included the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), United Activities Unlimited (UAU), the Tackling Youth Substance Abuse (TYSA) coalition, the Department of Veteran Affairs, Venture House, and the Pride Center of Staten Island.

The episode, titled “Egosurfing,” (spoilers ahead) focuses on Akane, an aspiring actress who is part of the reality show Aqua is on. Feeling the pressure to perform better for the audience, Akane strikes her co-star and ends up being bullied online which leads her to become suicidal. The message on HIDIVE states that Oshi no Ko is a work of fiction, but encourages everyone who is struggling with mental health to reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. While TV networks and streaming services in the US are not required by law to include these warnings in their content, they are heavily encouraged due to possible negative consequences the content may have on viewers.  The events in the episode carry a stark similarity to the Hana Kimura case. Kimura was a part of the Terrace House reality TV show in 2020. One of the episodes showed her getting into a fight with another cast member and the altercation was shown to the public. Kimura became a target of online bullying and later committed suicide. The show was canceled. Her mother, Kyoko Kimura, sued Fuji TV and two other producers of the show in December 2022, claiming that the scenes were edited to make her daughter appear in a bad light. She accused them of treating the contestants as dispensable. In a separate case in May 2021, a court ordered a man to pay Kyoko Kimura 1.29 million yen in damages for posting hateful messages about Hana after her death.  Oshi no Ko anime premiered this April with a 90-minute episode. Studio Doga Kobo is animating the series, which is proving to be one of the biggest hits of the season. YOASOBI is singing the opening theme song “Idol” while QUEEN Bee is performing the ending song titled “Mephisto.”  The anime is based on a manga written by Aka Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love Is War) with art by Mengo Yokoyari. The manga began serialization in 2020 in the Weekly Young Jump magazine. The story focuses on the dark side of the entertainment industry. Yen Press licensed it in English.  HIDIVE is simulcasting Oshi no Ko anime with English subtitles every Wednesday. The English dub is slated to premiere on May 24. The platform describes the plot as:  Dr. Goro is reborn as the son of the young starlet Ai Hoshino after her delusional stalker murders him.

What no one knew was that my husband had Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia. He had been admitted to the psychiatric ward twice when he was at the peak of his career. I was working hard to make ends meet as bipolar disorder had made my husband go on an excessive spending spree which had thrown the family finances into jeopardy. But nowhere, in this whole melee was the love lost. One night we all celebrated my birthday. We went to bed past midnight, but the next morning only I got up. He slept forever.”  Kiran calls herself a ‘suicide leftover’. Her husband died in 2019. Her in-laws blamed her for their son’s death. Rage and guilt engulfed her. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment,” recalls Kiran. “I couldn’t remember things. I was directionless. From an overachiever and a super organized multi-tasker, I began shirking work and responsibilities.”  Three years have since passed, but Kiran is still unable to extricate herself from guilt and shame.  Also read: “Bipolar Disorder will change your life but you can navigate around it”: A first-person account  As Priti Sridhar, Executive Director, Mariwala Health Initiative, writes in the research study Suicide Prevention: Changing the Narrative: “For each person that dies by suicide, about 60 others are impacted by the bereavement, and 20 go on to attempt suicide. This is undeniably a public health crisis of epic proportions.” The report is a collaborative effort of the Mariwala Health Initiative and India Development Review, released in 2023.  According to the 2022 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total of 1,64,033 suicides were reported in the country in 2021, an increase of 7.2% in comparison to 2020. The age group of 18 to 30 years and from 30 to 45 years accounted for 34.5% and 31.7% of total suicides, respectively. A significant proportion of these individuals were students. It is estimated that in 2021 about 13,039 students died by suicide.  Why does suicide affect those left behind with guilt? > Because one believes that they failed to listen to the person who died by suicide. > Guilt comes from the mistaken belief that we should have, or could have, prevented the death from happening. >They see suicide as their inadequacy. > Feel embarrassed for the person who died by suicide. The dead is often labelled as weak, failure, and quitter. Such labels further weaken the person suffering from guilt. > Unsolved issues with the dead also give rise to guilt. (Counsellors and therapists recommend that the loved ones of the deceased should accept the truth that some things are beyond their control.)  Kiran (name changed, pixelated) calls herself a ‘suicide leftover. Her husband died in 2019. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment”.  “My sister was three years older than me, studying computer science at a private institute in NOIDA,” says Moushami, who was 18 years old then and considered her elder sister as her best friend. “We had a healthy sibling relationship. We loved doing things together. We fought, bullied each other, and cried together. It was 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic, when my sister suddenly died by suicide. She was 21.”  The elder sister was good at studies and wanted to go abroad to pursue post-graduation. “But one night she put a full stop to everything,” recalls Moushami. “She jumped from the 12th floor of a multi-storey building”.  After her sister’s death, Moushami went into shock. “I was suddenly overtaken by the feeling of betrayal,” she says. “I wanted answers to unanswerable questions: Why did she kill herself? Was life that unbearable? Why did she not even think about me?”  Shame and stigma  Moushami and her family suffered in silence. “Because of shame and stigma, my family never shared the incident with others. We were not even allowed to discuss it at home. I had my solitary conversations. It is just a few months back when I joined college that I opened up. Some friends suggested joining a support group. I felt light after sharing my grief with unknown people in Swayam Hope Café, a support group,” says a teary-eyed Moushami.  Conversations around suicides are laced with stigma and myths. Says Dr Shashi Rai, Consultant Psychiatrist, Director Sambal Drug De-Addiction and Psychiatric Centre Indira Nagar, Lucknow: “There’s a general belief that suicide is the result of mental illness. The fact is there are various socio-economic factors and family expectations inter-connected with suicides.”  Exam pressure, unemployment, discrimination and financial issues are some of the major factors for suicides. The NCRB lists family problems as the primary cause of nearly one-third of suicides in India.  According to experts, death by suicide cannot be seen in isolation. It is complicated, complex, intersectional and inter-sectoral. Says Dr Kalyanasundaram, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Hon. Advisor Richmond Fellowship Society, Bangalore: “People look for easy gratification and quick fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Read more: Loneliness: An urban epidemic that carries the same risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day!  “People look for easy gratification and quick-fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Pic courtesy: Dr Kalyanasundaram  Suicide leaves behind a heavy toll on families and friends. “After my husband’s death by suicide, I found myself friendless,” says Kiran. “Some friends did reach out to me via social media. But I had no one with whom I could chat and have a cup of coffee. To change my environment, I changed my job. But I couldn’t hang out with new colleagues. I felt alienated. My life sucked till I discovered a support group. Finally, somewhere I redeemed myself of guilt.”  Somewhat similar is the experience of Ritu, based in Chandigarh. Her husband died by suicide in 2008. He shot himself. “For a long time, I suffered from guilt, in silence and blamed myself for not understanding his comments about suicide,” says Ritu. “He used to eulogise suicide and often regretted being trapped in a financial mess, having suffered heavy losses in his business. I merely tried to encourage him to see the positive side of life. But now when I remember his statements, I blame myself for not understanding the hidden meaning of his words.”  She feels that she should have forced him to see a therapist when he began to show anxiety symptoms. She was a homemaker when her husband died. Today, she handles the business and simultaneously conducts life coaching workshops. “I encourage my clients to always stand beside their loved ones and never be ashamed to seek counselling sessions.”  Warning Signs of Suicide Often talking or writing about death, dying or suicide.  Making comments about being hopeless, a failure or worthless. Using expressions such as, ‘I am a failure’ or saying, ‘I’m trapped,’ or expressing the feeling of being a ‘burden.’  Increased alcohol and/or drug use.  Withdrawal from friends, family and community.  Frequent mood changes. (Source: National Institute of Mental Health.  Website: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/warning-signs-of-suicide)  Sharing and listening  Suicide is preventable. Talking about suicide often helps a person who is thinking about suicide feel less alone.  “I met her at the World Book Fair while browsing through a book on mental health,” says 30-year-old Varun (name changed). “We both began to chat and in our conversation, we shared how we both had been ideating about life and suicide. Sharing made us feel less alone and more understood. We talk every other day now.”  “Sharing helps people feel less isolated and overwhelmed, it pauses their thoughts about suicide,” Says Dr Rai, “It reduces stress.”  While agreeing that sharing is vital, Dr Kalyanasundaram adds: “Youngsters look for peer validation. They are unable to handle peer and academic pressure. We should have proper mechanisms for help and guidance.”  Top of the list  At present, India is at the top of the list in suicide deaths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one Indian is lost to suicide every three minutes. With 419 suicides per day or 1,53,052 suicides annually, India has the most suicides globally.  Under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), world leaders agreed to decrease suicide deaths by a third by 2030. The question is what are we doing about it? Are we promoting interventions at various socio-cultural levels?  The need of the hour is to change the narratives of suicide. Though the Mental Care Health Act 2017 decriminalises suicide, hardly anything has been done to destigmatise it or encourage more suicide support groups or suicide first aid responders in colleges and workplaces.

"suicide","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:15:01","The state of California will not require doctors who object to assisted suicide to provide life-ending medications to patients or refer such patients to other health providers, a federal judge ordered Wednesday.  In addition, the Golden State will pay $300,000 in legal fees to settle an action brought in 2022 by the Christian Medical & Dental Association and Dr. Leslee Cochrane, a California-licensed hospice physician and CMDA member.  The challenge came after Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021 signed Senate Bill 380, which shortened the time between separate “oral requests” for “aid-in-dying” medication from 15 days to 48 hours. It required all physicians to document such requests, even those who hold moral objections to the practice.  Objecting doctors would have had to “educate” patients about procedures and medicines that would assist in suicide attempts under the existing statute and provide referrals to other providers.  In September, a federal district court in California ruled the state couldn’t force physicians to participate in such actions.  Kevin Theriot, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which sued on behalf of Dr. Cochrane and CMDA, said the 2021 legislation upended previously enacted conscience guarantees.  “They had great protection in the original assisted-suicide statute,” he said in a telephone interview. “And then they recently amended it to take away some of that protection. Most people agree, and in the original legislation [California] agreed the government doesn’t have any business forcing doctors to participate in procedures like taking human life.”  He said a subsequent “legislature didn’t heed that warning and so we had to file a lawsuit to be able to protect the rights of physicians in California.”  Under the settlement order issued by federal Central District Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha, state officials are barred from issuing “any criminal or civil punishment, including professional discipline or licensing sanction for a California-licensed physician’s refusal or failure” to document a request for “medical aid-in-dying,” provide information about such services apart from saying the physician does not provide them, or refer a patient to another provider.  The state can still require objecting physicians to “transfer a patient’s relevant medical record upon request” to another provider.  California is not the only state to reconsider protections for physicians who object to the procedure on conscience grounds. In April, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, enacted legislation protecting doctors’ conscience rights in that state, ending an ADF lawsuit there.  Mr. Theriot said the nonprofit legal organization is “looking at some potential lawsuits that in states that allow assisted suicide right now,” and “will likely be filing one in the coming days.”  The Washington Times has contacted the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta for comment.  • Mark A.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:26:15","Study pinpoints differences in brain connections that could be used in prevention and may lead to new treatments to reduce suicide risk  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan. For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt. But new research has uncovered a clue, or marker, in the brain that could be used to identify people at a higher risk of ending their life.  In a paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history. The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author on the paper. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact. Researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders ​​(TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  Jagger-Rickels says the findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTg5Njgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photo: Xinhua  Local police in Indonesia on Wednesday confirmed the suspicious deaths of two Chinese tourists in a local hotel, which has drawn wide attention on Chinese social media and sparked speculation over the cause of death.According to Denpasar Police, the 25-year-old victim Li Chiming beat, tied up and immersed his girlfriend, 22-year-old, Cheng Jianan, in a bathtub at the Jimbaran Intercontinential Hotel, local news outlet NusaBali reported on Wednesday.Then Li ""committed suicide by injuring himself using broken beer bottles on his neck and all over his body,"" NusaBali quoted local police chief as saying.The conclusion of murder and suicide was based on the results of internal and external examinations by a forensic doctor at Prof IGNG Ngoerah Hospital Denpasar and the results of the Bali Police Forensic Laboratory.The lovers had involved in an argument before arriving at the hotel, they shared five bottles of beer that they ordered from room service, according to investigators.The police questioned witnesses, both hotel guests and hotel employees, and reviewed CCTV footage, cellphones belonging to the two victims as well as checking the scene of the incident, another local outlet in Indonesian language Bali Tribune reported.The shocking case was revealed on May 1 when Li, the male, was found naked covered in blood with wounds all over his body, including two major wounds on his neck and left leg. Cheng was found dead lying in the bathtub in their room 4223, naked with strangle marks.Their belongings were all accounted for and no witnesses or CCTV showed anybody entering room 4223 except the room service person who only stayed very shortly before Li came out of the room for once, according to local police.The Wednesday police press briefing claimed that Cheng had scratch wounds on her forehead, right shoulder, forearm, lower leg and knees. There are line-shaped scratches on her neck and foam in her nose and mouth, leading to the conclusion that Cheng was badly beaten before dying from drowning in the bathtub.Li had more than 20 wounds on the neck, left chest, back of both hands, left wrist, back of both feet and allegedly died of loss of blood caused by injuries to his neck.The investigation results prompted doubt and questioning on Chinese social media as some netizens challenged that Li, if wanted to commit suicide, would not have run into the hotel hallway, which many interpreted as a call for help. People holding a different view said perhaps he injured himself and felt regret before he bled to death.Other questionable points included the fact that Li sustained a large number of wounds prior to suicide. With others contending that if it was indeed a murder suicide, the two had no reason to be naked; using a piece of glass to commit suicide is painful and is not a typical means of taking one's life.Netizens called for more details to be released to further dispel the doubts, including how the victims involved in an argument and proof of the man's homicide and suicide motivation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMzA1LzEyOTA4NzUuc2h0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nancy Paloma Collins, therapist director of Paloma Therapy, points out that 73% of people who identify as transgender have high anxiety, and more than 50% suffer from depression.  In the past year, one in five transgender youth has attempted suicide, according to figures from the Trevor Project.  ""A person who is gay or lesbian, for example, might say, 'I'm going to tell my friends, then my parents, and then I'm going out into the world,'"" Collins said. ""A young transgender man is totally different. As soon as they come out and the physical changes begin, the discrimination begins, the rejection.""  Although Alejandre faced rejection on the street, he never experienced it in his home. His mother was always aware of his well-being.  ""My mom supported me immediately,"" Alejandre said. ""She was the person, [that she] came when she called, that she picked me up from a situation where I felt very lost, like she wanted to commit suicide.""

So at this time, when mental health has reached a flashpoint nationwide, how are we doing in the Quad Cities?  Angela Ganzer-Bovitz, Director of Behavioral Health Inpatient with Genesis Health System, and Cecilia Bailey, Director at Quad Cities Open Network, talk about the 2021 Quad Cities Health Assessment’s mental health results. The analysis shows that the metro area has significantly higher rates of suicide than do the entire states of Illinois or Iowa (or even the entire U.S.).  An average of 53 Quad Cities’ residents die of suicide every year.  This led to the launching of Zero Suicide Initiative QC. The initiative is a collaboration between the Zero Suicide Institute and the Quad Cities Behavioral Health Coalition in an effort to lower suicide rates and make systemic change within our community.  The project’s mission statement is that “suicide is preventable” and they provide free training for individuals to be a part of the solution. Proper training better equips people to recognize the warning signs of suicide, how to talk to the person in crisis, and how to refer them for ongoing help.  It’s free to participate in the initiative’s Q-P-R training. Just like CPR, QPR is an emergency response to someone in crisis and can save lives.  QPR stands for Question, Persuade, Refer.

The bills are the Andrew Thomas McCaffrey Green Star Veterans Service Act, Green Star Families Act and Veterans’ Telecommunications Protection Act.  “Andrew Thomas McCaffrey was a brave and fearless man who served his country in Afghanistan,” Van Drew said in a statment. “Far too often, our veterans do not receive the care they need when they return from service, and tragically lose their lives to suicide.”  He said the Andrew Thomas McCaffrey Green Stars Veterans Service Act is a tribute to veterans like Andrew McCaffrey and provides a symbol of recognition and support for family members affected by veteran suicide.  “Each year, we lose thousands of veterans to suicide—we must allocate necessary funding and resources to fight for our veterans when they leave service, just as they have fought for all of us.”  The package of bills recognizes dedicated and selfless veterans across America and will bring awareness to the terrible tragedy of suicide.  “In Congress, we must invest in our veterans’ mental health and provide support to those who have lost their loved ones,” he added.  “Recognizing the existence of a problem is the first step towards finding a solution,”said Matt Cahill, founder of Green Star Families of America. “By acknowledging the importance of the Green Star Service Flag, we take the first official step towards addressing the issue of veteran suicide.”  The act introduced in memory of Andrew Thomas McCaffrey directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate a Green Star Flag for next of kin of veterans who die by suicide. Read the text of the bill here.  Green Star Families Act establishes a counseling program through the Veterans Affairs Department for families and caregivers of veterans deceased as the result of suicide, at no cost to them.

"suicide","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Henryetta"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:00:00","HENRYETTA, Okla. (KFOR) – It has been just over two weeks since a convicted sex offender is said to have murdered five children and his wife of less than a year. Search warrants are slowly being returned, now giving a possible motive for the killings, but also depicting false information.  According to the Okmulgee County District Court Clerk’s Office, eight search warrants involving Jesse McFadden have been issued, but only three have been returned so far.  The first search warrant was issued at 1:25 p.m. on May 1, the same day seven bodies were discovered on a Henryetta property.  Once the initial search warrant was obtained, law enforcement claims they found the “front door was ajar.”  That returned search warrant shows photographs, a State Farm drive safe token, and miscellaneous receipts were the only pieces of evidence found and seized from Jesse McFadden’s property on May 1.  An Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office Investigator added a white Chevrolet Avalanche was impounded by a Beggs, Oklahoma wrecker service.  The vehicle had a “No-Touch Hold” on it.  Records show law enforcement then seized eight pieces of evidence from the vehicle on May 8 once OSBI had already taken over:  Eight latent print cards from Avalanche processing; five palm and three fingerprint  Four pairs of swabs from exterior door handles, four interior door handles, steering wheel from Avalanche  Route 66 lanyard with two brinks keys on ring  Straw from driver’s side flat lid cup  Straw from passenger side cup dome lid  Purchase receipts x3 from Avalanche processing on May 8  Two McDonald’s McCafe cups  DVD with Avalanche processing photos on May 8  In the same set of search warrants is false information.  “Your affiant was made aware of a missing persons case involving a 14 year old female, named Tiffany Guess,” records show.  Court documents also indicate there was an Amber Alert pushed out for Tiffany Guess and Ivy Webster.  Both of those statements are inaccurate.  There was a “Missing and Endangered” alert for Ivy Webster and Brittany Brewer. Tiffany Guess was not included in the push notification.

Court records also show Tiffany’s father was interviewed on McFadden’s property by Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents about the additional items of interest he found inside the home.  “The subject described the items to be clothing and personal belongings of the deceased victims,” the report shows.  Ivy Webster’s dad, Justin said that’s also not true.  He claims he was the one interviewed on McFadden’s property.  McFadden’s rental property is several acres wide, but three different street numbers have been recorded.  Documents show Tiffany lived at 14317 Holly Road. It shows Ivy was spending the night at 14360 Holly Road. The mailbox outside of McFadden’s property has 14600 as the street number.  The mailbox outside of Jesse McFadden’s rental home. KFOR photo.  “How many times does it take a Sheriff’s office to mess up over and over and over again to where we finally get an investigation into the Sheriff’s office?,” asked Justin. “They failed once again miserably over and over and over again.”  According to records, exigent cellular phone pings showed McFadden’s wife, Holly Guess’ cell phone was actively pinging on or near the property as of May 1 at 12:45 p.m.  Tiffany’s cell phone pinged on or near the property, but then signal was lost.  No other cell phone pinging on or near McFadden’s property has been reported thus far.  The local storage unit Guess appeared to be making monthly payments to was also searched.  Law enforcement was made aware of the storage unit on May 6, according to records.  This is just one day after News 4 aired a story about the potential evidence left behind by law enforcement, including a check made out to the storage facility.  Records show nothing was seized from the unit.  “Based off what we were told is there was really just like, pool supplies and that was all that was in that storage unit, so there was no real concern,” stated Justin.  Justin told KFOR since OSBI took over his daughter’s investigation, there has been a steady stream of information.  “We’re being updated and it’s good communication, and I’m very grateful for it,” said Justin.  Before the OSBI took over, records show the Okmulgee Police Department was the lead on this case and only asked OSBI for “partial assistance.”  News 4 has been made aware of two hard drives, drug paraphernalia, two laptops, two tablets, a check, a 9mm gun, bullet casings, and nine cell phones recovered from McFadden’s property.  The Webster family told KFOR they feel as if the opportunity to grieve over Ivy has been stripped away from them because they’re constantly looking for answers and accepting tips from the public.  “I just feel like I need to keep fighting and keep digging and keep digging to get answers. And that’s my motivation right now and not just answers for us, but answers for other victims that might be out there,” stated Justin.  A possible motive revealed in court records is McFadden telling his mother the evening of April 30 that he was not going back to prison and had decided to kill himself.  Officials were asked during a press conference about McFadden’s possible motive, but they declined to speculate.  News 4 asked the State Medical Examiner’s Office for comment on May 8, but were told, “Our agency does not answer questions regarding cases or scenes.”  We have continued asking questions and filing Open Records Requests with the Okmulgee Sheriff’s Office.  Proof of one home compliance check at McFadden’s property was emailed last week.  Jesse McFadden’s only home compliance check. Photo courtesy: Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office.

We were redirected to the DA’s Office.  News 4 showed up to the DA’s Office Wednesday afternoon, asking why an Open Records Request for a different department would be redirected to their office, but no one was available for comment.  In the meantime, Justin is encouraging everyone to sign their petition demanding a change in current laws when it comes to registered sex offender sentences and probationary requirements.  He is also calling on Governor Kevin Stitt and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to step in.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9oZW5yeWV0dGEtd2FycmFudHMtc2hvdy1wb3NzaWJsZS1tb3RpdmUtaW5jb3JyZWN0LWluZm8v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hlbnJ5ZXR0YS13YXJyYW50cy1zaG93LXBvc3NpYmxlLW1vdGl2ZS1pbmNvcnJlY3QtaW5mby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-16","15:00:00","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:30:00","This article discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline available 24/7.  COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Suicide deaths climbed in Ohio in 2021, ending a two-year decline witnessed in years prior, according to new data from the state Department of Health.  As the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio, suicide accounted for the deaths of 1,766 Ohioans in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before, the department said Friday in its 2021 Suicide Demographics and Trends report. That means about five Ohioans – up from four in 2020 – died by suicide every day.  “We’ve got to reduce that number,” said Tony Coder, executive director of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation. “We’ve got to get that down to four, then to three, then to two, then to one every day – and hopefully put me out of business.”  The statewide rise in suicide deaths mirrors trends at both the local and national levels, with Franklin County recording a 10% jump in suicide deaths from 2020 to 2021 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recording a 4.79% rise across the U.S. during the same period.  Between the coronavirus pandemic, financial hardships, and social unrest experienced across the U.S., Coder said 2021 took a toll on the mental health of Ohioans, likely attributing to the rise in suicides.  “Two years ago, it’s kind of hard to remember, but there were some folks that were losing their jobs, businesses were struggling, just the lack of being able to see each other in person was something that really took an impact on folks,” he said.  But with the right help, Coder said suicide is preventable. While Ohio loses five people to suicide every day, another 35 are checking into emergency rooms daily for treatment after a suicide attempt, he said.  “Those are 35 people that are seeking help and getting the care that they need,” Coder said. “That’s where I hope that we can also see, that for all of the hopelessness that this report might show, there’s a lot of hope out there for folks if they get the care that they deserve.”  Demographics  White people had the largest increase, 7%, in the rate of suicide deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Department of Health. The rate among Black Ohioans – though it has steadily increased since 2012 – stayed largely the same in 2021.  Despite making up just under half of Ohio’s population, men accounted for 81% of suicide deaths in 2021, the report found. Those aged 75 and older had the highest suicide rate relative to other age groups. Among women, the rate was highest within the 45 to 54-year-old age bracket.  Suicide continued to be the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans ages 10 to 34 years in 2021, and during that year, 24 children between 10 and 14 years old died by suicide.  As for method, firearms were the No. 1 mechanism for completing a suicide among both men and women, with guns accounting for 991 deaths in Ohio in 2021 – a 10% increase from the year before. Coder said one data point that surprised him was the 22% rise in suicide deaths by drug poisoning.  “We have not seen that type of increase before,” he said.  Rural communities, which historically have lacked access to mental health resources, were hit hardest by suicide in 2021, the report found. Of the 15 counties with the highest rates of suicide death, 14 are considered rural.  “If you get into Jackson, Gallia counties down by the Ohio River, you might have to travel a county or two just to find somebody to seek care from,” Coder said. “It’s literally an access to care issue that needs to be addressed.”  Ohio’s suicide prevention plan  In 2020, the state partnered with Coder’s organization, the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, to create the Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio. Since then, the state has implemented awareness programs like Life Side Ohio for gun owners, a 988 suicide and crisis hotline, and the Ohio School Wellness Initiative to prevent and address suicide in schools.  Gov. Mike DeWine, who has made funding for mental health a priority during his administration, proposed the allocation of millions of dollars in the fiscal year 2024-25 budget, including:  $46.5 million for the continued operation of the 988 hotline  $8 million to continue and expand the state’s 2020 Suicide Prevention Plan  $100 million to create the State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network, or SOAR, to develop and implement mental health and addiction prevention, treatment and recovery  $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce and developing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities  “Most of this funding is sent directly to local communities and will be used to increase the number of Ohioans trained to help people build skills to bounce back from difficult life events and to reduce stigma so people can ask for help without shame,” Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Director Lori Criss said in a statement.  Ultimately, Coder said it’s important that those considering suicide – and those impacted by suicide – recognize that they are not alone and recovery is possible.  “We can get help; we can have hope,” he said. “And that’s what I hope our message is: You don’t feel like you’re on an island, you don’t feel like you’re all alone.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYzRpLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvb2hpby1zdWljaWRlLWRlYXRocy1yb3NlLWluLTIwMjEtYWZ0ZXItdHdvLXllYXItZGVjbGluZS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmM0aS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL29oaW8tc3VpY2lkZS1kZWF0aHMtcm9zZS1pbi0yMDIxLWFmdGVyLXR3by15ZWFyLWRlY2xpbmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Raeford"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:22:55","[Photo: Hoke County Health Department staff hosted the suicide prevention symposium at the Robert A. Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford.]  By Catharin Shepard • Editor • If you’re worried someone is suicidal, the first step to helping may be just to ask the question.  That was a key takeaway from the county’s first suicide prevention symposium, Hoke County Health Department Social Work Supervisor Isley Cotton said.  “Ask the question. You can’t be afraid to ask the question, and you have to be intentional. You can’t dance around it, you can’t use fluffier words,” she said. “If you think a person is having issues with suicidal thoughts, ask them directly, that’s the main thing.”  The Health Department hosted the suicide prevention symposium Friday evening at the Robert A. Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford. The evening featured a panel discussion with a group of mental health professionals, plus testimonials from survivors and people who experienced losing someone to suicide.  Being able to talk about a difficult topic that is often taboo was “refreshing,” Cotton said.  “For me tonight was refreshing because the topic that is so stigmatized in our community, to be able to just talk about suicide in an open, safe space, really was refreshing for me and for the community. There are so many people who came out who would probably not be that comfortable speaking about suicide in other settings,” she said.  Members of the local faith community, elected officials, healthcare providers and many others attended the event, which packed the room for the evening. Vendors set up tables with information about services and mental health treatment options, as well as information about suicide prevention. One vendor came all the way from South Carolina to attend the event.  Raising awareness about suicide prevention was a big goal of the symposium.  “Awareness is the first thing. We want people to know it is okay to not be okay, as so many people said…and for them to know there is help and there is hope,” Cotton said. “I think sometimes we devalue ‘brain pain,’ because it’s not like a body ache.”  Sometimes people can end up in a place where they feel ending their life is the only way to end the pain, but “we heard something different tonight,” Cotton said.  “I just hope that this event fostered a sense of community among everyone, and they know that we’re all here to support each other. We’re in it together, we can’t do it without each other.”  The event grew out of a suicide prevention team established at the Hoke Health Department through grant funding. It was a team effort between the Health Department and several other health agencies.  The Health Department works to address suicide prevention in a number of other ways, too.  “We have a firearm safety team we have started at the Health Department, which we are connected to so many people. And that’s the thing, fostering the connection, so that we all know who is in the room, who does what, and we can make adequate referrals,” Cotton said.  For more information on suicide prevention, contact the Hoke County Health Department at (910) 875-3717.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhva2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9zdWljaWRlLXByZXZlbnRpb24tYWJvdXQtYXNraW5nLXRoZS1xdWVzdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-03-23","Not Discerned","{""Louisville"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:45:58","By Leah Bomar  Crucial Conversations: A Panel Discussion and Forum on LGBTQ+ Suicide Awareness and Prevention brought community leaders and mental healthcare experts together on March 23, 2023, at Story Louisville to assess the problem and the risks within the Louisville Community.  Problems highlighted in Kentucky include high suicide rates, too many people without health insurance, no health literacy, lack of access to programs and providers who can help them, as well as gaps in follow-up mental health care.  “I wish people knew they are making it harder than it has to be. I wish people could see it as a healthcare issue that could save lives,” pleaded Dr. Christopher Peters, medical director of Norton Children’s Behavioral and Mental Health Clinic.  “We are still unraveling how the pandemic is playing out in youth. What happens when we put a pause on a crucial developmental time? They have anxiety, and depression, so access to more treatment is absolutely needed.”  The community is struggling to meet the needs of citizens and Kentucky’s youth are being impacted most.”  “They believe in Frankfurt that acceptance is killing kids, that we are the problem. They want to shove us back into the closet,” said panelist Chris Hartman, Director of the Fairness Campaign. “The bills are geared towards eradicating the LGBTQ presence… The worst bills are concentrated in the Deep Red South. It’s no surprise because they see more queer youth than ever before that they think we are recruiting.”  Panelist Carmellia Jackson Hurley, Executive Director of Louisville Girls Leadership, ensured, “These kids know themselves better than anyone else. I wish people knew the students know themselves better than we ever could. And I wish we could just help and guide them.”  “There’s a belief that the LGBTQ community is indoctrinating our youth,” said Hartman. “No, queer people have always been there… The actions in Frankfurt are teaching children to demonize another community.”  Essentially the laws being passed serve to legalize bullying. Many of the bills are often dubbed “Parents Rights Bills” and are touted as ways to protect children, but whose children are they protecting?  At a student-led rally in Frankfort, a Kentucky student who tried to take their own life publicly pleaded with the crowd and lawmakers to not pass a law that would subject others to more suffering. A 2022 survey conducted by The Trevor Project’s 2022 revealed 50% of LGBTQ teens seriously considered attempting suicide and 18% (twice the rate of non-LGBTQ teens) did attempt suicide.  “People in Frankfurt don’t know any queer people. They are making these laws so they can put a bullet point on their postcard to send out in the fall. They know it will score them cheap, easy points. Is a 3% bump worth a kid’s life? It’s not worth one single life,” said Hartman.  “Queers Gathering joyfully is going to prevent suicides… They want to eliminate the places where we gather joyfully. Events are getting get canceled because of threats of violence… If they’re racist, they are going to be transphobic and homophobic. It goes back to the intersectionality of racism, sexism, homophobia.”  Over the past year, protesters in Kentucky were often met by supporters of the anti-trans bill, like Conservative Family Foundation, who show up and hold their own rallies alongside protests. The Family Foundation and other supporters of the bill say it protects children from “irreparable harm” and safeguards parents’ rights.  “SB 150 will protect the lives of Kentucky children by setting policy in alignment with the truth that every child is created as a male or female and deserves to be loved, treated with dignity, and accepted for who they really are,” Family Foundation leader David Walls said in a statement, calling the override “a win for children and their parents in Kentucky.”  The panel also expressed the need for more spiritual and religious leaders to speak out. These hateful worldviews often have an underpinning of religious views.  “We must make people own up when they are not supportive,” encouraged Hartman. “If that’s how you feel, own it. Say it. Call them out. Don’t allow others to be compliant.”  Other potential solutions to the current disconnect in our city include pooling of resources.  “Louisville is a resource-dense area, but nobody knows. Here in Louisville, people are stuck in their own silos; everyone is doing the same thing. We need to step up and build community, maintain community and put egos aside,” said Jackson-Hurley.  Another step in the right direction is the 911 diversion program where people can call 911 and get someone other than the police with firearms to show up and help.  “We’ve got to make ourselves available and be a lifeline to others when they need it so that they can be there for us when we need it,” Hartman said.  “How can we help folks feel less isolated, rejected? How can we help people who have a mental diagnosis receive help and treatment? How can we keep weapons locked up and put away so those at risk have less access to the things that can kill them?” Peters asked.  Some of the reasons why people commit suicide are because ‘they feel rejected and isolated. Mental illness impacts how they see themselves and the world around them.”  Commuter cities and sprawl cities like Louisville suffer from the dynamic where nobody knows where the resources are.  When asked what can we do to combat this, the panel encouraged the public to share Fairness Campaign posts, articles and other information on social media to amplify what’s going on. Use your point of privilege and create a space of grace.  The panel was hosted by Queer Kentucky, in partnership with the Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness Division of Suicide Prevention, The Big Stomp, The Fairness Campaign, and Louisville Girls Leadership.  The results of this session will be shared with the Suicide Prevention Department of Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness. They will guide Queer Kentucky on implementing two public events addressing this topic.

"suicide","2020-11-07","Not Discerned","{""Manville"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:05:00","When Manville schools shifted to virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 17-year-old Myles Fitzpatrick came out as transgender and began transitioning from female to male, according to a lawsuit filed this month on his family’s behalf.  But when in-person learning resumed the following school year, the lawsuit charges Fitzpatrick was harassed, intimidated and bullied by other students because of his gender identity, and school officials did nothing to help, causing Fitzpatrick’s death by suicide on Nov. 7.  Fitzpatrick’s mother, Danielle Warshefski, is now suing the Manville school district for negligence – alleging officials failed to stop the bullying.  “Fitzpatrick has been severely injured as a result of such harassment and discrimination that he suffered physical and bodily injuries, severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, anguish, personal hardship, social disruption, psychological and emotional harm, and other such damages which ultimately led to plaintiff Fitzpatrick taking his life as a result of such harassment and discrimination,” the lawsuit filed May 2 in Superior Court of Somerset County.  The students harassed Fitzpatrick by calling him “f*****,” referring to him as “she”, attempting to make a mockery of his gender, pushing him into lockers, and telling Fitzpatrick that he would never be a male, the lawsuit said.  R. Daniel Bause, the attorney representing the family, did not return requests for comment. But he told mycentraljersey.com, “In our opinion, the current system let Myles down, and we look forward to proving the allegations contained in the lawsuit to hopefully effectuate positive change in that regard.”  Manville Superintendent Jamil Maroun said in an email that he could not comment on pending litigation.  “Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving for Myles’ family, the students who were his friends, and the staff members who taught him,” he said.  Fitzpatrick, whose family said in his obituary enjoyed exploring the woods, hiking and camping, was one of four students whose deaths by suicide have made headlines in recent months following allegations of bullying at school.  The others include Jack Reid, who died by suicide on April 30, 2022, at The Lawrenceville School after students bullied him and spread false rumors about him across campus. The school has acknowledged that it failed to protect Reid as part of a settlement in the case; Adriana Kuch, who died by suicide on Feb. 3, days after a video of four classmates attacking her spread around Central Regional High School in Bayville; and Felicia LoAlbo-Melendez, who died by suicide on Feb. 6 after bullying at school, less than two weeks after the death of her father.  One member of the LGBTQ community called Fitzpatrick’s death a tragedy.  “We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of Myles,” said Christian Fuscaraino, the executive director of Garden State Equality, which uplifts the diverse voices of LGBTQ+ communities through education and advocacy. “No student should ever have to face bullying or harassment based on their gender identity. We have to do more to create safe and inclusive school environments for students to learn.”  Thank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.

"suicide","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:18:26","Being a star comes with a package deal. The moment you become a star, your life does not remain private anymore. Haesoo, a 29-year-old Korean trot singer, has died by suicide in her dormitory on May 12, leaving behind a suicide note. The news of her passing spread quickly among her fans, fellow musicians, and industry insiders, who expressed their condolences on social media.  Back home, after Deepika Padukone’s confession on her struggle with depression, many came out talking about their mental health issues. Actor Tiger Shroff also underwent severe depression after the release of ‘A Flying Jatt’. Shah Rukh Khan also landed up with depression after his shoulder injury. It was also found out after the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, how he too struggled with mental health problems.  According to WHO, which estimates around 20 percent of youth, who suffer from mental health yet, this is just the recorded ones and if we can think about the ones which have not been recorded where I see the numbers increase. Social norms have created more struggles in balancing the physical and psychological health.  The numbers are increasing with cases such as parental pressures, the social pressures to “fit in”, social media and its demands, addictions and peer pressure, disturbed family environment and many more reasons to trigger mental health.  Padma Rewari, Psychotherapist from Mumbai says, “You are scrutinized for every act, every behaviour and never left to be a normal person. This pressure often leads to anxiety, depression, stress and other mental health issues. The celebrity status also makes them lonely and have the fear of missing out(FOMO) where competition and comparison are their daily challenges.”  The stigma around mental health  Physical health is always taken well in society and people will rush to a doctor and spend money. The myth around mental health and the acceptance around it still needs a makeover.  Say Rewari, “People are still not ready to seek professional help and use it as last resort when things turn chronic and so many times leading to suicide. How often as mental health professions we feel this could have been prevented if only the person got help in the right time. The reasons mental health is still not addressed in the global platform is the stigma attached, lack of efficient resources, myth around medication.”  Investing on mental health are some concerns to ponder on and change the mind-set. One would easily talk about suffering from diabetes but one would never openly share about having OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) or anxiety attacks  Rewari explained that due to the environmental triggers, the mental health issues have risen beyond control. The need of the hour is promoting and providing services. Educating hospitals and promoting mental health professionals in corporates, media where there is lot of pressure. I would also encourage stars and celebrities to have personal counsellors appointed and put therapy sessions on priority.  The mental health awareness has improved way beyond what existed years ago. But there has to be a complete global and consistent support and the support systems reaching each part of the society. Mental health hospitals (more in numbers) for chronic patients, addictions, other mental health disorders that need hospitalization in affordable prices.  The pressure of social media and mental health  Youth today are triggered more by social media. They are impatient, restless and peer pressure adds on to their anxiety levels. They want to achieve success before time and failing to do so they are frustrated and depressed. This often leads to addictions. The pressure is built with in and the competition around them. Life style also has a major contribution to play here.  Rewari explains that celebrities and stars who look and sound extremely happy have committed suicide in the past or have had suicidal tendencies. They often tend to supress their emotional pain, stress and anxiety, depression. It is very difficult to quote underlying issues that would have caused the person to end his or her life. So often they seek the solace by substance abuse, alcohol which gives them temporary relief. For them it is a competitive world which they are aware and the society that weighs their success over their failures. This pressure on public versus private life makes them feel helpless at times, leading to depression and that their value in society has no meaning leads to suicidal tendencies and suicide. Families and friends here must immediately seek professional help instead of waiting.  Mental health is as important as physical health  Garnering celebrity peer support works wonders and people should meet on such platforms to share and care. Like the way, Deepika Padukone started her mental health foundation (LLL) and similarly such platforms should be an investment for stars and celebrities to help society and their fellow members in general. The stigma around mental health needs to change. This can only be done by sensitizing, promoting and making it available.  Effects of mental health Issues:  Feelings of anxiety, concern, rage, despair, numbness, or frustration  Appetite, energy, desire, and interest changes  Having trouble focusing and making judgments  Nightmares or issues falling asleep  Physical symptoms include aches and pains, stomachaches, rashes, or headaches  Chronic health issues and mental health concerns becoming worse  Increased alcohol consumption, use of illicit substances and abuse of prescription medicines.

(KELO) — South Dakota had the fifth highest rate of suicide in the U.S. in 2021, according to the CDC.  The state Department of Health says more than 200 South Dakotans died of suicide that year.  Early numbers show suicides were down in South Dakota last year from that 10-year high.  Joel Kaskinen is trying to save lives through his work.  He’s the community engagement manager at Lost&Found, a suicide prevention organization.  He found himself here after working in higher education in Colorado.  “I lost three students to suicide in one year’s time, and I was a first responder to a student suicide. I was there when it happened, witnessed it, performed first aid,” Kaskinen said.  He decided to turn the pain and trauma into action.  “If I can talk about suicide and mental health awareness every single day, my hope is that I’m reaching at least one person through my daily conversations,” Kaskinen said.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month.  Karla Salem is an integrated health therapist with Sanford Health.  “We all have our time that the life just gets too much for us. There’s too much going on, it’s overwhelming, it’s sad, all of those things, but when you start feeling those things on a more regular chronic basis, when you just don’t find as much joy or happiness, you don’t find relief from your pain, those are kind of the indicators that things are getting kind of bad,” Salem said.  Salem says that’s a good time to reach out for help from a medical provider, family, or friend.  Meanwhile, Kaskinen is doing everything he can to stop more tragedies from happening.  “Suicide is preventable, and if we raise awareness of mental health challenges and the warning signs from people who are facing these challenges of feeling suicidal or having ideations if we can normalize those conversations and realize that everyone is just going through a tough time and there is help there and we can prevent this, that’s our goal,” Kaskinen said.  If you’re struggling with mental health or having thoughts of suicide, call 988.  You can find more resources at the Mental Health Fair this Saturday at Levitt at the Falls.

Trinity Health Michigan is joining a new nationwide network of hospitals collaborating on suicide prevention that will test methods to detect suicide risk in patients and connect them to the care they need.    Research shows nearly half of people who die by suicide interact with the healthcare system in the month before their death, providing a critical opportunity to save lives.    Julie Goldstein Grumet is the director of the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center. She says healthcare providers will use evidence-based methods to detect suicide risk and collect real-time data, as they would with other health concerns. Grumet said “We get our blood pressure and our weight just to kind of check there’s not an underlying issue – and we need to do the same when it comes to suicide. We need to ask at every visit, every person"".    Grumet added when interventions are used properly, hospitals can reduce suicide rates of people in their care by up to 75%. She said it’s always important to ask people directly if they are considering suicide, and advise them to contact the nationwide Suicide and Crisis Hotline at 9-8-8.    Over the next 14 months, participating hospitals will test and refine innovations to improve the care provided to patients at risk of suicide.    Melissa Tolstyka is the director of behavioral health services at Trinity Health in Ann Arbor and says utilizing the best practices will build confidence in hospital staff that they're providing the best care. She said ""You know you can always ask the question, are you feeling suicidal? But when someone responds, yes, what’s that next step? What can you do to put that patient at ease but also what can you do to feel confident that you can have that conversation?”. Tolstyka says data collection will be imperative to the new network's success and will help staff adjust their methods and treatments along the way.    The latest data reveals suicide claimed roughly 48,000 lives in 2021.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndobWkuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS90cmluaXR5LWhlYWx0aC1ob3NwaXRhbHMtc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The bodies of Parth Gandhi, 49, and his son, 16, were found on Saturday morning at the offices of Psychedelic Therapy and Research in Salt Lake City, KSLTV reported.  Gandhi worked at the offices as a neuropsychologist and clinic director with a “focus on psychedelics,” the outlet said.  It is unclear exactly what psychedelic therapy involves, or if the clinic advocates the use of illegal substances.  It is also not yet known if psychedelic drugs or other substances were present in Gandhi’s body or that of his son, who has not been named due to his age.  “Our detectives right now, they’re still developing more information trying to figure out, trying to answer the question of what may have motivated him to do this,” Brent Weisberg of the Salt Lake City Police Department told KSLTV on Monday.  Parth Gandhi, 49, was found dead on Saturday. Parth Gandhi/Facebook  The outlet noted that Gandhi mentioned remedies for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse on social media.  He also posted on Facebook in Dec. 2022 to celebrate his son’s musical abilities.  “Just reeling over it — I’m in utter shock.

Henderson Detention Center located at 18 East Basic Road, Thursday, August 3, 2017. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)  A wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of a man who killed himself at Henderson Detention Center alleged that the jail should not have removed him from suicide watch.  Jason Foy, 38, was found hanging inside his cell on April 25, 2021. He was taken to Henderson Hospital where he later died.  After his arrest on April 23, Foy told the officer taking him to jail that he wanted to kill himself. After being booked, Foy was placed on suicide watch, according to a complaint filed in District Court last month.  ‘I’m sick of this’  “You’re going to have something else on your hands because I’m going to (expletive) hang myself,” backseat video captured Foy saying to a police officer. “I’m sick of this.”  The next morning Foy was cleared by a social worker and removed from suicide watch.  At around 2:40 p.m. on April 25, Foy was found hanging during a cell check.  The Clark County coroner’s office said Foy died by hanging and ruled his death a suicide.  Foy was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and depression and was not provided adequate mental health treatment while in custody, according to the complaint.  Arrest details  According to a Henderson Police Department arrest report, Foy was arrested for misdemeanor assault against his girlfriend, who reported to police that Foy was prone to fits of sudden rage. She said Foy came home drunk and threw a water bottle at her. Foy then threw a door that was off its hinges down a hallway, shattering an overhead light in the process.  Body-camera footage from an officer who responded to the call showed officers asking Foy to tell his side of what happened. Foy said he defused the situation by going into his room to sleep and said telling his side wouldn’t help because he would be going to jail either way.  “I’m not going to have a story because this keeps going on and on,” Foy said. “I’m out on bail right now for the same exact thing.”  A note addressed to his girlfriend was found in Foy’s cell with the words “Waiting to Die,” on it, according to a Henderson police incident report.  Surveillance footage from inside Henderson Detention Center on April 25 shows Foy in a common area by himself standing and then sitting before going into his cell. After some time, an officer walks through looking into the doors of the other cells. The officer stopped at Foy’s door and soon after, several officers and medical personnel run into the room.  According to an incident report, Foy attempted to make five phone calls that were denied before going back into his cell to hang himself.  The report said officers continued to do routine checks of Foy’s cell after he was cleared from suicide watch. Police noted that Foy had been placed on suicide watch at Henderson Detention Center in 2016, 2020 and 2021.  The city of Henderson, the Henderson Police Department, former Police Chief Thedrick Andres and Naphcare, Inc. were named as defendants in the case.  Naphcare contracts with Clark County to provide services to people detained at Henderson Detention Center, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit alleged a deprivation of civil rights, negligence, wrongful death and discrimination based on a disability.  When reached for comment Wednesday, George Hand, an attorney representing Foy, said, “We’re just relying on the facts in the complaint at this time.”  City of Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said the department and city could not comment on pending litigation.  Naphcare could not be reached for comment.  If you’re thinking about suicide, or are worried about a friend or loved one, help is available 24/7 by calling or texting the Lifeline network at 988.

Following a thorough investigation, which included review of security camera footage, crime scene analysis, and witness interviews, OSI confirmed that on May 8, 2022, off-duty New York City Police Department (NYPD) Officer Sean Armstead shot and killed Edward Wilkins in a parking lot on Route 211 and committed suicide immediately after.  On the night of May 8, 2022, Mr. Wilkins was driving westbound on Route 211 in a black sedan when his car was hit by a Dodge Charger driven by Officer Armstead. When the cars came to a stop, Mr. Wilkins got out of the sedan and began to run away. Officer Armstead got out of his car to chase Mr. Wilkins. He shot Mr. Wilkins multiple times in the parking lot of a Buffalo Wild Wings before shooting himself in the head. Mr. Wilkins and Officer Armstead were both pronounced dead at the scene. Responding officers recovered Officer Armstead’s service weapon at the scene.  A full review of the evidence supports the conclusion that Officer Armstead was responsible for Mr. Wilkins’ death. OSI uncovered no evidence indicating that any other person was involved in the homicide. Therefore, there is no basis on which OSI could seek charges against any living person in this case.  Executive Law Section 70-b directs OSI to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute offenses arising from any incident in which the death of a person is caused by a police officer, whether on or off duty. When OSI does not or, as in this case, cannot seek charges against the officer, Section 70-b requires OSI to issue a public report describing its investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYWcubnkuZ292L3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy9hdHRvcm5leS1nZW5lcmFsLWphbWVzLW9mZmljZS1zcGVjaWFsLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tcmVsZWFzZXMtcmVwb3J0LWRlYXRoLWVkd2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""AnnArbor"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:40:56","Legislation in Michigan to ban mental health professionals from performing conversion therapy on minors under penalty of losing their licenses will be introduced this week.  Conversion therapy, the practice of intervening to alter an individual’s gender expression or sexuality to conform to heterosexuality, involves psychologically damaging processes, bill sponsor Rep. Jason Hoskins (D-Southfield) told the Michigan Advance. On Thursday, Hoskins said he, along with other representatives and members of the state Senate, will introduce bills to protect minors from such practices.  “At the end of the day, this is really torture for kids,” Hoskins said. “You’re growing up, you’re figuring things out and I think children should have that opportunity to do that.”  LGBTQ youth who were put in conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide than their peers who had not been through conversion therapy, according to research from The Trevor Project and published in the American Journal of Public Health.  Many major health organizations oppose conversion therapy.  Since 1998, the American Psychiatric Association has opposed conversion therapy and said in a statement on its website that, “gender diverse patients have been shown to benefit from gender-affirming therapies.”  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said not only is there a lack of evidence conversion therapy works to the desired effect, but, “…there is evidence that such interventions are harmful. As a result, ‘conversion therapies’ should not be part of any behavioral health treatment of children and adolescents.”  Currently, 21 states have a ban on conversion therapy for minors, and Michigan is one of four states that have a ban on using federal or state funds for conversion therapy on minors.  Conversion therapy is an “abusive practice” and must be stopped for the benefit of all Michigan residents, Equality Michigan Executive Director Erin Knott told the Michigan Advance in an emailed statement Wednesday.  “So-called conversion therapy is a dangerous and discredited pseudoscience that frequently leads to depression, decreased self-esteem, substance abuse, and even suicide,” Knott said. “Equality Michigan calls upon the Legislature to protect our youth and their families from this deceitful, denigrating, and lethal tactic, and take the necessary action to ensure Michigan becomes the 22nd state to ban this barbaric practice.”  Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive directive banning state and federal funding for the practice in 2021, calling conversion therapy harmful and a barrier for LGBTQ+ Michiganders from reaching their full potential in the state.  “Since day one, I have made it clear that hate has no home in Michigan,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing her directive in 2021. “The actions we take today will serve as a starting point in protecting our LGBTQ+ youth from the damaging practice of conversion therapy and in ensuring that Michigan is a reflection of true inclusion.”  Similar legislation has been introduced in the past in Michigan but hasn’t made it through the previously Republican-led legislature.  Now, with a Democratic majority in the state legislature that recently passed legislation that was signed into law to expand Michigan’s civil rights laws to include protections for LGBTQ+ rights, Hoskins said public perception of LGBTQ+ individuals is changing and he’s confident the legislation will pass.  “One of the issues with conversion therapy is that it is something that was put in place because there’s an idea that LGBTQ people need to fit in, that there’s something wrong with them, and that unfortunately helps discrimination flourish when you think you have to be fixed,” Hoskins said.  Hoskins said he’s partnering with Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and Rep. Felicia Brabec (D-Pittsfield), who in 2021 introduced a ban on conversion therapy. Those bills were never voted out of committee.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbWljaGlnYW5hZHZhbmNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L21pY2hpZ2FuLWxhd21ha2Vycy10by1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtbGVnaXNsYXRpb24tYmFubmluZy1jb252ZXJzaW9uLXRoZXJhcHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Col. Michael J. Kennedy said as he spoke to a gathered crowd on base.  Monday kicked off National Police Week in Alaska and around the nation. President John F. Kennedy proclaimed May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day in 1962 and the week on which that day falls as Police Week.  The week has been used to honor law enforcement members who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This year, the 673d Security Forces Squadron also chose to remember those who lost their lives to suicide.  “It’s definitely an emotional day. We’ve got to remember all the lives that have been lost in the line of duty. Those who haven’t made it to the end of their watch,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Taylor Davis said. “In the last seven years, we calculated the numbers — there’ve been 1,981 lives taken in the line of duty, or lost by death or suicide.”  Kicking off at noon Monday, service members honored the lives of those fallen by running around the Elmendorf Fitness Track for 24 hours carrying a guidon, a flag bearing the name of the squadron.  Throughout the day, service members will hand off the guidon as it continues to make its way around the entire track — all day, never stopping.  “There as a symbol, have it moving is a dedication to what we are doing here this week,” Davis said.  It’s an opportunity to reflect on the lives lost, Kennedy said. In the past, Kennedy said he has participated in it.  This year, he planned to participate as well and run with his family.  “Obviously, I lost friends in security forces. I lost a lot of law enforcement friends as well,” Kennedy said. “It’s an honor, it’s really humbling. It’s a somber experience.”  As the troops click off laps around the track carrying the guidon, remembering the names of the fallen and their stories, they continue to move forward together and never forget those who lost their lives.  “We remember the courage with which they worked and lived,” Kennedy said. “And may we recommit ourselves to the mission to which they dedicated their lives.”  Copyright 2023 KTUU.

"suicide","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:17:23","(Geber86/E+ via Getty Images)  Lesbian and bisexual women may be less likely to have ideal heart health scores than heterosexual women, according to new research. Gay or bisexual men, however, scored higher than their heterosexual peers, but only if they lived in urban areas.  The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, measured cardiovascular health among lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual adults in France using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, a set of lifestyle behaviors and factors for good cardiovascular health.  The metrics encourage people to be physically active, eat a healthy diet, sleep seven to nine hours each night, manage their weight, avoid tobacco products, and to control blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.  ""Improving these metrics is a great opportunity to prevent heart problems before they happen,"" Omar Deraz, the study's lead author, said in a news release. Deraz is a researcher with Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, and the Paris Cardiovascular Research Center's Integrative Epidemiology of Cardiovascular Disease Team.  The study is the first to measure cardiovascular health disparities using Life's Essential 8 among gay, lesbian and bisexual people, researchers said.  The study included health data from about 169,400 adults in France – including nearly 91,000 women – who participated in the nationwide Constances study. Participants did not have cardiovascular disease and had an average age of 46.  Among the women, 93% identified as heterosexual; about 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 0.61% identified as lesbian. Among the men, 90% identified as heterosexual; 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 3% identified as gay. About 3% of all participants declined to answer questions about their sexual orientation.  After adjusting for variables such as family history of cardiovascular disease, age and social factors, the researchers found that lesbian and bisexual women had lower cardiovascular health scores compared to heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men living in urban areas scored higher than heterosexual men, whereas those living in rural areas had lower cardiovascular health scores and were less likely to reach ideal cardiovascular health.  Compared to their heterosexual peers, lesbian women scored lower for healthy diet and blood pressure. In contrast, bisexual women had higher scores for healthy diet and nicotine exposure.  Previous research shows LGBT adults are less likely to access health care and more likely to delay treatment than heterosexual adults. Deraz said it is essential to recognize and overcome barriers to health care access.  ""Improving cultural competency and awareness of cardiovascular disease risk among sexual minority adults may help to improve conversations between doctors and patients about cardiovascular health,"" he said.  The study's authors said, citing previous evidence, that LGBT populations disproportionately experience depression and attempted suicide. These have been linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Discrimination and violence fueled by bias, and increased societal stressors, also may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors, including increased alcohol use, smoking and a sedentary lifestyle.  In the study, lesbian, gay and bisexual adults overall reported anxiety disorders, depression symptoms or attempted suicide more frequently than heterosexual adults. However, lesbian women less frequently reported anxiety disorders and depression symptoms compared to heterosexual women.  In a 2020 scientific statement, the AHA noted that LGBTQ adults experience significant psychosocial stressors that compromise their cardiovascular health.  Because France is a high-income country that offers universal health care insurance, the researchers cautioned that their findings may not apply to other countries. The study, they said, also is limited by its single focus on assessing cardiovascular health by sexual orientation, and that heart health data was unavailable for those who identified as transgender.  Even so, ""it's important research into a population that is grossly underrepresented in clinical and epidemiological studies,"" said Dr. Connie Tsao, attending staff cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who was not involved in the new study.  ""To fully address discrimination and disparities that impact health, we must better recognize and understand the unique experiences of all individuals and populations, including sexual minorities,"" she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYXJ0Lm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbGVzYmlhbi1hbmQtYmlzZXh1YWwtd29tZW4tbWF5LWhhdmUtd29yc2UtaGVhcnQtaGVhbHRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-16","21:00:00","{""Brownville"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:01:00","PILLAR POINT, New York (WWNY) - Police describe “bullets whizzing past us” and diving “behind the patrol vehicles for cover” during Tuesday night’s standoff with a Pillar Point man.  The suspect, 45-year-old Nathan Krump, is charged with first-degree attempted murder. Following his arraignment Wednesday in Watertown City Court, 7 News obtained multiple pages of police statements.  In those pages, members of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and New York State Police recount their harrowing experience of being shot at, taking cover behind a trooper car that was hit by a bullet, watching a house go up in flames, and tasing the suspect to take him into custody.  Deputy Humberto Perez reported that he was sent to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6:15 p.m. to check on a person who lives there.  “The caller was advising that a Nathan Krump was making suicidal/homicidal posts on Facebook and he believed that suicide by cop may be part of his plan,” Perez said.  After getting to the home, Perez was joined on the scene by Trooper Derrick Leonard.  Perez reported that Krump, while holding a white object, began yelling at him to get off his property “or I’m going to shoot you” and also, “You’re going to get killed.”  (Other police later said the white object appeared to be a rifle with a white stock.)  “Nathan then raised the object at me with one hand and I heard a gunshot,” he said. “I heard Trooper Leonard call out over the air that Nathan had just shot at me.”  Perez said he and Leonard used the trooper’s patrol vehicle for cover while waiting for more police to arrive.  Once other law enforcement officials got there, Perez said, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  In his statement, Trooper Leonard described how he and two other troopers were positioned behind doors of a marked police vehicle.  “I heard several shots fired, at least three of which were fired at our position. Two of the rounds went over our heads and one round struck the windshield” of the police vehicle.  Police said they repeatedly tried to make contact with Krump through the PA system, but he didn’t respond.  The sheriff’s department’s SERT (Special Emergency Response Team) arrived on the scene with its MRAP armored vehicle and began to advance toward the place where Krump was holed up.  Deputy James Randall said he heard several rounds “striking what I believe to be the residence behind me.”  He said he and another deputy went to the neighbor’s home to evacuate the people who live there. While crossing their yard, Randall said, “More shots were fired in our direction.” He reported that he fell and sprained his ankle.  The other deputy, Jeffrey Froelich, said Randall provided cover for him as he helped evacuate a couple and their dog to safety.  During this time, Deputy Froelich reported seeing fire at the home where Krump had been.  “The residence was now fully engulfed and propane tanks attached to the house went up in flames and created a huge fireball,” he said.  Police reported the heavy smoke made it difficult to see  Deputy Matthew Young stated he saw a man, later identified as Krump, driving a tractor toward a state police vehicle.

Australian Ambassador to the Philippines HK Yu PSM said “Australia recognizes the value of addressing the mental health concerns of the Filipino people that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with DOH, WHO, and other UN agencies through Project BRAVE, to deliver mental health services to communities – especially to women, children and adolescents – through capacity-building and development initiatives.”  Representatives from public and private media organizations, DOH media partners, and regulatory bodies discussed best practices for reporting on suicide incidents, including respecting one’s data privacy, eliminating graphic details and focusing only on factual information, using non-judgmental language, and providing trigger warnings and helpful information with every story. Mental health experts also stressed the importance of taking a suicide-prevention approach to avoid copycat incidents.  Given that suicide remains one of the most pressing health issues in the world, and evidence shows that media portrayal and reportage can contribute to preventing suicide risks, in March 2022, DOH released Administrative Order (AO) 2022-0004 on the Guidelines for Responsible and Ethical Portrayal of Suicide in Media, Audiovisuals, and Films. The AO outlines concrete actions to encourage responsible reporting and portrayal and establish mechanisms to gain feedback to prevent suicide and further harm due to unethical coverage.  Furthermore, the WHO Mental Health Report 2022 states that globally, one in every 100 deaths is by suicide, and it is the leading cause of death among adolescents. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) found that the suicide rate in 2020 increased by 57.3% from the previous year (4,892 individuals), with the highest numbers coming from the 15 to 29 age groups.  “Suicide is preventable with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Our vision is a world where death by suicide is no longer a leading cause of death and where people who are attempting or thinking about suicide feel comfortable seeking help which is provided capably and respectfully to all. We need a Mindful Media environment to reach our goals to prevent suicide and suicide attempts,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.  The DOH, through the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH), has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns. The 1553 hotline is a Luzon-wide, toll-free landline number.

These are important jobs that make good careers in public service. In honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.”  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) spoke on the floor today in honor of Police Week, calling on her colleagues to pass her bill, the Invest to Protect Act, which will set aside crucial funding specifically for small police departments across the country.  As the former top law enforcement official in Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto has been a leading advocate in the Senate for our police officers and is part of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. Last year, she secured historic funding for the Byrne JAG grant program, the leading source of criminal justice funding in the country. Her bipartisan bills to combat the crisis of law enforcement suicide and provide mental health resources to police officers have been signed into law by presidents of both parties. Cortez Masto recently reintroduced the BADGES for Native Communities Act to support the Bureau of Indian Affairs with law enforcement recruitment and retention.  Below are her remarks as prepared for delivery:  M. President, we observe Police Week every year to honor the men and women who risk their lives each day for the safety of our communities. As we go about our daily lives, our police officers are the ones protecting us and our families.  They know that this job puts their lives in danger. And their families know that every day when their loved one leaves for work, they may not come home. It’s a sacrifice for the individual getting up and leaving that house, and it is a sacrifice for the loved ones watching that individual leave.  Why do I know that? Because I’m married 25 years to a federal law enforcement officer now retired. And I remember in the middle of the night when he was on call, and he got that call, and his boots were by the side of the bed, slips his feet into them, and walks out that door.  And every spouse, every loved one who sees them leave has always in the back of their mind, “Are they going to come home?”  And so, this is important that we recognize the men and women who are representing and protecting our communities every single day.  I’ve been honored to work with Nevada’s police officers throughout my career. I have worked with police departments across my state to crack down on crime, prosecute offenders, and keep Nevadans safe. Not only have I worked in my state as a prosecutor, I’ve worked here in the District of Columbia, in the United States Attorney’s Office as a prosecutor.  I’ve witnessed the hard work and dedication of our police officers firsthand, whether you’re a state police officer, a local city or county police officer, or a federal officer. I have worked alongside them. I know what they do day in and day out. And that’s why my role in the Senate will always be to fight for our law enforcement.  It’s been my priority to listen to the needs of police departments throughout Nevada, both big and small, to ensure I’m doing everything I can to get them what they need to protect our communities. That includes securing funding for more resources, improved technology, and better training for our officers.  Last year, alongside Senator Grassley, I was proud to make sure Congress passed the biggest increase in Byrne JAG funding in ten years. And to help put an end to tragic law enforcement suicides, I introduced and passed legislation to increase data collection on suicide and support peer counseling programs that can improve police officers’ mental health.  Now, while these investments are so crucial to ensuring our officers are prepared for the job, far too many smaller police departments just can’t compete with their larger counterparts for resources. I know this from our law enforcement agencies in my rural communities in Nevada. Our law enforcement communities in our rural areas, which are much smaller, have to really fight for resources that they need. Over 90% of police departments nationally, including several in Nevada, have fewer than 200 full-time officers.  That’s why I’ve worked with Senator Grassley to introduce the Invest to Protect Act. This legislation would set aside grant funding specifically for smaller local police departments, including Tribal law enforcement, to ensure they can access the resources they need to keep our families safe.  Police officers in both Northern and Southern Nevada have told me about how hard it is to do their jobs when they’re short on personnel. They’re stretched too thin, and that makes it harder for them to protect our communities and their own lives.  The Invest to Protect Act will help these police departments with recruitment and retention so they have enough officers to serve their communities. These are important jobs that make good careers in public service.  So, in honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3J0ZXptYXN0by5zZW5hdGUuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvZHVyaW5nLXBvbGljZS13ZWVrLWNvcnRlei1tYXN0by1jYWxscy1mb3ItaW5jcmVhc2VkLXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLWxhdy1lbmZvcmNlbWVudC1vbi10aGUtc2VuYXRlLWZsb29y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

ABC11 is helping to decode the difference between mental health and mental illness. As the terms are used more and more, many may still wonder what they mean or what the difference is.  ""Mental health is what we all have,"" said WakeMed psychiatrist Dr. Nerissa Price who describes mental health as a continuum. Something that's always there -- whether it's positive or negative.  ""It has to be really intentionally looked after,"" Dr. Price said. ""You don't just wake up having good mental health.""  Silent Struggle: ABC11 to host town hall aimed at combating youth mental health  Mental health, at its best, you're excelling: joyful, energetic, high-performing at work or school. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may be in crisis: extremely anxious, not sleeping, perhaps thoughts of suicide. Those are serious signs of mental illness.  ""There's a lot of complexity that goes into us developing mental illness that we don't fully understand,"" said Price.  Being aware of the triggers can make a huge difference. Sometimes it's genetics, a family history of mental illness or substance use disorder or unresolved stress: a death, financial problems, divorce.  But 75% of mental illnesses begin before the age of 24 -- triggered by a childhood trauma that's never been confronted.  ""It's so important to reach the child, the teenager, the young person to help them to identify when these symptoms may begin to help get them treatment at those early stages,"" Price said.  SEE ALSO | 'Pivotal moment for action.' Mental health crisis among teens mounts as stakeholders ask for help  Among the coping strategies Dr. Price promotes, resilience is a key component. It's your ability to recover when adverse things happen.  ""Resilience can be taught. Resilience can be learned,"" Price said. ""Just in the same way you can learn to strengthen your physical body, you strengthen your mental body.""  Price agrees it's possible to have good mental health even if suffering from a mental illness.  ""Absolutely,"" she said. ""In fact, there are treatments that are really successful in helping people with mental illness and they work so well and can get people back on track to have the fullness of their life.""

Kari Oyen is the director of the school psychology program at the University of South Dakota. She said don’t underestimate the value of social interactions.  “The social-emotional system is running rampant,"" Oyen said. ""We do a lot of what we call reward seeking, so when you are beyond the age of 10 there’s a dip in your dopamine. Dopamine is the thing that makes you feel good when you get rewards. That’s what’s happening – you get that reward seeking – but what’s so fascinating about adolescents is you mostly feel those things in the presence of peers. There is a lot of perhaps misperception that is happening for our adolescents, and they really are perceiving that they are feeling quite isolated.”  Dr. Wallace Jackman with Avera said there are tangible effects to social media use.  “There’s a direct link between the amount of time folks spend on social media and their distress level, anxiety and depression,"" Jackman said.

On the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, we reaffirm our commitment to this ongoing work and stand with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people around the world.    More than 30 years ago today, thanks to the tireless advocacy of LGBTQI+ activists the World Health Organization took the long overdue step of declassifying ‘homosexuality’ as a mental health disorder. Since then, we’ve seen real progress—including a powerful movement for LGBTQI+ liberation, more protections for LGBTQI+ people, and more spaces that recognize and affirm that our diversity is our strength. But sadly, we continue to see reminders of how much work remains. More than 60 countries still criminalize homosexuality and some are considering even more draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation. Some governments continue to classify LGBTQI+ individuals as having a medical disorder or permit the use of so-called “conversion therapy”—a dangerous and discredited practice that blatantly violates human rights and causes significant harm, including high rates of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors among LGBTQI+ youth. And right here at home, violent attacks on LGBTQI+ individuals and community spaces have risen dramatically, and more than 600 hateful laws have been introduced this year targeting the LGBTQI+ community, particularly youth.    That is why, during my first month in office, I signed a Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World to combat criminalization, protect vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees, and build international coalitions to fight against discrimination. Last June, I signed an Executive Order directing my Administration to work to prevent the use of so-called “conversion therapy” in the United States and around the world. We have also launched a new Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally to ensure that our efforts to confront the scourge of gender-based violence addresses the unique risks and barriers for LGBTQI+ people. And, my Administration continues to engage with governments, faith leaders, families, and communities around the globe to protect and promote respect for human rights—including LGBTQI+ rights.    Here at home, we’ve also worked to advance equality and equity for LGBTQI+ Americans. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ citizens in housing, health care, education, the criminal justice system, and more. We have made strides in ensuring that transgender and non-binary Americans can access accurate federal IDs and vital government services—from emergency homeless shelters to Social Security benefits. The Department of Justice is responding to discriminatory state laws that violate the rights and freedoms of LGBTQI+ youth and their families. And, I am proud to have appointed a historic number of proud LGBTQI+ public servants, including the first openly gay person to serve as a Cabinet Secretary, the first two openly transgender Americans to ever be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and the first openly lesbian American to achieve the rank of Ambassador.    All of us have a responsibility to speak out and stand up against hate and violence in any form. When the rights of any group or individual are under attack, it endangers our own freedom, and the freedom of people everywhere. So today, let us join together across our country—and around the world—to stand with the LGBTQI+ community. Let us renew our work to combat homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia—and put an end to the harmful violence and discrimination that stems from it.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9zdGF0ZW1lbnQtZnJvbS1wcmVzaWRlbnQtam9lLWJpZGVuLW9uLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZGF5LWFnYWluc3QtaG9tb3Bob2JpYS1iaXBob2JpYS1hbmQtdHJhbnNwaG9iaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:46:29","Researchers from the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health released a set of state-based policy recommendations to address the intersection of alcohol use and firearms.  Alcohol plays an outsize role in firearm fatalities. An estimated one in three individuals who committed homicide with a firearm had been heavily drinking when they murdered their victims. More than 30 percent of gun homicide victims had been heavily drinking when they were killed, and a quarter of gun suicide victims had been heavily drinking before dying by suicide.  The report’s recommendations were developed with a steering committee of the Consortium for Risk-Based Firearm Policy, a group of leading experts that advances evidence-based gun violence prevention policies. The Consortium is led by Joshua Horwitz, JD, the Dana Feitler Professor of the Practice in Gun Violence Prevention and Advocacy and co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Bloomberg School.  The report, “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy,” focuses on two policy areas: limiting access to firearms by a person with a documented history of alcohol misuse, such as driving under the influence, and restricting firearms at locations where alcohol is consumed. The authors based their recommendations on the latest available research on alcohol use and firearms as well as comprehensive reviews of state laws.  “The intersection of alcohol misuse and firearms can have devastating consequences,” says Silvia Villarreal, director of research translation at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions the report’s lead author. “These recommendations provide specific guidelines for states to limit access to firearms and address the risk of dangerous behaviors when the two are combined.”  Federal law does not address the risk of alcohol and guns, and many state laws are ambiguous. Some states prohibit possession of guns using unclear criteria such as “habitual drunkard,” or “while intoxicated.” Bringing a gun to a place where alcohol is present is legal in many states but prohibited in others. Some states exempt concealed carry permit holders from laws prohibiting firearm possession in places where alcohol is consumed.  To limit access to firearms by an individual with a history of alcohol misuse, the authors recommend that states focus on individuals with a history of driving under the influence or other documented alcohol misuse. The authors recommend that states pass laws that prohibit the following for at least five years:  The purchase and possession of firearms by an individual convicted of two or more instances within a five-year period of driving under the influence of alcohol or driving while intoxicated.  Obtaining or possessing a concealed carry permit—a license required to carry firearms in public—by individuals convicted of one driving under the influence offense, and/or documented with court records to have a recent history of alcohol misuse.  To limit access to guns when and where alcohol is consumed, the authors recommend that states pass laws prohibiting public carrying or possession of firearms where alcohol is consumed, including bars, restaurants, sporting arenas, and outdoor festivals and other events. Some states already have laws that restrict firearm possession in places such as bars and restaurants; however, concealed carry permit holders are often exempt from these laws.  The report also includes additional policy considerations, including:  Limiting the number of alcohol retailers in a particular area through licensing and zoning regulations.  Limiting the hours and days when alcohol can be served.  Increasing the price of alcohol by raising taxes.  “Firearm policies aimed at reducing harmful outcomes due to gun violence do not operate in a vacuum,” says Horwitz. “We must take into consideration the environment where alcohol is sold and consumed to limit the risk of potential violence.”  The report is aimed at researchers, practitioners, policymakers, law enforcement professionals, and others working to address gun violence.  “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy” was written by Silvia Villarreal, Amy Barnhorst, Richard Bonnie, Kami Chavis, Ari Davis, Shannon Frattaroli, Kelly Roskam, Jeffrey Swanson, and Joshua Horwitz.

Established to recognize students for their positive efforts in raising awareness, affecting change regarding mental health, and breaking down its stigma, Jain was one of five students selected out of 300 applicants. NSHSS, the organization that awarded Jain the scholarship, is an honors and scholarship program co-founded by Claes Nobel and James Lewis.  He received a $2,000 prize.  Jain harnessed artificial intelligence, according to a news release, to detect suicidal messaging in social media posts. The AI would then connect that user in crisis with help. He called his non-profit SuicideWatch.  In 2021, Jain worked with friends to develop an automated system that reads Twitter posts and flags suicidal messages. In 2023, they worked with mental health nonprofits, police departments, and crisis hotlines across the nation to provide help to the suicidal individuals they detect. In total, Jain has connected 600+ social media users with six mental health support partners, including Texas Health and Human Services.  In December, Google executive Kelley Gibson reached out to Jain. As a result, Google is exploring making SuicideWatch an internally funded, tax-free charitable nonprofit, connecting Lavik with research fellows experienced in suicide detection technology.

Shobhit Mahajan, a professor of astrophysics at Delhi, said that a particularly bad appointments backlog at the institution – which is one of India’s largest, with 80 colleges and about 700,000 students in total – has resulted in an acute situation.  “In DU, there were no permanent appointments for over a decade and more in some of its constituent colleges,” he said.  While a particular factor at Delhi, temporary employment is commonplace in India’s public university system, which includes upwards of 50 central universities and hundreds of state institutions, he said.  “In many state universities…there is a problem with permanent appointments since these are usually centralised for the whole state, which means a lot more bureaucracy and procedural issues,” Professor Mahajan said.  For displaced ad hoc lecturers, employment prospects at other public universities are slim, and teachers are “left to fend for themselves”, he said.  Times Higher Education has contacted Delhi University for comment. A registrar at the university previously told Indian media that there was no provision under India’s regulations for the absorption of ad hoc teachers.  Those who are made redundant are unlikely to rebuild careers in academia, although they may go on to teach in smaller private universities or in cram schools that prepare students for India’s hypercompetitive university entrance exams, he noted. “They will, of course, not get paid as much, nor will they have the prestige, but it is possibly better than starving.”  Apoorvanand, a Hindi professor at Delhi University, worried about the rapid review process preceding layoffs.  Describing the current approach at many colleges – in which expert panels take just a few minutes to assess ad hoc faculty – as a “farce”, he said it was common knowledge that the list of permanent appointees was largely predetermined ahead of time.  “If it’s only two to three minutes, it hardly matters who’s asking the questions,” he said, adding, “the list is known to those appearing for interviews”.  While he sympathised with the plight of ad hoc instructors, he cautioned that not all of them had been well suited for their jobs.  In many cases, he said, the “loyalty” of candidates took precedence over who was best qualified for the job, with principals or teachers’ associations pulling for politically like-minded employees to be hired.  He urged greater scrutiny of recruitment decisions. “It’s for the college to explain: why did you continue to employ them for years if they were not very capable? If you found them fit to teach for eight to 10 years, why is it that now you don’t find them fit for a permanent position?”  Professor Apoorvanand said political parties, which have a strong presence on India’s campuses, viewed academic vacancies as a “golden opportunity” to get loyal supporters into teaching posts in many colleges. He warned that, if successful, such a large-scale push could lead to disastrous consequences for the institution.  pola.lem@timeshighereducation.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzaGlnaGVyZWR1Y2F0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbGhpLXN1aWNpZGUtcmFpc2VzLWFsYXJtLW92ZXItbWFzcy1sYXlvZmZzLWFkLWhvYy1mYWN1bHR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","1991-10-05","Not Discerned","{""ElkCity"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:50:00","Brock became a suicide intervention counselor for farmers in the 1980s when she and her husband noticed a need in their community after losing their Lincoln County farm.  During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.  People can visit the dedication display for Mona Lee Brock and learn more about her legacy at the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry building.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtnb3Uub3JnL29rbGFob21hLW5ld3MvMjAyMy0wNS0xNy9va2xhaG9tYS1mYXJtZXJzLWFuZC1yYW5jaGVycy1ob25vci10aGUtbGF0ZS1mYXJtZXItYWR2b2NhdGUtbW9uYS1sZWUtYnJvY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For Alaskans aged 15-34, the most frequent cause of emergency room visits and hospitalizations is motor vehicle crashes. (Dean Swope/KYUK)  Alaska’s death rate from traumatic brain injuries – or TBIs – is the highest in the nation. That’s according to a recent report from the Alaska Health Department.  Dr. Katherine Newell is an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assigned to Alaska. She put together the report.  “The fact that one in four deaths in Alaskans aged under 30 was related to a TBI is a shocking statistic and so many of these deaths are preventable,” said Newell.  Traumatic brain injuries range from a mild bump on the head to a deadly punctured skull. The report looked at rates of emergency room visits, hospitalization, and death for TBIs over five years–from 2016 to 2021.  Suicides and accidental falls caused the most TBI deaths in Alaska. And Newell said there was a lot of variation by age group.  “For older adults aged over 85 years, 72% of TBI-related deaths were due to unintentional fall, whereas in younger adults, the largest proportion of deaths were due to suicide,” said Newell.  According to the report, Alaska Native and American Indian people were disproportionately likely to have serious or deadly traumatic brain injuries — at a rate three times higher than the national average.  Vehicle crashes seriously injured or killed the most young adults. And for people in Northern Alaska, ATV and snow machine accidents were likely to cause serious head injuries.  Over 40% of deaths due to traumatic brain injury were suicide by firearms. In Alaska, suicide rates are higher for young men, age 25-34, and Native Alaskans and American Indian people.  Newell says traumatic brain injuries can have lasting effects, so prevention is the only real cure.  Because the causes of TBIs vary so much, in the report, she suggests a variety of ways to prevent injuries.  “A good strategy is to think about how we are supporting our older community and our elders to prevent slips and falls, especially in the winter months,” said Newell.  The report mentions existing community programs that distribute ice cleats to elders. Other suggested interventions include firearm safety education, healthcare screenings for elders, and free helmet giveaways.  The report also found many people in Alaska had trouble getting care after they experienced a traumatic brain injury, usually due to cost or geography.

"suicide","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Monroe"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:07:38","The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Tuesday that would ban gender affirming healthcare for transgender youth.  House Bill 463, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed on a 71-24 vote. Rep. Joe Stagni, R-Kenner opposed the bill, while several Democratic lawmakers supported it.  The bill was passed with enough votes to withstand a potential veto. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has not said whether he will reject the bill if it ends up on his desk, but he has mentioned the recent onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation would have a negative impact on the already high suicide rate for transgender Louisianians.  When presenting his proposal, Firment pointed out several surrounding states have passed similar bans, arguing that Louisiana needed to do the same or else become a “destination for these type of procedures across the entire South.”  Other gender-affirming healthcare bans have been the subject of federal lawsuits. Similar restrictions in Alabama and Arkansas are currently blocked from taking effect pending a court judgment.  Speaking to colleagues on the floor, Firment shared several pieces of misleading or incorrect information, claiming the treatments are experimental and that minors in Louisiana are being sterilized.  “Why are we aggressively treating a social contagion with experimental treatments?” Firment asked.  The American Academy of Pediatrics supports gender-affirming healthcare, and the American Medical Association does not consider it experimental. Minors also rarely undergo surgical procedures, including top surgery, which adds or removes breast tissue, or bottom surgery, which constructs either a vagina or a penis.  Firment’s claims received bipartisan pushback.  “We want to talk about parental consent, but we want to talk about what other kids and their doctors do,” Stagni said, arguing the bill flies in the face of parental rights.  Rep. Joe Marino, I-Gretna, also took to the floor to give a speech in opposition to the ban.  “If this is really about protecting kids, why are we ignoring lots of things that protect kids?” Marino asked. “Gender-affirming care for transgender kids reduces depression, reduces suicide and other devastating consequences.”  Studies indicate approximately 80% of transgender youth have considered suicide, and 40% report at least one suicide attempt. Research also indicates gender-affirming healthcare leads to improved mental health outcomes.  Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, argued the bill is unconstitutional because it specifically targets transgender minors. The ban has exceptions for puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatments for cisgender youth.  The bill will next be heard in a Senate committee.  Firment’s proposal is the third piece of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation to clear the House.  House Bill 81, by Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, would forbid teachers and other school employees from using transgender minors’ chosen names and pronouns. The bill was advanced from the House last week.  Another proposal, House Bill 466, by Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, was also advanced from the House last week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9sb3Vpc2lhbmEtaG91c2UtcGFzc2VzLWJhbi1vbi1nZW5kZXItYWZmaXJtaW5nLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtZm9yLW1pbm9ycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A CDC report found nearly three in five teen girls in the U.S. felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021, which is an almost 60% increase in the past decade.  The data also revealed 24% of high school girls had seriously considered suicide.  ""I see it everywhere, so no it doesn't surprise me,"" said Zanaya Bailey, a 16-year-old student at Everman High School. ""Because it's everywhere.""  Bailey is a member of her school's Hope Squad, a peer-to-peer suicide prevention program.  ""It's easier to talk to somebody that's your age because they might have gone through what you've gone through or they can relate to it,"" said 16-year-old Kayla Graham, another member of Everman High School's Hope Squad.  Both girls have listened to classmates who were struggling and connected them to trusted adults who could help.  ""Our Hope Squad members are the eyes, ears and maybe even heart of a school,"" said Kristi Wiley, the director of programs for the Jordan Elizabeth Harris Foundation, which has helped set up Hope Squad in 114 schools across 20 districts in North Texas.  Forty more schools plan to implement the program this fall.  Wiley said Hope Squad has saved countless lives.  ""When we can be direct about suicide and say, 'I saw you post this – are you thinking about suicide?' what we know is that it lowers anxiety, opens up communication, and reduces the change of a suicidal act,"" she said.  Initiating conversations about mental health and suicide is hard, but psychologists said they're key to reaching young people dealing with anxiety and depression.  ""People do want to be there for you,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Newton, who also serves as the Chief Medical Officer at SonderMind. ""As lonely as it may feel sometimes, it's not something that will last forever, and someone can help you.""  That support from someone at home or at school can make young girls feel less alone.  ""Now students, they know I can have somebody I can talk to, I have somebody I can go to for this, I don't have to do it alone, there's people I can trust,"" Bailey said. ""We provide that.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an “absolute miracle.”  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  “He drove off. He’s depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. “He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.”  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil’s Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.

Statement from Casey Pick (she/her), Director of Law and Policy for The Trevor Project:  “LGBTQ young people in Florida deserve the same opportunity to lead happy, healthy lives as their peers. As the world recognizes International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, we are outraged to see Florida’s governor continue to cruelly target LGBTQ young people by signing this slate of harmful bills into law.  The Trevor Project’s research found that 45% of young LGBTQ Floridians have seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% have made an attempt. These young people are not inherently prone to suicide, but rather, placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society. These anti-LGBTQ laws target the very things that we know can support and uplift LGBTQ young people – such as affirming environments at school and in the community, education about their identities and history, and best-practice healthcare.  For LGBTQ young people in Florida and across the country who might feel scared or stressed by this news – we see you. The Trevor Project is here to support you 24/7, and we will never stop fighting for your right to be exactly who you are. We will continue working with our partners and allies on the ground to push back against these dangerous policies.”  Relevant Research  The Trevor Project’s 2022 U.S. National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health by State found that 45% of LGBTQ youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% made an attempt. 54% of transgender and nonbinary youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 1 in 5 attempted suicide.  At a national level, The Trevor Project’s data has found that 60% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, and those who have reported higher rates of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who have not.  Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies, and nearly 2 in 3 said that hearing about potential laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school made their mental health a lot worse.  A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who experienced bathroom discrimination had more than 1.5 times the odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not experience bathroom discrimination.  Research has found that learning about LGBTQ people or issues has been associated with significantly lower odds (23%) of a past-year suicide attempt in LGBTQ students.  According to The Trevor Project’s latest polling published in Jan. 2023, 86% of transgender and nonbinary youth say recent debates about state laws restricting the rights of transgender people have negatively impacted their mental health. A majority of those trans youth (55%) said it impacted their mental health “very negatively.”  However, research also shows that transgender and nonbinary youth who have access to gender-affirming spaces report lower rates of attempting suicide.  A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in Transgender Health, also found that transgender and nonbinary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from adults and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year.

(Photo Credit: Troy Darr) VIEW ORIGINAL  SEMBACH, Germany – David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shared his journey from mental “hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  Bartley said his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011.  “That was the day I was going to kill myself,” said Bartley. “That's the day that I call the monster convinced me of two sets of things.  “On the first hand, that I was worthless. I was useless. I was stupid. I was pitiful. I was grotesque. I was ugly. I was an embarrassment and a burden. Nobody said these things to me, and yet I believed those to be true, and if that wasn't enough, the straw that broke my spiritual, my mental and psychological back was on that day what I believed to be true was, if I killed myself, well, there's no way I could be selfish, because everybody would be better off without me.”  Bartley told the Soldiers that his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011, but his story started long before that.  Bartley’s father committed suicide when Bartley was seven years old. His older brother enlisted in the Army and raised him like a father. Bartley’s story might have started on that day.  Or maybe his story started the first time he thought that life was more difficult to live than to die.  David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shares his story from “mental hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. See the one-hour executive presentation at https://youtu.be/zf_9JWhsWr4.  “Please know I did not have a death wish,” said Bartley. “Now that may seem contrary. The three-headed monster is depression. It's trauma. It's suicidal ideation. That was this thing that was convincing me of all these lies that I took as true.  “So how can you say, if you admit you had suicidal ideations, that you didn't have a death wish?  “What I'd say is they're not the same thing. There was a chasm between a death wish and a suicidal ideation. I desperately wanted to live.  “The majority of the people … don't want to die, but what happens is, in that moment when a person is making sure the noose is going to hold tight, when they have calculated that I have to take enough of this to wash down with that, they're there for the sole reason that life has become more difficult to live than it is to die.”  Or maybe his story really started when he was 11-years old, and a youth organization leader repeatedly sexually assaulted him.  But his journey of survival started on Aug. 31, 2011, when convinced that everyone would be better off without him, Bartley drove to the Foresthill Bridge that spans the American River at a height of 730 feet.  He had left a note carefully placed in his vehicle to be easily found. It read:  -------------------------------------------------------------  To my beloved Deanna, my family, and friends,  I've decided that the time has come for me to go. I am choosing to end my life, so I can be free of the pain in my heart and soul, the betrayal of my mind and the depth of self-hatred that I feel most every moment of every day.  I have become the burden I wish I never would and a drag on those around me.  I'm a damaged shell and just a little boy, not yet close to what a man should be.  Everyone, yes, everyone I know will be much better off without me.  I am so incredibly sorry.  David  -------------------------------------------------------------  Bartley told the story of how a sheriff’s deputy found him standing 730 feet over the river thinking about how much he would miss his wife and the life they created together running an animal rescue shelter, A Chance for Bliss, in California.  “The sheriff's deputy approached me from the left-hand side and did the thing that is the foundation of this new set of beliefs for me,” said Bartley. “He created a connection.  “Connection is not just this broad conceptual thing. It is tangible. It is actual. We all know this to be true because when we connect with another person, we are seen, we feel heard, and we feel valued.  “Connection creates hope. Hope is a weapon. It's not just this cute cuddly thing. It is tenacious. It is the single greatest form of ordnance against this monster called suicide because hope saves lives, because in the moment … it can rob the monster of oxygen,” he said.  Bartley told the Soldiers of a series of scientific tests from the 1950s involving drowning rats. Rats placed in a bucket of water would drown in minutes, but rats that had previously been rescued from the bucket would continue to swim for days based on the hope they would be rescued again.  He said he believes the way the Army teaches suicide prevention; indicators of potential suicide behavior, intervention strategies, and services and resources available for people with suicidal ideations, is not as effective as what he came to realize on that day, Aug. 11, 2011.  “Making someone feel valued is the foundation of great leadership,” said Bartley and explained that more importantly making someone feel valued is the Army’s greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  Bartley said when he talks to people about suicide, he likes to describe four things he calls “the why, the feeling, the cause and the healing.”  He said asking why is a waste of time.  “A lot of people kill themselves, and what I like to say with all due respect, we have no idea why. We think we do,” he said. “Kay Redfield Jamison is an extraordinary researcher and has had her own suffering with bipolar (disorder). Here's what she says.  “Each way to suicide is its own: intensely private, unknowable and terrible. Suicide will seem to its perpetrator the last and best of bad possibilities and any attempt by the living to chart this final terrain of life can only be a sketch, maddeningly incomplete.  “We're asking the wrong question,” said Bartley. “If I had time, I would have every one of you take a piece of paper and write the question Why? on it, put a big X through it, and put it in a shredder.  “It is a totally useless question because every why requires justification. We're not going to ever answer the question. What we need to do is determine the foundation that caused somebody to kill themselves.”  Bartley said that why requires a logical answer, and people don’t commit suicide for logical reasons.  “People don't kill themselves because of what they think. What pulls the trigger finger back towards a person is a feeling. It's emotions. People kill themselves because of how they feel not because of what they think.”  Bartley said the starting point for suicidal ideations. The cause is likely some sort of trauma which he describes as “severe lasting emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.”  But the solution, the healing, is not based on the why or the feeling. It’s based on hope. And hope is based on connectedness. And connectedness Bartley said comes from being “seen, heard and valued.”  A search of the internet turns up thousands of self-help pages on improving social connectedness and developing a culture of connection in organizations.  During his presentation, Bartley discussed how he makes connections in his everyday life and how the sheriff’s deputy made a connection on that Aug. 31, 2011, day that literally talked Bartley off the ledge.  “I’m a freak about names,” said Bartley.  Bartley said he uses people names to make connections, and he has an acronym PARA he uses as a memory aid to talk about how he uses people’s names to make connections.  PARA stands for pause, ask, repeat, associate. During his presentation Bartley spoke about people he has connected with recently, Amanda, Steven not Stephen, Sarah, Mikael, and the importance of using people’s names to make a connection.  “When you see somebody with a name tag at the DFAC (Dining Facility) or the commissary,” said Bartley, “when a server comes up and they say ‘Hi, what can I get for you?’ you say wait, what's your name, because when you don't call them by their name, they're basically a thing.”  Bartley describes that as the pause and the ask. Then you repeat the name.  “Hi, Amanda. My name's David. You're new here.”  The associate part of PARA can be as simple as recognizing that someone is new, asking the spelling of the name, or asking where the name comes from.  Bartley talked about a senior officer he met in Alaska named Jody. Jody was not happy about his name growing up until when he was older his father told him he was named for his father’s friend who died fighting in Vietnam.  Bartley said that people suffering from depression, people considering suicide as their best option normally cannot create connectedness with those around them. But those around them are able to create connectedness by making them feel seen, heard and valued.  “Feeling seen, heard and valued creates connectedness,” said Bartley. “Connectedness creates hope,” and hope is the greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  And that, said Bartley, is exactly what happened on Aug. 11, 2001, as Bartley leaned over the rail of the bridge with almost half his weight over the rail. This is what the sheriff’s deputy said to create connectedness and give Bartley hope.  “I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. I get a sense you’re suffering.”  “Would you please tell me, because I would imagine you're feeling depressed, would you please tell me what does it feel like when you're depressed?”  “Wow, man. Thank you for sharing that. It had to be tough. When you feel like that, what's it like on your very, very worst days?”  “Gosh, I was just thinking. That's your worst day. Hey man, well, what's it like on your best day?”  “Wow, that'd be amazing. Wow, thank you. Thanks for sharing. That makes me feel good.”  “Hey, have you ever thought, well, what do you want the rest of your life to be like?”  With that question, Bartley said he felt seen, heard, and valued, and he shifted his weight back to the safe side of the bridge.  Earlier in the presentation Bartley asked the Soldiers in the crowd how many had lost someone to suicide. He also asked how many had seen the indicators of potential suicide behavior.  He said people with suicidal ideations are very good at hiding the indicators. He said the Army should be more focused on creating connections rather than recognizing the indicators of potential suicide behavior as the key to preventing suicide.  “Making the connection opens a door,” said Bartley, “because we’re not going to see the signs.  “This last quote puts this whole thing together so much more beautifully than I can,” said Bartley. “Drew Ramsey is a psychiatrist who specializes in suicide. Forget everything I said. Please take these words because it applies to every single one of us every single day. Here's what he says.  “Someone you see today is thinking about killing themselves. Your smile, your question, your love, you know what, it could save them. You know how I know? They told me it did.”  To see Bartley’s one-hour executive presentation go to the U.S. Army NATO YouTube page at www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf_9JWhsWr4 or click below.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjY2Nzc2L21lbnRhbF9oZWFsdGhfYWR2b2NhdGVfc2hhcmVzX21lc3NhZ2Vfb2ZfaG9wZV93aXRoX25hdG9fc29sZGllcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She has a keychain with various mementos that remind her of important events or people in her life.  In other ways, Maddie has had different experiences than her peers. She's transgender, and was outed by a local television news station while in the carpool line in the first grade. WUNC is not using her last name because she's a minor. Maddie and her family have been forced into advocacy more than they might have liked, but she's not about to back down.  ""I do just want to be a kid. I do just want to be at home watching movies and stuff like that. But also I have to fight,"" she says. ""I have to fight because people are trying to take stuff away from me that doesn't even involve them. Like, you are like a 70-year-old man. You do not need to be taking rights away from somebody who's 15-16 years old.""  Yet that's exactly what is happening around the United States and in North Carolina. According to the Trans Legislation Tracker, the number of trans-related bills introduced nationally in 2023 is nearly four times the amount from 2021. In North Carolina, there have been a dozen bills introduced this year that activists say target transgender people. Earlier this month, one of those bills passed a House health committee at the state legislature with no discussion, leaving some in the audience aghast.  Critics of House Bill 808 protest in the committee room after House Health approves the Youth Health Protection Act without hearing from any members of the public, due to the committee running out of time. The bill was taken up last with about 15 minutes left. #ncga #ncpol pic.twitter.com/OJWdaw8aAk — Avi Bajpai (@avibajpai_) May 2, 2023  Maddie wasn't at the legislature that day, but says she feels the impacts.  ""It hurts to be taken down by people who don't even get it,"" she says.  Some pieces of legislation would restrict health care available to transgender kids. They could even penalize health care providers for certain kinds of care. Any kind of limits on care — like access to hormone therapy or puberty blockers, or limits on insurance coverage for gender-affirming care — would impact Maddie and others in her position.  ""I've said it a million times, I don't know if I would be here if I wasn't like this,"" she says. ""It's life-saving stuff. People are so much happier when they realize who they really are.""  Health experts echo Maddie. Studies show that two-thirds of all transgender people thought about suicide before transitioning.  ""We have a lot of patients who self-harm. Cutting and burning and things like that,"" says Dr. Deanna Adkins, a pediatric endocrinologist who works with transgender youth.  She says there's a misunderstanding over what gender-affirming health care even is. For example, proposed legislation in North Carolina would ban gender transition surgery for anyone under 18. But Adkins says surgeries on minors happen only in the rarest of cases.  ""Someone who is already trying to cut their breasts off, or cut their penis off,"" she says. ""We would much rather have a surgeon, who knows what they're doing in a safe environment, do that, and keep that patient alive.""  Adkins says most gender-affirming care includes a lot of talk therapy, or simply working with parents to help them navigate what their child is going through.  ""Even just using [preferred] name and pronouns can reduce suicidality by half,"" she says.  In some cases, and only after months or years of talk therapy, doctors will prescribe puberty blockers. That's prescription medication to temporarily suppress puberty. Adkins says only later do teens start with hormone therapy, where they receive either testosterone or estrogen.  ""We're not putting them in a — as has been indicated — a pathway the minute they come in and say, 'This is what's going on with me,'"" she says. ""Everyone's pathway is totally different. Some get puberty blockers, some don't. Some stay on, some go off.""  Supporters of stricter rules around gender-affirming care say they want to protect children and keep them from doing something drastic they will regret later in life. As transgender rights have received more political attention lately, there has been an increase in claims that people regret a gender transition and then choose to stop treatment or detransition.  Courtesy Katie Jenifer / Katie Jenifer, right, with daughter Maddie at the N.C. General Assembly  Health experts say it's important to understand any case where a patient is unhappy with their care, but say that focusing too much on detransitioners misunderstands how care is delivered. It's not like getting a tattoo on spring break. Anything that dramatically changes a person's body happens only after years of therapy and with multiple medical providers signing off on treatment.  Maddie's mom, Katie Jenifer, says she thinks the latest rounds of legislation are simply aimed at ""othering"" people.  ""Maddie said something as a joke to me the other day, but it really struck me. She said, 'How am I supposed to live, love, laugh under these conditions?'"" she says. ""How is she supposed to? When she constantly has to worry about what rights they're going to take away next. How are they going to target her next? And for what reason? She's not doing anything or hurting anybody. She's just trying to be a kid.""  The legislature has moved fast on some of these bills, meaning they will likely pass some versions this year. Governor Roy Cooper has signaled he will veto some of these bills, but with strong majorities in both chambers, Republicans have a good chance of overriding those vetoes.

"suicide","2017-10-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:09:00","State lawmakers are again considering a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe lethal medications at the request of terminally ill patients.  The proposal — referred to as medical aid in dying by supporters and assisted suicide by critics — is a perennial and emotionally charged subject of debate in the General Assembly.  In the eight years since state Rep. Paul Baumbach first introduced the proposal, some lawmakers have confronted the difficult end-of-life decisions at the heart of the bill themselves. Two weeks before a Tuesday House committee hearing, state Rep. Kevin Hensley – previously an opponent – helped his terminally ill mother secure a prescription for medication to end her life in California.  But the arguments surrounding the measure remain largely unchanged. For those with terminal illnesses like Dawn Lentz, it offers the option to avoid a prolonged and painful death.  “When it comes down to it, it must be me who will ultimately answer to my creator,"" she told the House Health and Human Development Committee on Tuesday. ""I don’t know if I will use this option, but I do know that I have the right.”  Sue St. Laurent, another supporter of the bill with a terminal illness, says she only remains active because of a $15,000-per-month medication. If the nonprofit assistance that helps her afford the medication were to dry up, St. Laurent says she would want the option to request medication to facilitate a faster death. ""I want the right to make my own decision about my life,"" she said.  Baumbach echoed the same reasoning, underscoring that the bill includes guardrails to prevent patients from being coerced into using the lethal medications. Those guardrails include a requirement that patients go through two waiting periods before receiving their prescription; their attending physician or nurse practitioner must also offer the patient opportunities to rescind their request. The bill would only allow people with a life expectancy of six months or less to request lethal medication.  Opponents include some disability rights groups, who argue that while Baumbach's bill explicitly prohibits requesting lethal medication ""solely because of the individual's age or disability,"" other states that allow medical aid in dying — namely Oregon — have expanded eligibility to include some disabilities; they worry that Delaware could follow the same path.  The bill has also drawn firm opposition from the Delaware Psychiatric Society. Former Psychiatric Society President Neil Kaye argues physicians’ life expectancy estimates for terminally ill patients are too unreliable to use as the basis for life-or-death decisions.  “This bill requires physicians to inform patients of their end-of-life expectancy,"" he said. ""We can’t do that with 50 percent accuracy — that’s like monkeys flipping quarters. How can we be asked to help a patient decide to commit suicide instead of seeking additional treatment and compassionate palliative care?”  Kaye also pointed out that Oregon has repeatedly updated the drug cocktail prescribed to people with terminal illnesses — a process he characterized as ""unmonitored experiments"" by physicians who aren't trained on how to quickly and painlessly facilitate death.  Other critics note that medical aid in dying generally relies on drugs produced by compound pharmacies — meaning they are not tested and approved by the FDA.  While the Delaware Psychiatric Society remains opposed to the bill, many of the state's other medical organizations — including the Delaware Association of Nurses and Delaware Healthcare Association — have changed their position on the subject. The Delaware Medical Society, for instance, shifted from opposing the bill to a policy of ""active neutrality"" to reflect divided opinions among its members.  Meanwhile, Delaware Association of Nurse Practitioners spokesperson Susan Conaty-Buck testified in support of the bill on Tuesday, attempting to assuage concerns that medical professionals might pressure patients to choose lethal medications over longer-term palliative care. ""It's not an opportunity to rush a person to death,"" she said. ""It's an opportunity for me to work with a patient and their family, to respect what they need and what they want.""  The bill would, however, allow healthcare providers to prohibit physicians from prescribing the lethal medications on their premises. If the bill becomes law, Baumbach says he does not anticipate that any Delaware hospital system would immediately allow its physicians to offer medical aid in dying. ""We fully expect hospitals to not allow this on their premises for at least five years,"" he said.  Once private practice physicians have time to demonstrate the safety of the procedure, Baumbach says he expects some hospital systems to come around. While Catholic hospitals cannot provide medical aid in dying in accordance with church doctrine, Delaware's largest Catholic hospital system — St. Francis Health Care — makes up a relatively small share of the state's total hospital beds and is not poised to merge with any competitors.  The bill passed out of committee with less opposition than in previous years, but no version of the bill has ever reached the House floor.

"suicide","2021-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Brighton"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:39:33","Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) have called for the introduction of a specific suicide prevention programme for the nursing workforce across the UK.  In an emergency resolution submitted at the RCN’s annual conference in Brighton, members called on RCN Council to lobby for the implementation of an evidence-based, integrated suicide prevention programme for the profession.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change"" Chantel Rose  Ruth Bailey, a nurse who presented the item, warned that nurses were working in settings where there had been an “explosion of poor mental health”.  Ms Bailey noted that while there were many examples of good practice, such as mental health first aid, access to staff counselling provision was “still inconsistent across the UK” and the incidence of suicide continued to rise.  She said: “We need a consistent and co-ordinated approach of an evidence-based suicide prevention programme, and we need the RCN to lobby for urgent action now.  “It is imperative that the RCN, as the voice of nursing, steps into this space and leads a co-ordinated UK response to this epidemic of distress and that it acts now to prevent further death by suicide in nursing and midwifery.”  Meanwhile, Chantel Rose, a registered mental health nurse, told RCN Congress that her workload was “getting harder and getting more distressing”.  She said: “Sadly I have more fellow nurses on my caseload than ever in my entire life.  “It breaks my heart that I could be next.”  Ms Rose added: “We can pull it back if council make a change – you’re doing it with pay [so] do it with suicide.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change.""  Separately, Eva Omondi, from the RCN Eastern region, said that the support system available for internationally educated nurses who were struggling with their mental health was the “bare minimum”.  She highlighted that during discussions about nurse suicide it was important to think about “the aggravating factors” which were specifically affecting internationally educated nurses.  One of the key factors she mentioned was how some internationally educated nurses have a lack of family in the UK to support them through poor mental health.  Meanwhile, Chloe Roberts, a student nurse and RCN ambassador, told RCN Congress that suicide was sometimes “a taboo topic” that people are afraid to talk about for fear of saying the wrong thing.  Ms Roberts, who lost her best friend to suicide two years ago, explained that she had taken part in suicide prevention training and called for the training to be mandatory for all NHS employees.  She said: “I urge you to support this resolution to help create change in our workforce, to make suicide prevention training course mandatory as congress you never know when this training could help you with the knowledge to save a life.”  The emergency resolution was backed overwhelming by RCN members, which could lead to RCN Council lobbying for a suicide prevention programme for the nursing workforce across the UK.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm51cnNpbmd0aW1lcy5uZXQvbmV3cy9udXJzZS13ZWxsYmVpbmcvbnVyc2VzLXNheS1wcm9mZXNzaW9uLW5lZWRzLXN1aWNpZGUtcHJldmVudGlvbi1wcm9ncmFtbWUtMTctMDUtMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:13:00","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - When his grandfather tells the story of Mark Cook, the first thing he’ll mention is how Cook would always say “I love you.”  He’d do it all the time, Tom Abel says. He’d come in and raid the fridge for a soda and ice cream and tell his grandfather he loved him.  Cook would come home at night and say “I love you” before bed.  “What we miss about him is his presence,” Abel said. “His presence filled our households. Every chance he got, he’d be telling us ‘Grandpa, I love you, Grandma, I love you.’”  Abel says his grandson killed himself inside a cell at Lemon Creek Correctional Center.  According to the Department of Corrections, Cook was the third person to die while in custody this year.  Abel says his grandson had gone to a local clinic for treatment on his back — but the treatment didn’t work. It made the pain even worse, and Cook yelled and threatened to sue people. The pain was so intense Cook couldn’t walk and was screaming out in pain.  The next day he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor charges of trespassing and property damage. Abel says Cook was put in solitary confinement because of an issue with another prisoner.  Abel believes that while Cook was in custody, he didn’t get the proper treatment and the pain persisted. He says at one point even using the bathroom for Cook was unbearable.  Then, one day, Cook hung himself. Abel says he put tape over the room’s security camera and that it was 30 minutes before security guards found him.  “He was calling me every day and telling me what he was going through. He was, he was suffering and pain,” Abel said.  According to the Department of Corrections, 18 people died in custody in the year 2022. Of those deaths, seven were ruled suicides.  That’s an increase over the previous years — only two people died by suicide in 2021 and five in 2020, according to DOC.  The DOC says 65% of the inmate population have a mental illness, and 75 people work as contractors providing mental health services statewide to a total prison population of nearly 4,500 people.  “We are the number one mental health providers of the people of Alaska by default,” DOC’s Chief Mental Health Officer Lisa Guzman said.  A former mental health professional who worked with inmates says the DOC’s care of those experiencing a mental crisis within the system is lacking. Her identity is being protected due to concerns of retaliation against her.  “I’m there to help them with the mental health care part — they’re in jail, that’s taking care of the law part, I had nothing to do with their punishment. So I have every obligation to treat them as a patient. So in that sense, since I wasn’t actually able to treat them adequately, it felt really shameful,” she said.  “I often had patients that were suicidal, telling me that, you know, well, I get seen, you know, once a day for a couple of minutes. And I think that was a lot due to staffing,” she said.  DOC admits there isn’t enough staff.  “We have consistently tried to make improvements on services,” Guzman said. “And I think, that despite not having enough staff, despite still having positions open, we’ve continued to provide the essential services we need.”  Megan Edge, director of the ACLU of Alaska Prison Project, said the DOC lacks the ability to take care of inmates’ mental and physical health.  “I’ve heard a lot of nice things come out of the mouths of DOC executives and legislative budget hearings and confirmation hearings. But what I’m seeing actually happen inside of our prisons and jails is not reflective of those nice words. Those words are hollow,” Edge said.  DOC says it is participating in Project 2025, which is a national movement to decrease suicide in the U.S. by 20% by the year 2025.  “Corrections was one of the kind of target populations that was identified because suicide rates are high in corrections nationwide,” Guzman said. “And so we are actively participating in that, we’ve developed kind of a suicide prevention readiness checklists that we’re going to be trying to go to all the facilities and collect data on how we can make improvements and hopefully contribute to that project and decreasing suicide nationally.”  Guzman goes on to say that many of those incarcerated already have mental health issues that haven’t been addressed.  “We are managing a high volume of mentally ill people who are not getting the care they need,” Guzman said. “So as much as you know, they, they come into our system, and we treat them and then we send — we do as much release planning as we can — and we send them back out into the community. And then at times, they’re not getting that follow-up care. And so it’s kind of a — it can become a cycle.”  Edge says what’s happening now is essentially a bandage for a much larger problem.  “When you start to understand why people go in, let’s take, you know, the suicides last year, they’re all fairly young, many of them had complicated mental health issues. One person was experiencing homelessness. Prison is not a solution for public safety. It’s putting a Band-Aid on the symptom. That’s it,” Edge said.  Abel says his grandson, Mark was looking forward to the birth of his second child, who is due in the fall.

"suicide","2018-07-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:40:18","The Justice Department today filed a complaint and proposed consent decree with Cumberland County, New Jersey and the Cumberland County Department of Corrections to resolve allegations that conditions at the Cumberland County Jail violate the Constitution.  The proposed consent decree resolves the department’s claims that the jail fails to provide adequate mental health care to incarcerated individuals at risk of self-harm and suicide, and fails to provide medication-assisted treatment, where clinically indicated, to incarcerated individuals experiencing unmedicated opiate withdrawal. The proposed consent decree requires the jail to provide adequate mental health care and medication-assisted treatment in those circumstances.  “The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country, and under our Constitution, jails and prisons must provide adequate medical care to incarcerated individuals,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Today’s proposed consent decree is a significant step toward improving the care of individuals incarcerated in Cumberland County who are struggling with serious mental health disorders, and toward protecting the civil rights that are guaranteed by our Constitution.”  “This consent decree marks a significant milestone in the Justice Department’s efforts to combat discrimination against those with opioid use disorder and to protect the civil rights of people in our jails and prisons,” said Assistant Attorney General for Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Under this agreement, Cumberland County must provide adequate medical and mental health care, including access to life-saving medications, treatment for opiate withdrawal, and protection for those with a heightened risk of self-harm and suicide. We commend Cumberland County for working collaboratively with us to implement the reforms in this decree to protect the safety and constitutional rights of incarcerated people at Cumberland County Jail.”  “The opioid epidemic is a public health emergency that plagues too many communities across the country,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “Medications are a critically important tool in combatting the opioid crisis, and they save lives. By providing medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated individuals experiencing opiate withdrawal, officials at jails and prisons can take significant steps to both combat the opioid epidemic and protect the constitutional rights of their populations.”  In June 2018, following suicides at the jail by six incarcerated people denied medication-assisted treatment, the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey initiated the investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. That statute authorizes the Justice Department to address a pattern or practice of deprivation of constitutional rights of individuals confined to state or local government-run correctional facilities. In January 2021, the Department found reasonable cause to believe that Cumberland County’s failure to provide medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated people with opioid use disorder, together with its failure to offer adequate mental health and suicide prevention measures, violated the rights of incarcerated individuals. The Department also identified measures necessary to remedy the unlawful conditions.

He’s a horror-movie fan: His office décor includes a poster from “Halloween” and small figurines like Pennywise, Wolf Man and Stripe from “Gremlins.” With his patients (who don’t see him in his office), Bender plays the role of curious, open-minded confidant. By the time he gets to them, some children are, as he put it to me, “so done” — frustrated by school, parents, on-and-off-again friendships, romantic relationships, their lack of control over much of anything, life. “They are mad, so mad,” he says. One threw apple juice in his face; two girls threatened to kill him after they said they found his address on the internet. “I tell kids, please hate me if you need to,” he says. “I prefer you hate me instead of your parents.”  His goal is to understand how it feels to be them, not to tell them what they need to do. “When you can’t make sense of your despair, I can make sense,” says Bender, who has won several teaching and clinical-care awards. “Not ‘expert’ sense, but a realistic sense of what may be going on. I can help them feel contained and engage them. Or not react in the same way as their family. I’m not going to understand everything while they are here. But we can find a closer gray about what the real story is. And, hopefully, help parents do so, too.”  As he talked, more children were waiting at the hospital’s Psychiatric Emergency Services, six floors below. The PES (pronounced Pez) is the first stop when children and adolescents come to Western Psych’s emergency department after passing through security and handing over their phones and bags. To fill out forms, they have to use soft, bendable plastic pens, so they can’t harm themselves or others. (For the same reason, the bathrooms’ metal toilets have nondetachable seats.) TVs play cartoons, cooking shows, Hallmark movies. The only available phone is attached to the wall. Patients often spend hours in one of two pediatric waiting areas, sometimes wearing hospital gowns after having been transferred from another medical center. They sit in the blue-and-orange plastic chairs around a table with board games or in leather chairs that fold out to become single beds. Some patients stay overnight — or several nights — when Bender’s unit cannot accommodate them.  Psychiatrists at PES interview children and their parents (or other caregivers) separately, to figure out if the patients needs to be admitted or if a referral for outpatient care, which can include crisis services, will be enough. Most teenagers who experience suicidal thoughts don’t need to be hospitalized and most don’t kill themselves (about 2,800 did in 2021). Psychiatrists have to weigh the possible protective factor of admitting a child against the reality of limited beds and the fact that hospitalization can make anxiety worse, which can drive adolescents away from mental health care altogether.  Medical professionals use the word “suicidality” to refer to a range of thoughts and actions, from passive death wishes, like the desire to go to bed and not wake up, to more active thoughts and, at the most extreme, suicide attempts and death. Though we know a lot about some causes of suicidality — mood disorders, child abuse, substance use — experts don’t understand why the numbers have been rising, on the whole, over the last decade. Some blame social media, which can both deprive children of sleep — the lack of which is associated with increased suicidal thoughts — and increase loneliness and feelings of being left out (even as it offers helpful communities for children, especially those who feel marginalized). Since 2020, the pandemic has likely been another factor.  Systemic conditions can also fuel anxiety, anger, dread and, in turn, suicidal thoughts and actions among particular groups — Black children facing trauma and persistent racism, for example, or trans children forced to use the wrong bathroom for them at school and made to feel ostracized, unseen and alone. Rates of suicidality in both populations have increased in recent years. “Ignore the social and family context at your peril,” says Brent, who has tracked the rise in adolescent suicide for years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbWFnYXppbmUvc3VpY2lkZS10ZWVucy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-09-08","Not Discerned","{""Fairbanks"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:50:30","Funding for states, territories, and tribes will help build local capacity.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), today announced more than $200 million in new funding for states, territories, and tribes to build local capacity for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and related crisis services.  “Thanks to President Biden, we are finally and seriously saying to Americans struggling with their mental health: Support is Here!” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Support is here in 988, the three-digit Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, and this new funding reflects our commitment to strengthening the crisis care system across our country so Americans can get the care they need.”  The $200.15 million in new funding opportunities for the 988 Lifeline includes:  $177.35 million to states and U.S. territories to: improve local response; enhance recruiting, hiring, and training of 988 workforce; implement additional technology and security measures to support infrastructure and effectively coordinate across the crisis continuum; improve support and service for high-risk and underserved populations, including quality assurance and review of critical incidents; and develop and implement comprehensive communication plans,  $17.8 million to federally recognized Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to: improve response, ensure access to culturally competent 988 crisis center support, improve integration and support and ensure navigation and follow-up care, and  $5 million for 988 Lifeline crisis follow-up programs that will allow call centers to provide systematic follow-up of suicidal persons who reach out to the 988 Lifeline, enhanced coordination of crisis stabilization, including with 911 and emergency service providers, reduction of unnecessary police engagement and improved connections for high-risk populations.  The Biden-Harris Administration has made an unprecedented investment of nearly $1 billion to support the 988 Lifeline, including an initial $432 million to support the transition to 988 in July 2022, to build up crisis center capacity and to provide special services, including a sub-network for Spanish speakers. Additional funding for the 988 Lifeline has been provided by the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the federal FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Prior to this investment, the Lifeline, which existed since 2005 as a 1-800 number, had been long underfunded and under-resourced.  “The timely investments in the 988 Lifeline at the federal, state and local levels are helping ensure that many more people in crisis are getting the help and support they need,” said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Data continues to show an increase in overall calls, texts and chats from the year prior, and at the same time, answer rates are significantly improving, which means that more people are getting help and they are getting help more quickly, which is crucial for someone in crisis.”  Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most 988 Lifeline callers are significantly more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed, and more hopeful.  In 2021, according to SAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 4.8% of adults ages 18 or older (about 12.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide, and among adolescents ages 12 to 17, 12.7% (about 3.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people aged 10–14 and 25–34 years.

"suicide","2023-05-10","10:00:00","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:51:33","By Barby Ingle, PNN Columnist  Trigeminal neuralgia, arachnoiditis, Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) have all been called the “suicide disease” – the worst pain possible. But saying which disease or condition causes the most pain is subjective because people experience pain differently.  According to U.S. News & World Report, passing a kidney stone is one of the most painful medical conditions you can have.  News Medical Life Sciences lists sickle cell disease as one of the 20 most painful chronic conditions, with episodes of pain occurring when sickle-shaped red blood cells block small blood vessels.  McGill University in Canada has a “pain index” based on a questionnaire that asks people to describe what kind of pain they experience. The index consistently lists CRPS as the worst known pain to humans.  Verywell Health reports that fibromyalgia is one of the most common pain conditions, affecting 10 million people in the U.S. and causing widespread body pain, sleep problems, fatigue and distress.  After living with multiple pain conditions for over 20 years and speaking with tens of thousands of other patients, I no longer believe it matters which type of pain a person has or who has the most pain. We all experience pain. How much pain we feel depends on the individual and a host of other factors, such as genetics, life experiences, and whether effective treatment is available and affordable. That is what matters.  When we do not manage pain effectively, suicides go up. We also see drug abuse and misuse rise. According to a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 5% to 7% of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are intentional suicides. Many of those deaths are pain patients.  Since 2011, we have seen a steady decrease in opioid prescribing. Be it acute or chronic, providers are weary of prescribing opioids for pain. It’s not because opioids don’t work. More often than not, the reason they stop prescribing is because they have invested so much into becoming a provider (education, cost, time, family and social connections) that they are now at risk of losing due to laws and medical guidelines based on misleading information about opioids.  We need to get away from the generalities of treating pain and into individualized patient care. It may or may not involve pain medication, surgery, implants, cognitive therapy and other treatments. For those who have the audacity to say that anyone else should remain in pain because you are not comfortable with their form of treatment -- shame on you.  I have chosen not to use opioids for over 10 years because I have other options that work for me. I want all people to get whatever treatment they need to control their pain. It will be different for each of us and whatever condition or comorbidities we live with. We all need and deserve to get the care we choose after careful consideration, research and discussions with our providers. Laws and guidelines should not be used to take away medications that have been available since the beginning of time.  At a recent pain education event I attended, I heard the argument that there were no long-term studies on the use of opioids for pain. But there are millions of patients who have taken opioids safely for years who will tell you otherwise. Opioids actually gave them more life, because they were able to work, exercise and function when their pain was properly managed.  As a pain patient myself, I want the freedom to do what is best for me. I am currently working on getting access to ketamine infusions again after my ketamine clinic closed down. I want that same right in selecting treatment to be available to others. It should be left to patients and their providers to decide on treatment, without interference from others.

"suicide","2020-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:16:05","by  (Credit: Unsplash)  This article was exclusively written for The European Sting by Ms. Sadia Khalid, early-stage researcher (ESRs), medical writer and specialist at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia. She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), cordial partner of The Sting. The opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writers and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.  The COVID-19 pandemic has put significant pressure on healthcare systems and healthcare providers, leading to high levels of stress and burnout among healthcare staff, and has raised concerns about the increased risk of suicide among this group. Burnout can have a significant impact on the well-being of healthcare providers, as well as the quality of care they are able to provide to patients.  The exact number of healthcare staff who have been lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to determine as it varies by country and region. While it is difficult to determine exact numbers, some reports have indicated increased suicide rates among physicians during the pandemic.  A study published in JAMA Network Open in 2021 analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and found that between January and December 2020, 239 physicians died by suicide in the United States. This represents an increase from previous years, although it is important to note that suicide is a complex issue and cannot be attributed solely to the pandemic.  In response to concerns about physician suicide, organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have called for increased resources and support for healthcare providers. This includes initiatives such as providing access to mental health resources and promoting the destigmatization of seeking help for mental health concerns.  To address healthcare mental health and burnout, there are several steps that can be taken.    1: Healthcare organizations should prioritize the well-being of their staff by providing access to mental health resources, promoting self-care, and addressing workload issues. This can include providing time off, implementing workload management strategies, and adjusting staffing levels to reduce stress and burnout.  2: Healthcare organizations should promote a culture of teamwork and collaboration, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and overwhelm among healthcare providers. This can be achieved by creating opportunities for staff to connect with one another, work together on projects, and share ideas and experiences. Encouraging teamwork and collaboration can help healthcare staff feel supported and engaged in their work, reducing the risk of burnout.    3: Develop Support Networks: Healthcare providers benefit from a strong support network, including colleagues, mentors, and peer groups. Developing support networks within healthcare organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare providers. Let’s also raise awareness in public about how important mental health is to the healthcare staff in their community. Compassion for All.    4: Promote a Culture of Self-Care: Healthcare organizations can promote a culture of self-care by providing access to wellness programs, stress-management techniques, and mental health resources. Encouraging healthcare staff to take care of themselves can help prevent burnout and improve the overall well-being of healthcare providers.    5. Implement Work-Life Balance Policies: Healthcare providers often have demanding schedules and work long hours. Policies supporting work-life balance, such as flexible schedules, remote work options, and time off, can help prevent burnout.    6: Address Workload Issues: High workloads and long hours are major contributors to burnout in healthcare providers. Healthcare organizations can address workload issues by adjusting staffing levels, providing time off, and implementing workload management strategies that allow healthcare providers to focus on high-priority tasks.    7: Increase Staffing: One of the most important factors contributing to burnout is understaffing. To prevent burnout, healthcare organizations need to ensure that they have adequate staffing levels to meet patient needs. This can be achieved through a combination of recruitment, retention, and training programs.    8: Provide Mental Health Support: Healthcare providers may experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues because of their work. Providing access to mental health support, such as counseling and therapy services, can help prevent burnout and support the well-being of healthcare providers.    9: Ensure Adequate Resources: Providing healthcare staff with the resources they need to do their jobs effectively can help prevent burnout. This can include access to up-to-date technology and medical equipment, as well as adequate funding and support for research and development.    10: Increase Compensation and Benefits: Healthcare providers are often underpaid for their work. Increasing compensation and benefits can help reduce financial stress and prevent burnout.  11: Provide Professional Development Opportunities: Healthcare organizations should invest in professional development opportunities for their staff. This can help keep healthcare providers engaged and motivated in their work and prevent burnout by providing opportunities for growth and career advancement. This improves the overall quality of care provided to patients.  12: Policymakers should address systemic issues within healthcare systems that contribute to burnout, such as inadequate resources and administrative burdens. This can include implementing policies that provide funding and support for research and development and addressing issues related to healthcare access and affordability. Addressing these issues through policy changes can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare staff.    Implementing these strategies can help prevent burnout and improve the well-being of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a stronger healthcare system. It is important to recognize the impact of burnout on healthcare staff and advocate for policies that promote staff well-being and resilience.Overall, addressing healthcare burnout requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes the well-being of healthcare providers, promotes collaboration and teamwork, invests in professional development, and addresses systemic issues within healthcare systems.  It is important to prioritize the mental health and well-being of healthcare providers and to continue to raise awareness about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This can help reduce stigma and promote access to resources and support for those who may be struggling.

"suicide","2022-10-03","14:00:00","{""Tallahassee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:01:00","In 2022, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida passed the “Paternal Rights in Education” bill also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill (HB 1557). The bill restricts “teachers and school districts from discussing gender identity and topics surrounding sexuality in the classroom.” The law has been in effect for the 2022-23 school year. Although this measure primarily affects Florida’s LGBTQ community and their freedom of speech, many anti-transgender bills similar to this one are being considered across all states.  Even here in the state of Connecticut, there is a bill proposed regarding a student’s “biological gender.”  Connecticut House Bill 6331 proposes that “public school educators are required to recognize each student by the biological gender of the student.” Even though the bill is unlikely to pass, I believe even the proposal of this bill can lead to an unsafe environment and disparities in health, particularly mental health, and it should be called out.  The author of HB 6331, State Rep. Joe Hoxha, (R-Bristol) does not seem to notice the difference between biological (assigned) sex and gender identity. Biological sex is the sex assigned at birth based on the infant’s anatomical and biological characteristics. Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of being; whether that is male, female, or something else.  There is no such terminology as “biological gender.”  Megan Gaffney  Why would Rep. Hoxha use that term rather than the proper term, biological sex? The wording shows that Rep. Hoxha does not understand the issue, nor has he done enough research to know what term to use when drafting the bill. Was Rep. Hoxha aware that biological gender is not the proper term? Why is he drafting legislation on a subject he hasn’t researched?  Schools need to provide a safe and accepting environment for all students, yet many LGBTQ young people experience bullying, harassment, and other discrimination because of their gender identity. A national survey by GLSEN has found that “75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who can persevere had significantly lower GPAs, were more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and were less likely to plan on continuing their education.”  If school administrators ignore these students by refusing to acknowledge their gender identity and even penalize them for expressing it, they can put kids at risk.  A survey by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community, provided some key findings, showing that approximately 45% of LGBTQ youth have had suicidal ideation within the past year, 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide within the past year, and 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted to receive mental health treatment were not able to receive it in the past year.  Federal and state laws and “the U.S. Constitution prohibits discrimination, bullying, and harassment against students because they’re transgender. This includes Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools.”  There are 16 states, including Connecticut, that have laws that prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals. In New Haven Public Schools “a student has the right to be addressed by a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required, and the student need not change his or her official records.”  But even though here in Connecticut transgender individuals have protection, there have still been debates about transgenders athletes in the news. Four cisgender women, formerly high school athletes in Connecticut, sued the state for its trans-inclusive policies, saying that, “allowing transgender women to compete in high school girls’ sports put them at an athletic disadvantage.” While they lost their case last year, they have sought to revive it.  We should recognize that we are lucky that Connecticut has strong protections for transgender individuals. While this bill is unlikely to pass, Connecticut residents should greet Rep. Hoxha’s proposal of the bill with a resounding “no.”  To repurpose a phrase from our Southern neighbors, “Don’t Florida my Connecticut!” The anti-LGBTQ policies of Florida do not have a place here in Connecticut.

"suicide","2023-05-17","14:00:00","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:38:56","Younger population experiences increased risk of death from suicide and chronic liver disease.  A new retrospective study with up to 40 years of follow-up shows significant reductions in death rates from all causes and cause-specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants with severe obesity, according to a new study published in Obesity, The Obesity Society’s (TOS) flagship journal.  The study also found evidence suggesting increased risk of death from chronic liver disease, in addition to higher death rates from suicide in younger patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The study’s authors observe that the findings of increased suicide rates among younger patients who have had bariatric surgery may promote more aggressive, pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up.  As a result of the decades-long durability of bariatric surgery in reducing death from all causes and decreasing deaths related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer compared to matched participants, researchers note the findings may not only increase interest in bariatric surgery treatment for patients with severe obesity but, in addition, further stimulate important research related to the discovery of physiologic and biomolecular mechanisms leading to non-surgical treatment that results in weight loss and improved mortality similar to that achieved by bariatric surgery, said Ted D. Adams, Intermountain Surgical Specialties/Digestive Health Clinical Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine and Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Adams is the corresponding author of the study.  Experts explain that multiple association studies connecting bariatric surgery and mortality outcomes have been reported, predominantly retrospective, with wide variation in study design pertaining to participant number, control cohorts, mean follow-up, procedure type, age at surgery, clinical end points such as life expectancy and death rates for all causes and specific causes, and presence or absence of prevalent diabetes. The new study builds upon the groups’ reported mortality outcomes following gastric bypass surgery by extending follow-up to 40 years, tripling the number of surgical patients, and using four, instead of one, bariatric surgery procedures.  Researchers used data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) for the current study. The UPDB includes linked, population-based information from Utah with statewide birth and death certificates, driver licenses and ID cards, and voter registration cards. The UPDB creates and maintains links between the database and the medical records held by the two, largest healthcare providers in Utah.  Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in Utah between 1982 and 2018 were identified from three, large bariatric surgical practices in Salt Lake City, Utah, and from medical records from the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouses in Salt Lake City. Non-surgical participants were selected from Utah driver license records or ID cards. Because driver licenses are generally renewed every five years, multiple records were available for selection for matching to the bariatric surgeries.  Nearly 22,000 participants with bariatric surgery and without were matched (1:1) for age, sex, body mass index and surgery date with a driver license/renewal date. Mortality rates were compared by Cox regression and stratified by sex, surgery type, and age at surgery. Whereas mortality after gastric bypass surgery was previously reported from 1984 to 2002, this study extends mortality follow-up through 2021. The four bariatric surgery procedures included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and bilio-pancreatic diversion with duo-denal switch.  Results revealed that all-cause mortality was 16% lower in patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. Lower mortality was observed for both males and females. Mortality after surgery versus non-surgery decreased by 29%, 43%, and 72% for cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, respectively. Death rates for males and females from chronic liver disease were 83% higher in patients who had surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The hazard ratio for suicide was 2.4 times higher in surgery compared with non-surgery participants, primarily in individuals with ages at surgery between 18 and 34 years.  “This important study adds to the mounting evidence that bariatric surgery, not only improves quality of life for patients, but will also increase their life expectancy. This work will hopefully improve patients’ access to this effective treatment for obesity, which is still limited to only one percent of qualified patients. Also, the study highlights the importance of providing more resources for pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up, especially for younger patients,” said Jihad Kudsi, MD, MBA, MSF, DABOM, FASMBS, FACS, Bariatric Surgery Division, Duly Health and Care, Downers Grove, Ill.

"suicide","1988-09-25","14:00:00","{""Lincoln"", ""Nebraska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:55:00","Brock became a suicide intervention counselor for farmers in the 1980s when she and her husband noticed a need in their community after losing their Lincoln County farm.  During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative / A bronze relief of Mona Lee Brock.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize the need for greater connection to military members and veterans by designating Nov. 12, 2023, as ""National Warrior Call Day."" The duo led a similar resolution in 2022 that passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent. The resolution this year is initially supported by 20 senators.  Led by the Troops First Foundation, Warrior Call is a coast-to-coast push that engages all Americans to build and maintain meaningful relationships with servicemembers and veterans in order to help curtail suicide deaths.  Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it. Tweet this  Simple by design, Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it, because isolation often is a precursor to suicidal ideation. In addition, many veterans may be suffering from undiagnosed brain injuries that can mimic mental illness and other ailments that spur isolation.  ""We thank Sens. Shaheen, Cotton and all cosponsors for their help in elevating this initiative and helping push the message to the grassroots level,"" said Frank Larkin, COO of Troops First and Chair of Warrior Call. ""We are hopeful the resolution will again move through the Senate, that leaders in the U.S. House will join in too, and that ultimately as many people as possible will work this year to help troops and vets through simple yet critical connection. It is not hyperbole to say a single call can turn a life around.""  Sitting on key committees in the Senate, the senators are strong advocates for the troops and veterans.  According to the most recent data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 6,146 veterans died by suicide in 2020. The unadjusted rate of suicide among U.S. veterans was 31.7 suicide deaths per 100,000, compared to 16.1 per 100,000 for civilians. After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide was 57% higher for veterans than for non-veteran adults.  The government, however, may still be drastically underestimating suicide deaths. Many other deaths may not be reported or classified as suicide because the evidence doesn't support a death determination. This is a statistical ""gray zone,"" especially as society wrestles with alcohol and opioid addiction.  ""Warrior Call and other efforts to connect with these brave men and women have never been more important,"" added Larkin. ""Working together, we can save lives.""

Within weeks of her passing the family named their charity ‘We Mind & Kelly Matters,’ emerging from their immense grief, shock, and anger that ‘Kelly mattered’. Following the charity set up, numerous fundraising events began, and the band of resolute fundraisers and followers were aptly named Kelly’s Heroes.  The two largest events, consisted of cycle rides from John O’Groats to Lands’ End in 2020, and again The Loneliest Road Cycle Tour across Europe, and New York to San Francisco in 2022. Teams of cyclists rode as Kelly’s Heroes, who not only raised in excess of £300k, created enormous awareness for mental health whilst breaking down stigma around suicide.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  John Hewitt, Kelly’s dad, and co-founder of the charity explained:  ‘The renaming marks an exciting new chapter for the charity. Having organised the Kelly’s Heroes cycle rides, I’ve trained and ridden with those heroes and the charity evolved, developing expertise and forming its own identity, growing from a foundation of pure grief to a place of hope. The family and also the cyclists have met with some of the recipients of where the funding goes, people who have used the support, accessed bereavement workshops and more, and it quickly became clear to us, that they are all heroes, each and every one of them. We will always want Kelly’s name to be remembered and we think the new name is a fitting tribute to her memory and the tireless work put in by our staff and supporters over the last 4 years’.  Kelly’s Heroes hopes to continue breaking down barriers and open up more conversations around the importance of not only managing your mental health but maintaining and promoting good positive wellbeing. Recognising the importance of early interventions, providing accessible mental health support, as well as offering bespoke training to local schools, businesses, and communities around mental health and suicide prevention. Mental health deserving a space for conversation.  CEO, Sherry Adams added:  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ‘The charity was founded around two purposes, to raise much needed funding, and to enable people in need to get support when they need it. The two are coming together under one name, one identity, all the events and work every fundraiser undertakes, all the donations they all underpin our support services, it became clear we needed just one name. Through changing to solely “Kelly’s Heroes”, it better reflects the ethos of all that we do, and that everyone who either works for the charity, fundraises for the charity, or bravely reaches out for support, they are all Kelly’s Heroes. If you cycle thousands of miles, run a marathon with tired limbs, have a cake sale, or be the one that reaches out and asks for help when you are feeling low, each and every person has mental health, and all of those actions are admirable, brave and determined, defining heroic’.  Rachael Hewitt, Kelly’s mum, and co-founder of the charity said:  ‘We are incredibly proud of what we have been able to achieve in the first four years, and in awe of all those who have reached out and recognised they needed support with their mental health. We are now looking forward to building on our identity as Kelly’s Heroes and aim to support more people and earlier, ideally before any crisis. We want to offer new services, support and activities that help promote and maintain good positive well-being, for adults and young people. Including all those who have found support and are in recovery, the earlier people get support the better for everyone, and our community. It’s our ambition and aspiration to help people live well and stay well, that will be fitting for Kelly’s legacy.’  Kelly’s Heroes will continue to support with free services, including 365 days of online support, every evening from 6-9pm, their ‘Listening Ear’ service offers emotional support to everyone, for anyone struggling to manage good positive wellbeing, to dealing with poor mental health, suicide ideation, and bereavements by suicide.

The training courses available range from Mental Health First Aid through to Safeguarding from Suicide, and are available to schools, colleges, universities, businesses, charities, and everyone in the community. All funds raised by delivering training go directly back to supporting people in need.  Amy Hewitt, Kelly’s sister, and co-founder of the charity added:  ‘Millions of people of all ages from all walks of life are experiencing issues with their mental health and so many struggle to find help, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to take the first step in getting support. With the charity and now the support services being known as Kelly’s Heroes it will broaden the awareness of the charity.

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Today marks the anniversary of the end of the Azovstal siege, sometimes described as “Ukraine’s Dunkirk”.  The three-month battle for Mariupol ended with a last-ditch defence of the city’s steelworks that inspired a wave of international sympathy.  Russia almost completely flattened Mariupol with endless airstrikes and artillery barrages. The destruction of the one of the city's maternity units and Mariupol's theatre, where hundreds of people were taking shelter, shocked the world.  READ MORE: Bombing hospitals, gassing children - the bloody atrocities of ‘Butcher of Mariupol’  But the massive Azovstal iron and steel works remained, described by witnesses as a “fortress within the city”.  Putin ordered his troops to blockade the plant, “so not even a fly can escape”.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  The main Ukrainian unit sealed inside the sprawling steelworks was The Azov Regiment, a force developed from a far-right all-volunteer militia that was often used in Russian propaganda broadcasts as evidence that Ukraine was run by “Nazis”.  They were reinforced by regular Ukrainian marines and foreign volunteers.  Hundreds of civilians had also taken refuge in the factory's miles of tunnels.  (Image: Interior Ministry of the Donetsk)  Conditions inside the dark, freezing and badly-ventilated underground base started as bad, and became truly horrific as stocks of food, water and vital medicines dwindled.  Amputations were carried out with little or no anaesthetic and the defenders ran dangerously low on ammunition.  One defender said: “It feels like I’ve landed in a hellish reality show in which us soldiers fight for our lives and the whole world watches this interesting episode. Pain, suffering, hunger, misery, tears, fears, death. It’s all real.”  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  A desperate helicopter airlift was put in place to resupply the defenders.  Between March 21 and May 11 last year, a total of 15 helicopters and 45 aircrew made nearly 30 rescue missions to Azovstal.  They delivered communications gear from Elon Musk’s Starlink company as well as ammunition and medicine. On the return flights the helicopters were loaded with wounded Ukrainian fighters.  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  Six flights successfully completed the mission and returned. More than 20 did not.  The helicopters were stripped of any non-essential gear to make the deadly journey through a ring of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.  Colonel Hryhorii, a squadron leader in the 12th Brigade of Army Aviation, told The Times: “Everything that was unnecessary was unloaded from the aircraft to make way for the cargo, even the machineguns.  “The pilots saw their task and understood it was dangerous to the point of impossible. But no one refused.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  One of the pilots, who gave his names “Ginger” explained that while the first resupply missions caught the Russians by surprise, subsequent mission were more dangerous: “The next flights looked like impudence on our part,” Ginger said.  “They were waiting for us. Every helicopter was fired upon, many of them taking damage.”On March 31, four Mi-8 helicopters made the trip, escorted by a Hind Mi-24 attack helicopter for cover.  As the Hind took on Russian anti-aircraft emplacements two of the transports here hit with shoulder-mounted ground-to-air missiles: “One was shot down and the other returned with only one engine,” Ginger said. “But he brought 22 wounded back.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  As the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest reached its climax, the frontman for the winning basin – Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra, begged the massive TV audience: “I ask all of you, please help Azovstal, right now!”  Finally, on May 16, President Zelenskyy told the defenders it was time to surrender. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” he said.  Even then, the fighters’ torment was not over.  Oksana, an Azovstal employee, told The Guardian: “No one came out of there unchanged. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.”  (Image: ALESSANDRO GUERRA/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  One of the fighters, Mykhailo Dianov, told Sky News after his release from a Russian POW camp he thought he would never survive: “We thought this every day. At Azovstal we thought it was the end.  “After a month of starvation, when you close your eyes, you forget about your family, everything. The only thing you think about is food.” He lost over six stone during the siege.  In the Russian prisoner-of-war camp, he said, the guards “treated us like animals. It was impossible to eat.”  (Image: President.gov.ua)  As the 2,500 Ukrainian fighters emerged from the ruined steel plant, they were loaded onto buses and shipped off to destinations in Russian -occupied territory. For months their fate remained a mystery.  The Kremlin hinted at trials, and possible death sentences.  But then, in September, Kyiv announced that over 200 POWs had been returned as part of a prisoner swap deal, including Lt Colonel Denys Prokopenko, the Azov Battalion’s commander.  But by the end of the year, some 1,000 Azov soldiers remained prisoners of war. And Ukrainian officials say that the bodies of an unknown number of soldiers still lie buried under the rubble of Azovstal.

"suicide","2021-07-05","14:00:00","{""Songnam"", ""KyonggiDo"", ""SouthKorea""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:55:20","Teens in crisis  Steps required urgently to address suicide, self-isolation among young people    Korea's suicide rate, still the highest among OECD member nations, has declined gradually over the past decade.  A notable exception is the suicide rate among children and adolescents.  According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate among people aged 17 and under was 1.2 per 100,000 in 2000. However, the figure more than doubled to 2.7 in 2021. The comparable rate primarily for middle school students aged 12-14 jumped nearly fivefold, from 1.1 to 5.0 persons.  That, along with Korea's lowest birthrate worldwide, casts doubt on this society's health and sustainability. So many buds wither or are trampled long before they blossom. What has gone wrong?  Suicide by teenagers, and its weaker or preceding stage of reclusion, are due to the avoidance of social activities such as study and play. Another possible cause is society itself teeming with limitless greed and competition. All parents here wish the worldly successes of money and reputation for their children ― and only that. Kids unable or unwilling to go all the way drop out of the rat race.  Korea may not be alone. But nowhere else are these phenomena more severe than here. This country industrialized and democratized itself over the span of just two generations and is the only one among 140 nations that became independent after World War II. It is the fifth hardest-working country in the OECD and perhaps the only one that can make Japan appear lazy. Korea and its establishment deserve praise for that and may as well have pride.  However, according to a survey conducted by the vernacular daily Dong-A Ilbo, 29.4 percent of people in their 20s said they ""don't like being Korean."" As reasons, they pointed to their country being ""too competitive,"" ""complicated,"" and ""exhausting."" Young Koreans think they have nothing to do with their country's or parents' accomplishments. These only pressure and discourage youngsters who will not and cannot repeat what their seniors did. For the poor, the increasingly hierarchical society also appears hopeless.  In this gloomy social atmosphere, various websites and online communities are mushrooming into the dark side of this IT-savvy country.  About a month ago, a girl in middle school jumped to her death from a 19-story building in Seoul's Gangnam District. The suicide was streamed live on Instagram and viewed by dozens of people. The operator of the website believed to be responsible for abetting the suicide has rejected a police request for a voluntary and temporary shutdown, maintaining that other online sites will continue to remain open. The Korea Communications Standards Commission does not enforce its closure, citing ""freedom of expression."" Meanwhile, two more teenagers attempted copycat suicides but failed.  The incident reveals two problems.  First, numerous ugly and wicked adults are bent on abusing and exploiting disoriented teenagers. They approach young victims online disguised as helpers, but abuse them sexually and financially offline, encouraging self-harm and suicide and extorting money. More and more teens fall prey to them amid social ignorance and legal leniency. Second, as one former victim said, there is the problem of having ""no other adults to talk to,"" forcing teenagers to visit these websites and risk danger. Parents and teachers are of no help to these desperate kids, some of whom are already injured, mentally if not physically.  What society should do is clear enough.  In the short term, the government must punish individuals and organizations that abuse children and adolescents. It should force relevant online communities to shut down voluntarily by enacting laws if necessary and prosecuting those responsible. Protecting young lives is far more important than freedom of expression. It should also open many ""anonymous"" ― instead of open and public ― websites through which these youth can communicate freely and frankly.  In the long term, this society and the country should rethink its direction. Korea, where its people, especially younger ones, are almost the unhappiest worldwide, should be where most can live while doing what they want to do without social alienation or economic want.  Aiming to be a wealthier and stronger country is okay. However, what good is this if people are unhappy?

The BJP MP and his father, known Dr Chag for 20 years, had borrowed nearly Rs 1.75 crore from him in instalments since 2008. They had refunded some money but later stopped responding to Dr Chag’s repeated requests to return the money.  Following dishonouring of a cheque of Rs 90 lakh, the MP and his father had abused Dr Chag and threatened to kill his son Hitarth if he still demanded the money back.  This threat allegedly upset the doctor who took the extreme step out of shock and fear, the FIR against the BJP MP and his father stated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vaW5kaWEvYmpwLW1wLWZhdGhlci1ib29rZWQtZm9yLXN1aWNpZGUtb2YtdmVyYXZhbC1kb2N0b3ItMTUwMzE4MTg5MC5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9ianAtbXAtZmF0aGVyLWJvb2tlZC1mb3Itc3VpY2lkZS1vZi12ZXJhdmFsLWRvY3Rvci0xNTAzMTgxODkwLmh0bWwvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Suicide prevention services can also be reached at 888-568-1112 or 800-273-TALK (8255).First responders' jobs are traumatic almost by definition. They run toward the danger. They go into the burning building. They put themselves on the line to help the rest of us. How could that not take an emotional toll on them?Tragically, Bangor experienced a gutting recent reminder of that toll. A young firefighter, Jacob Madden , died by suicide in late April.""Jake was a loving and caring man, who always kept humor at the center of his life. His bright smile and consistent banter brought joy to everyone that he interacted with,"" his obituary reads. ""Jake had an eccentric and quirky personality that was irreplaceable. Those closest to him knew him as nostalgic, sentimental, and a true romantic. Above all, Jake was an extremely proud father and family man.""Bangor firefighter Jared Willey , president of Local 772 of the International Association of Firefighters , spoke with Bangor Daily News reporter Kathleen O'Brien about first responders struggling with mental health and the high risk of dying by suicide. Firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, according to the U. S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .Willey said that mental health support is available, but stigma and a ""suck it up and be a man mentality"" can be barriers to getting help.""We have to talk about mental health and suicide because, if we don't, we're not going to see change,"" Willey said. ""We don't want to lose another firefighter, so we have to make sure everyone feels comfortable enough to sit down and talk about it. If my back hurts because of a fire last week, I'm going to sit with others and complain about it and get it fixed. The same needs to go for mental health.""We could not agree more. That is true this month, with May being Mental Health Awareness Month, and it is true all year long. And this is an instance where everyone can help to be part of the solution. Across society, we need to normalize talking about and addressing mental health challenges. We owe it to the first responders who put their physical and emotional well-being on the line, just as we owe it to our neighbors, friends and family. There is nothing wrong with needing help.Aside from this universal, interpersonal step to help support firefighters and other first responders, there is also a much more bureaucratic step to take. O'Brien explained how the U.S. Fire Administration has only recorded six firefighter suicides since its On-Duty Firefighter Fatality Program's started in the 1970s. Other firefighter groups estimate that there are roughly 100 firefighter suicides each year in the U.S.Clearly, the Fire Administration's reporting system isn't fully tracking this issue, and that is a problem. To better address an issue like this, policymakers and the public need to be fully aware of its scope. That requires having accurate and comprehensive data.As O'Brien reported, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has said the Fire Administrator's system only counts on-duty deaths and relies on voluntary reporting, so the seemingly obvious steps would be to update those elements of the system. The federal government should find a more proactive way of collecting this information from departments across the country, and make sure to include off-duty deaths by suicide — because the trauma doesn't just shut off when a first responder is off the clock.""After that call and when you're left with your own thoughts is when it haunts you,"" Willey told O'Brien about witnessing tragedies on the job. ""Many people have night terrors because when you don't process those traumatic events, your brain re-lives it when you sleep.""First responders need to know that resources exist to help them process that trauma and that there is nothing wrong about needing that help.___","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdnRlY2guY29tL2VtL3ByZXBhcmVkbmVzcy9lZGl0b3JpYWwtd2Utc2hvdWxkLWJlLXRoZXJlLWZvci1maXJzdC1yZXNwb25kZXJz0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292dGVjaC5jb20vZW0vcHJlcGFyZWRuZXNzL2VkaXRvcmlhbC13ZS1zaG91bGQtYmUtdGhlcmUtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXJlc3BvbmRlcnM_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The convict, S. D. Gafoor, complained to Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge court in Rangareddy court complex that at the behest of the prison superintendent an under-trial prisoner assaulted him by fingering his private parts. “I have attempted suicide unable to bear this third degree torture of fingers being forcibly put into my anus. Officers hitting me with lathis. I am unable to practice my religion and having to face daily torture and humiliation,” Gafoor said in his complaint to the IV Additional MSJ.  Mr. Gafoor was serving sentence in the prison and facing a couple of other cases. He was brought to the court by the prison authorities for appearance in other cases on Tuesday. Soon after being presented before the judge, the prisoner started narrating the alleged torture by the prison authorities. Mr. Roy, Krishnamurthy, Venkat Reddy and Satya hand-cuffed and beaten with fiber lathis, he charged. “Venkat Reddy kicked me in my face and my legs. I got bleeding injuries in my mouth,” he told the judge.  With the judge asking him to give a specific complaint, advocate D. Suresh Kumar of Indian Association of Peoples Lawyers (who was present in the court) volunteered to file vakalat to represent Mr. Gafoor. Mr. Kumar informed the court oral statement of the prisoner was sufficient for the judiciary to act upon on the issue. As Mr. Gafoor spoke in Urdu and Hindi, a young lawyer Rizwan present in the court came forward to assist the court.  He translated Mr. Gafoor’s complaint into English and presented it to the court. The prisoner explained to the court that he had slashed his head and neck with a blade on Monday, a day after being tortured by the prison officials.  The prisoner charged that constables of the prison made him consume soap water. According to him, Venkat Reddy and Satya threatened to implicate him in narcotics cases. Mr. Gafoor told the court that magistrates were not visiting the under-trial prisoners who were confined in single cells. They were only visiting the general barrack, he said.  On receiving the written complaint of the prisoner, the judge directed the prison authorities to take him to conduct medical examination of the injuries Mr. Gafoor had sustained. When the government counsel requested the court to hear prison officials’ contentions, the judge said he would listen to them eventually. The matter was posted to May 30 for next hearing.","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sign up for news and features from our diverse communities  A mental health hospital accused of attempting to 'cover-up' failures that contributed to a patient’s suicide has an 'issue with transparency', a senior staff member has admitted. Winbourne Charles, 58, died in his room at Goodmayes Hospital, North East London, on April 10 2021, having spent five months undergoing treatment for depression with psychotic symptoms.  In an inquest last month, a jury ruled that the dad-of-two’s suicide was 'contributed to by neglect' and failure to protect him from an 'obvious risk of self-harm'. Senior coroner for East London Graeme Irvine accused staff at North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT) – which runs the hospital – of attempting to 'cover-up' evidence of failing to regularly check on Winbourne’s welfare.  READ MORE: Met Police officers investigated after man Tasered before falling to his death from fifth floor balcony  Nurses' notes claimed he was alive 2 days after he had died  These included 'factually inaccurate' records of when Ilford staff had observed him and 'governance process failings' that saw its failings left out of three internal reports about the suicide. Two nurses' entries to Winbourne’s observation notes claimed he was alive and 'wake in his bedroom' two days after he died.  NELFT’s integrated care director Bob Edwards told Redbridge Council’s health scrutiny committee that the trust has 'an issue with transparency', despite encouraging staff to speak up. He said: “We absolutely strive to make sure that safety is the highest possible objective.""  He continued: “I think for people in the inpatient services included in this particular case, we could have done very much better, which we accept as an organisation, and we need to make sure we do so in future.”  Where to get help if you're struggling You don't have to suffer in silence if you're struggling with your mental health.

Concerns raised in a 'prevention of future deaths' report issued by the coroner last week include the fact that an investigation signed off by the integrated care director 72 hours after Winbourne’s death did not admit that observations had been missed.  The trust’s final serious incident report, handed to the coroner before the inquest, also failed to address “poor” assessments of Winbourne’s risk of self-harm and “inadequate” information in previous reports.  Witnesses to the inquest reported nurses using the “cut and paste” function to record when they observed patients and senior staff admitted medical notes appeared “dishonest”.  Mr Irvine noted that two staff members declined to answer questions about the accuracy of their notes, instead invoking an inquest rule protecting themselves from self-incrimination.  NELFT is required to respond to the coroner’s prevention of future deaths report by late June. The report has also been sent to the police, the Care Quality Commission, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council.  Don't miss out on the biggest local stories.

Londeka is popularly known for her character as Nkanyezi on Showmax’s drama series, Adulting, produced by Tshedza Pictures.  During an interview with Lungelo KM on Engineer Your Life, the actress revealed that she wanted to kill herself because she felt like there was no purpose to her life.  “I remember that falling pregnant was the only thing that stopped me from killing myself. Before my daughter, Liyana, my life was not worth living.”  Bagging a role in Adulting  The actress said scoring a role in Adulting restored her acting dream she had already gave up on because she felt inadequate and thought she did not deserve a chance in the industry.  She also shared that acting alongside her real-life crush Thembinkosi Mthembu, who plays Bonga on the show, was quite a shock to her, especially after finding out that she would be playing Bonga’s love interest.  “The crush is gone now. We are all good and well. He has and continues to teach me a lot about the industry,” she said, adding that fame has brought a lot of attention to her from other male celebrities.  ALSO READ: REVIEW: ‘Adulting’ gets off to a sexy start  “Having sex on TV“  Londeka shared that her mother is a pastor, and she was nervous about telling her about her role as it included a lot of explicit scenes.  “When I told her that I was going to shoot this, she was excited for me because this is something I have been wanting to do. But I did not give her context to say this is exactly what we are shooting. When the first episode aired, she was excited and told the congregation, and I had to get off my phone for a while. We never spoke about it again,” she said.  Showmax aired the 8th episode of Adulting last Monday, which marked the end of season 1. However, the show topped the trending topics on Twitter yesterday as fans complained that Monday was not the same without the show.  The eight-part drama series tells the story of four varsity friends who are trying to find love and success after varsity.

"suicide","2018-04-03","Not Discerned","{""Darby"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:31:18","On April 3, 2018, Jeffrey Parker called 911 from his Huntsville, Alabama residence and threatened to blow his head off. Huntsville Police Department (HPD) officers Pegues and Beckles were dispatched to the call. Upon arrival, Pegues drew her pistol and made a partial entry through the front door, thereby exposing half her body to the inside. She observed Parker sitting on a couch with what appeared to be a gun at his own head. She told Beckles, still outside, what she saw. Beckles informed police dispatch that Pegues had seen Parker with a gun to his head. [1]  Officer Darby heard Beckles’ radio call about “a guy with a gun … threatening suicide” and responded. Darby arrived and saw that Pegues had her gun drawn but pointed down. He commanded her to point her gun at Parker because he thought that Parker “could kill her.” Pegues moved completely into the residence and briefly raised her gun but almost immediately lowered it. Both Beckles and Darby followed her inside and demanded that Parker drop the weapon.  Pegues also pleaded with Parker to drop the weapon, but he kept it pointed at his head and refused to drop it. Darby, believing that all three officers were in danger of being shot, fired at Parker and killed him.  The Darby murder trial  Darby was charged with murder. After a jury trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Officer Pegues testified at Darby’s trial that prior to Darby’s arrival, she attempted to de-escalate the situation, but that once Darby entered the residence, she “could feel the tension just rising.” She testified that Parker didn’t threaten her or “do anything to make her believe he wanted to do anything other than commit suicide.”  Officer Beckles testified that “at no time during this event did he feel the need to take deadly force action.” He stated that Parker “didn’t make any overt action to” indicate that he was about to point his weapon at the officers. He estimated that Parker was ordered to drop the weapon about seven times but failed to comply.  An HPD detective investigated the shooting incident and testified that he found no evidence that Parker “ever made a hostile determination towards anybody other than himself.”  Officer Darby testified that upon entering the residence he realized that all three officers had no cover between them and Parker. He ordered Parker to drop the gun twice, but Parker refused. Darby shot and killed him. “Darby also presented testimony from three other law enforcement officers (expert witnesses) who each testified that Parker's refusal to put his weapon down constituted an imminent threat to the responding officers' lives.” [2]  After both sides presented their evidence, Darby requested the trial judge to charge the jury as follows: ""The reasonableness of an officer's actions in using deadly force must be objectively reasonable judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, the fact that officers are forced to make split-second decisions, and in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them at the time.”  In support of his requested jury instruction, Darby cited the United States Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [3] The trial judge rejected Darby’s requested instruction. Instead, the judge provided the jury with a general self-defense instruction that is available to all citizens who assert self-defense as a justification for their actions. This permitted the jury to examine Darby’s conduct from the perspective of an ordinary citizen rather than a trained law enforcement officer.  Darby appealed and argued that the trial judge delivered an erroneous self-defense instruction that permitted the jury to ignore, as irrelevant, the expert testimony from several witnesses that reasonable law enforcement officers would believe they were facing an imminent threat to their personal safety.  The decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals [4]  The Alabama Court of Appeals reversed Darby’s conviction and ordered that he receive a new trial. The court ruled that it was not bound to accept Darby’s offered instruction that was based upon the Supreme Court’s opinion in Graham v. Connor. The court explained that Graham does not govern a state court’s application of state criminal statutes because it “involved a civil action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” (The federal civil rights statute). [5] Nonetheless, the court observed that the Alabama legislature passed a self-defense statute designed for Alabama peace officers that states: ""A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes it necessary in order … [t]o defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force."" [6]  The court ruled that the trial judge erred by giving the jury a self-defense instruction designed for ordinary citizens instead of an instruction intended by the Alabama legislature to be used for peace officers in self-defense situations. The court explained, “[T]he Alabama Legislature has made clear that there is a unique standard to be used in judging a police officer's use of deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer. Thus, the proper perspective from which to evaluate a police officer's use of deadly force in such situations is indeed that of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  The court observed that the ordinary citizen self-defense instruction given to the jury permitted the jury to ignore “extensive testimony from multiple witnesses regarding the training a police officer receives with respect to confrontations with an armed person.” The court noted that this testimony “supported a finding that a reasonable police officer in Darby's situation could have concluded that Parker's conduct represented the imminent use of deadly force. In other words, that testimony supported a finding that Darby acted in self-defense or defense of another when he shot Parker.”  Lessons learned  Here’s a summary of the lessons law enforcement officers can take from this case:  Parker called the police himself and threatened suicide. There was no indication that there were other civilians in immediate danger. Once the first officer saw Parker with a gun to his head, her tactical response should have been to back out, take cover, call for help, set up a perimeter, request a mental health professional, and attempt to de-escalate and negotiate a peaceful surrender.  The tactical decision(s) by all three officers to completely enter the room and expose themselves to a person holding a gun was extremely dangerous and unnecessary. This involved an unforced error that dramatically escalated an already dangerous encounter.  Once the officers placed themselves in this precarious predicament, a strong argument can be made that the officers were faced with a significant threat to their personal safety.  An action/reaction study conducted by Dr. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, involved students holding training guns loaded with marking cartridges to their heads while being confronted by officers 10 feet away with training pistols pointed at the students. Each confrontation involved one student and one officer. The confrontation was repeated several times with different students and officers participating each time. Once the officers ordered the students to drop the guns, the students would attempt to shoot the officers as quickly as they could. The average time for the students to fire was .40 of a second. The average officer response time to fire was .40 of a second. The study demonstrates how fast a situation can turn from encountering a potential suicide subject to becoming the victim of a cop killer.  This case demonstrates the sobering reality that in prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter etc., state court judges can, as the court did in the instant matter, reject an officer’s legal defense grounded in the “objective reasonableness” use of force standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [7]  As discussed, the murder conviction reversal was based not upon Graham but rather upon an Alabama statute that treated peace officers differently than ordinary citizens who claimed self-defense for their actions. The court ruled, “[W]here there is evidence to support a defendant police officer's claim that he used deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer, the trial court should instruct the jury to evaluate the defendant's actions from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  Police officials and police attorneys should ensure that officers under their command or counsel are made aware of the state deadly force standard that they would be judged by if charged with murder or manslaughter. Further, if the current state deadly force standard for officers criminally charged, is not favorable to law enforcement, strong consideration should be given to attempting to influence the state legislature to change the law to reflect more favorably upon law enforcement officers.  In 2019, the California legislature passed a new unfavorable deadly force statute for police officers that changed the deadly force standard for police officers from “reasonable” (Supreme Court’s Garner/Graham standard) to “necessary.” [8] Commenting on the new law, a recent University of Toledo Law Review article observed, ”the proposed law was tempered to allay concerns raised by police associations … the bill was watered down in an attempt to ensure its passage.” [9] The proposed law was amended by the California legislature to make it more acceptable for law enforcement due to pressure from police advocacy groups. The result, although unfavorable to police, could have been much worse.  The California law doesn’t define “necessary” but does state that deadly force may be used to “defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” [10] The law also contains language that suggests that imminent means immediate. [11] The California statute also permits examination of an officer’s pre-shooting conduct (which the Supreme Court suggests is not relevant in Graham v. Connor). [12]  The effect of the new California statute on prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter is yet to be seen. Suffice it to say that California’s move away from the Supreme Court’s “reasonableness” standard to an undefined statutory “necessary” standard to govern police use of deadly force is likely to result in more criminal prosecutions and convictions of police officers in that state.  References  1. It would later be determined that Parker was holding ‘a flare gun that had been intentionally painted black,’ but there is no evidence indicating that any of the officers were aware of that fact.  2. Quote is taken from the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals opinion.  3. 490 U.S. 386 (1989}. In Graham, the Supreme Court created an objective reasonableness standard for police use of deadly force grounded in the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that “the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Further, the Court ruled that when police use of force situations are evaluated, the fact that officers are “forced to make split-second judgments” must be considered.  4. Darby v Alabama, (CR-20-0919) (3/24/23).  5. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals determined when reviewing state criminal statutes, it is not bound to follow a constitutionally grounded Fourth Amendment-based opinion of the United States Supreme Court regarding the standard for police use of deadly force. The Alabama court cited a quote from a California case, People v. Perry, 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 465, 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 522, 536 n.10 (2019) as authority for declining to follow Graham v. Connor regarding its application to a state’s criminal statutes. The California court ruled, “Perry contends throughout his briefing that we are bound to apply the standards articulated in Graham in this case.

"suicide","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:59:27","Photo Credit: Israel Police Spox  On Saturday, there was an incident that is depressingly familiar:  A Palestinian man who allegedly attempted to stab Border Police officers at a checkpoint in the northern West Bank was shot dead on Saturday afternoon. A Border Police spokesman said the suspect ran toward the checkpoint near the settlement of Shaked, known as “checkpoint 300,” while brandishing a knife. “Border Police troops operating at the crossing fired at the terrorist and neutralized him,” the spokesman said. The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry identified the man as 33-year-old Ahmed Muhammad Atatreh, and said he had died of his wounds.  “Lone wolf” stabbing and car ramming attempts that result in the death of the attackers happen about once a week; there have been at least 13 of them this year  But the perpetrators of these attacks have different demographics than the Palestinian terrorists killed in arrest raids. They are usually older, often with families of their own, and they are sometimes women.  These incidents happen often enough that the attackers know very well what is going to happen. The soldiers they attack will almost never be injured, and the attackers will probably end up dead.  It doesn’t take much thinking to realize that these aren’t terror attacks. They are suicides.  If you are a troubled Palestinian, with emotional, relationship or money problems, traditional suicide is not an option. It is a major sin in Islam; Muslims who commit suicide are taught that they do not enter Paradise, and a suicide would bring shame on the rest of the family. But martyrdom is the opposite: it is honorable, and brings honor as well as monetary compensation to the families.  There are two guaranteed consequences of these attacks: the attackers will be honored as heroic martyrs, and their families will get a guaranteed income from the Palestinian Authority.  Suicidal Palestinians have an easy decision on how to kill themselves: one path towards shame and hellfire, and the other towards honor, Paradise, and guaranteed family income and security.  Although this is only a theory, it seems to be a compelling one. There are huge disincentives to traditional suicides and giant incentives to “suicide by IDF.” The way to verify it would be if the media would investigate the personal lives of the would-be stabbers and car rammers to see what their family situations were like, what their personalities were, and to dig beyond the relatives claiming that they were angry at Israel to see of there were any other things going on in their lives.  But, of course, no media bother to do that. Even though they have enormous resources at their disposal – look at how they reported on Shireen Abu Akleh’s death – as far a I know, no mainstream media have ever investigated the circumstances of these attackers’ lives.  And the reason for that is just as obvious: they have a narrative of Israeli evil, and they have no desire to disprove what “everybody knows.” Especially when doing so would bring the exact dishonor to the victims that they were trying to avoid.  This is another example of media bias by omission. And the world only sees the simplistic lies of desperate Palestinians driven to act by how terrible their lives are under “occupation.”  {Reposted from EoZ}","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpld2lzaHByZXNzLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9lbGRlci1vZi16aXlvbi9zaWxlbmNlLW9uLXBhbGVzdGluaWFuLWVwaWRlbWljLW9mLXN1aWNpZGUtYnktaWRmLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Black"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 18:15:00","Newswise — Black adults – particularly Black women – with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to grow up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  “The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,” said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study. “This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.”  Recent research shows that since 2019 half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death – whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence – increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community. Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don’t own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020. The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  “For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,” said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center. “However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzd2lzZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tY3JpbWUtYW5kLXN1aWNpZGFsLXRob3VnaHRzLWFzc29jaWF0ZWQtd2l0aC1ncmVhdGVyLW9kZHMtb2YtZmlyZWFybS1vd25lcnNoaXAtYW1vbmctYmxhY2stYWR1bHRzP3RhPWhvbWXSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3dpc2UuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2Rpc2NyaW1pbmF0aW9uLWNyaW1lLWFuZC1zdWljaWRhbC10aG91Z2h0cy1hc3NvY2lhdGVkLXdpdGgtZ3JlYXRlci1vZGRzLW9mLWZpcmVhcm0tb3duZXJzaGlwLWFtb25nLWJsYWNrLWFkdWx0cz90YT1ob21l?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This conclusion has been made after the revenue department reached out out nearly five lakh families of farmers in the region as part of a survey conducted in December last year, Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrekar told reporters on Tuesday.  The Marathwada region, which comprises Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad and Parbhani districts, reported 1,023 farmer suicides in 2022.  As many as 10,431 farmers committed suicide in this region since 2001, as per figures provided by the divisional commissioner’s office.  Kendrekar said the administration studied the socio-economic condition of farmers and their families in the eight districts of Marathwada.  “The survey was conducted to find the families where farmers were vulnerable to taking the extreme step due to various conditions. The farmer suicide rate in Marathwada is more (compared to other parts of Maharashtra,” he said.  “Less crop yield, no good returns on crops, climatic conditions, problems due to wild animals and costly farming inputs were some of the main reasons for farmer suicides in the region. We called four such families and had discussions with them,” the official said.  He said the families get aid after they lose their member to suicide.  “To find such suicide vulnerable farmer families, we decided to reach out to the cultivators through a survey comprising 104 questions. It was like a psychological test,” the official said. Through this survey, the farmers families were found that were tired of their (socio-economic) condition, he said.  “The situation is serious. There are families with girls to be married, children who have left their education. If a family has five-seven acre of land and doesn’t have ample water, it yields less crop. They take loans from banks and private money lenders,” he noted.  Kendrekar said farmers need money in this “risky” business of farming.  “Like the Telangana government, I think the farmers should be given an aid of Rs 10,000 per acre before a crop season. They can purchase seeds and make their farms ready for sowing. After this, they can purchase other farming essentials without any debt and interest. We will recommend this to the state government soon,” the official said.  Market reforms are also necessary to prevent farmer suicides, he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vZmFybWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZ2l2ZW4tZmluYW5jaWFsLWFpZC1iZWZvcmUtY3JvcC1zZWFzb25zLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtbWFoYS1vZmZpY2lhbC0yNTkwNjMwL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vZmFybWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZ2l2ZW4tZmluYW5jaWFsLWFpZC1iZWZvcmUtY3JvcC1zZWFzb25zLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtc3VpY2lkZXMtbWFoYS1vZmZpY2lhbC0yNTkwNjMwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

GARNER, N.C. (WTVD) -- Local Emergency Rooms are under pressure to help those facing mental health episodes.  Last year, WakeMed Hospital admitted 4,000 adults and children with suicidal thoughts. That represents a 15 percent increase from the previous year.  Victor Chambers knows people suffering, but they're having difficulty accessing resources.  ""(They're) just mostly peers. I'm still kind of young myself so it's very prevalent in my age range,' said Chambers.  Wake County is committing about $30 million every year to support behavioral health services, but a newly released report shows there are several gaps in getting people the help they need.  The report notes that right now ""there is an overreliance on calling 911 for behavioral health crisis"" and then a ""lack of coordination with the new 988 crisis call line.""  One recommendation is to increase funding to the mental health facility WakeBrook and turn it into a crisis hub.  The report is being released as WakeMed is inching closer to building a new medical health hospital in Garner.  WakeMed Behavorial Health Department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Micah Krempasky said only about half of the people, who are admitted to the ER and need a psychiatric bed, actually get one.  ""We are vastly underserved in the amount of in-patient psychiatric beds available,"" she said. ""There are people that wait days, weeks, months or are actually never able to access that level of care. Instead, we stabilized them in the hospital. We connect them with out-patient services. We do the best that we can.""  WakeMed said there was a 104 percent jump in the number of pediatric patients since 2020.  Hospital leaders are trying to tackle the problem and building a new medical health hospital in Garner. The site is located near the intersection of White Oak Road and Timber Drive.  The facility will eventually have a 150 psychiatric beds and help with a shortage.  ""The need for behavioral health care is far bigger than what WakeMed can handle alone. We have to come together to come up with community solutions for the overwhelming need that is here and that has been under addressed for year,"" said Krempasky.

The deceased 14-year-old girl’s grandfather submitted a complaint to police in which he stated that he had gone to his native place in Hapur and came back on Sunday evening. On his return, he found about 10-12 people standing outside his house and searching for the suspect.  “They were family members of the boy and were searching for him in my house. They went to the terrace of the house which was locked. They put up a ladder from the adjacent house and found the boy. They then took him along. Around 1.25am, I heard some sound and went upstairs to my granddaughter’s room. I found her hanging from the ceiling fan,” the complainant said.  The officers said that the girl was alone at home on Sunday as her mother and brother had gone to a hospital in Delhi while her grandfather was also away.  The grandfather’s complaint further said that he found five used contraceptives from under the bed.  “It is suspected that the boy blackmailed the girl using some videos and she died by suicide,” the complaint said further.  The police said that they seized the contraceptives.  “These have been sent for forensic analysis while investigation is on regarding the said videos. The boy has been detained and the girl’s body was sent for autopsy. The investigation is on in the case,” said Nimish Patil, ACP (Masuri).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL25vaWRhLW5ld3MvMTV5ZWFyb2xkLWJveS1kZXRhaW5lZC1mb3ItcmFwZS1hbmQtYWJldHRpbmctc3VpY2lkZS1vZi1jbGFzc21hdGUtaW4tZ2hhemlhYmFkLWZpci1yZWdpc3RlcmVkLXVuZGVyLWlwYy1hbmQtcG9jc28tYWN0LTEwMTY4NDI2MzEzMjg3OC5odG1s0gG_AWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbm9pZGEtbmV3cy8xNXllYXJvbGQtYm95LWRldGFpbmVkLWZvci1yYXBlLWFuZC1hYmV0dGluZy1zdWljaWRlLW9mLWNsYXNzbWF0ZS1pbi1naGF6aWFiYWQtZmlyLXJlZ2lzdGVyZWQtdW5kZXItaXBjLWFuZC1wb2Nzby1hY3QtMTAxNjg0MjYzMTMyODc4LWFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Health chiefs from countries that have given ill people control over how they die shared a range of experiences in a debate on a potential change to the law in the UK.  Professor Brian Owler, a consultant in New South Wales, said hearing the horrific ways people had taken their own life was a “very powerful argument” in assisted dying being made legal in the Australian state.  He told the story of a woman who went through chemotherapy for Leukaemia and took her own life before the legislation was available.  “The sadness was that her husband who cared for her for I think about 10 years went to work one day and had to come home and find her dead and that was really unfair on her and of course her husband and her whole family,” he told the Commons health select committee.  Image: bbc.co.uk) bbc.co.uk)  “That’s the sort of harm we’re trying to stop with this legislation. It really is about understanding people’s autonomy and respecting their decision and their choice when they are in a situation where they are suffering or when they are dying about the timing and the manner of their death.”  South Australia’s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Kyam Maher said 10% of suicides police attended in the area were of elderly people with terminal illnesses.  He said: “There has to be a better way that someone at the end of their life can die with the same dignity with which they lived their life.”  Dr Chandana Banerjee, a professor in palliative medicine in California, said having the option of assisted dying gives patients “peace of mind”.  “It allows them and their families to really plan for things rather than wait for the disease to get so debilitating that they can’t enjoy their lives for those last six months.”  There are strict rules in most countries that have legalised the practice.  Dr Banerjess said most people still think assisted dying in the US is “for anyone and everybody” but added: “That’s not the case. It really is highly regulated for those who have a prognosis of six months or less.”  Dr Lydia Dugdale, director at the centre for clinical medical ethics at New York’s Columbia University, highlighted the importance of safeguarding with the case of Canada, which has been highly criticised for its right-to-die laws.  Image: Getty Images/Westend61) Getty Images/Westend61)  She gave the example of more than 1,700 euthanasias having been carried out for loneliness in the country.  Dr Dugdale said: “What kind of society do we want to live in where we solve the problem of ageing and lack of access and poverty by Euthanisa?  “That’s what we’re seeing in Canada which has not had it legalised for that long. People can’t pay their rent, they get euthanised. People can’t afford their medicines, they get euthanised. People need a wheelchair lift and the veterans’ affairs office offers them euthanasia.”  Professor Roderick MacLeod, a former senior palliative care consultant in New Zealand, was the voice of general concerns about assisted dying.  Saying he’d like to see the law reversed, he said: “For a long time I’ve spoken about the fact, as a palliative physician, people would ask me quite frequently if there was anything that I could do to end their life and when I was in practice I would say I couldn’t because it was illegal.  “But requests for a hastened death are not uncommon in palliative care because people are essentially saying ‘I don’t want to live like this’ and that is a very reasonable statement to make.  “What I know from my own practice and the practice of my colleagues is after a variable length in the palliative care service those requests for hastened death melt away.”  Last month, crossbench peer and chair of the charity Dignity in Dying, Molly Meacher, told MPs the reality of end of life could include vomiting faeces, endless nausea and bad-smelling decaying tumours.  She has long campaigned for reform to laws in the UK, where assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.  British retiree David Hunter is currently on trial in Cyprus after killing his cancer-stricken wife after she begged him to help end her misery.  He wept as he told the court on Monday: “It was her decision that she wanted to die, not mine - hers. It was her decision that she didn’t want any more treatment.  “She has her own mind and she asked me. I would never in a million years have done it. She wasn’t just my wife - she was my best friend.  “I didn’t just decide to kill her. I loved her so much. I still love her.  “You don’t know what we went through.

The university student named Ho sustained injuries to his head and right leg after he jumped onto the tracks at about 7.40 pm and was hit by the moving train before becoming trapped beneath it.  He was rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital in critical condition.  Police found a suicide note at the scene, and a preliminary investigation revealed Ho had been conned on a social networking app.  Sources said Ho could not repay the debts, and the stress might have led to his suicide attempt.  The service of the East Rail Line was once suspended and resumed at 8.30 pm.  In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy was also defrauded on a social networking app by being blackmailed with indecent clips and photos of himself.  Police said the boy was recently lured into a nude chat, with his mother receiving some of the indecent images taken by the scammer, asking for HK$10,000.  It is unknown whether the mother paid the ransom.  Officers recommended that parents explain more about online pitfalls to their children and remind them not to be naked in front of the camera, click on suspicious links, or download programs from unknown sources.

(WJBF) – The National Institutes of Health reports insomnia as a common sleep disorder, affecting up to half of patients with schizophrenia. Insomnia can also increase the risk of suicide in schizophrenic patients.  Doctors at the Medical College of Georgia at AU are investigating ways to lower this risk and improve patients’ quality of life.  Insomnia disorder affects about 10 percent of adults.  “Insomnia was a risk factor for suicidal thinking, suicidal behavior and suicide death,” said Dr. William Vaughn McCall, Chair of Psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.  During his earlier studies, Dr. McCall says he wanted to see if treating insomnia in people with active suicidal thinking would make a difference.  “It did,” said Dr. McCall. “Treating insomnia appeared to mitigate people’s tendency towards suicidal thinking. And this was the first time that it had been shown.”  Now, he and Dr. Brian Miller, professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, are working to treat this occurrence in patients with schizophrenia- using a drug called clozapine.  “We use it because it dramatically changes people’s lives when it works,” said Dr. Miller.  “I’ve started patients on clozapine who’ve been able to go back to school and finish degrees. And pursue advanced degrees. And get meaningful employment.”  Dr. Vaughn notes that a person’s ability to think clearly is noticeably diminished if they don’t get enough sleep.  “The decision they land upon is ‘I might commit suicide’, which is a decision they might not make if they slept better,” said Dr. McCall.  The doctors are also looking at ways to better recognize signs and symptoms of high alertness, which is often linked to insomnia.  Using a device called a pupillometer, they can measure the rate of pupil responses to determine the patient’s level of physiological excitement.  It has proven to be a helpful instrument in the stages of both diagnosis and treatment.  “We have an additional study with the pupillometer to measure these pupillary responses to light in patients before and after they get treated with clozapine,” said Dr. Miller.  “We think that the autonomic nervous system will tell us things about the patient that they may not be able to even access themselves,” said Dr. McCall.  Drs. Miller and McCall tell us they remain committed to proving their hypotheses and providing better care for patients in need.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqYmYuY29tL25ld3MvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1tYXR0ZXJzLWhvdy1kb2N0b3JzLWFyZS10cmVhdGluZy1zdWljaWRhbC1iZWhhdmlvci1pbi1wYXRpZW50cy13aXRoLXNjaGl6b3BocmVuaWEv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2piZi5jb20vbmV3cy9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLW1hdHRlcnMtaG93LWRvY3RvcnMtYXJlLXRyZWF0aW5nLXN1aWNpZGFsLWJlaGF2aW9yLWluLXBhdGllbnRzLXdpdGgtc2NoaXpvcGhyZW5pYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-09-25","Not Discerned","{""Guildford"", ""Surrey"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:03:15","SURREY, United Kingdom — According to a teacher and author, schools should provide “lessons in bromance” to address the mental health crisis among boys. Matt Pinkett’s new book proposes that classes centered around anger management, friendship, and active listening could potentially reduce male suicide rates.  Pinkett’s book delves into key research that explores factors influencing boys’ mental health, discussing topics such as body image, pornography, and self-harm. Additionally, it offers practical strategies for teachers to initiate positive change. The guide is grounded in evidence gathered from teachers, school staff, well-being experts, and therapists.  Research indicates that teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, a rate that triples when boys transition into adulthood. According to official data used by the U.K.-based researcher, 264 people between 10 and 19 years-old committed suicide in 2020 in England, Scotland, and Wales — with boys constituting 72 percent of these cases. In England specifically, suicide is the leading cause of death among men under 45.  Despite these grim statistics, Pinkett remains optimistic. In his book, “Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in School,” he urges teachers to refrain from stigmatizing anger, suggesting they should instead help boys understand the neurological and physiological roots of their feelings.  “Anger isn’t inherently bad. Telling boys it is only leads to shame and concealment. Instead, we should teach them that anger is as natural as joy or sadness, and equip them with the tools to manage it and the language to express it,” the author says in a media release.  Pinkett also believes that teachers should normalize loving, male relationships. He maintains that every social interaction in the classroom is observed and internalized, hence, male teachers should openly compliment male colleagues, speak affectionately about others, and acknowledge and applaud male emotional vulnerability whenever possible. He advocates for teaching boys about bromances, as this can furnish young men with the skills to listen actively and exhibit compassion and affection towards one another.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work. However, the fact is that we are in front of these children for significant portions of their lives. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing,” says Pinkett, who also co-authored the book, “Boys Don’t Try.”  He further adds that the challenge lies not in encouraging young men to talk, but rather in teaching their peers to listen. Pinkett’s research suggests that boys don’t listen as effectively as girls.  “There is so much discussion about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through effective listening?”  His research proposes that boys yearn for emotional intimacy and the liberty to express themselves without ridicule. However, he identifies toxic masculinity as an obstacle to nurturing these beneficial peer relationships. He believes boys should be taught kindness, vulnerability, and emotional articulation. Pinkett hopes his book will embolden others to tackle difficult topics that will benefit everyone.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to discard harmful and outdated expectations of masculinity, society as a whole will benefit. It is only through education that the blight of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Armed with extensive research, Pinkett offers advice on intervening when a child may be at risk and provides tips on establishing group tasks that foster friendships while facilitating learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists.

"suicide","2023-04-01","10:00:00","{""Springfield"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:59:41","Suicide prevention experts are praising the performance of the 988 lifeline, saying the simple three-digit code is expanding access to crisis services nationwide.  “For people in crisis, 988 is a game changer,” said Angela Cummings, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  Illinois has six crisis call centers statewide. In July 2021, the state was last in the country, with only 19% of crisis calls answered in state.  After the 988 launch in July 2022, that number jumped to 81% and new data just released for April 2023 found 87% of calls were answered in-state, the highest ever.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “You can call it and have your call answered in about 36 seconds is the average now, while it used to be close to 170 seconds. So that's a huge improvement,” Cummings said.  Nationwide, people in crisis contacted the 988 lifeline nearly 368,936 times last month. That’s 160,314 more contacts in April 2023 compared to April 2022.  A year over year comparison for the month of April also found calls answered went up by 52%, chats answered increased by 90% and text responses went up by 1,022%.  “I was thrilled, because a lot of the people who do the texting are younger people, and we want to get to them as soon as possible,” said Cara Levinson.  Levinson is the board chair for the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Levinson lost her daughter, Elana, 18, to suicide in 2007.  “Not that every minute is occupied with missing her but it's, as you can see, it's, it's still, still there,” Levinson said, tears in her eyes.  Levinson said she can’t help but wonder if the outcome would have been different had the 988 lifeline been available to Elana.  “With anyone who dies, there’s always this feeling, especially with suicide, if… only….” Levinson said.  Levinson was recently at an event where people she spoke with weren’t aware calling or texting the three-digit code, 988, provides immediate access to trained counselors.  “I can't tell you how many people did not know of its existence. That’s a problem,” Levinson said.    She’s determined to raise awareness, hoping to spare another family the pain she feels from losing Elana.  “If it can't be there for her, then her death though, has prompted me to do this work,” Levinson said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMTAtbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRoZS05ODgtbGlmZWxpbmUtc3RhbmRzLzMxNDI1OTgv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8xMC1tb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItc3RhcnRpbmctaGVyZXMtd2hlcmUtdGhlLTk4OC1saWZlbGluZS1zdGFuZHMvMzE0MjU5OC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2021-05-16","01:00:00","{""Charleston"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:00","Jamie Ray Harris had a few explanations for how his 18-year-old girlfriend ended up dead at his home. None convinced North Charleston police not to charge him with murder. On May 16 Harris' plea for bond failed to persuade a judge to grant the request.  Harris, 20, is accused of murder in the July 5, 2021, fatal shooting of Anissa Shank, of Moncks Corner. He has been held in jail nearly two years without bond. After hearing from both sides on the issue of bond May 16, Circuit Judge B. Alex Hyman ruled against Harris.  The day Shank died, North Charleston police responded to a 911 call around 1 a.m. at his residence, 4853 Lecque St. The call was about a suicide. But North Charleston police officers who responded to the call and found Shank dead determined the fatal gunshot wasn't self inflicted. Detectives determined a charge of murder was appropriate for Harris, whom they believed tried to stage Shank's death as a suicide before he fled the scene.  Harris later told police he was ""playing"" with a gun and accidentally shot Shank, 9th Circuit Assistant Solicitor Kelsey Davis said during the May 16 bond hearing.  Her killing devastated an already grief-stricken family. Shank's mother died just three weeks before she was killed, according to Dana Rabon, who identified herself in the courtroom May 16 as the victim's aunt. Rabon implored the judge to deny bond.  Nicholas D'Angelo, of the Charleston County Public Defenders Office, said he is concerned for his client's wellbeing in the county jail. Harris has been held for 802 days awaiting trial. The attorney said he just learned his 22-year-old client had been placed on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center. Harris' mother and his new girlfriend supported him in the courtroom.  The case will likely not be scheduled for trial this year, D'Angelo said. Prosecutors and defense attorneys in Charleston's General Sessions Court are still working to resolve cases that predate Harris' case, which is nearing two years old.  The case backlog has grown to 14,000 pending cases. Last year, the typical case in General Sessions Court lasted 625 days — more than 1½ years — according to a recently released report by the Charleston County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vbmV3cy9ib25kLWRlbmllZC1mb3ItbmMtbWFuLXdoby1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LXRyaWVkLXRvLXN0YWdlLWdpcmxmcmllbmRzLXNsYXlpbmctYXMtc3VpY2lkZS9hcnRpY2xlXzczNTY0ZTAwLWY0MDQtMTFlZC1iNjEzLTdiN2FjMjRhMjc5Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2023-05-01","18:30:00","{""Sydney"", ""NewSouthWales"", ""Australia""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:39:45","Glenn Anthony and his wife Maria Anthony, President of Pontoxeniteas NSW, are holding a fundraiser on Saturday, May 27 in Sydney in honour of their brother Terry ‘Tezza’ Anthony, who died by suicide six years ago.  The fundraiser is being held at The Grand Roxy in Brighton-Le-Sands from 6.30pm and will raise money for the Black Dog Institute towards Mental Health Awareness and Suicide Prevention.  The night will be focused on personal stories from the family and other guest speakers, including Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Ahead of the fundraiser, The Greek Herald spoke with Glenn and Katrina to hear all about their personal connection to losing a family member through suicide.  Anna, Glenn and Liza.  Glenn Anthony:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I lost my brother Terry to suicide in 2017. He was suffering from mental health issues and depression for many years. We as a family had lived with this and tried to get help for Terry, but this was very difficult and challenging for my parents, sister and myself. After Terry’s passing, it was extremely difficult to process and all our lives were changed.  Personally, my views on life were altered and nothing seemed important anymore. I shut myself off to everyone and everything, and slipped into a terrible depression. I had many questions but no answers. I spent three years with my bereavement councillor to help me focus and see clearly again.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I do believe it is a taboo topic regardless of which community you come from. There is a stigma attached to suicide which generates thoughts within the community of weakness, blame, shame or even sin. The topic makes people uncomfortable and unsure of how to react.  Since my brother’s suicide, I have been able to understand a bit more about this disease and along with this better understanding, I have felt more comfortable discussing it. It is more frowned upon within the Greek community as it is looked at as a sin and having lack of faith.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we are open and honest about the topic, the more people will feel comfortable talking about it. When we don’t talk about our problems or our depression or dark thoughts, then it builds up and it always feels much worse. The more we talk, the more we raise awareness, people are likely to seek help and advice. Let’s talk, let’s make a difference, let’s save lives together.  What do you hope to achieve with your fundraiser?  The fundraiser is about bringing people together from all communities to raise awareness for mental health and suicide prevention. The Black Dog Institute will be there on the night sharing what they are doing and what programs they have to assist people affected. We hope this night shows people there is a lot of help out there.  People can expect some educational insight as to what is being done, they can expect to hear from people that have been affected by suicide, as well as plenty of good food, wine, music and fun, as this night is also a celebration of life.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  As far as dealing with mental health issues, there are many different organisations to help with advice on recognising mental health, what to do, what to say and how to deal with this debilitating disease.  As far as a message for someone dealing with suicide, I would say to talk about your feelings, be open with your family and friends and don’t shut yourself off. The sooner you understand and accept what has happened, the sooner you can get peace of mind and ease your soul. It’s not easy. It’s a type of bereavement that never leaves you, so you have to find a way to best deal with it as it becomes part of your everyday life.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I knew nothing about mental health. But when I lost my son, George, to suicide in 2012, I was unable to accept the tragedy. I developed post-traumatic stress and depression and became suicidal. In order to help myself, I had to obtain treatment and knowledge from mental health services. Now I use this knowledge to raise awareness and help others.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I think it is a taboo subject in every community. Society in general, is very unaccepting and judgemental. The Greek community I found even more so. I found myself treated like a leper, people were cruel with their judgement and criticisms. Greeks don’t understand mental health is a chemical imbalance in the brain, a physical condition. They treat it as an aberration, a weakness, a lack of faith, and something to be avoided. They consider people be more religious and stronger.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we talk openly about the subject, to bring it out of the shadows, the safer people will be. When they know others understand, and they can put up their hands and ask for help without judgement, they will seek help. This will save lives. My son did not seek help, fearing he would be labelled, and his teammates would think less of him.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  Losing a family member to suicide is devastating. My family unit imploded. We couldn’t deal with the grief, the mental health issues and beating the guilt of the ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybes.’ That ate us up alive.  My message is – you cannot fix them, you cannot take away their pain, but you can be there for them. Show compassion and understanding, be prepared to listen and support without judgement, have empathy, and give of yourself to share their grief.  Is there anything else you’d like to say?  There are many organisations dealing with mental health and there is a lot of assistance out there. There is a life lost to suicide every three hours, the toll is horrific. We need to raise awareness with our youth, teach them to recognise mental health, tell them where to get help, and how to build resistance. With knowledge and these tools, we can make a difference, we can save lives.

"suicide","2021-01-03","Not Discerned","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:12:02","This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain  Black adults—particularly Black women—with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to have grown up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm, and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  ""The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,"" said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study.  ""This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.""  Recent research shows that since 2019, half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death—whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence—increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community.  Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don't own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020.  The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  ""For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.  ""However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.""

Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public “when dysregulated and engaging in aggressive behaviour” in a fast food restaurant, and how the video was shared thousands of times on various social media sites.  Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public (Peter Byrne/PA Wire)  The Tory peer explained how the video was reported by the boy and his mother, but the sites would not take it down, and the teen “became overwhelmed” by the negative comments, eventually trying to end his own life.  Her remarks came as peers called on the Government to create an avenue of redress for individuals unhappy with how a platform has dealt with their complaint.  She said: “This footage was shared out of context across social media with much of the response online labelling Harry as a disruptive teenager who was engaging in unacceptable aggression and vandalising public property.  “This was shared thousands of times over the course of a few weeks.  “When Harry and his mum reported it to the social media platforms, they were informed it didn’t violate community guidelines and that there was a public interest in the footage remaining online.  “The family, quite rightly, felt powerless, Harry became overwhelmed at the negative response to the footage and the comments made about his behaviour.  “Harry became withdrawn and stopped engaging. He then tried to take his own life.  “It was at this point that Harry’s mum reached out to the voluntary-run service Report Harmful Content as she had nowhere else to turn to. Report Harmful Content is run by the charity South West Grid for Learning.  “They were able to mediate between the social media sites involved to further explain the context and demonstrate the real-world harm that this footage, by remaining online, was having on the family and Harry’s mental health.  “Then, and only then, did the social media companies concerned remove the content.”  Lady Newlove gave the troubling account as peers continued their line-by-line scrutiny of the Online Safety Bill.  Peers across the House called for an independent appeals procedure for social media users who have exhausted the internal complaints process of these sites – an ombudsman separate to Ofcom to provide an impartial out-of-court resolution.  This suggestion was rejected by the Government, with technology minister Viscount Camrose saying: “The Government does remain confident that service providers are best placed to deal with individual user complaints as they will be able to take appropriate action promptly.  “This could include removing content, sanctioning offending users, reversing wrongful content removal or changing their systems and processes.”  He added that the Bill includes “super-complaints provisions” that allow for systemic issues to be raised with Ofcom, who will be required to publish a response.  Individuals can also submit complaints to Ofcom but it “will not be able to investigate or arbitrate in individual cases” – instead, these reports will be used to inform its overall enforcement activity.  Liberal Democrat peer Lord Allan of Hallam, who worked as Facebook’s director of policy in Europe for 10 years, highlighted that online providers struggle to deal with the “vast funnel of reports”, most of which are “spurious or vexatious”, and the challenge of separating the “genuinely serious reports” from the “vast amount of noise”.  He argued an independent body is needed to identify circumstances where a platform has correctly enforced its policies, but that in a particular case, like Harry’s, it is “deeply unfair, problematic and harmful for an individual”, and provide an avenue for redress.  Children’s rights campaigner Baroness Kidron said the minister responding to the debate had been given “a sticky wicket here of defending the indefensible”.  The film director and independent crossbencher said: “The Government has chosen to give individuals no recourse under the Bill and that is the current situation as it stands, and there is no concession on that matter.  “I believe I have been in meetings with people when they have been promised such things and I think it’s really important that we state what the situation is.”  Offering a meeting with peers to discuss the matter further, Viscount Camrose said: “We are giving users greater protection through the Bill.”  Labour frontbencher Lord Stevenson of Balmacara told him: “This is a very complicated Bill and you and I are now learning the hard lessons.  “It’s quite clear there’s something here that needs to be resolved and the way the Government is approaching it, it is heading towards a brick wall.”  He added that the Bill is “reinforcing an inequality of arms” between individuals and companies, concluding:  “The Government is in a mess, please sort it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvaG9tZS1uZXdzL2F1dGlzdGljLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1vbmxpbmUtc2FmZXR5LWJpbGwtYjIzNDAwODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"suicide","2019-10-14","14:00:00","{""Sussex"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:02:14","Moral, ethical and religious opinions were at the heart of a lengthy debate on assisted suicide that had nearly 40 public commentors in the House Health & Human Development Committee Tuesday.  House Bill 140, sponsored by Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, permits a terminally ill adult resident of Delaware to request and self-administer medication to end the individual’s life in a humane and dignified manner.  The bill was introduced last year, but didn’t survive the session.  Under HB 140, both the individual’s attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse and a consulting physician or nurse would have to agree on an individual’s diagnosis and prognosis and believe the individual has decision-making capacity, is making an informed decision, and is acting voluntarily.  Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, who was against the bill, was among those who thought the bill would prematurely end some people’s lives, saying citing religious belief and prayer sometimes prolongs life.  “My father was diagnosed with lung cancer and was given 18 months,” Briggs King said. “He lived 18 years.”  Rep. Mike Smith, R-Pike Creek, questioned a major talking point for proponents of the bill, which was that 70% of Delawareans support assisted suicide, and that is consistent nationally across surveys.  He said the survey question, which asked whether a health care provider honoring a terminally ill patient’s request to end his or her life should be subject to criminal or civil penalties.  “Doctors are not trained in this. Doctors are trained to treat disease,” he said. “They’re not trained to teach you when to die, or how to die.”  Rep. Stell Parker Selby, D-Milton, said she received dozens of emails from Sussex County residents that were in opposition to the bill.  She said when her mother died, she and her family agreed that she wouldn’t go on any machines or have doctors give her anything, and most people in Sussex agree that they want to die without any assistance.  One common form of assisted suicide that was discussed was a powder that is mixed with a small amount of water or other solution that a patient drinks and typically dies within a few hours.  However, the powder often causes nausea and patients can vomit it up causing a delayed reaction.  READ: Food service workers, paraprofessionals could get raises  Doctors from out-of-state testified that they give patients medications to treat nausea before giving them the solution to ensure it works as it’s supposed to, with a painless death a few hours later.  One speaker said 80% of patients who take the solution die within one hour.  Smith and some others pushed the fact that patients must be in the right state of mind while making the decision, and even suggested mandating a psychiatric evaluation prior to making a decision.  “The physicians regularly are assessing the mental capability of their patients,” Baumbach said.  The idea of assisted suicide legislation has been thrown around in the General Assembly for nearly a decade without success.  Personal anecdotes were shared throughout the meeting.  Kevin Hensely, R-Kevin Hensley, R-Middletown, said his mom, who recently died, wanted to go out her way, by her own choice.  “’I’m sorry to lay that all out here,” he said. “But it’s really fresh, and it’s helped me see it from a different perspective.”  Proponents of the bill said someone who is terminally ill and in pain should be the one to make a decision on their life.  Because several committee members left sometime during the meeting, the committee did not have enough voting members to declare if it was released or not.  That will be made clear hours after the meeting on the bill’s tracker site.  Also Tuesday:  House Bill 150, dubbed the Cover All Delaware Children Act and sponsored by Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Greenville, would help Delaware children who are undocumented and do not have access to routine or preventative healthcare, including vaccinations and physicals, because they cannot afford the services.  HB 150 directs the Department of Health and Social Services to develop and operate a limited medical assistance program for children in Delaware who are not otherwise covered, including children who are not documented.  A child resident in the state whose family income is low enough that they would qualify on that basis for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, but is not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, is eligible for coverage and medical care under this Act.  The coverage would be co-extensive with that provided by CHIP and Medicaid, except that it would not include in-patient care at a hospital or other healthcare facility.  HB 150 also requires the state to submit a plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services so that the state can take advantage of the federal CHIP option to include coverage of pregnant women regardless of immigration status.  HB 150 had enough voting members to constitute a quorum, and legislators voted to release the bill, which will now head to the House floor.  Senate Bill 98, sponsored by Sen. Nicole Poore, D-Delaware City, also was released and is on its way to the House floor.  SB 98 would allow dental clinicians possessing a DDS or DMDS to participate in the Health Care Provider Loan Repayment grant program. The bill also extends the time in which providers may apply for a Healthcare Provider Loan Repayment grant from six months to two years following completion of their graduate education.

We urge the Senate to follow through and help state authorities understand the root causes of this problem.  A 2022 state-mandated report on suicide prevention revealed that the number of suicides among Texas children in foster care jumped from one in 2017 to four in 2021. There are about 50,000 youths in the state’s foster care system.  Foster care youth experience higher rates of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Sadly, their suicide rate is three times higher than that of the general youth population in Texas, according to the state’s suicide prevention report. Still, it’s the job of Texas’ child welfare agency to protect children in its care from harm or death.  Understanding why children in foster care attempt suicide can help the state prevent deaths, said Angela Ott, a policy fellow at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health, a nonprofit affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin. Currently, the state is not required to report suicide attempts.  Opinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  House Bill 4065, which was approved 145-0 in the lower chamber, would require the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to maintain records and collect data on suicide attempts of children in foster care. The Senate now has to take up the bill.  The causes of suicide are complex, and they must be addressed as part of the state’s larger effort to support better mental health programming and infrastructure.  The Legislature is looking at increasing funding for mental health programs. Senate Bill 26, which has been forwarded to the House for debate, would fund grants for community-based organizations that work with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The bill would give priority to organizations that work with children considered high risk for mental health issues, according to The Texas Tribune.  Better data collection must inform the strategies that the state adopts to prevent suicides in the foster care system. These are Texas’ most vulnerable children, and they deserve our best effort.

Two days before the murder-suicide, Tavarez-Rodriguez called 911, claiming his wife had ""too much to drink.""  ""This is not an emergency, this is a call for service,"" he said to the 911 operator.  He said on the call that they had gone to the gas station and were eating dinner at home when he decided to call 911.  The only thing Tavarez-Rodriguez told the operator is that his wife was too drunk; he makes no mention of a domestic disturbance.  ""I wouldn’t call it a disturbance; I just want to cover myself,"" Tavarez-Rodriguez said. ""I just want to make sure that everything is settled.""  The operator asked if they had access to any weapons. He said yes, they did have access to weapons, but said the weapons were locked in a safe.  Two days later, the couple was found shot to death in their home.  On April 28, a Fayetteville 911 operator contacted the Verizon security assistance team to request an emergency ping on a phone.  When asked if this involves danger of death, the operator responded, ""Yes.""  The operator said the emergency ping was in regard to ""a subject who may be attempting to harm himself or his wife.""  After Tavarez-Rodriguez failed to report for duty, officers went to his home to check on him.  A call was made on April 28, in which an officer requested to do a wellness check at the couple's home.  ""I didn't want to call it over the radio because it's one of our officers,"" he said.  When the officers arrived, the couple was found dead inside their home.

"suicide","2020-07-10","10:00:00","{""Dover"", ""Delaware"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:07:38","DOVER, Del. – Delaware lawmakers unveiled a bill on Tuesday that would establish a funding source for the state’s 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to improve its continuum of care.  In 2020, Congress passed the 988 National Suicide Designation Act, requiring a new and universal three-digit calling code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to how 911 is used for public safety emergencies. However, state and local governments were responsible for implementing the 988 system, which launched in July of 2022, though Congress allowed states to assess a fee on cell phone bills to recover the costs related to 988 and the associated crisis services.  House Bill 160, sponsored by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Senator Nicole Poore, would implement a 60-cent monthly surcharge on each wireless access line, establish a fund for the surcharge, and create a board composed state agencies and stakeholders to report on the state’s crisis intervention services. It would also institute a one-time, 60-cent fee on prepaid services. Under the bill, the funds collected through the surcharge would specifically be earmarked for operating the 988 system, providing crisis intervention services and staffing associated services. Unspent money would revert to the fund each year and could not be used for general state expenses.  “People in crisis need to know when they call 988 that they are being connected to knowledgeable, caring professionals who will help steer them through incredibly difficult situations. However, 988 calls in Delaware are currently funneled to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, which is chronically understaffed. We need to provide our behavioral health professionals with the tools and resources they need to save lives. Establishing a small monthly surcharge, similar to way we fund 911 emergency services, will strengthen our mental health services in Delaware and ensure that a person reaching out for help receives quality care. HB 160 builds on our ongoing efforts to address the mental health crisis and provide a continuum of care for residents,” said Rep. Longhurst.  “Delaware can’t sit by and hope that the behavioral health crisis that has been affecting our nation for decades will simply go away on its own,” said Sen. Poore, the Senate prime sponsor of HB 160. “That’s why I have joined with Rep. Longhurst and our colleagues in the Delaware General Assembly to make real investments in a system of care capable of helping people who need it most. This legislation builds on that work by giving our new behavioral health crisis and suicide prevention help line the staff and resources it needs to deescalate emergencies, quickly provide families with immediate access to support and services, and most importantly, save lives.”  Currently, Delaware’s crisis lines handle about 25,000 contacts, though state officials say they expect those numbers to increase due to a greater need for behavioral health services, with a possible growth of 60% or more.  HB 160 would allow funds collected to be used for the establishment and operation of the 988 system and center, including staffing, providing crisis intervention services, providing specialized training, raising public awareness, and data collection and analysis.  HB 160 has been assigned to the House Health & Human Development Committee.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtZHQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvZGVsLWxhd21ha2Vycy1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtOTg4LWZ1bmRpbmctYmlsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2017-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:37:18","K-pop star Haesoo has reportedly died by suicide. The 29-year-old trot singer was found dead by the police on 12 May, reported Naver. This is the second death of a K-pop star to hit the South Korean entertainment industry in less than a month.  In mid-April, famous K-pop star Moonbin’s death had left fans shocked globally. The 25-year-old member of the boy band Astro appeared to “have taken his own life”, as per the police.  These tragic incidents have once again put the spotlight on the dark side of the K-pop world and the Korean entertainment industry.  Series of cases  26-year-old actor Jung Chae-yull was found dead in her home on 11 April. Another actor Yoo Joo-eun died last year at the age of 27.  Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), passed away in October 2019. The 25-year-old had faced cyberbullying throughout her career. A month later, her close friend and a K-pop star, 28-year-old Goo Hara, was found dead at home.  In a rare admission for a K-pop star, Goo had previously revealed in a video that she was suffering from depression.  In December 2017, the lead singer of the boy band Shinee, Kim Jong-hyun, died in a suspected suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.  In a note shared a day before his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt “broken from inside”.  “The depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,” Kim wrote, adding he “couldn’t defeat it anymore”, reported The Guardian.  The heavy cost of fame  According to experts, a variety of factors contribute to higher pressure on young entertainers in South Korea than pop stars of other countries.  This includes presenting a perfect image in public, a stringent training schedule and a culture of online bullying, noted Variety magazine.  K-pop artist Amber Liu opened up about the intense industry pressure in 2020. She told CBS Mornings, “If you aren’t under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut”. “You’re told what to do, what to say, what to think.”  As per CNN, a K-pop star works for an average of 16 hours or so a day, doing everything from dance practices and singing lessons to language classes and camera training.  K-pop artists have to undergo a rigorous training period, even preparing for 10 years or more sometimes before they can make their debut.  There is also extreme competition in the industry for K-pop stars or “idols” as they are called.  “The control from celebrities’ agencies and fan culture are two main contributors to the massive stress Korean stars face,” Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine, told BBC.  South Korea has “fandoms” or organised groups of admirers who spend time and money to prop up their favourite stars and target their opponents, reported Daily Mail.  The stars, in return, have to maintain their perfectly crafted image.  In South Korea’s conservative society, scrutiny of entertainers starts once they debut, with their every move being closely watched by everyone, especially the fans.  As per Daily Mail, drug use or drunken driving can end careers in the industry.  “Korea has a very strict moral standard for celebrities compared to other countries,” Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-kun told BBC.  “If a star behaves only a little different from what’s perceived ‘decent’, the public would attack them. And it’s hard for a star to ignore this kind of assault because of the high social pressure from strong collectivism.”  “Koreans have a strict moral code for their celebrities,” Jeeheng Lee, a culture expert at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, was quoted as saying by Variety. “Demonising the K-pop industry alone doesn’t solve the problem. Sulli and Hara suffered more from misogynistic attacks than from K-pop fans.”  As The Diplomat said in December 2022, while the Korean Wave overtakes the world, “mistreatment, suicide, slave labour contracts, gruelling training schedules, ‘no dating’ clauses, sexual assault, and sexualisation of minors by K-pop agencies cannot go unnoticed”.  ALSO READ: How toilet paper in Japan is helping suicidal youth  Mental health stigma  South Korea has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, as per Bloomberg.  BBC noted that suicide cases among people in their 20s are increasing in the Asian country.  While the stigma around mental health is not limited to South Korea, the added pressure from the country’s entertainment industry has made matters worse for its young celebrities.  Royce Lee, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, told Variety in 2019: “All cultures have a stigma against mental illness. It’s not uniquely Korean”.  “But when talking about celebrities, the intersection of culture and psychology becomes very important. The idea that one must please everybody is both a very Korean idea and a very common problem with fame. So it is a double whammy.”  According to Paik Jong-woo, a psychiatrist and the director of the Korea Suicide Prevention Center, artists are hesitant to approach mental health professionals due to “fear of public shame” and their hectic schedules, CNN reported in 2019.  Speaking to CBS This Morning, Liu, who was a former bandmate of Sulli, talked about the stigma against mental illnesses in the country. “When (people) hear you’re getting help they’re like, ‘What? Why are you getting help? That’s weird’,” she said in 2020.  “That stigma against mental health is just so strong.”  As per reports, while several agencies have started therapy sessions for trainees and stars, the problem of stigmatisation continues to persist.

"suicide","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:54:00","ASHTABULA, Ohio — So far in 2023, 19 school shootings have taken place across the United States as of May 16, according to EdWeek.A group of students at Braden Middle School in Ashtabula has had enough.  ""As a kid, it’s very disappointing,"" eighth grader Josiah Pope said.  ""I get pretty scared because you don’t know when it can happen,"" eighth grader J.R. Crooks said. ""It can happen at any time to anybody.""  For the past year, students in a class titled ""Youth for the Future"" created a new way to market 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number that replaced the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline last July.  News 5 The students pose with advisers Sally Bradley and Joslin Seeds and their poster after a presentation with area leaders at the Ashtabula County Building Resiliency Together (BRT) Collaborative meeting on May 10.  ""We want to change how people look at [988],"" classroom adviser Joslin Seeds said. ""It isn’t just suicide. It’s everything.""  The goal of the poster, which features a student wearing a hoodie, is to connect with students that the lifeline could also be used for other mental health challenges instead of strictly suicidal thoughts.  The idea, Seeds explained, came from watching school shooting after school shooting and learning that in some cases, the shooter tried to reach out for help.  RELATED: She checked her Instagram. She didn't expect a message from The Covenant School shooter.  ""Young kids shouldn’t be dying,"" Pope added. ""We want to get our program out there to as much people as we can.""  ""I think it might be one of the most important things I’ve done and might be in my life,"" Crooks explained.  In student Haiden Peterson’s case, fear took over his house.  ""When I was in third grade, my mom home-schooled me and the rest of my siblings because she was scared of someone coming into the building and shooting us,"" Haiden explained.  988 launched in July 2022  Last year, 988 was unveiled across the country as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, replacing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  The new number is a chance for anyone across the country to call or text and reach a trained professional who can help those experiencing a mental health or an addiction crisis.  In Ohio, experts were expecting around a 40% increase in calls when the number changed, but tell News 5 they’ve only seen a slight uptick.  Across the state, that averages out to about 8,600 calls per month handled by counselors.  Help Network of Northeast Ohio handles the 988 calls for those living in Mahoning, Trumbull and Ashtabula counties.  ""Today, the effects of the pandemic appear to be more mental health,"" said Vince Brancaccio, CEO of the Help Network of Northeast Ohio. ""We're getting a lot more calls from people traumatized by the pandemic. They're feeling depressed, they're anxious and frightened and calling saying they need mental health.""  It comes at a time when, whether it’s trauma, or the harmful effects of technology and social media, the impacts on our children's mental well-being are everywhere.  ""We have a youth mental health crisis in our country,"" U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during a visit to Cleveland in April. ""We have to make sure counselors are in schools, that there's more mental health care in hospitals and clinics.""

The class, run by Seeds and Sally Bradley, meets every day with its all-male class to deal with the academic, social and emotional needs.  ""We want the kids we see every day to normalize those feelings of depression and anxiety,"" Seeds explained.  Already, the campaign, which has not been finalized, is getting attention.  ""Those young men, their voice is a force to be reckoned with,"" said Joleen Sundquist, Chief Clinical Officer at the Ashtabula-based Community Counseling Center. ""There are thoughts that [988 is] just for people taking their own life. As our 'Youth for the Future' students said, it’s for hurt people who are thinking about hurting people. That could be themselves or someone else.""  The next step will be for the poster to be finalized by the Ashtabula County Mental Health Recovery Services Board. If approved, the poster could end up on billboards, inside grocery stores, schools and more.  The students have their own ideas as well about how to catch the attention of their peers: from Instagram stories and Snapchat to the big screen at a Cleveland Cavaliers game.

"suicide","2022-01-10","Not Discerned","{""Buffalo"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:00","Social media giants are facing new fresh pressure on the lasting impact on “addicted” teens – including protests, lawsuits, and warnings from psychologists on harmful content proliferating online.  Now parents tell The Post how their families have suffered as social media severely impacted their teenage children, even driving them to suicide.  The American Psychological Association released 10 new recommendations last week on protecting teens while they use social apps, underlining the growing concern among parents, experts, and lawmakers about interacting with others through phones and screens for hours unchecked.  The guidance does not suggest specific daily limits for teens. But it urges parents to keep children away from content about “beauty” and “appearance” – saying comments on photos can lead to poor body image, eating disorders, and depression, particularly among girls.  Parents protested at Snap’s headquarters last week, saying their children died as a result of the company’s Snapchat platform. One mom who spoke to The Post, Rosellene Bronstein, said her son took his own life after being bullied on it. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  It also tells parents to make sure children are not stopped by social media from getting eight hours of sleep, to keep them away from screens an hour before bedtime, and to monitor usage for problematic content.  “Within the field, there is pretty clear consensus that it is not how much time kids are on screen that matters as much as what they are doing during that screen time,” the APA’s chief science officer, Mitch Prinstein, who helped develop the advice, told The Post.  Prinstein said teens should focus on homework or reading the news instead of passive scrolling or exposure to potentially destructive content.  “It may be easiest for parents to consider how much their children are balancing social interactions that allow for the development of mature social competence as compared to the amount of social interaction that is via social media,” Prinstein said.  Protests from the parents of dead teenagers are only part of the pressure on social media platforms, with members of both parties in Congress proposing bans on its use for under-13s and new restrictions for other teens. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  Social media giants, including Meta’s Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and smaller platforms including Roblox, Discord, Reddit, and Twitch, are facing not just criticism from parents and psychologists but calls from both parties in the Senate for an all-out ban on their use by under-13s and severe restrictions for 13- to 18-year-olds.  And relatives of the 10 people murdered by a racist gunman in the Buffalo, New York, supermarket shooting last May are now suing Meta, Snapchat’s parent company Snap, Discord, Reddit, 4chan, YouTube’s owner Alphabet and Twitch’s parent company Amazon. They claim the platforms radicalized the teen gunman before the mass shooting.  One school resource officer told The Post he tells parents to keep kids off social media until “at least 13” because of the risk that they will be exploited for nudes or money by extortionists.  Corp. David Gomez, an officer with the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said he operates multiple fake accounts to see what “kind of drug issues” are impacting the area, as well as to search for local runaways. He regularly gets contacted by men and women while portraying both boys and girls, he said.  Corp. David Gomez, of the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said “dangers” await young users of social media sites, including scammers in search of money or sexually explicit content.  “I just regurgitate what the kids say and then I get adult predators who want to meet for sex,” Gomez, 50, said. “As a community, we need to increase our education of parents and kids about social media dangers.”  He also cultivates relationships offline with students, but he realizes authorities are outnumbered.  “This is like emptying the river with one cup at a time,” Gomez said. “Most adults cannot fathom the amount of kids that are becoming victims to these things.”  SNAPCHAT BULLIES TOLD MY SON: ‘GO KILL YOURSELF’  Rosellene Bronstein, 49, of Chicago, traveled to California for a protest outside Snap headquarters in Santa Monica on Friday because she does not want another family to lose a child to suicide – as she did last year.  She joined dozens of parents calling for stricter regulations on social media companies and expressing support for the proposed Kids Online Safety Act. The measure, proposed by a bipartisan group of senators, would require annual independent audits assessing risks to teens and increased parental controls.  Nate with his parents, Rob and Rosellene Bronstein, during a trip in 2020, roughly two years before the bullied teen committed suicide. Social media sites deliberately use algorithms to “create addiction” among young users, his mother told The Post. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “The algorithms are deliberately designed to create addiction to the content our children are exposed to,” she continued. “And couple with our children’s desire to be validated by likes, shares and views, these online environments are extremely harmful to our children’s mental health.”  Bronstein’s son, Nate, took his own life in January 2022 following relentless bullying by more than 20 classmates at the Latin School of Chicago.  Just weeks before hanging himself, the 15-year-old had received a Snapchat message from a basketball teammate urging him to “go kill yourself,” she recalled.  Bronstein said Nate reported the abuse to school officials, but his parents weren’t informed until it was too late. She and her husband Rob Bronstein later filed a $100 million lawsuit against the school, alleging their son was initially targeted by bullies who wrongly believed he was unvaccinated.  “Social media platforms do not care about our children. They only care about profits.” Rosellene Bronstein  They also joined a class-action lawsuit that accuses platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and others of being designed to maximize screen time and encourage addictive behavior, often resulting in emotional, mental or physical harm.  “It’s really up to us parents to come together to create our own societal shift and say, ‘Enough is enough, we’re not going to put our kids on social media,’” Bronstein, whose daughters Mia and Sydney are 19 and 15, told The Post.  Nate Bronstein, 15, was found hanged in his family’s home just one month after he received a Snapchat message urging him to “go kill yourself,” his mother told The Post.  She said parents should consider keeping their teens away from social media altogether if possible, likening abuse of sites like Facebook or TikTok to smoking or doing drugs.  “It’s the same idea, it has to be applied to social media,” Bronstein said. “But parents aren’t there yet. And what really upsets me is that parents have their heads down in the sand, thinking this is not a crisis. That’s the issue.”  She also wants Snapchat to allow parents to monitor all the content its teenage users receive by permitting third-party apps such as Bark to monitor messages, something the platform does not currently allow.  A $100 million lawsuit filed by Robert Bronstein, left, and his wife Rosellene alleges the Latin School of Chicago committed “willful failure” to stop continual bullying of their son Nate. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “If I would’ve been able to use Bark with Snapchat, the minute he would’ve gotten that message, I would’ve gotten like a three-alarm alert on my phone,” she said. “We would have been able to save our son.”  Users must be at least 13 to create a Snapchat account and teens receive an alert if they’ve accepted a friend request from an adult. The app also recently launched its “Family Center,” a tool allowing parents to track friends of their teens without getting access to their messages, a company spokesperson told The Post.  PREDATORS AT PLAY  April Veneigh, 39, wants other parents to know that young adolescents – like her 12-year-old daughter Kaelyn – can be targeted outside traditional social media giants such as Instagram or TikTok.  Kaelyn, then 11, connected with another user on the online gaming platform Roblox early last year. The chat later moved to Discord, a voice-video-text service where most conversations are private.  The other user claimed he was 14, and started to “groom” Kaelyn, now in the sixth grade, by sending explicit videos and requesting nude photos from her, Veneigh told The Post.  April Veneigh, 39, of King City, Oregon, with her two daughters, Kimberly, 16, and Kaelyn, 12. An online predator recently targeted Veneigh’s younger daughter, she told The Post. Courtesy of April Veneigh  “He claimed he was 14, but was very advanced for a 14-year-old,” said Veneigh, of King City, Oregon. “He got her to think we were abusive and that she could only trust him with everything.”  Veneigh said she noticed changes in Kaelyn’s behavior after she connected with the stranger, including severe anxiety and panic attacks.  That led her to contact her cellphone provider, Verizon, which was able to show the files Kaelyn had been sending, leading to the horrifying discovery that she had been groomed into sending naked images.  Veneigh then called cops, who told her the investigation would include FBI officials since the other user was suspected to be in Wisconsin. No arrests have been so far, she said.  “I’m still waiting to hear back from police and what they find,” Veneigh said.  Veneigh said other parents should regularly check with cellphone providers to find out what files are being sent since all data, including sexual content, is backed up. The “cloud doesn’t lie,” she said.  “You don’t know who is really on the other end of that computer. There are too many face filters. People can be older but make themselves look like a child. It’s scary,” Veneigh continued. “You also don’t know who’s going to be grooming your child.”  The mother of two urged other parents to get their kids away from screens with exercise or running errands.  “I’m embarrassed and ashamed this is happening to my family,” Veneigh said. “It’s so depressing.”  HOW TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM LED TO ANOREXIA  Jon Sayah, 61, of Dallas, said his three children use TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat at least four hours per day. “They’re hooked on social media,” he told The Post.  But three years ago, at the peak of the pandemic, his eldest daughter, Lucy, 20, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, an illness he believes was exacerbated by her social media use.  “She is just getting better now,” Jon told The Post. “Social media provided detailed strategies on eating less, strategic foods to eat, behaviors to avoid the professional check-ins, and most important what her friends were doing and what she was missing or not included.”  Jon Sayah, his wife Julie, and their children (from left) Betsy, 18, Lucy, 20, and Dustin, 13. The couple tried to enforce restricted use of social media, but that only caused more friction, Jon told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Lucy, now a sophomore at Northwestern University, said she wishes she had not become so invested in social media. She first logged onto Instagram at 13, later joining TikTok.  “Social media has caused me to constantly compare myself to others online and has greatly contributed to the onset of my anorexia nervosa,” she said, adding she no longer uses others’ posts to gauge herself.  “I would encourage parents, especially of young teens, to set boundaries with their children on social media use and time spent as it can have an extremely negative and maladaptive impact,” Lucy told The Post.  “Social media does not allow children and young teens to live in the present and instead forces them to view false realities of other individuals’ lives, which has the potential to be harmful.”  Dustin, 13, Betsy, 18, and Lucy, 20, would rather be in front of a screen instead of spending time together as a family because “they’re hooked on social media,” their father told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Sayah’s 13-year-old son, Dustin, has already learned plenty on social media about sex and alcohol – topics normally associated with high schoolers, he said.  “Not sure yet what the impact is of growing up too fast,” said Sayah, who said attempts to restrict and lessen social media usage only caused more drama and tension in the family. Algorithms tailored for young users make them especially vulnerable, possibly triggering harmful behavior that seemingly appears “normal and popular,” he said.  “It is dominating their time and allows them to connect without ‘real connections,’” Sayah said. “It is a substitute for so many other activities.  “Conversations in the car, figuring out how to spend downtime, being creative, being uncomfortable trying to make friends or spending time on passions are all sacrificed when they can ‘kill’ several hours on social media a day during any time.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3NvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kcm92ZS1vdXItdGVlbmFnZXJzLXRvLWFub3JleGlhLWFuZC1zdWljaWRlL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3NvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1kcm92ZS1vdXItdGVlbmFnZXJzLXRvLWFub3JleGlhLWFuZC1zdWljaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2019-07-18","Not Discerned","{""RockHill"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:10:00","Sextortionists sent a grieving South Carolina lawmaker a sick message gloating about driving his teenage son to suicide — while threatening to release nude photos and demanding more money.  State Rep. Brandon Guffey, 54, told CNN that he got the Instagram message on the day his son Gavin would have turned 18 — and less than a month after he found him dead last year at their family home in Rock Hill.  “It said, ‘Did I tell you your son begged for his life,’ with a laughing face emoji,” Guffey told the outlet.  The sick, tragic crime was behind Guffey introducing “Gavin’s Law,” which was passed by state senators Thursday and is expected to be signed into law soon.  It threatens scammers who extort a minor or an at-risk adult with up to five years in prison for a first offense.  Guffey said he had no idea his son, a recent high school grad, was being blackmailed when he found him dead in the bathroom last July after hearing the loud thump of his body hitting the floor after he shot himself.  The lawmaker only realized 17-year-old son Gavin was being blackmailed after sextortionists started messaging him, too. Facebook / Gavin âGoopâ Guffey Remembrance  “My initial thought was, this is my fault — I left the gun out,” he said, adding he will never forget the pain of realizing his son died by suicide.  The sick plot emerged in part after the sextortionists started barraging Guffey and his family — including his younger son, Coen, 16 — with Instagram messages demanding more money.  They then realized that Gavin thought he was sharing nude photos with a young woman who first sent him pics — only to be told they’d be released to everyone he knew unless he paid blackmail.  The sextortionists started messaging the family of Gavin (here on his graduation day) after his death. Family Handout  Gavin had used Venmo to send the scammers all the money he had: $25.  “He was telling them he would get them more money, please don’t send these images out,” Guffey told CNN.  “They didn’t care.”  The grieving dad said the scammers used disappearing messages to make “kids feel safe” that their intimate pics would be scrubbed.  “What they don’t realize is, someone has another device recording that device,” he said.  “If you can extort 10 teenage boys that aren’t gonna say anything for $100 each, and do all that with one image that you got from a girl, it’s fairly simple.  “And teenage boys, whenever they see they’re getting that attention (from a girl), they’re not necessarily thinking.”  The FBI said that last year there were at least 7,000 reports of sextortion of minors, with at least 3,000 victims, mostly boys. More than a dozen are known to have died by suicide.  The true number may well be way higher because “the shame, fear, and confusion children feel when they are caught in this cycle often prevents them from asking for help or reporting the abuse,” the FBI says.  When Gavin died, his dad was in the middle of his successful run for state representative — and briefly considered quitting to focus on hunting for his son’s scammers.  “My wife said, ‘Absolutely not. You’re one of the few people that have a voice that can get out there and truly make a difference,’” he recalled.  The lawmaker’s wife persuaded him to use his office to help other young victims. Facebook / Brandon Guffey  He stayed in office, with “Gavin’s Law” his first order of business.  “I feel like he (Gavin) would want me trying to save additional kids from ever having to feel the way that he felt at that time,” he said proudly.  An FBI spokesperson told CNN that no arrests have been made in the Guffey case. The rep declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing investigation.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:27:29","Share this  Article Facebook  Twitter  Email You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license. University Boston University  Researchers have uncovered a marker in the brain that could help identify people at a higher risk of suicide.  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  As reported in the paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says lead author Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, assistant professor of psychiatry a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  The researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  The findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting, Jagger-Rickels says.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  The Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health supported the work.

"suicide","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:30:58","A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  The report, The Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data Summary & Trends Report: 2011–2021, focuses on a decade of research on youth sexual activity, substance use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, violence, poor mental health, unstable housing, school connectedness, and parental monitoring, while also exploring the data by sex, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, and sex of sexual contacts.  CDC data from 2021 showed “significant increases in the percentage of youth who seriously considered suicide, made a suicide plan, and attempted suicide,” and that was true across all demographic categories. It was up to 22% compared to the 2011 report which showed that 15.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 months before the survey. In this latest study, female students were 16% more likely than males to make this consideration, at 30% and 14%, respectively. By race and ethnicity, the youth with the highest rates of ideation were youth identifying as Native American at 27%, followed by youth identifying as multiracial at 24%, youth identifying as white at 23%, youth identifying as Black or Hispanic both at 22%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander at 21%, and youth identifying as Asian at 18%. The rates spiked even higher for youth identifying as LGBTQ+ at 45% compared to 15% among youth identifying as heterosexual. The report noted that nearly 60% of female students and 70% of LGBTQ+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness and that 10% of female students and 20% of LGBTQ+ students had gone as far as attempting suicide.  “As we saw in the 10 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health among students overall continues to worsen, with more than 40% of high school students feeling so sad or helpless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year—a possible indication of the experience of depressive symptoms,” the report stated. That’s 14% higher than 2011.  “Nearly all indicators of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased from 2011 to 2021,” the report noted, although it showed no increase in the number of students treated for suicidal injuries.  Contributors to Instability in Mental Health  While the data showed an overall decrease in bullying and risky behaviors involving sex and substances, and a high level of parental monitoring among most youth, there was plenty of alarming data that could help to account for the continued decline in mental health among female students. For example, in 2021, almost 20% of them reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and 14% had been physically forced to have sex.  Other contributing factors for mental health decline among all students might include unstable housing, not feeling connected at school, and fear of violence. The report notes that a high level of parental monitoring, defined as “parents or other adults in a family most of the time or always knowing where they were going or who they would be with, and school connectedness, which it defines as “the feeling among adolescents that people at their school care about them, their well-being, and their success,” both correlate to decreased sexual risk, substance abuse, experiences with violence, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Overall, only 3% of students had experienced unstable housing, although the rates were disproportionately higher for Black and Native American students, as well as among youth identifying as LGBTQ+ who had any same-sex partners. Overall, 7% of students had been threatened or injured by a weapon at school, down about 3% from 2011 among males and unchanged among females. The percentages decreased among Asian and Hispanic students and there was no change among Blacks and whites. However, LGBTQ+ students were more likely than their peers to be threatened or injured in this scenario. And overall, 9% of students had to go to school in the past 30 days because of fear of violence. The rates in this category were especially high among students identifying as Native Americans at 13%, Black at 12%, Hispanic at 11%, and LGBTQ+ at 14%, and females were 3% more likely to stay home than their male counterparts who reported not going at 7%.  Finally, it’s debatable whether school, the setting where 95% of youth spend their daily lives, was a welcoming and safe environment. While white students felt more connected than any other group at 65%, only 61% of all youth surveyed said they felt close to people at school. Females were even less likely to feel that way at 58% compared to 65% among males. Only 54% of Native American and Black youth felt close to people at school and the numbers were only slightly higher among Hispanic youth at 58%. Meanwhile, only 58% of LGBTQ+ youth felt close to someone at school compared to 65% of their heterosexual counterparts.  Recommendations  “These data make it clear that young people in the U.S. are collectively experiencing a level of distress that calls on us to act,” the report said in its key findings section. “Although the primary goal of school is academic learning, they play a key role in shaping mental, physical, and social growth.”  To address this, the CDC made the following recommendations:  Increase school connectedness across all grades.  Increase access to needed services by improving school-based services and connecting youth and families to community-based sources of care.  Implement greater health education for all grades.  The report also recommended that schools reference the CDC’s What Works in Schools program, an evidence-based approach to the above recommendations that have led to improvements in sexual behavior, substance abuse, violence, and missed school due to safety concerns. It also noted that “schools that implemented policies and practices to support LGBTQ+ youth not only saw improvements in health and well-being for young people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, but also their heterosexual counterparts.”  An Intersectional Perspective  While the ten-year report did not explore the prevalence of these issues at the intersection of race and gender identity, a supplemental study released in April did use unadjusted logistic regression models to explore prevalence across some subgroups from 2019 to 2021. The study, titled Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among High School Students — Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 2021, showed a significant spike in serious consideration of suicide among Black, Hispanic, and white females students. For example, suicide ideation was up 6% among Hispanic females, 6.8% among Black, and 7% among white females, compared to 4.6% among multiracial females, 2.2% among Asian females, and .2% among Native Americans. It also showed a higher increase in suicide attempts requiring medical treatment for multiracial, Black, and Hispanic females, up 3.7%, 1.7%, and 1.1% respectively compared to an increase of .3% among Asian females and .6% among white ones, with no change for Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander females.  While this supplement does not include data on suicidal tendencies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender identity, UnidosUS knows Latinx students identifying as LGBTQ+ already are indeed struggling with mental health and safety issues. According to the 2021 UnidosUS fact sheet Latinx LGBTQ+ Students and Their Experiences, 22% of Latinx students identify as LGBTQ+, 40% have experienced assault and/or harassment due to race or gender orientation, 57% feel unsafe at school due to their gender expression, and 35% are likely to miss school because they feel unsafe there. The fact sheet also notes that 70% of these students experience symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, 64% major depressive disorder, 43% have considered suicide, and 18% have attempted suicide. And a new UnidosUS factsheet on mental health shows that Latino LGBTQ youth are 30% more likely to attempt suicide than non-Latino LGBTQ youth.  “The data shows that youth with intersectional identities, such as students of color who also identify as LGBTQ+ are disproportionately at risk and therefore it is important to recognize their unique experiences in order to equitably address their mental health and offer culturally and linguistically relevant supports and interventions,” says Amalia Chamorro, education policy project director at UnidosUS.  South Florida-based Afro-Latina LGBTQ+ youth human rights advocate Ayari Aguayo says the pandemic contributed to feelings of isolation, as well as exposure to violence and unwanted sexual behavior. She cited societal phenomena such as the hypertextualization of girls of color as contributors to exploitation and low self-esteem, and she fears feelings of sadness and hopelessness are likely to get even worse in a state like Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis has pushed through legislation banning classroom discussions of gender identity and some Black studies curricula, further adding to the fragile mental health of youth who feel further stigmatized.  “It’s all layered with not being in an empowered community, not having the tools, workshops, or the support services,” Aguayo said, adding that during the pandemic, she and her colleagues found they were able to combat these concerns by helping to introduce youth to inspiring characters who had been in similar life situations.  “We brought role models who were courageous and vulnerable, who said, ‘I grew up with abuse and this is how I became resilient, this is what I did to overcome it,’” said Aguayo.  This type of intervention is congruent with CDC study’s goal of maintaining high-quality surveillance systems, conducting, and translating youth supporting scientific research, and helping school systems provide health education for safer, more supportive learning.  In its fact sheets and other policy and advocacy materials, UnidosUS’s policy team encourages schools and districts to fund GSA, ethnic clubs, and staff professional development programs focused on improving mental health and creating diverse and inclusive learning environments. It also urges the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to enforce existing federal laws created to prevent and combat gender and race discrimination. And it also wants to see that same office disaggregate data to reflect multiple identities of students related to race, ethnicity, and gender identity when conducting student-focused research on topics like this one.  A February announcement by the U.S. Department of Education that it had received $188 million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support mental health and student wellness can help schools provide critical and necessary support. UnidosUS supported the passage of this legislation.  “As the President outlined in his State of the Union address, we must do more to tackle our nation’s growing mental health crisis, which is particularly acute among our youth,” Domestic Policy Advisor to the President Susan Rice said in the U.S. Department of Education’s February 16 announcement.  “Mental health and wellness have profound implications for our students, their academic success, and their overall outcomes, and we know that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in that same announcement. “The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act represents an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to supercharge efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizQFodHRwczovL3VuaWRvc3VzLm9yZy9wcm9ncmVzcy1yZXBvcnQvYW1lcmljYXMteW91dGgtaW4tZW1vdGlvbmFsLWNyaXNpcy10aGUtY2Rjcy1sYXRlc3Qtc3R1ZHktb24teW91dGgtcmlzay1iZWhhdmlvci1zaG93cy1oaWdoLWxldmVscy1vZi1zdWljaWRlLWFtb25nLWdpcmxzLWFuZC15b3V0aC1pZGVudGlmeWluZy1hcy1oaXNwYW5pYy1hbmQtb3ItbGdidHEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-10","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:28:58","Image by Sasin Tipchai from Pixabay  There has been much discussion recently about adolescent mental health. Some of this comes in the wake of the alarming CDC report released in February showing unprecedented levels of sadness and suicidality, especially in teen girls. Some say social media is to blame for this recent rise in mental health problems, and I remain skeptical.  But before we try to understand what variables might be causing the problem, we should first clarify whether there is, in fact, a problem, and what exactly the problem is. Some of this depends on how we interpret mental health trend data. Is the American adolescent suicide rate at an all-time high? And how do we compare to the rest of the world?  While it is the case that the suicide rate among American teenagers increased over the last 10 to 15 years, if we pull back the lens a bit, things get more complicated. Across recent history, we can see that overall, the teen suicide rate is about the same now as it was in the 1970s. In fact, the suicide rate amongst teen boys was higher in the 1990s than it is now. Following this, it dropped in the late 90s and early 2000s (no one knows why), before rising again in the 2010s. Look for yourself at the CDC data here.  Still, even if teen suicides are lower than last century, it is still alarming to see them rising in recent years. Something is definitely going on. If, for example, we hypothetically found out that cancer or pregnancy death rates were increasing over the past few years, the notion that they had gone down 30 years ago and were now returning to baseline would be cold comfort. But is the recent increase in youth suicide a worldwide phenomenon? The answer appears to be no. In most other countries throughout the world, the suicide rate among adolescents has not increased over the past 10 to 15 years. A paper published in 2020 by a group of researchers from Britain found that the suicide rate amongst teenagers has risen only in Australia, Canada, the UK, and USA. Whereas in France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, Japan and Korea, the teen suicide rate has fallen.  These researchers characterize the four countries with rising teen suicidality as being unique in several ways. These are “populous high-income predominantly English-speaking nations” which also have high levels of economic inequality. These four countries were all in the top five highest for economic inequality (measured by Gini index) out of all the countries studied. Simply put, the people in these countries are “W.E.I.R.D” relative to the rest of the world. The researchers also point out that social media cannot be an explanatory factor for the rise in teen suicides, since all countries studied throughout the world have the same media access as American teenagers do. If social media was the key variable that explains the rise in teen suicide, we’d be seeing comparable rises in most other countries. But we don’t see that in the data.  The study authors also ran analyses examining whether the places with an increase in teen suicides also had a greater increase in social media usage compared to the other countries. They did not find any statistical difference. They also looked at the proportion of young people who used social media for more than one, three, or six hours per day, and it was also not statistically different across those countries. Simply put, social media usage does not appear to be different across the countries with rising vs. flat suicide rates.  If you’re interested in looking at other countries besides those discussed in this research paper, Our World In Data provides a resource based on data from the World Health Organization. The same decrease in adolescent suicides over the past decade can also be found in countries such as New Zealand, Russia, Argentina, India, and Iran. For other countries such as Israel, Cuba, Norway, and Denmark there is virtually no change across this period.  What do all these countries have in common? This is for future research to discover. Some studies show that cultural factors such as strong social norms are a variable that predicts suicide in various countries, but this does not necessarily explain stability or changes in youth suicides across time. It would also be useful to consider specific subpopulations (e.g., young secular girls/women on the political left), to see if there are trends in suicide-related distress occurring in other countries besides America.  One thing does seem clear. The suicide rate among young people is not increasing throughout most countries around the world over the past decade, or even since the year 2000. Furthermore, we cannot blame social media for the rise in suicide among American teenagers. The data simply do not support this conclusion, for the simple reason that teenagers in other countries also have access to the same media that we do. It would be unwise and incorrect to declare that social media usage plays a role in suicidality.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wc3ljaG9sb2d5dG9kYXkuY29tL3VzL2Jsb2cvdGhlLXJlc2lzdGFuY2UtaHlwb3RoZXNpcy8yMDIzMDUvdGhlLXRlZW4tc3VpY2lkZS1yYXRlLWhhcy1ub3QtaW5jcmVhc2VkLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtdGhlLXdvcmxk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"suicide","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:56:01","SALT LAKE CITY — A tight-knit medical community in Utah is sharing their thoughts and talking about how to move forward after a well-known doctor in their field killed his son, then himself at his clinic.  In a place to promote healing, Dr. Emily Bullock offers the space for people to process at her psychotherapy clinic in Woods Cross, Utah.  “All different kinds of traumatic events that people have gone through, sometimes from long ago, sometimes current, sometimes accidents, sometimes sexual trauma, military trauma, things like that,” Bullock explained.  The kinds of therapy found in her clinic include EMDR, assisted psychotherapy, clinical yoga and ketamine.  “Ketamine is used as a tool to help people in their therapy to be able to accomplish whatever their goal is that they’re working on in their treatment,” she said.  She’s seen clients who utilize ketamine as medicine and has found it brings “a lot of hope and promise” to their lives.  “These psychedelic medicines and ketamine specifically — which is the one that’s FDA approved right now — have been incredibly beneficial and impactful for people in their lives when they’re used as a tool to aid them in their recovery or their mental health journeys,” Bullock said.  Something else has been impacting her this week, as those in the psychedelic medicine community talk, discuss and express emotions following what took place at a different clinic over the weekend.  “When you hear about a tragedy like this, it’s very confusing. It’s very distressing,” Bullock said.  Police said Dr. Parth Gandhi died by suicide after shooting and killing his 16-year-old son inside Salt Lake City Psychedelic Therapy and Research Saturday. It’s unknown if any substances were used prior.  Gandhi was known in the healing world for his work with psychedelics, specifically as they relate to autism, concussions, addiction and depression.  “It’s terribly upsetting for everyone in the psychology community in the medical community, in the psychedelic medicine field,” Bullock expressed.  Dr. Scott Allen, a physician and anesthesiologist who runs a psychedelic medicine clinic, knew Gandhi.  “Dr. Gandhi was a fairly influential educator within the psychedelic movement within Utah and sort of nationally to here,” he said. “He led a fairly large training course that a lot of people attended.”  He indicated how the people who are used to helping others are now working themselves to process this terrible event.  “We’re trying to figure out a way going forward in which we can help support each other,” he said.  Allen said they would host their next professional journal club in a couple of weeks and have been discussing ways to support each other’s thoughts, feelings and emotions as they work to take care of other physicians.  “We’ve been discussing ways that we can offer services to people and have a venue for people to kind of talk about what they’re feeling personally,” he said.  He said this one tragic act does not represent the psychedelic medicine community as a whole.  “Psychedelics, in general, tend to promote a lot of feelings of love, of connectedness, oneness with the universe. That’s usually what people experience is, is more love and more compassion for other people, more empathy. That’s usually what we see,” Allen said. “And so, for somebody involved with the psychedelic community, I think it kind of compounds the shock of it because most of us who have engaged with it, we’re like, ‘Wow, these substances make us so loving towards others.'”  Dr. Bullock, who specializes in working with complex trauma and led the Traumatic Stress Response Team in the U.S. Air Force, explained that in horrible traumas like this, it’s normal to experience a range of different emotions, and she talked about how crucial it is to reach out, get support and speak with others.  “It’s so, so important to be able to get take care of yourself and your basic needs following a tragedy,” she said. “But then also, getting the right kind of help and support immediately and thereafter.”  For anyone wanting to reach out for services, Bullock said the Utah Psychological Association is always available and is currently on standby to be able to refer people affected by last weekend’s events to the appropriate agency.  She said anyone in a dangerous or emergency situation should call 911, and there’s also the 988 mental health emergency line. That line will link people to a crisis response center, and they can deploy a team of mental health experts to intervene. The 24/7, free, confidential domestic violence hotline is also at 1-800-897-LINK.  The Utah Psychological Association released the statement below in response to the situation. It explains their sorrow for Gandhi’s daughters, his son’s mother and others close to them, and how they’re ready to help his clients.

"suicide","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 02:05:06","Question: In your book you argue the suicidal are oppressed by structural suicidism, a hidden oppression.  Alexandre Baril: “I coined the term suicidism to refer to an oppressive system in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence. Our society is replete with horrific stories of suicidal individuals facing inhumane treatment after expressing their suicidal ideations. The intention is to save their lives at all costs and interventions range from being hospitalized and drugged against their will, to being handcuffed and shot by police, to losing their jobs, to having their parental rights revoked, to even being kicked off university campuses. Thus, suicidal people often remain silent and complete their suicide without reaching out to anyone.”  “Worse, I argue that suicide prevention services do more harm than good. Simply put, suicide prevention often increases deaths by suicide rather than prevents them. This is especially true for marginalized suicidal people such as Indigenous, racialized, homeless, poor, queer, trans, disabled, neurodiverse and Mad individuals, for whom suicide intervention often increases the racist, colonialist, classist, sexist, heterosexist (or homophobic), cisgenderist (or transphobic), ableist and sanist violence they experience. My thesis is that suicidal people are oppressed by suicidism and the oppression they experience remains under-theorized.”  Q: Support for suicidal persons is not working. Please explain why that is.  AB: “Suicide statistics remain relatively stable and have not improved significantly over the past decades. Despite decades of multiple strategies and billions of dollars invested in outreach initiatives, studies show that those most determined to die carry out their suicidal plans without reaching out for help. In sum, our prevention strategies do not work.”  “My work found current prevention services generally fail to connect with suicidal people, who do not feel safe asking for help. This silencing effect, due to suicidist consequences (experiencing forms of harm when revealing suicidal plans) leads suicidal people to not feel supported to share their distress.”  Q: You believe that offering assistance in dying to suicidal patients would better prevent unnecessary deaths. How?  AB: “The most radical idea of my book is to theorize suicide as a positive right that would involve supporting suicidal people in their quest for death through assisted suicide. This support would be delivered through a suicide-affirmative approach. This might save more lives than current prevention strategies.”  “This non-stigmatizing approach would provide suicidal people with the chance to speak freely and to benefit from an accompaniment process to reach an informed decision about their desire to live or die. My approach has the potential to drastically reduce rates of suicidality, particularly among marginalized groups, by opening channels of communication with people who are currently too afraid to reach out for help.”  “Even for the small minority of people who would go ahead with an assisted suicide, they would have a less lonely and violent death and a relational process of dying that would also be less traumatic for family and friends.”  Q: Should this idea ever come to fruition, what kind of impact would you expect to see? How would this influence a person’s suicidal ideation?  AB: “My approach is a radical de-stigmatization of suicidality. Slogans such as ‘Speak Up, Reach Out’ or ‘Let’s Talk’ urge suicidal people to share their distress. But suicide prevention services send a paradoxical message since those who open their hearts often experience harm, forced treatments, and rights violation in the name of care and of saving vulnerable people from themselves, all because suicide is never an option.”  “Through my approach, suicide becomes an option, one that should be carefully thought through within an accompanied process during which various options would be seriously considered to help the person make an informed decision. By removing the suicidist violence suicidal people experience when they share their suicidal ideations and plans, and by supporting the assisted suicide of the person if they determine that this is indeed the best option for them, suicidal people would finally feel safe to speak up, reach out for help and talk about their distress. In my approach, the priority is the suicidal person, not life itself. Instead of completing their suicide without speaking with anyone, they would be accompanied as they contemplate making this crucial decision, weighing all the pros and cons, informing their relatives and family members, and preparing for this passage from life to death.”  Q: Are there examples of this model working elsewhere in the world?  AB: “There has never been a model such as this before. Throughout history, some philosophers, bioethicists and thinkers have promoted the right to die by suicide, but it’s always a negative right. Those in favor of a positive right to die limit this exclusively to the context of assisted death in the case of disability/sickness/illness.”  “My work questions why we offer assistance in dying to people who, in the vast majority of cases, don’t want to die and ask for better living conditions. And those who do want to die, such as suicidal people, are denied any assistance and are forced to die alone in atrocious conditions. If such an idea was adopted, it would lead to a completely different social, political, and legal landscape than the one we are used to. This is an out-of-the-box idea, which invites us to radically rethink both our perspectives on suicide and assisted suicide.”  Q: The inspiration comes from the support that transgender persons receive. Please elaborate on this parallel.  AB: “The positive right to assisted suicide for suicidal people may be new, but my suicide-affirmative approach is inspired by trans-affirmative approaches to rethink the care offered to trans people – not based on forms of control and gatekeeping – but to support their autonomy. My suicide-affirmative approach is anchored in self-determination, informed consent, and harm reduction. Instead of trying to cure trans people of their transness or suicidal people of their suicidality, we develop safer spaces in which we can examine their suicidality with them and discuss a variety of options.“  “A shift from prevention to accompaniment would empower suicidal people. Similarly to a trans-affirmative approach, the suicide-affirmative approach offers care and support through an informed consent model, taking for granted that the expert in the decision to transition—in this case, from life to death—is the person making the decision.”  “Regarding the theorization of suicidism and the rights and recognition of suicidal people, we are currently where trans people were regarding trans rights and recognition in the 1930s. Indeed, everything needs to be imagined, theorized, and transformed, as was the case for trans people several decades ago when transitioning was not even an option. My work constitutes a first step in this direction; it allows us to open our hearts and imaginations regarding the possibility of envisioning suicide and assisted suicide from a different point of view, from the standpoint of suicidal people.”  Baril, Alexandre.

The campaign targets 26-70 year-olds and shows the impact of simple, direct dialogue about suicide and how to initiate those conversations when they are more important than ever. In 2021, 48,183 died by suicide , an increase of 4.79% from 2020.  Talk Away the Dark Father showing emotional distress  Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9170651-american-foundation-for-suicide-prevention-talk-away-the-dark-campaign/  Research shows that suicide is preventable. The more we openly, honestly, and directly talk about suicide, the more we can help to prevent it.  The campaign anchor is a public service announcement (PSA) produced by TBWA\Chiat\Day New York through a pro bono partnership with AFSP. It depicts a daughter having brave conversations with her father as she recognizes in him common warning signs of suicide. The PSA ends with the daughter asking her father directly about suicide, bringing him back from the shadows and into the light. Its message is clear: we can't begin to address suicide if we don't take the first step and start the conversation.  ""In the past several years, we have made tremendous progress in our openness surrounding mental health. However, many people are still unsure about what to do when someone they know is struggling with their mental health,"" said AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia. ""Our campaign is a powerful reminder that we all have the ability to help.""  ""I have experienced loss from suicide, so our work on this is incredibly meaningful to me,"" said TBWA\Chiat\Day New York Chief Creative Officer Amy Ferguson. ""To partner with AFSP and put the talent and efforts of our agency to use on such an important issue is so incredibly rewarding.""  AFSP will be hosting a virtual event on its Instagram channel with experts at 4 p.m. ET on May 16 to discuss best practices for having important mental health conversations with loved ones. The PSA will appear nationwide across broadcast, digital, social, and print and it connects with Spanish-speaking communities, offering translated resources.  The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention is dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide. AFSP creates a culture that's smart about mental health through public education and community programs, develops suicide prevention through research and advocacy, and provides support for those affected by suicide.

On Monday, the company said it will soon display messages that people searching about suicide could use to ask for help. Based on specific templates, the prewritten messages will contain different requests to speak or chat with a friend, family member, or other trusted contact.  If you need help, visit: The International Association for Suicide Prevention  The idea behind Google's initiative is that a person thinking of suicide might run an online search looking for answers or guidance or information, especially if they don't know where else to turn. In that case, the person might not even know how to describe what's wrong or why they're having suicidal thoughts. And they may be reluctant or embarrassed to contact a friend or family member directly.  Designed to remove some of the difficulty and stigma involved in reaching out to another person, the messages will offer direct requests such as the following:  Also: Is ChatGPT an effective therapy alternative? 80% of this study's participants thought so  ""I'm struggling right now and just need to talk to someone—can we chat?""  ""This is really hard for me to say but I'm having painful thoughts and it might help to talk. Are you free?""  ""I don't want to die but I don't know how to live. Talking with you may help me feel safe. Are you free right now?""  The person could choose the message that best expresses their feelings and thoughts and then text it directly to a loved one, who hopefully will be able to intervene and provide aid and comfort to that person.  The pre-written messages were developed by Google in partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention. But this isn't the first time Google has made an attempt to help individuals thinking of suicide.  For several years, suicide prevention information has been available at the top of relevant search results. Last year in the US, the company updated this information to display the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of state and local call centers from the US Department of Health.  A 2022 survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 90% of the people polled felt that the US is facing a huge mental health crisis. On its end, Google said that searches for ""mental health crisis"" have risen each year. In this environment, people in crisis need easier access to mental health resources and to friends and family members for support.  Also: Generative AI could lower drug prices. Here's how  ""People often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments,"" Dr. Megan Jones Bell, Director of Consumer and Mental Health at Google, said in a blog post. ""In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on.""  Google has also directed certain resources to teenagers and young adults. For people in the 10-34 age group, suicide is the second leading cause of death, according to the CDC. In response, the company offers crisis support resource panels on YouTube to help young people connect with live crisis professionals for suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. To address that last issue, Google has started to remove content from YouTube that shows or promotes eating disorders such as binging and purging.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N1aWNpZGUtcmVsYXRlZC1nb29nbGUtc2VhcmNoZXMtdG8teWllbGQtbWVzc2FnZS10ZW1wbGF0ZXMtZm9yLXNlZWtpbmctaGVscC_SAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy56ZG5ldC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLWFtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3N1aWNpZGUtcmVsYXRlZC1nb29nbGUtc2VhcmNoZXMtdG8teWllbGQtbWVzc2FnZS10ZW1wbGF0ZXMtZm9yLXNlZWtpbmctaGVscC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Gujarat BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama. (File Photo)  As per the complaint lodged by Chag’s son Hitarth Chag at Veraval police station, his father had lent about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.75 crore to Naran Chudasama who wanted it for his business. On being asked to return the money, Chudasama and his son refused to do so and had threatened to kill the complainant and his father, as per the complaint. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.  The FIR is filed under IPC Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  Dr Chag, 59, who is also a philanthropist in the coastal town of Veraval, was found hanging at his residence with a suicide note beside him on February 12.  The one-line suicide note written in Gujarati blamed Rajesh Chudasama and Naran Chudasama for his death. Hitarth alleged that the names mentioned in the suicide note are Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh-Gir Somnath and Naran Chudasama is his father.  On February 17, Hitarth lodged a complaint with Veraval police, demanding that the MP and his father be held accountable for his father’s suicide.  As the police did not immediately register an FIR against the MP and his father based on Hitarth’s application, he approached the Gujarat high court in March.  In his plea he alleged that police had acted in contempt of the Supreme Court’s Lalita Kumari judgment by refusing to lodge an FIR in the case.

The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said. (Representational Image/Getty Images)  Police said that the student was depressed after learning of her poor performance in the board exams, the result for which was announced on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) GS Sidhu said that the student had left a suicide note saying she was upset over the result and had walked out of her home on Friday. Police did not clarify how far away the drain was from the victim’s house, but said it was in the same neighbourhood.  “We have not found any foul play behind the death so far,” the officer added.  The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said.  DCP Sidhu said that the girl was dejected. Her parents said that around 3.30pm, she quietly walked out of her home and it was only later that they discovered the suicide note written by her, after which they approached the police at around 9.30pm, police said.  “We launched an extensive search operation to find her. We also took all other legal steps to trace her by informing the police control room (PCR) and flashed wireless messages to all the station house officers in Delhi and all the deputy commissioners of police by describing the student. The details of the missing girl were also uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet) but we got no response,” said the officer.  On Sunday morning, police received a call about the partly submerged body of a girl being found in a drain. “The body was taken out from the drain with the help of locals and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. She was soon identified as the missing victim by her father,” said the DCP.  Since there was no indication of foul play, the police initiated proceedings under the CrPC instead of registering an FIR.  This is the third known case of a student dying by suicide in the Capital due to performance issues in the Class 12 board exam since Friday. In the first instance, a 19-year-old woman student died in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri after failing. In the second case, a 16-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar hanged herself to death after scoring 75%, which was lesser than what she had hoped.  A senior official from the Directorate of Education said that the department offers a helpline to students where they can reach out for counselling. “Students can call up the Yuva helpline and get in touch with education and vocational guidance counsellors on the toll-free helpline. The helpline number is promoted among students during exams, it works round the clock from morning to evening,” said the official, requesting anonymity.  Central Board of Secondary Education started the post-result psychological counselling on Friday. The counselling will be conducted till May 27 from 9.30am to 5.30pm. Students who want to attend the counselling can dial the toll-free number 1800-11-8004 and can get centralised access to CBSE tele-counselling helpline, information, and helpful tips for parents and students in case of result-related anxiety or stress.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpLW5ld3MvMTh5ZWFyb2xkLXN0dWRlbnQtZm91bmQtZGVhZC1pbi1kZWxoaS1kcmFpbi1hZnRlci1wb29yLWJvYXJkLWV4YW0tcmVzdWx0cy0xMDE2ODQwODk5NTY1MDAuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpLW5ld3MvMTh5ZWFyb2xkLXN0dWRlbnQtZm91bmQtZGVhZC1pbi1kZWxoaS1kcmFpbi1hZnRlci1wb29yLWJvYXJkLWV4YW0tcmVzdWx0cy0xMDE2ODQwODk5NTY1MDAtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The charity has temporarily removed mascot Pudsey’s eye covering to show “not all of the challenges that children and young people may be facing are visible”, the broadcaster said.  The campaign encourages conversations between children and parents, carers and other trusted adults “to ensure no child faces their emotional and mental health challenges alone”.  Behind The Bandana ambassador Dr Alex George (BBC/PA)  Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, who has campaigned for better mental health after the death of his 19-year-old brother Llyr by suicide in 2020, has been named Behind The Bandana ambassador.  He said: “I know how important early intervention is in helping make a difference to the emotional wellbeing of children and young people and so I am very proud to be the ambassador of such a powerful campaign that really shines a light on the mental health crisis we are facing.  “As highlighted by Pudsey bear himself, mental health issues can be less visible on the outside, but conversations and positive relationships really can help.”  As part of the campaign, Children In Need has released the findings of a new Censuswide survey shedding light on how comfortable children feel when asking for help with their feelings and how often they feel the need to put on their “metaphorical bandana” and hide their emotions.  While nine in 10 parents surveyed said they talk to their child about their mental health at least once a month, more than a quarter of young people surveyed said they had not talked to someone they trust about their mental health in the last six months.  Children In Need’s boss Simon Antrobus said: “This research is a clear indication that our Behind The Bandana campaign is urgently needed.  “What’s also clear is that we can all play a role in addressing early signs of worry and anxiety by showing children and young people that we’re here to listen and to support them.  “By recognising and acknowledging that some feelings of worry and anxiety can be hidden means early conversations, sensitively delivered with kindness and empathy, can make a real difference to a child’s wellbeing and can help prevent mental health problems from becoming embedded.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxkcmVuLXJlbW92ZXMtcHVkc2V5LWJhbmRhbmEtbWVudGFsLTIzMDEwMDYzNS5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9jaGlsZHJlbi1yZW1vdmVzLXB1ZHNleS1iYW5kYW5hLW1lbnRhbC0yMzAxMDA2MzUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney at just 17 to chase a contract in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns throughout a rollercoaster career that almost broke him in more ways than one.  The 28-year-old spent seasons on the sidelines battling a foot injury that left his chances of running again uncertain and his playing career in freefall.  A product of a tough upbringing, Brown struggled when he moved to Australia and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide.  While playing with Cronulla at age 19, Brown says he felt isolated and disconnected from everyone.  Bulldogs backrower Fa'amanu Brown pictured with his mother who passed away in 2020  Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney to play in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns that almost broke him in more ways than one  'I went and signed papers at Cronulla Leagues Club … and I was, like, 'Man, I'm done. I want to go home or else I'm going to commit suicide',' he told ABC News.  And one night when the pressure became unbearable, Brown swam out into the ocean as far he could.  'God, if you're going to take me, take me now because, man, I'm done,' he recalled thinking at the time.  'But, for some reason, I floated on my back, swimming backwards back to the shore … I remember just crying,' he said.  Brown spoke to his mother afterwards and she encouraged him to be strong.  The young footy star started earning big bucks with the Sharks, but without proper guidance Brown soon developed a gambling problem.  'I ended up becoming broke. I went through a gambling phase. There was a point where I had to ask [the club to be paid] in an advance,' he admits.  It was his mother's cancer diagnosis that finally made him pull himself together and became the defining moment of his life.  Brown struggled when he moved to Australia to play footy and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide  Brown (pictured with his partner) started earning a large wage with the Sharks, but without proper guidance the youngster soon developed a gambling problem  'There was a time where Mum was going to be put into a rest home, where people look after them until they pass, or we had an option where me and my brothers look after our mum,' he explained.  Brown thought a care home would be the best idea, but his brothers talked him out of it.  'But my brothers know the Samoan way more than me … My older brothers said: 'Trust me, you'll understand once you start looking after her.'  'This beats my NRL debut, making whatever money … I don't think getting married will top this.'  In a social media post from 2020, the footy star detailed how he was feeling while looking after his dying mother.  Brown says his mother's cancer diagnosis pulled him together and became the defining moment of his life  Brown thought about putting his mum in a care facility for her final days, but was glad he spent the time with her instead  'What I've learnt through my relationship with mum is there's no point in holding grudges towards others,' he wrote.  'Life is too short to darken your heart. Every time you say goodbye to your loved ones that could be the last time you will hear or see them. Now she is sick, I regret so many things.  'I should've would've could've but i know it's made me who i am today. Realise before it's too late.  'Everyday embrace your loved ones. Tell them you love them. Say it sincerely. Record memories.
