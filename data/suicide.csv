Rubu Zhao, 52, suffered a skull fracture in the fall Sunday in PACE mental health unit 8B at the George R. Vierno Center, multiple sources told the Daily News. He died Tuesday night at Elmhurst Hospital.  Advertisement  Zhao, a native of China, is the second Rikers detainee known to have died in custody this year. He was arrested in December on charges of murder and illegal weapons possession in Brooklyn and had a May 31 court date. He was accused of killing his girlfriend in their Sunset Park home.  Rikers Island's George R. Vierno Center (James Keivom/New York Daily News)  PACE units are supposed to have a higher degree of security and medical supervision to monitor the people held there than regular jail units.  Advertisement  A DOC source familiar with the incident said Zhao was not on suicide watch, and was allowed to move around within the unit.  The sources said Zhao swung his leg over a banister at a top tier stairwell, plummeted backwards down a set of stairs and landed on his head.  Officers responded immediately and called for medical help, officials said. Zhao was taken to Elmhurst hospital, where he died at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday, they said.  “I am saddened by the circumstances that led to Mr. Zhao’s passing and I offer my condolences to his family,” said Correction Commissioner Louis Molina. “The health and safety of everyone in our custody is a top priority and a full investigation is underway to determine how this unfortunate incident occurred.”  The incident remained under investigation Wednesday.  A copy of the preliminary incident report shows Zhao fell at 2:18 p.m. on Sunday, but the incident wasn’t reported until two days later, at 12:06 a.m. on Tuesday, according to a copy of the Correction Department’s 24-hour report obtained by The News.  The report is a carefully compiled log of major incidents in the jails. The reason for the discrepancy remained unclear Wednesday.  Advocates decried the death. “When is it going to stop? Rubu Zhao should be alive today,” said Victor Pate of the group HALTSolitary. “Relying on jails to address mental health needs is destined to fail. Yet, no one in a position of power has done a damn thing to release people to alleviate this crisis.”  Advertisement  The other detainee to die at Rikers this year was Marvin Pines, who died Feb. 4 after he was found unresponsive in a housing area at the North Infirmary Command.  Five correction officers were suspended in connection with Pines’ death. A preliminary Board of Correction report found that for three hours before Pines’s death, his unit was without an officer touring the floor as required by Correction Department policy.

(FOX 56) — According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 800,000 people die by suicide each year. That’s more than all wars and homicides combined.  With this in mind, The University of Kentucky’s nursing program is stepping up to teach students about the warning signs of suicide and what to do next.  UK is now offering a one-hour online program that teaches people a suicidal prevention tactic called “QPR”, which stands for “question, persuade, refer.”  QPR training teaches how to recognize early signs of suicide and how to respond.  The training program started as a class for just 30 nursing students at a time. It has now grown into an online platform to accommodate a larger demand.  Amanda Lykins, an assistant professor for UK’s undergraduate nursing program and she said, “We know that through this training, one little interaction can save a life.”  Lykins also said the university has seen demand go up for the campus “Mental health crisis hotline.”  “We are seeing an increase in students accessing that throughout the semester,” Lykins said. “We are seeing more and more students who are socially isolated and doesn’t have the ability to be able to cope with those difficult situations.  Lykins said one positive development in the last year is that suicide has dropped from the 10th leading cause of death in the nation to 12th.  “I think that the stigma around mental health and mental illness has definitely improved,” Lykins said. “I feel like we are providing more awareness that it’s ok not to be ok.”  However, even with the lower rates, the WHO reports there is one suicide death every 40 seconds; 15 people every 10 minutes.  UK said its QPR training is available for all communities and it’s funded by the state of Kentucky.

Only every other working-age individual now considers their quality of life good, whereas four years ago, over 60 percent of working-age individuals felt the same way. Quality of life refers to a person's perception of their own situation, including their health, well-being, social relationships, and living environment.  These findings emerge from a comprehensive population study called ""Terve Suomi"" conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The survey data was collected between September 2022 and March 2023.  According to the study, one in five working-age individuals, aged 20 to 64, experiences significant psychological strain. Mental strain has increased markedly among both men and women compared to 2018: from 13 percent to 19 percent among men and from 13 percent to 20 percent among women. Psychological strain remains most prevalent among individuals aged 20 to 29, but there has also been an increase among those aged 30 to 49.  ""The results are concerning from the perspective of societal social and economic sustainability. While there have been indications of the declining well-being of the working-age population previously, the crises of recent years have likely further complicated the situation. During the upcoming government term, the well-being of working-age individuals must be placed at the core of decision-making, as an aging Finnish society requires a healthy and functional population,"" says lead researcher Annamari Lundqvist.  Suicidal thoughts have become more prevalent among those under 50 years old. While in 2018, one in ten individuals reported having suicidal thoughts, now the number has risen to one in eight among those under 50.  ""The implementation of suicide prevention programs is now particularly crucial. These programs aim to develop ways for anyone to address concerns and guide healthcare professionals on what to do after identifying suicide risk. Additionally, we encourage individuals to create safety plans in case of suicidal thoughts and promote the use of other effective treatment methods in social and healthcare services,"" explains research professor Timo Partonen.  An increasing number of working-age individuals report utilizing mental health services due to mental health-related problems. Currently, 20 percent of women and 12 percent of men in this age group state that they have used mental health services, compared to 15 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in 2018.  The study also reveals that access to healthcare services has become more challenging. Nearly one in four adults feel that they do not receive sufficient medical services relative to their needs. This means that over 800,000 individuals in Finland perceive medical services as inadequate. The proportion has increased by almost 10 percentage points among both men and women since 2018: from 14 percent to 23 percent among men and from 17 percent to 27 percent among women. These findings reflect the situation prior to the social and healthcare reform.  The most challenging situations regarding access to doctors are found in North Karelia, Central Uusimaa, and Kainuu, where over 30 percent of residents feel they receive insufficient medical services relative to their needs.  ""The new well-being regions face a difficult starting point that they must address. The poor development is likely influenced by several factors, such as the backlog of COVID-19 treatment, the delayed social and healthcare reform, and personnel shortages. Finland also allocates less funding to healthcare compared to Western European countries,"" states senior expert Anna-Mari Aalto.  ""There is no single solution to this complex situation. The new well-being regions now have the opportunity to develop the service structure of their regions and seek solutions to improve service availability,"" Aalto adds.  The survey portion of the ""Terve Suomi"" study invited 61,600 randomly selected individuals aged 20 or older from various parts of Finland to participate. The sample was constructed in a manner that allows for generalization of the results to the whole of Finland and the well-being regions. Of those invited to the study, 46 percent responded to the survey between September 2022 and March 2023.  Data from 2018 and 2020 is based on the FinSote study conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).  HT"

The Moderator of the Church of Scotland General Assembly, the Rt Rev Iain Greenshields, the Vice President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Scotland, Bishop John Keenan, and the Imam of Dundee Central Mosque, Imam Shaykh Hamza Khandwalla, will hold a meeting with MSPs at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday to express their opposition.  During their meeting, hosted by the Logos Scotland think thank, they will sign a statement voicing their ""deep concern"" over the proposals and urging MSPs to vote them down.  The statement says that assisted suicide undermines human dignity and puts pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.  ""Our faith traditions are united in the principle that assisted dying in itself inevitably undermines the dignity of the human person, and to allow it would mean that our society as a whole loses its common humanity,"" the statement says.  ""The Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques remain firm in their opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia.""  The latest campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide is being led by Liam McArthur, Lib Dem MSP for Orkney, whose Member's Bill would allow competent terminally ill adults to request assistance to end their life.  The faith leaders add in their joint statement, ""The ways in which similar laws in other countries are being applied, and the effect that its introduction would have on some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the disabled and the elderly, would be extremely detrimental.""  The statement ends with a call to MSPs ""to consider carefully the implications of this Bill, to express their concerns, and to vote against it"".  Bishop Keenan said: ""Assisted suicide attacks human dignity and results in human life being increasingly valued on the basis of its efficiency and utility. Implicit in legal assisted suicide is that an individual can lose their value and worth.  ""Evidence from countries where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal shows that vulnerable people feel pressured to end their lives through fear of being a burden. In such situations the option of assisted suicide is less about having a 'right' to die and more about feeling the full weight and expectation of a duty to die.  ""When vulnerable people, including the elderly and poor, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.""  Rev Greenshields said: ""Our opposition to assisted dying is based on our Christian faith, and involves concerns around the principle of assisted dying, around the application of the law in practice, the perception of the value of human lives, and also the effect which any change is likely to have on the provision of care - in particular, on palliative care."""

The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh."

Sreeranjini (38), widow of Prakash, from Nediyamkode, Dhanuvachapuram, Parassala, threatened to jump off the wall into the nearby 30 foot-deep cemetery compound as the authorities continued to neglect her demand.  Prakash, who had served as a temporary watchman for 14 years at the Karakkonam, Vellarada, Udayankulangara, and Balaramapuram branches under the District Co-operative Bank, committed suicide three years ago. Sreeranjini had applied for compassionate appointment at the bank and visited the bank’s Udayankulangara branch and headquarters numerous times but in vain.  She reached the bank's headquarters on Tuesday as a last-ditch attempt. However, the security pesonnel refused to let her in. An upset Sreeranjini then began to cry uncontrollably, stating that she has no other means to take care of her two children. She waited in front of the bank. Finally, when the employees came out and locked the entrance after the day’s work, she suddenly scaled the high compound wall and threatened to jump.  The shocked employees tried to pacify her, but she ignored their pleas. Finally, police and fire force personnel rushed in and brought her down half an hour later after assuring her of appropriate action.  “There is no means for me to earn a living. Both my children are currently at asylums. I am frequenting the office desperately to get a job for the last one year. Initially, they assured to give me the job without any delay. Now they have gone back on their words. I have to bring back the children and take care of them. My struggle is for the same,” she said."

Guests who dined at Applebee’s had 20% of the cost of their meal donated back to the American Foundation For Suicide Prevention, resulting in a $700 donation as part of the Applebee’s Dining to Donate program. Other donations were received from raffle ticket sales.  LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT  Performers came together to showcase their talents, while spokespersons from community organizations offered information about resources available for those who are struggling with mental health.  The goal of the evening was to put suicide and mental illness in the spotlight and to encourage conversations about how to come to the aid of those who are who need assistance.  Performers for the evening included local stand-up comedian Jane Joan Costagliola, violinist Comfort Cat, singers Madison Burkhart, Joey Escribano, Thomas DeVito, Christian Gueits, Miss Richmond County Madison Gattullo, Miss Staten Island Outstanding Teen Nadia Anwar, Jenny Pisani, Victoria Billalba, and poets Alana Light, Matt Germoso, Andrew Littlefield and Thomas Fucaloro.  Organizations in attendance included the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), United Activities Unlimited (UAU), the Tackling Youth Substance Abuse (TYSA) coalition, the Department of Veteran Affairs, Venture House, and the Pride Center of Staten Island.  Those in attendance also received “The Magician’s Project” stickers that contained a QR code created to share free resources and educational material on suicide and mental illness, and a way for people to make donations to AFSP.  As the event came to a close, founder Felicia Gambino, announced “The Magician’s Project” will partner with AFSP and she will serve as chairperson of AFSP’s Staten Island Committee.  The initiative will work with AFSP to organize Staten Island’s Walk Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention Walk on Sept. 23 at Cloves Lake Park in Sunnyside. Funds raised during the walk will be reinvested into local Staten Island mental health organizations and community centers.  Those interested in joining the walk should visit afsp.org"

The episode, titled “Egosurfing,” (spoilers ahead) focuses on Akane, an aspiring actress who is part of the reality show Aqua is on. Feeling the pressure to perform better for the audience, Akane strikes her co-star and ends up being bullied online which leads her to become suicidal. The message on HIDIVE states that Oshi no Ko is a work of fiction, but encourages everyone who is struggling with mental health to reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. While TV networks and streaming services in the US are not required by law to include these warnings in their content, they are heavily encouraged due to possible negative consequences the content may have on viewers.  The events in the episode carry a stark similarity to the Hana Kimura case. Kimura was a part of the Terrace House reality TV show in 2020. One of the episodes showed her getting into a fight with another cast member and the altercation was shown to the public. Kimura became a target of online bullying and later committed suicide. The show was canceled. Her mother, Kyoko Kimura, sued Fuji TV and two other producers of the show in December 2022, claiming that the scenes were edited to make her daughter appear in a bad light. She accused them of treating the contestants as dispensable. In a separate case in May 2021, a court ordered a man to pay Kyoko Kimura 1.29 million yen in damages for posting hateful messages about Hana after her death.  Oshi no Ko anime premiered this April with a 90-minute episode. Studio Doga Kobo is animating the series, which is proving to be one of the biggest hits of the season. YOASOBI is singing the opening theme song “Idol” while QUEEN Bee is performing the ending song titled “Mephisto.”  The anime is based on a manga written by Aka Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love Is War) with art by Mengo Yokoyari. The manga began serialization in 2020 in the Weekly Young Jump magazine. The story focuses on the dark side of the entertainment industry. Yen Press licensed it in English.  HIDIVE is simulcasting Oshi no Ko anime with English subtitles every Wednesday. The English dub is slated to premiere on May 24. The platform describes the plot as:  Dr. Goro is reborn as the son of the young starlet Ai Hoshino after her delusional stalker murders him. Now, he wants to help his new mother rise to the top, but what can a child do about the dark underbelly of the entertainment industry?  © Akasaka Aka x Mengo Yokoyari / Shueisha / Oshi no Ko Production Committee"

On May 13, Leah Moses found out that her son, Om Moses Gandhi, 16, was shot and killed by Leah’s ex-husband Parth Gandhi in Sugarhouse. Leah said she tried to warn law enforcement, child protective service, and the courts that her ex-husband was an abuser for over 15 years.  Leah is an advocate against domestic violence and is on the board for Safe Harbor in Davis County, as well as Utah Domestic Violence Coalition. She has worked on the Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act (a.k.a. “Kayden’s Law”) for the past year.  Leah said she hopes that by passing “Kayden’s Law,” other children will be saved, and has asked others to contact their legislatures requesting they support it. She says she wants to make sure her son’s death was not in vain but would result in systemic change.  Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.  Those who would like to support Om’s legacy can donate to his memorial fund via GoFundMe. This fund will be used to help pass Kayden’s Law and expand the Safe Harbor Crisis Center, the only domestic violence and sexual assault survivor service in Davis County.  According to the GoFundMe page, before Om’s passing, he was a kind and thoughtful young man. He was also reportedly a talented musician and enjoyed playing basketball, camping, kayaking, and math.

What no one knew was that my husband had Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia. He had been admitted to the psychiatric ward twice when he was at the peak of his career. I was working hard to make ends meet as bipolar disorder had made my husband go on an excessive spending spree which had thrown the family finances into jeopardy. But nowhere, in this whole melee was the love lost. One night we all celebrated my birthday. We went to bed past midnight, but the next morning only I got up. He slept forever.”  Kiran calls herself a ‘suicide leftover’. Her husband died in 2019. Her in-laws blamed her for their son’s death. Rage and guilt engulfed her. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment,” recalls Kiran. “I couldn’t remember things. I was directionless. From an overachiever and a super organized multi-tasker, I began shirking work and responsibilities.”  Three years have since passed, but Kiran is still unable to extricate herself from guilt and shame.  Also read: “Bipolar Disorder will change your life but you can navigate around it”: A first-person account  As Priti Sridhar, Executive Director, Mariwala Health Initiative, writes in the research study Suicide Prevention: Changing the Narrative: “For each person that dies by suicide, about 60 others are impacted by the bereavement, and 20 go on to attempt suicide. This is undeniably a public health crisis of epic proportions.” The report is a collaborative effort of the Mariwala Health Initiative and India Development Review, released in 2023.  According to the 2022 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total of 1,64,033 suicides were reported in the country in 2021, an increase of 7.2% in comparison to 2020. The age group of 18 to 30 years and from 30 to 45 years accounted for 34.5% and 31.7% of total suicides, respectively. A significant proportion of these individuals were students. It is estimated that in 2021 about 13,039 students died by suicide.  Why does suicide affect those left behind with guilt? > Because one believes that they failed to listen to the person who died by suicide. > Guilt comes from the mistaken belief that we should have, or could have, prevented the death from happening. >They see suicide as their inadequacy. > Feel embarrassed for the person who died by suicide. The dead is often labelled as weak, failure, and quitter. Such labels further weaken the person suffering from guilt. > Unsolved issues with the dead also give rise to guilt. (Counsellors and therapists recommend that the loved ones of the deceased should accept the truth that some things are beyond their control.)  Kiran (name changed, pixelated) calls herself a ‘suicide leftover. Her husband died in 2019. “I was consumed by guilt, anger and embarrassment”.  “My sister was three years older than me, studying computer science at a private institute in NOIDA,” says Moushami, who was 18 years old then and considered her elder sister as her best friend. “We had a healthy sibling relationship. We loved doing things together. We fought, bullied each other, and cried together. It was 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic, when my sister suddenly died by suicide. She was 21.”  The elder sister was good at studies and wanted to go abroad to pursue post-graduation. “But one night she put a full stop to everything,” recalls Moushami. “She jumped from the 12th floor of a multi-storey building”.  After her sister’s death, Moushami went into shock. “I was suddenly overtaken by the feeling of betrayal,” she says. “I wanted answers to unanswerable questions: Why did she kill herself? Was life that unbearable? Why did she not even think about me?”  Shame and stigma  Moushami and her family suffered in silence. “Because of shame and stigma, my family never shared the incident with others. We were not even allowed to discuss it at home. I had my solitary conversations. It is just a few months back when I joined college that I opened up. Some friends suggested joining a support group. I felt light after sharing my grief with unknown people in Swayam Hope Café, a support group,” says a teary-eyed Moushami.  Conversations around suicides are laced with stigma and myths. Says Dr Shashi Rai, Consultant Psychiatrist, Director Sambal Drug De-Addiction and Psychiatric Centre Indira Nagar, Lucknow: “There’s a general belief that suicide is the result of mental illness. The fact is there are various socio-economic factors and family expectations inter-connected with suicides.”  Exam pressure, unemployment, discrimination and financial issues are some of the major factors for suicides. The NCRB lists family problems as the primary cause of nearly one-third of suicides in India.  According to experts, death by suicide cannot be seen in isolation. It is complicated, complex, intersectional and inter-sectoral. Says Dr Kalyanasundaram, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Hon. Advisor Richmond Fellowship Society, Bangalore: “People look for easy gratification and quick fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Read more: Loneliness: An urban epidemic that carries the same risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day!  “People look for easy gratification and quick-fix solutions. Social media has compounded the issues and there is hardly any support system. Even families fail to understand the person who is contemplating suicide.”  Pic courtesy: Dr Kalyanasundaram  Suicide leaves behind a heavy toll on families and friends. “After my husband’s death by suicide, I found myself friendless,” says Kiran. “Some friends did reach out to me via social media. But I had no one with whom I could chat and have a cup of coffee. To change my environment, I changed my job. But I couldn’t hang out with new colleagues. I felt alienated. My life sucked till I discovered a support group. Finally, somewhere I redeemed myself of guilt.”  Somewhat similar is the experience of Ritu, based in Chandigarh. Her husband died by suicide in 2008. He shot himself. “For a long time, I suffered from guilt, in silence and blamed myself for not understanding his comments about suicide,” says Ritu. “He used to eulogise suicide and often regretted being trapped in a financial mess, having suffered heavy losses in his business. I merely tried to encourage him to see the positive side of life. But now when I remember his statements, I blame myself for not understanding the hidden meaning of his words.”  She feels that she should have forced him to see a therapist when he began to show anxiety symptoms. She was a homemaker when her husband died. Today, she handles the business and simultaneously conducts life coaching workshops. “I encourage my clients to always stand beside their loved ones and never be ashamed to seek counselling sessions.”  Warning Signs of Suicide Often talking or writing about death, dying or suicide.  Making comments about being hopeless, a failure or worthless. Using expressions such as, ‘I am a failure’ or saying, ‘I’m trapped,’ or expressing the feeling of being a ‘burden.’  Increased alcohol and/or drug use.  Withdrawal from friends, family and community.  Frequent mood changes. (Source: National Institute of Mental Health.  Website: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/warning-signs-of-suicide)  Sharing and listening  Suicide is preventable. Talking about suicide often helps a person who is thinking about suicide feel less alone.  “I met her at the World Book Fair while browsing through a book on mental health,” says 30-year-old Varun (name changed). “We both began to chat and in our conversation, we shared how we both had been ideating about life and suicide. Sharing made us feel less alone and more understood. We talk every other day now.”  “Sharing helps people feel less isolated and overwhelmed, it pauses their thoughts about suicide,” Says Dr Rai, “It reduces stress.”  While agreeing that sharing is vital, Dr Kalyanasundaram adds: “Youngsters look for peer validation. They are unable to handle peer and academic pressure. We should have proper mechanisms for help and guidance.”  Top of the list  At present, India is at the top of the list in suicide deaths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one Indian is lost to suicide every three minutes. With 419 suicides per day or 1,53,052 suicides annually, India has the most suicides globally.  Under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), world leaders agreed to decrease suicide deaths by a third by 2030. The question is what are we doing about it? Are we promoting interventions at various socio-cultural levels?  The need of the hour is to change the narratives of suicide. Though the Mental Care Health Act 2017 decriminalises suicide, hardly anything has been done to destigmatise it or encourage more suicide support groups or suicide first aid responders in colleges and workplaces.

In addition, the Golden State will pay $300,000 in legal fees to settle an action brought in 2022 by the Christian Medical & Dental Association and Dr. Leslee Cochrane, a California-licensed hospice physician and CMDA member.  The challenge came after Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021 signed Senate Bill 380, which shortened the time between separate “oral requests” for “aid-in-dying” medication from 15 days to 48 hours. It required all physicians to document such requests, even those who hold moral objections to the practice.  Objecting doctors would have had to “educate” patients about procedures and medicines that would assist in suicide attempts under the existing statute and provide referrals to other providers.  In September, a federal district court in California ruled the state couldn’t force physicians to participate in such actions.  Kevin Theriot, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which sued on behalf of Dr. Cochrane and CMDA, said the 2021 legislation upended previously enacted conscience guarantees.  “They had great protection in the original assisted-suicide statute,” he said in a telephone interview. “And then they recently amended it to take away some of that protection. Most people agree, and in the original legislation [California] agreed the government doesn’t have any business forcing doctors to participate in procedures like taking human life.”  He said a subsequent “legislature didn’t heed that warning and so we had to file a lawsuit to be able to protect the rights of physicians in California.”  Under the settlement order issued by federal Central District Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha, state officials are barred from issuing “any criminal or civil punishment, including professional discipline or licensing sanction for a California-licensed physician’s refusal or failure” to document a request for “medical aid-in-dying,” provide information about such services apart from saying the physician does not provide them, or refer a patient to another provider.  The state can still require objecting physicians to “transfer a patient’s relevant medical record upon request” to another provider.  California is not the only state to reconsider protections for physicians who object to the procedure on conscience grounds. In April, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, enacted legislation protecting doctors’ conscience rights in that state, ending an ADF lawsuit there.  Mr. Theriot said the nonprofit legal organization is “looking at some potential lawsuits that in states that allow assisted suicide right now,” and “will likely be filing one in the coming days.”  The Washington Times has contacted the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta for comment.  • Mark A.

In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan. For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt. But new research has uncovered a clue, or marker, in the brain that could be used to identify people at a higher risk of ending their life.  In a paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history. The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author on the paper. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact. Researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders ​​(TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  Jagger-Rickels says the findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health."

Photo: Xinhua  Local police in Indonesia on Wednesday confirmed the suspicious deaths of two Chinese tourists in a local hotel, which has drawn wide attention on Chinese social media and sparked speculation over the cause of death.According to Denpasar Police, the 25-year-old victim Li Chiming beat, tied up and immersed his girlfriend, 22-year-old, Cheng Jianan, in a bathtub at the Jimbaran Intercontinential Hotel, local news outlet NusaBali reported on Wednesday.Then Li ""committed suicide by injuring himself using broken beer bottles on his neck and all over his body,"" NusaBali quoted local police chief as saying.The conclusion of murder and suicide was based on the results of internal and external examinations by a forensic doctor at Prof IGNG Ngoerah Hospital Denpasar and the results of the Bali Police Forensic Laboratory.The lovers had involved in an argument before arriving at the hotel, they shared five bottles of beer that they ordered from room service, according to investigators.The police questioned witnesses, both hotel guests and hotel employees, and reviewed CCTV footage, cellphones belonging to the two victims as well as checking the scene of the incident, another local outlet in Indonesian language Bali Tribune reported.The shocking case was revealed on May 1 when Li, the male, was found naked covered in blood with wounds all over his body, including two major wounds on his neck and left leg. Cheng was found dead lying in the bathtub in their room 4223, naked with strangle marks.Their belongings were all accounted for and no witnesses or CCTV showed anybody entering room 4223 except the room service person who only stayed very shortly before Li came out of the room for once, according to local police.The Wednesday police press briefing claimed that Cheng had scratch wounds on her forehead, right shoulder, forearm, lower leg and knees. There are line-shaped scratches on her neck and foam in her nose and mouth, leading to the conclusion that Cheng was badly beaten before dying from drowning in the bathtub.Li had more than 20 wounds on the neck, left chest, back of both hands, left wrist, back of both feet and allegedly died of loss of blood caused by injuries to his neck.The investigation results prompted doubt and questioning on Chinese social media as some netizens challenged that Li, if wanted to commit suicide, would not have run into the hotel hallway, which many interpreted as a call for help. People holding a different view said perhaps he injured himself and felt regret before he bled to death.Other questionable points included the fact that Li sustained a large number of wounds prior to suicide. With others contending that if it was indeed a murder suicide, the two had no reason to be naked; using a piece of glass to commit suicide is painful and is not a typical means of taking one's life.Netizens called for more details to be released to further dispel the doubts, including how the victims involved in an argument and proof of the man's homicide and suicide motivation."

Nancy Paloma Collins, therapist director of Paloma Therapy, points out that 73% of people who identify as transgender have high anxiety, and more than 50% suffer from depression.  In the past year, one in five transgender youth has attempted suicide, according to figures from the Trevor Project.  ""A person who is gay or lesbian, for example, might say, 'I'm going to tell my friends, then my parents, and then I'm going out into the world,'"" Collins said. ""A young transgender man is totally different. As soon as they come out and the physical changes begin, the discrimination begins, the rejection.""  Although Alejandre faced rejection on the street, he never experienced it in his home. His mother was always aware of his well-being.  ""My mom supported me immediately,"" Alejandre said. ""She was the person, [that she] came when she called, that she picked me up from a situation where I felt very lost, like she wanted to commit suicide.""  A Trevor Project survey highlights that having at least one accepting adult can reduce the risk of suicide attempts among LGBTQ youth by 40%.  When the road seemed to end, Alejandre sought help and received therapy for 10 years.  Mental Health Services in Los Angeles County"

Angela Ganzer-Bovitz, Director of Behavioral Health Inpatient with Genesis Health System, and Cecilia Bailey, Director at Quad Cities Open Network, talk about the 2021 Quad Cities Health Assessment’s mental health results. The analysis shows that the metro area has significantly higher rates of suicide than do the entire states of Illinois or Iowa (or even the entire U.S.).  An average of 53 Quad Cities’ residents die of suicide every year.  This led to the launching of Zero Suicide Initiative QC. The initiative is a collaboration between the Zero Suicide Institute and the Quad Cities Behavioral Health Coalition in an effort to lower suicide rates and make systemic change within our community.  The project’s mission statement is that “suicide is preventable” and they provide free training for individuals to be a part of the solution. Proper training better equips people to recognize the warning signs of suicide, how to talk to the person in crisis, and how to refer them for ongoing help.  It’s free to participate in the initiative’s Q-P-R training. Just like CPR, QPR is an emergency response to someone in crisis and can save lives.  QPR stands for Question, Persuade, Refer.

(KFOR) – It has been just over two weeks since a convicted sex offender is said to have murdered five children and his wife of less than a year. Search warrants are slowly being returned, now giving a possible motive for the killings, but also depicting false information.  According to the Okmulgee County District Court Clerk’s Office, eight search warrants involving Jesse McFadden have been issued, but only three have been returned so far.  The first search warrant was issued at 1:25 p.m. on May 1, the same day seven bodies were discovered on a Henryetta property.  Once the initial search warrant was obtained, law enforcement claims they found the “front door was ajar.”  That returned search warrant shows photographs, a State Farm drive safe token, and miscellaneous receipts were the only pieces of evidence found and seized from Jesse McFadden’s property on May 1.  An Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office Investigator added a white Chevrolet Avalanche was impounded by a Beggs, Oklahoma wrecker service.  The vehicle had a “No-Touch Hold” on it.  Records show law enforcement then seized eight pieces of evidence from the vehicle on May 8 once OSBI had already taken over:  Eight latent print cards from Avalanche processing; five palm and three fingerprint  Four pairs of swabs from exterior door handles, four interior door handles, steering wheel from Avalanche  Route 66 lanyard with two brinks keys on ring  Straw from driver’s side flat lid cup  Straw from passenger side cup dome lid  Purchase receipts x3 from Avalanche processing on May 8  Two McDonald’s McCafe cups  DVD with Avalanche processing photos on May 8  In the same set of search warrants is false information.  “Your affiant was made aware of a missing persons case involving a 14 year old female, named Tiffany Guess,” records show.  Court documents also indicate there was an Amber Alert pushed out for Tiffany Guess and Ivy Webster.  Both of those statements are inaccurate.  There was a “Missing and Endangered” alert for Ivy Webster and Brittany Brewer. Tiffany Guess was not included in the push notification.

Court records also show Tiffany’s father was interviewed on McFadden’s property by Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents about the additional items of interest he found inside the home.  “The subject described the items to be clothing and personal belongings of the deceased victims,” the report shows.  Ivy Webster’s dad, Justin said that’s also not true.  He claims he was the one interviewed on McFadden’s property.  McFadden’s rental property is several acres wide, but three different street numbers have been recorded.  Documents show Tiffany lived at 14317 Holly Road. It shows Ivy was spending the night at 14360 Holly Road. The mailbox outside of McFadden’s property has 14600 as the street number.  The mailbox outside of Jesse McFadden’s rental home.

No other cell phone pinging on or near McFadden’s property has been reported thus far.  The local storage unit Guess appeared to be making monthly payments to was also searched.  Law enforcement was made aware of the storage unit on May 6, according to records.  This is just one day after News 4 aired a story about the potential evidence left behind by law enforcement, including a check made out to the storage facility.  Records show nothing was seized from the unit.  “Based off what we were told is there was really just like, pool supplies and that was all that was in that storage unit, so there was no real concern,” stated Justin.  Justin told KFOR since OSBI took over his daughter’s investigation, there has been a steady stream of information.  “We’re being updated and it’s good communication, and I’m very grateful for it,” said Justin.  Before the OSBI took over, records show the Okmulgee Police Department was the lead on this case and only asked OSBI for “partial assistance.”  News 4 has been made aware of two hard drives, drug paraphernalia, two laptops, two tablets, a check, a 9mm gun, bullet casings, and nine cell phones recovered from McFadden’s property.  The Webster family told KFOR they feel as if the opportunity to grieve over Ivy has been stripped away from them because they’re constantly looking for answers and accepting tips from the public.  “I just feel like I need to keep fighting and keep digging and keep digging to get answers. And that’s my motivation right now and not just answers for us, but answers for other victims that might be out there,” stated Justin.  A possible motive revealed in court records is McFadden telling his mother the evening of April 30 that he was not going back to prison and had decided to kill himself.  Officials were asked during a press conference about McFadden’s possible motive, but they declined to speculate.  News 4 asked the State Medical Examiner’s Office for comment on May 8, but were told, “Our agency does not answer questions regarding cases or scenes.”  We have continued asking questions and filing Open Records Requests with the Okmulgee Sheriff’s Office.  Proof of one home compliance check at McFadden’s property was emailed last week.  Jesse McFadden’s only home compliance check. Photo courtesy: Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office.

If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline available 24/7.  COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Suicide deaths climbed in Ohio in 2021, ending a two-year decline witnessed in years prior, according to new data from the state Department of Health.  As the 12th-leading cause of death in Ohio, suicide accounted for the deaths of 1,766 Ohioans in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before, the department said Friday in its 2021 Suicide Demographics and Trends report. That means about five Ohioans – up from four in 2020 – died by suicide every day.  “We’ve got to reduce that number,” said Tony Coder, executive director of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation. “We’ve got to get that down to four, then to three, then to two, then to one every day – and hopefully put me out of business.”  The statewide rise in suicide deaths mirrors trends at both the local and national levels, with Franklin County recording a 10% jump in suicide deaths from 2020 to 2021 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recording a 4.79% rise across the U.S. during the same period.  Between the coronavirus pandemic, financial hardships, and social unrest experienced across the U.S., Coder said 2021 took a toll on the mental health of Ohioans, likely attributing to the rise in suicides.  “Two years ago, it’s kind of hard to remember, but there were some folks that were losing their jobs, businesses were struggling, just the lack of being able to see each other in person was something that really took an impact on folks,” he said.  But with the right help, Coder said suicide is preventable. While Ohio loses five people to suicide every day, another 35 are checking into emergency rooms daily for treatment after a suicide attempt, he said.  “Those are 35 people that are seeking help and getting the care that they need,” Coder said. “That’s where I hope that we can also see, that for all of the hopelessness that this report might show, there’s a lot of hope out there for folks if they get the care that they deserve.”  Demographics  White people had the largest increase, 7%, in the rate of suicide deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Department of Health. The rate among Black Ohioans – though it has steadily increased since 2012 – stayed largely the same in 2021.  Despite making up just under half of Ohio’s population, men accounted for 81% of suicide deaths in 2021, the report found. Those aged 75 and older had the highest suicide rate relative to other age groups. Among women, the rate was highest within the 45 to 54-year-old age bracket.  Suicide continued to be the second-leading cause of death among Ohioans ages 10 to 34 years in 2021, and during that year, 24 children between 10 and 14 years old died by suicide.  As for method, firearms were the No. 1 mechanism for completing a suicide among both men and women, with guns accounting for 991 deaths in Ohio in 2021 – a 10% increase from the year before. Coder said one data point that surprised him was the 22% rise in suicide deaths by drug poisoning.  “We have not seen that type of increase before,” he said.  Rural communities, which historically have lacked access to mental health resources, were hit hardest by suicide in 2021, the report found. Of the 15 counties with the highest rates of suicide death, 14 are considered rural.  “If you get into Jackson, Gallia counties down by the Ohio River, you might have to travel a county or two just to find somebody to seek care from,” Coder said. “It’s literally an access to care issue that needs to be addressed.”  Ohio’s suicide prevention plan  In 2020, the state partnered with Coder’s organization, the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, to create the Suicide Prevention Plan for Ohio. Since then, the state has implemented awareness programs like Life Side Ohio for gun owners, a 988 suicide and crisis hotline, and the Ohio School Wellness Initiative to prevent and address suicide in schools.  Gov. Mike DeWine, who has made funding for mental health a priority during his administration, proposed the allocation of millions of dollars in the fiscal year 2024-25 budget, including:  $46.5 million for the continued operation of the 988 hotline  $8 million to continue and expand the state’s 2020 Suicide Prevention Plan  $100 million to create the State of Ohio Action for Resiliency Network, or SOAR, to develop and implement mental health and addiction prevention, treatment and recovery  $50 million for pediatric behavioral health workforce and developing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities  “Most of this funding is sent directly to local communities and will be used to increase the number of Ohioans trained to help people build skills to bounce back from difficult life events and to reduce stigma so people can ask for help without shame,” Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Director Lori Criss said in a statement.  Ultimately, Coder said it’s important that those considering suicide – and those impacted by suicide – recognize that they are not alone and recovery is possible.  “We can get help; we can have hope,” he said. “And that’s what I hope our message is: You don’t feel like you’re on an island, you don’t feel like you’re all alone.”"

Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford.]  By Catharin Shepard • Editor • If you’re worried someone is suicidal, the first step to helping may be just to ask the question.  That was a key takeaway from the county’s first suicide prevention symposium, Hoke County Health Department Social Work Supervisor Isley Cotton said.  “Ask the question. You can’t be afraid to ask the question, and you have to be intentional. You can’t dance around it, you can’t use fluffier words,” she said. “If you think a person is having issues with suicidal thoughts, ask them directly, that’s the main thing.”  The Health Department hosted the suicide prevention symposium Friday evening at the Robert A. Wright Agriculture Building in Raeford. The evening featured a panel discussion with a group of mental health professionals, plus testimonials from survivors and people who experienced losing someone to suicide.  Being able to talk about a difficult topic that is often taboo was “refreshing,” Cotton said.  “For me tonight was refreshing because the topic that is so stigmatized in our community, to be able to just talk about suicide in an open, safe space, really was refreshing for me and for the community. There are so many people who came out who would probably not be that comfortable speaking about suicide in other settings,” she said.  Members of the local faith community, elected officials, healthcare providers and many others attended the event, which packed the room for the evening. Vendors set up tables with information about services and mental health treatment options, as well as information about suicide prevention. One vendor came all the way from South Carolina to attend the event.  Raising awareness about suicide prevention was a big goal of the symposium.  “Awareness is the first thing. We want people to know it is okay to not be okay, as so many people said…and for them to know there is help and there is hope,” Cotton said. “I think sometimes we devalue ‘brain pain,’ because it’s not like a body ache.”  Sometimes people can end up in a place where they feel ending their life is the only way to end the pain, but “we heard something different tonight,” Cotton said.  “I just hope that this event fostered a sense of community among everyone, and they know that we’re all here to support each other. We’re in it together, we can’t do it without each other.”  The event grew out of a suicide prevention team established at the Hoke Health Department through grant funding. It was a team effort between the Health Department and several other health agencies.  The Health Department works to address suicide prevention in a number of other ways, too.  “We have a firearm safety team we have started at the Health Department, which we are connected to so many people. And that’s the thing, fostering the connection, so that we all know who is in the room, who does what, and we can make adequate referrals,” Cotton said.  For more information on suicide prevention, contact the Hoke County Health Department at (910) 875-3717."

Problems highlighted in Kentucky include high suicide rates, too many people without health insurance, no health literacy, lack of access to programs and providers who can help them, as well as gaps in follow-up mental health care.  “I wish people knew they are making it harder than it has to be. I wish people could see it as a healthcare issue that could save lives,” pleaded Dr. Christopher Peters, medical director of Norton Children’s Behavioral and Mental Health Clinic.  “We are still unraveling how the pandemic is playing out in youth. What happens when we put a pause on a crucial developmental time? They have anxiety, and depression, so access to more treatment is absolutely needed.”  The community is struggling to meet the needs of citizens and Kentucky’s youth are being impacted most.”  “They believe in Frankfurt that acceptance is killing kids, that we are the problem. They want to shove us back into the closet,” said panelist Chris Hartman, Director of the Fairness Campaign. “The bills are geared towards eradicating the LGBTQ presence… The worst bills are concentrated in the Deep Red South. It’s no surprise because they see more queer youth than ever before that they think we are recruiting.”  Panelist Carmellia Jackson Hurley, Executive Director of Louisville Girls Leadership, ensured, “These kids know themselves better than anyone else. I wish people knew the students know themselves better than we ever could. And I wish we could just help and guide them.”  “There’s a belief that the LGBTQ community is indoctrinating our youth,” said Hartman. “No, queer people have always been there… The actions in Frankfurt are teaching children to demonize another community.”  Essentially the laws being passed serve to legalize bullying. Many of the bills are often dubbed “Parents Rights Bills” and are touted as ways to protect children, but whose children are they protecting?  At a student-led rally in Frankfort, a Kentucky student who tried to take their own life publicly pleaded with the crowd and lawmakers to not pass a law that would subject others to more suffering. A 2022 survey conducted by The Trevor Project’s 2022 revealed 50% of LGBTQ teens seriously considered attempting suicide and 18% (twice the rate of non-LGBTQ teens) did attempt suicide.  “People in Frankfurt don’t know any queer people. They are making these laws so they can put a bullet point on their postcard to send out in the fall. They know it will score them cheap, easy points. Is a 3% bump worth a kid’s life? It’s not worth one single life,” said Hartman.  “Queers Gathering joyfully is going to prevent suicides… They want to eliminate the places where we gather joyfully. Events are getting get canceled because of threats of violence… If they’re racist, they are going to be transphobic and homophobic. It goes back to the intersectionality of racism, sexism, homophobia.”  Over the past year, protesters in Kentucky were often met by supporters of the anti-trans bill, like Conservative Family Foundation, who show up and hold their own rallies alongside protests. The Family Foundation and other supporters of the bill say it protects children from “irreparable harm” and safeguards parents’ rights.  “SB 150 will protect the lives of Kentucky children by setting policy in alignment with the truth that every child is created as a male or female and deserves to be loved, treated with dignity, and accepted for who they really are,” Family Foundation leader David Walls said in a statement, calling the override “a win for children and their parents in Kentucky.”  The panel also expressed the need for more spiritual and religious leaders to speak out. These hateful worldviews often have an underpinning of religious views.  “We must make people own up when they are not supportive,” encouraged Hartman. “If that’s how you feel, own it. Say it. Call them out. Don’t allow others to be compliant.”  Other potential solutions to the current disconnect in our city include pooling of resources.  “Louisville is a resource-dense area, but nobody knows. Here in Louisville, people are stuck in their own silos; everyone is doing the same thing. We need to step up and build community, maintain community and put egos aside,” said Jackson-Hurley.  Another step in the right direction is the 911 diversion program where people can call 911 and get someone other than the police with firearms to show up and help.  “We’ve got to make ourselves available and be a lifeline to others when they need it so that they can be there for us when we need it,” Hartman said.  “How can we help folks feel less isolated, rejected? How can we help people who have a mental diagnosis receive help and treatment? How can we keep weapons locked up and put away so those at risk have less access to the things that can kill them?” Peters asked.  Some of the reasons why people commit suicide are because ‘they feel rejected and isolated. Mental illness impacts how they see themselves and the world around them.”  Commuter cities and sprawl cities like Louisville suffer from the dynamic where nobody knows where the resources are.  When asked what can we do to combat this, the panel encouraged the public to share Fairness Campaign posts, articles and other information on social media to amplify what’s going on. Use your point of privilege and create a space of grace.  The panel was hosted by Queer Kentucky, in partnership with the Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness Division of Suicide Prevention, The Big Stomp, The Fairness Campaign, and Louisville Girls Leadership.  The results of this session will be shared with the Suicide Prevention Department of Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness. They will guide Queer Kentucky on implementing two public events addressing this topic.  Follow @QueerKentucky on social media for more upcoming events."

But when in-person learning resumed the following school year, the lawsuit charges Fitzpatrick was harassed, intimidated and bullied by other students because of his gender identity, and school officials did nothing to help, causing Fitzpatrick’s death by suicide on Nov. 7.  Fitzpatrick’s mother, Danielle Warshefski, is now suing the Manville school district for negligence – alleging officials failed to stop the bullying.  “Fitzpatrick has been severely injured as a result of such harassment and discrimination that he suffered physical and bodily injuries, severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, anguish, personal hardship, social disruption, psychological and emotional harm, and other such damages which ultimately led to plaintiff Fitzpatrick taking his life as a result of such harassment and discrimination,” the lawsuit filed May 2 in Superior Court of Somerset County.  The students harassed Fitzpatrick by calling him “f*****,” referring to him as “she”, attempting to make a mockery of his gender, pushing him into lockers, and telling Fitzpatrick that he would never be a male, the lawsuit said.  R. Daniel Bause, the attorney representing the family, did not return requests for comment. But he told mycentraljersey.com, “In our opinion, the current system let Myles down, and we look forward to proving the allegations contained in the lawsuit to hopefully effectuate positive change in that regard.”  Manville Superintendent Jamil Maroun said in an email that he could not comment on pending litigation.  “Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving for Myles’ family, the students who were his friends, and the staff members who taught him,” he said.  Fitzpatrick, whose family said in his obituary enjoyed exploring the woods, hiking and camping, was one of four students whose deaths by suicide have made headlines in recent months following allegations of bullying at school.  The others include Jack Reid, who died by suicide on April 30, 2022, at The Lawrenceville School after students bullied him and spread false rumors about him across campus. The school has acknowledged that it failed to protect Reid as part of a settlement in the case; Adriana Kuch, who died by suicide on Feb. 3, days after a video of four classmates attacking her spread around Central Regional High School in Bayville; and Felicia LoAlbo-Melendez, who died by suicide on Feb. 6 after bullying at school, less than two weeks after the death of her father.  One member of the LGBTQ community called Fitzpatrick’s death a tragedy.  “We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of Myles,” said Christian Fuscaraino, the executive director of Garden State Equality, which uplifts the diverse voices of LGBTQ+ communities through education and advocacy. “No student should ever have to face bullying or harassment based on their gender identity. We have to do more to create safe and inclusive school environments for students to learn.”  Thank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.

The moment you become a star, your life does not remain private anymore. Haesoo, a 29-year-old Korean trot singer, has died by suicide in her dormitory on May 12, leaving behind a suicide note. The news of her passing spread quickly among her fans, fellow musicians, and industry insiders, who expressed their condolences on social media.  Back home, after Deepika Padukone’s confession on her struggle with depression, many came out talking about their mental health issues. Actor Tiger Shroff also underwent severe depression after the release of ‘A Flying Jatt’. Shah Rukh Khan also landed up with depression after his shoulder injury. It was also found out after the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, how he too struggled with mental health problems.  According to WHO, which estimates around 20 percent of youth, who suffer from mental health yet, this is just the recorded ones and if we can think about the ones which have not been recorded where I see the numbers increase. Social norms have created more struggles in balancing the physical and psychological health.  The numbers are increasing with cases such as parental pressures, the social pressures to “fit in”, social media and its demands, addictions and peer pressure, disturbed family environment and many more reasons to trigger mental health.  Padma Rewari, Psychotherapist from Mumbai says, “You are scrutinized for every act, every behaviour and never left to be a normal person. This pressure often leads to anxiety, depression, stress and other mental health issues. The celebrity status also makes them lonely and have the fear of missing out(FOMO) where competition and comparison are their daily challenges.”  The stigma around mental health  Physical health is always taken well in society and people will rush to a doctor and spend money. The myth around mental health and the acceptance around it still needs a makeover.  Say Rewari, “People are still not ready to seek professional help and use it as last resort when things turn chronic and so many times leading to suicide. How often as mental health professions we feel this could have been prevented if only the person got help in the right time. The reasons mental health is still not addressed in the global platform is the stigma attached, lack of efficient resources, myth around medication.”  Investing on mental health are some concerns to ponder on and change the mind-set. One would easily talk about suffering from diabetes but one would never openly share about having OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) or anxiety attacks  Rewari explained that due to the environmental triggers, the mental health issues have risen beyond control. The need of the hour is promoting and providing services. Educating hospitals and promoting mental health professionals in corporates, media where there is lot of pressure. I would also encourage stars and celebrities to have personal counsellors appointed and put therapy sessions on priority.  The mental health awareness has improved way beyond what existed years ago. But there has to be a complete global and consistent support and the support systems reaching each part of the society. Mental health hospitals (more in numbers) for chronic patients, addictions, other mental health disorders that need hospitalization in affordable prices.  The pressure of social media and mental health  Youth today are triggered more by social media. They are impatient, restless and peer pressure adds on to their anxiety levels. They want to achieve success before time and failing to do so they are frustrated and depressed. This often leads to addictions. The pressure is built with in and the competition around them. Life style also has a major contribution to play here.  Rewari explains that celebrities and stars who look and sound extremely happy have committed suicide in the past or have had suicidal tendencies. They often tend to supress their emotional pain, stress and anxiety, depression. It is very difficult to quote underlying issues that would have caused the person to end his or her life. So often they seek the solace by substance abuse, alcohol which gives them temporary relief. For them it is a competitive world which they are aware and the society that weighs their success over their failures. This pressure on public versus private life makes them feel helpless at times, leading to depression and that their value in society has no meaning leads to suicidal tendencies and suicide. Families and friends here must immediately seek professional help instead of waiting.  Mental health is as important as physical health  Garnering celebrity peer support works wonders and people should meet on such platforms to share and care. Like the way, Deepika Padukone started her mental health foundation (LLL) and similarly such platforms should be an investment for stars and celebrities to help society and their fellow members in general. The stigma around mental health needs to change. This can only be done by sensitizing, promoting and making it available.  Effects of mental health Issues:  Feelings of anxiety, concern, rage, despair, numbness, or frustration  Appetite, energy, desire, and interest changes  Having trouble focusing and making judgments  Nightmares or issues falling asleep  Physical symptoms include aches and pains, stomachaches, rashes, or headaches  Chronic health issues and mental health concerns becoming worse  Increased alcohol consumption, use of illicit substances and abuse of prescription medicines.

(KELO) — South Dakota had the fifth highest rate of suicide in the U.S. in 2021, according to the CDC.  The state Department of Health says more than 200 South Dakotans died of suicide that year.  Early numbers show suicides were down in South Dakota last year from that 10-year high.  Joel Kaskinen is trying to save lives through his work.  He’s the community engagement manager at Lost&Found, a suicide prevention organization.  He found himself here after working in higher education in Colorado.  “I lost three students to suicide in one year’s time, and I was a first responder to a student suicide. I was there when it happened, witnessed it, performed first aid,” Kaskinen said.  He decided to turn the pain and trauma into action.  “If I can talk about suicide and mental health awareness every single day, my hope is that I’m reaching at least one person through my daily conversations,” Kaskinen said.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month.  Karla Salem is an integrated health therapist with Sanford Health.  “We all have our time that the life just gets too much for us. There’s too much going on, it’s overwhelming, it’s sad, all of those things, but when you start feeling those things on a more regular chronic basis, when you just don’t find as much joy or happiness, you don’t find relief from your pain, those are kind of the indicators that things are getting kind of bad,” Salem said.  Salem says that’s a good time to reach out for help from a medical provider, family, or friend.  Meanwhile, Kaskinen is doing everything he can to stop more tragedies from happening.  “Suicide is preventable, and if we raise awareness of mental health challenges and the warning signs from people who are facing these challenges of feeling suicidal or having ideations if we can normalize those conversations and realize that everyone is just going through a tough time and there is help there and we can prevent this, that’s our goal,” Kaskinen said.  If you’re struggling with mental health or having thoughts of suicide, call 988.  You can find more resources at the Mental Health Fair this Saturday at Levitt at the Falls.  It runs from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m."

Trinity Health Michigan is joining a new nationwide network of hospitals collaborating on suicide prevention that will test methods to detect suicide risk in patients and connect them to the care they need.    Research shows nearly half of people who die by suicide interact with the healthcare system in the month before their death, providing a critical opportunity to save lives.    Julie Goldstein Grumet is the director of the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center. She says healthcare providers will use evidence-based methods to detect suicide risk and collect real-time data, as they would with other health concerns. Grumet said “We get our blood pressure and our weight just to kind of check there’s not an underlying issue – and we need to do the same when it comes to suicide. We need to ask at every visit, every person"".    Grumet added when interventions are used properly, hospitals can reduce suicide rates of people in their care by up to 75%. She said it’s always important to ask people directly if they are considering suicide, and advise them to contact the nationwide Suicide and Crisis Hotline at 9-8-8.    Over the next 14 months, participating hospitals will test and refine innovations to improve the care provided to patients at risk of suicide.    Melissa Tolstyka is the director of behavioral health services at Trinity Health in Ann Arbor and says utilizing the best practices will build confidence in hospital staff that they're providing the best care. She said ""You know you can always ask the question, are you feeling suicidal? But when someone responds, yes, what’s that next step? What can you do to put that patient at ease but also what can you do to feel confident that you can have that conversation?”. Tolstyka says data collection will be imperative to the new network's success and will help staff adjust their methods and treatments along the way.    The latest data reveals suicide claimed roughly 48,000 lives in 2021."

The bodies of Parth Gandhi, 49, and his son, 16, were found on Saturday morning at the offices of Psychedelic Therapy and Research in Salt Lake City, KSLTV reported.  Gandhi worked at the offices as a neuropsychologist and clinic director with a “focus on psychedelics,” the outlet said.  It is unclear exactly what psychedelic therapy involves, or if the clinic advocates the use of illegal substances.  It is also not yet known if psychedelic drugs or other substances were present in Gandhi’s body or that of his son, who has not been named due to his age.  “Our detectives right now, they’re still developing more information trying to figure out, trying to answer the question of what may have motivated him to do this,” Brent Weisberg of the Salt Lake City Police Department told KSLTV on Monday.  Parth Gandhi, 49, was found dead on Saturday. Parth Gandhi/Facebook  The outlet noted that Gandhi mentioned remedies for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse on social media.  He also posted on Facebook in Dec. 2022 to celebrate his son’s musical abilities.  “Just reeling over it — I’m in utter shock. It’s not something I ever see coming from him at all,” Rachel Cieslewicz told FOX13 of the tragedy.  The doctor and his son’s bodies were found in his medical office. Fox13 Now  Police are still looking into the incident. Salt Lake City PD  Cieslewicz said that Gandhi previously taught yoga at her studio, Centered City Yoga.  “We had youth groups at our studio. He would volunteer and teach for free just to help the kids,” she said of the doctor.  Denise Druce told the outlet she also knew Gandhi from her yoga and cycling class at 24-Hour Fitness.  “Until we have more details, I’m going to reserve judgment and just hold a lot of compassion in my heart for the people who are left in the aftermath of this overall,” she said."

Henderson Detention Center located at 18 East Basic Road, Thursday, August 3, 2017. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)  A wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of a man who killed himself at Henderson Detention Center alleged that the jail should not have removed him from suicide watch.  Jason Foy, 38, was found hanging inside his cell on April 25, 2021. He was taken to Henderson Hospital where he later died.  After his arrest on April 23, Foy told the officer taking him to jail that he wanted to kill himself. After being booked, Foy was placed on suicide watch, according to a complaint filed in District Court last month.  ‘I’m sick of this’  “You’re going to have something else on your hands because I’m going to (expletive) hang myself,” backseat video captured Foy saying to a police officer. “I’m sick of this.”  The next morning Foy was cleared by a social worker and removed from suicide watch.  At around 2:40 p.m. on April 25, Foy was found hanging during a cell check.  The Clark County coroner’s office said Foy died by hanging and ruled his death a suicide.  Foy was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and depression and was not provided adequate mental health treatment while in custody, according to the complaint.  Arrest details  According to a Henderson Police Department arrest report, Foy was arrested for misdemeanor assault against his girlfriend, who reported to police that Foy was prone to fits of sudden rage. She said Foy came home drunk and threw a water bottle at her. Foy then threw a door that was off its hinges down a hallway, shattering an overhead light in the process.  Body-camera footage from an officer who responded to the call showed officers asking Foy to tell his side of what happened. Foy said he defused the situation by going into his room to sleep and said telling his side wouldn’t help because he would be going to jail either way.  “I’m not going to have a story because this keeps going on and on,” Foy said. “I’m out on bail right now for the same exact thing.”  A note addressed to his girlfriend was found in Foy’s cell with the words “Waiting to Die,” on it, according to a Henderson police incident report.  Surveillance footage from inside Henderson Detention Center on April 25 shows Foy in a common area by himself standing and then sitting before going into his cell. After some time, an officer walks through looking into the doors of the other cells. The officer stopped at Foy’s door and soon after, several officers and medical personnel run into the room.  According to an incident report, Foy attempted to make five phone calls that were denied before going back into his cell to hang himself.  The report said officers continued to do routine checks of Foy’s cell after he was cleared from suicide watch. Police noted that Foy had been placed on suicide watch at Henderson Detention Center in 2016, 2020 and 2021.  The city of Henderson, the Henderson Police Department, former Police Chief Thedrick Andres and Naphcare, Inc. were named as defendants in the case.  Naphcare contracts with Clark County to provide services to people detained at Henderson Detention Center, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit alleged a deprivation of civil rights, negligence, wrongful death and discrimination based on a disability.  When reached for comment Wednesday, George Hand, an attorney representing Foy, said, “We’re just relying on the facts in the complaint at this time.”  City of Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said the department and city could not comment on pending litigation.  Naphcare could not be reached for comment.  If you’re thinking about suicide, or are worried about a friend or loved one, help is available 24/7 by calling or texting the Lifeline network at 988.

It included Tunisia's Grand Rabbi Haim Bittan, Mufti Hichem ben Mahmoud and Archbishop Ilario Antoniazzi.  The gunman, a police officer, killed three other officers and two worshippers, a French-Tunisian and an Israeli-Tunisian man, before being shot dead himself by police.  During the meeting, Saied said a probe was underway to determine whether the shooter had any accomplices.  Four people linked to the gunman and suspected of involvement in the attack have so far been arrested, the private Mosaique FM radio reported late Wednesday.  Tunisian officials have denounced the attack as ""criminal"" but refrained from referring to it as a ""terrorist"" operation which would imply anti-Semitic motives.

Following a thorough investigation, which included review of security camera footage, crime scene analysis, and witness interviews, OSI confirmed that on May 8, 2022, off-duty New York City Police Department (NYPD) Officer Sean Armstead shot and killed Edward Wilkins in a parking lot on Route 211 and committed suicide immediately after.  On the night of May 8, 2022, Mr. Wilkins was driving westbound on Route 211 in a black sedan when his car was hit by a Dodge Charger driven by Officer Armstead. When the cars came to a stop, Mr. Wilkins got out of the sedan and began to run away. Officer Armstead got out of his car to chase Mr. Wilkins. He shot Mr. Wilkins multiple times in the parking lot of a Buffalo Wild Wings before shooting himself in the head. Mr. Wilkins and Officer Armstead were both pronounced dead at the scene. Responding officers recovered Officer Armstead’s service weapon at the scene.  A full review of the evidence supports the conclusion that Officer Armstead was responsible for Mr. Wilkins’ death. OSI uncovered no evidence indicating that any other person was involved in the homicide. Therefore, there is no basis on which OSI could seek charges against any living person in this case.  Executive Law Section 70-b directs OSI to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute offenses arising from any incident in which the death of a person is caused by a police officer, whether on or off duty. When OSI does not or, as in this case, cannot seek charges against the officer, Section 70-b requires OSI to issue a public report describing its investigation."

Conversion therapy, the practice of intervening to alter an individual’s gender expression or sexuality to conform to heterosexuality, involves psychologically damaging processes, bill sponsor Rep. Jason Hoskins (D-Southfield) told the Michigan Advance. On Thursday, Hoskins said he, along with other representatives and members of the state Senate, will introduce bills to protect minors from such practices.  “At the end of the day, this is really torture for kids,” Hoskins said. “You’re growing up, you’re figuring things out and I think children should have that opportunity to do that.”  LGBTQ youth who were put in conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide than their peers who had not been through conversion therapy, according to research from The Trevor Project and published in the American Journal of Public Health.  Many major health organizations oppose conversion therapy.  Since 1998, the American Psychiatric Association has opposed conversion therapy and said in a statement on its website that, “gender diverse patients have been shown to benefit from gender-affirming therapies.”  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said not only is there a lack of evidence conversion therapy works to the desired effect, but, “…there is evidence that such interventions are harmful. As a result, ‘conversion therapies’ should not be part of any behavioral health treatment of children and adolescents.”  Currently, 21 states have a ban on conversion therapy for minors, and Michigan is one of four states that have a ban on using federal or state funds for conversion therapy on minors.  Conversion therapy is an “abusive practice” and must be stopped for the benefit of all Michigan residents, Equality Michigan Executive Director Erin Knott told the Michigan Advance in an emailed statement Wednesday.  “So-called conversion therapy is a dangerous and discredited pseudoscience that frequently leads to depression, decreased self-esteem, substance abuse, and even suicide,” Knott said. “Equality Michigan calls upon the Legislature to protect our youth and their families from this deceitful, denigrating, and lethal tactic, and take the necessary action to ensure Michigan becomes the 22nd state to ban this barbaric practice.”  Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive directive banning state and federal funding for the practice in 2021, calling conversion therapy harmful and a barrier for LGBTQ+ Michiganders from reaching their full potential in the state.  “Since day one, I have made it clear that hate has no home in Michigan,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing her directive in 2021. “The actions we take today will serve as a starting point in protecting our LGBTQ+ youth from the damaging practice of conversion therapy and in ensuring that Michigan is a reflection of true inclusion.”  Similar legislation has been introduced in the past in Michigan but hasn’t made it through the previously Republican-led legislature.  Now, with a Democratic majority in the state legislature that recently passed legislation that was signed into law to expand Michigan’s civil rights laws to include protections for LGBTQ+ rights, Hoskins said public perception of LGBTQ+ individuals is changing and he’s confident the legislation will pass.  “One of the issues with conversion therapy is that it is something that was put in place because there’s an idea that LGBTQ people need to fit in, that there’s something wrong with them, and that unfortunately helps discrimination flourish when you think you have to be fixed,” Hoskins said.  Hoskins said he’s partnering with Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and Rep. Felicia Brabec (D-Pittsfield), who in 2021 introduced a ban on conversion therapy. Those bills were never voted out of committee."

Col. Michael J. Kennedy said as he spoke to a gathered crowd on base.  Monday kicked off National Police Week in Alaska and around the nation. President John F. Kennedy proclaimed May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day in 1962 and the week on which that day falls as Police Week.  The week has been used to honor law enforcement members who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This year, the 673d Security Forces Squadron also chose to remember those who lost their lives to suicide.  “It’s definitely an emotional day. We’ve got to remember all the lives that have been lost in the line of duty. Those who haven’t made it to the end of their watch,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Taylor Davis said. “In the last seven years, we calculated the numbers — there’ve been 1,981 lives taken in the line of duty, or lost by death or suicide.”  Kicking off at noon Monday, service members honored the lives of those fallen by running around the Elmendorf Fitness Track for 24 hours carrying a guidon, a flag bearing the name of the squadron.  Throughout the day, service members will hand off the guidon as it continues to make its way around the entire track — all day, never stopping.  “There as a symbol, have it moving is a dedication to what we are doing here this week,” Davis said.  It’s an opportunity to reflect on the lives lost, Kennedy said. In the past, Kennedy said he has participated in it.  This year, he planned to participate as well and run with his family.  “Obviously, I lost friends in security forces. I lost a lot of law enforcement friends as well,” Kennedy said. “It’s an honor, it’s really humbling. It’s a somber experience.”  As the troops click off laps around the track carrying the guidon, remembering the names of the fallen and their stories, they continue to move forward together and never forget those who lost their lives.  “We remember the courage with which they worked and lived,” Kennedy said. “And may we recommit ourselves to the mission to which they dedicated their lives.”  Copyright 2023 KTUU.

Gay or bisexual men, however, scored higher than their heterosexual peers, but only if they lived in urban areas.  The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, measured cardiovascular health among lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual adults in France using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, a set of lifestyle behaviors and factors for good cardiovascular health.  The metrics encourage people to be physically active, eat a healthy diet, sleep seven to nine hours each night, manage their weight, avoid tobacco products, and to control blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.  ""Improving these metrics is a great opportunity to prevent heart problems before they happen,"" Omar Deraz, the study's lead author, said in a news release. Deraz is a researcher with Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, and the Paris Cardiovascular Research Center's Integrative Epidemiology of Cardiovascular Disease Team.  The study is the first to measure cardiovascular health disparities using Life's Essential 8 among gay, lesbian and bisexual people, researchers said.  The study included health data from about 169,400 adults in France – including nearly 91,000 women – who participated in the nationwide Constances study. Participants did not have cardiovascular disease and had an average age of 46.  Among the women, 93% identified as heterosexual; about 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 0.61% identified as lesbian. Among the men, 90% identified as heterosexual; 3.5% identified as bisexual; and 3% identified as gay. About 3% of all participants declined to answer questions about their sexual orientation.  After adjusting for variables such as family history of cardiovascular disease, age and social factors, the researchers found that lesbian and bisexual women had lower cardiovascular health scores compared to heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men living in urban areas scored higher than heterosexual men, whereas those living in rural areas had lower cardiovascular health scores and were less likely to reach ideal cardiovascular health.  Compared to their heterosexual peers, lesbian women scored lower for healthy diet and blood pressure. In contrast, bisexual women had higher scores for healthy diet and nicotine exposure.  Previous research shows LGBT adults are less likely to access health care and more likely to delay treatment than heterosexual adults. Deraz said it is essential to recognize and overcome barriers to health care access.  ""Improving cultural competency and awareness of cardiovascular disease risk among sexual minority adults may help to improve conversations between doctors and patients about cardiovascular health,"" he said.  The study's authors said, citing previous evidence, that LGBT populations disproportionately experience depression and attempted suicide. These have been linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Discrimination and violence fueled by bias, and increased societal stressors, also may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors, including increased alcohol use, smoking and a sedentary lifestyle.  In the study, lesbian, gay and bisexual adults overall reported anxiety disorders, depression symptoms or attempted suicide more frequently than heterosexual adults. However, lesbian women less frequently reported anxiety disorders and depression symptoms compared to heterosexual women.  In a 2020 scientific statement, the AHA noted that LGBTQ adults experience significant psychosocial stressors that compromise their cardiovascular health.  Because France is a high-income country that offers universal health care insurance, the researchers cautioned that their findings may not apply to other countries. The study, they said, also is limited by its single focus on assessing cardiovascular health by sexual orientation, and that heart health data was unavailable for those who identified as transgender.  Even so, ""it's important research into a population that is grossly underrepresented in clinical and epidemiological studies,"" said Dr. Connie Tsao, attending staff cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who was not involved in the new study.  ""To fully address discrimination and disparities that impact health, we must better recognize and understand the unique experiences of all individuals and populations, including sexual minorities,"" she said."

The suspect, 45-year-old Nathan Krump, is charged with first-degree attempted murder. Following his arraignment Wednesday in Watertown City Court, 7 News obtained multiple pages of police statements.  In those pages, members of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and New York State Police recount their harrowing experience of being shot at, taking cover behind a trooper car that was hit by a bullet, watching a house go up in flames, and tasing the suspect to take him into custody.  Deputy Humberto Perez reported that he was sent to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6:15 p.m. to check on a person who lives there.  “The caller was advising that a Nathan Krump was making suicidal/homicidal posts on Facebook and he believed that suicide by cop may be part of his plan,” Perez said.  After getting to the home, Perez was joined on the scene by Trooper Derrick Leonard.  Perez reported that Krump, while holding a white object, began yelling at him to get off his property “or I’m going to shoot you” and also, “You’re going to get killed.”  (Other police later said the white object appeared to be a rifle with a white stock.)  “Nathan then raised the object at me with one hand and I heard a gunshot,” he said. “I heard Trooper Leonard call out over the air that Nathan had just shot at me.”  Perez said he and Leonard used the trooper’s patrol vehicle for cover while waiting for more police to arrive.  Once other law enforcement officials got there, Perez said, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  In his statement, Trooper Leonard described how he and two other troopers were positioned behind doors of a marked police vehicle.  “I heard several shots fired, at least three of which were fired at our position. Two of the rounds went over our heads and one round struck the windshield” of the police vehicle.  Police said they repeatedly tried to make contact with Krump through the PA system, but he didn’t respond.  The sheriff’s department’s SERT (Special Emergency Response Team) arrived on the scene with its MRAP armored vehicle and began to advance toward the place where Krump was holed up.  Deputy James Randall said he heard several rounds “striking what I believe to be the residence behind me.”  He said he and another deputy went to the neighbor’s home to evacuate the people who live there. While crossing their yard, Randall said, “More shots were fired in our direction.” He reported that he fell and sprained his ankle.  The other deputy, Jeffrey Froelich, said Randall provided cover for him as he helped evacuate a couple and their dog to safety.  During this time, Deputy Froelich reported seeing fire at the home where Krump had been.  “The residence was now fully engulfed and propane tanks attached to the house went up in flames and created a huge fireball,” he said.  Police reported the heavy smoke made it difficult to see  Deputy Matthew Young stated he saw a man, later identified as Krump, driving a tractor toward a state police vehicle. He reported it over the police radio and “the SERT team took the subject into custody...using a taser.”  According to a statement by Detective Jay Morrow of the sheriff’s office, Krump’s tractor hit and injured a deputy.  Young said Krump was escorted in handcuffs to his patrol vehicle.  “I removed the taser probes from his body and collected them as evidence,” he said.  Young stated that emergency medical personnel evaluated Krump and cleared him.  Krump was then taken to the county jail, Young said.  Copyright 2023 WWNY. All rights reserved."

Australian Ambassador to the Philippines HK Yu PSM said “Australia recognizes the value of addressing the mental health concerns of the Filipino people that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with DOH, WHO, and other UN agencies through Project BRAVE, to deliver mental health services to communities – especially to women, children and adolescents – through capacity-building and development initiatives.”  Representatives from public and private media organizations, DOH media partners, and regulatory bodies discussed best practices for reporting on suicide incidents, including respecting one’s data privacy, eliminating graphic details and focusing only on factual information, using non-judgmental language, and providing trigger warnings and helpful information with every story. Mental health experts also stressed the importance of taking a suicide-prevention approach to avoid copycat incidents.  Given that suicide remains one of the most pressing health issues in the world, and evidence shows that media portrayal and reportage can contribute to preventing suicide risks, in March 2022, DOH released Administrative Order (AO) 2022-0004 on the Guidelines for Responsible and Ethical Portrayal of Suicide in Media, Audiovisuals, and Films. The AO outlines concrete actions to encourage responsible reporting and portrayal and establish mechanisms to gain feedback to prevent suicide and further harm due to unethical coverage.  Furthermore, the WHO Mental Health Report 2022 states that globally, one in every 100 deaths is by suicide, and it is the leading cause of death among adolescents. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) found that the suicide rate in 2020 increased by 57.3% from the previous year (4,892 individuals), with the highest numbers coming from the 15 to 29 age groups.  “Suicide is preventable with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Our vision is a world where death by suicide is no longer a leading cause of death and where people who are attempting or thinking about suicide feel comfortable seeking help which is provided capably and respectfully to all. We need a Mindful Media environment to reach our goals to prevent suicide and suicide attempts,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.  The DOH, through the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH), has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns. The 1553 hotline is a Luzon-wide, toll-free landline number. Their Globe and TM numbers are 0917-899-8727, 0966-351-4518, and 0908-639-2672 for Smart and Sun subscribers."

These are important jobs that make good careers in public service. In honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.”  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) spoke on the floor today in honor of Police Week, calling on her colleagues to pass her bill, the Invest to Protect Act, which will set aside crucial funding specifically for small police departments across the country.  As the former top law enforcement official in Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto has been a leading advocate in the Senate for our police officers and is part of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. Last year, she secured historic funding for the Byrne JAG grant program, the leading source of criminal justice funding in the country. Her bipartisan bills to combat the crisis of law enforcement suicide and provide mental health resources to police officers have been signed into law by presidents of both parties. Cortez Masto recently reintroduced the BADGES for Native Communities Act to support the Bureau of Indian Affairs with law enforcement recruitment and retention.  Below are her remarks as prepared for delivery:  M. President, we observe Police Week every year to honor the men and women who risk their lives each day for the safety of our communities. As we go about our daily lives, our police officers are the ones protecting us and our families.  They know that this job puts their lives in danger. And their families know that every day when their loved one leaves for work, they may not come home. It’s a sacrifice for the individual getting up and leaving that house, and it is a sacrifice for the loved ones watching that individual leave.  Why do I know that? Because I’m married 25 years to a federal law enforcement officer now retired. And I remember in the middle of the night when he was on call, and he got that call, and his boots were by the side of the bed, slips his feet into them, and walks out that door.  And every spouse, every loved one who sees them leave has always in the back of their mind, “Are they going to come home?”  And so, this is important that we recognize the men and women who are representing and protecting our communities every single day.  I’ve been honored to work with Nevada’s police officers throughout my career. I have worked with police departments across my state to crack down on crime, prosecute offenders, and keep Nevadans safe. Not only have I worked in my state as a prosecutor, I’ve worked here in the District of Columbia, in the United States Attorney’s Office as a prosecutor.  I’ve witnessed the hard work and dedication of our police officers firsthand, whether you’re a state police officer, a local city or county police officer, or a federal officer. I have worked alongside them. I know what they do day in and day out. And that’s why my role in the Senate will always be to fight for our law enforcement.  It’s been my priority to listen to the needs of police departments throughout Nevada, both big and small, to ensure I’m doing everything I can to get them what they need to protect our communities. That includes securing funding for more resources, improved technology, and better training for our officers.  Last year, alongside Senator Grassley, I was proud to make sure Congress passed the biggest increase in Byrne JAG funding in ten years. And to help put an end to tragic law enforcement suicides, I introduced and passed legislation to increase data collection on suicide and support peer counseling programs that can improve police officers’ mental health.  Now, while these investments are so crucial to ensuring our officers are prepared for the job, far too many smaller police departments just can’t compete with their larger counterparts for resources. I know this from our law enforcement agencies in my rural communities in Nevada. Our law enforcement communities in our rural areas, which are much smaller, have to really fight for resources that they need. Over 90% of police departments nationally, including several in Nevada, have fewer than 200 full-time officers.  That’s why I’ve worked with Senator Grassley to introduce the Invest to Protect Act. This legislation would set aside grant funding specifically for smaller local police departments, including Tribal law enforcement, to ensure they can access the resources they need to keep our families safe.  Police officers in both Northern and Southern Nevada have told me about how hard it is to do their jobs when they’re short on personnel. They’re stretched too thin, and that makes it harder for them to protect our communities and their own lives.  The Invest to Protect Act will help these police departments with recruitment and retention so they have enough officers to serve their communities. These are important jobs that make good careers in public service.  So, in honor of Police Week and the sacrifices our officers have made to protect us, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting the Invest to Protect Act.  ###"

ABC11 is helping to decode the difference between mental health and mental illness. As the terms are used more and more, many may still wonder what they mean or what the difference is.  ""Mental health is what we all have,"" said WakeMed psychiatrist Dr. Nerissa Price who describes mental health as a continuum. Something that's always there -- whether it's positive or negative.  ""It has to be really intentionally looked after,"" Dr. Price said. ""You don't just wake up having good mental health.""  Silent Struggle: ABC11 to host town hall aimed at combating youth mental health  Mental health, at its best, you're excelling: joyful, energetic, high-performing at work or school. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may be in crisis: extremely anxious, not sleeping, perhaps thoughts of suicide. Those are serious signs of mental illness.  ""There's a lot of complexity that goes into us developing mental illness that we don't fully understand,"" said Price.  Being aware of the triggers can make a huge difference. Sometimes it's genetics, a family history of mental illness or substance use disorder or unresolved stress: a death, financial problems, divorce.  But 75% of mental illnesses begin before the age of 24 -- triggered by a childhood trauma that's never been confronted.  ""It's so important to reach the child, the teenager, the young person to help them to identify when these symptoms may begin to help get them treatment at those early stages,"" Price said.  SEE ALSO | 'Pivotal moment for action.' Mental health crisis among teens mounts as stakeholders ask for help  Among the coping strategies Dr. Price promotes, resilience is a key component. It's your ability to recover when adverse things happen.  ""Resilience can be taught. Resilience can be learned,"" Price said. ""Just in the same way you can learn to strengthen your physical body, you strengthen your mental body.""  Price agrees it's possible to have good mental health even if suffering from a mental illness.  ""Absolutely,"" she said. ""In fact, there are treatments that are really successful in helping people with mental illness and they work so well and can get people back on track to have the fullness of their life.""

On the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, we reaffirm our commitment to this ongoing work and stand with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people around the world.    More than 30 years ago today, thanks to the tireless advocacy of LGBTQI+ activists the World Health Organization took the long overdue step of declassifying ‘homosexuality’ as a mental health disorder. Since then, we’ve seen real progress—including a powerful movement for LGBTQI+ liberation, more protections for LGBTQI+ people, and more spaces that recognize and affirm that our diversity is our strength. But sadly, we continue to see reminders of how much work remains. More than 60 countries still criminalize homosexuality and some are considering even more draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation. Some governments continue to classify LGBTQI+ individuals as having a medical disorder or permit the use of so-called “conversion therapy”—a dangerous and discredited practice that blatantly violates human rights and causes significant harm, including high rates of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors among LGBTQI+ youth. And right here at home, violent attacks on LGBTQI+ individuals and community spaces have risen dramatically, and more than 600 hateful laws have been introduced this year targeting the LGBTQI+ community, particularly youth.    That is why, during my first month in office, I signed a Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World to combat criminalization, protect vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees, and build international coalitions to fight against discrimination. Last June, I signed an Executive Order directing my Administration to work to prevent the use of so-called “conversion therapy” in the United States and around the world. We have also launched a new Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally to ensure that our efforts to confront the scourge of gender-based violence addresses the unique risks and barriers for LGBTQI+ people. And, my Administration continues to engage with governments, faith leaders, families, and communities around the globe to protect and promote respect for human rights—including LGBTQI+ rights.    Here at home, we’ve also worked to advance equality and equity for LGBTQI+ Americans. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ citizens in housing, health care, education, the criminal justice system, and more. We have made strides in ensuring that transgender and non-binary Americans can access accurate federal IDs and vital government services—from emergency homeless shelters to Social Security benefits. The Department of Justice is responding to discriminatory state laws that violate the rights and freedoms of LGBTQI+ youth and their families. And, I am proud to have appointed a historic number of proud LGBTQI+ public servants, including the first openly gay person to serve as a Cabinet Secretary, the first two openly transgender Americans to ever be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and the first openly lesbian American to achieve the rank of Ambassador.    All of us have a responsibility to speak out and stand up against hate and violence in any form. When the rights of any group or individual are under attack, it endangers our own freedom, and the freedom of people everywhere. So today, let us join together across our country—and around the world—to stand with the LGBTQI+ community. Let us renew our work to combat homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia—and put an end to the harmful violence and discrimination that stems from it.  ###"

Alcohol plays an outsize role in firearm fatalities. An estimated one in three individuals who committed homicide with a firearm had been heavily drinking when they murdered their victims. More than 30 percent of gun homicide victims had been heavily drinking when they were killed, and a quarter of gun suicide victims had been heavily drinking before dying by suicide.  The report’s recommendations were developed with a steering committee of the Consortium for Risk-Based Firearm Policy, a group of leading experts that advances evidence-based gun violence prevention policies. The Consortium is led by Joshua Horwitz, JD, the Dana Feitler Professor of the Practice in Gun Violence Prevention and Advocacy and co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at the Bloomberg School.  The report, “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy,” focuses on two policy areas: limiting access to firearms by a person with a documented history of alcohol misuse, such as driving under the influence, and restricting firearms at locations where alcohol is consumed. The authors based their recommendations on the latest available research on alcohol use and firearms as well as comprehensive reviews of state laws.  “The intersection of alcohol misuse and firearms can have devastating consequences,” says Silvia Villarreal, director of research translation at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions the report’s lead author. “These recommendations provide specific guidelines for states to limit access to firearms and address the risk of dangerous behaviors when the two are combined.”  Federal law does not address the risk of alcohol and guns, and many state laws are ambiguous. Some states prohibit possession of guns using unclear criteria such as “habitual drunkard,” or “while intoxicated.” Bringing a gun to a place where alcohol is present is legal in many states but prohibited in others. Some states exempt concealed carry permit holders from laws prohibiting firearm possession in places where alcohol is consumed.  To limit access to firearms by an individual with a history of alcohol misuse, the authors recommend that states focus on individuals with a history of driving under the influence or other documented alcohol misuse. The authors recommend that states pass laws that prohibit the following for at least five years:  The purchase and possession of firearms by an individual convicted of two or more instances within a five-year period of driving under the influence of alcohol or driving while intoxicated.  Obtaining or possessing a concealed carry permit—a license required to carry firearms in public—by individuals convicted of one driving under the influence offense, and/or documented with court records to have a recent history of alcohol misuse.  To limit access to guns when and where alcohol is consumed, the authors recommend that states pass laws prohibiting public carrying or possession of firearms where alcohol is consumed, including bars, restaurants, sporting arenas, and outdoor festivals and other events. Some states already have laws that restrict firearm possession in places such as bars and restaurants; however, concealed carry permit holders are often exempt from these laws.  The report also includes additional policy considerations, including:  Limiting the number of alcohol retailers in a particular area through licensing and zoning regulations.  Limiting the hours and days when alcohol can be served.  Increasing the price of alcohol by raising taxes.  “Firearm policies aimed at reducing harmful outcomes due to gun violence do not operate in a vacuum,” says Horwitz. “We must take into consideration the environment where alcohol is sold and consumed to limit the risk of potential violence.”  The report is aimed at researchers, practitioners, policymakers, law enforcement professionals, and others working to address gun violence.  “Alcohol Misuse and Gun Violence: An Evidence-based Approach for State Policy” was written by Silvia Villarreal, Amy Barnhorst, Richard Bonnie, Kami Chavis, Ari Davis, Shannon Frattaroli, Kelly Roskam, Jeffrey Swanson, and Joshua Horwitz.

In 2023, they worked with mental health nonprofits, police departments, and crisis hotlines across the nation to provide help to the suicidal individuals they detect. In total, Jain has connected 600+ social media users with six mental health support partners, including Texas Health and Human Services.  In December, Google executive Kelley Gibson reached out to Jain. As a result, Google is exploring making SuicideWatch an internally funded, tax-free charitable nonprofit, connecting Lavik with research fellows experienced in suicide detection technology.

According to national media, Samarveer Singh, a 33-year-old philosophy lecturer on a temporary contract, took his life in April after he was made redundant by Delhi University (DU). The institution has over recent months ended the contracts of more than 300 ad hoc teachers and is now on a recruitment drive intended to hire more permanent employees, according to reports.  Shobhit Mahajan, a professor of astrophysics at Delhi, said that a particularly bad appointments backlog at the institution – which is one of India’s largest, with 80 colleges and about 700,000 students in total – has resulted in an acute situation.  “In DU, there were no permanent appointments for over a decade and more in some of its constituent colleges,” he said.  While a particular factor at Delhi, temporary employment is commonplace in India’s public university system, which includes upwards of 50 central universities and hundreds of state institutions, he said.  “In many state universities…there is a problem with permanent appointments since these are usually centralised for the whole state, which means a lot more bureaucracy and procedural issues,” Professor Mahajan said.  For displaced ad hoc lecturers, employment prospects at other public universities are slim, and teachers are “left to fend for themselves”, he said.  Times Higher Education has contacted Delhi University for comment. A registrar at the university previously told Indian media that there was no provision under India’s regulations for the absorption of ad hoc teachers.  Those who are made redundant are unlikely to rebuild careers in academia, although they may go on to teach in smaller private universities or in cram schools that prepare students for India’s hypercompetitive university entrance exams, he noted. “They will, of course, not get paid as much, nor will they have the prestige, but it is possibly better than starving.”  Apoorvanand, a Hindi professor at Delhi University, worried about the rapid review process preceding layoffs.  Describing the current approach at many colleges – in which expert panels take just a few minutes to assess ad hoc faculty – as a “farce”, he said it was common knowledge that the list of permanent appointees was largely predetermined ahead of time.  “If it’s only two to three minutes, it hardly matters who’s asking the questions,” he said, adding, “the list is known to those appearing for interviews”.  While he sympathised with the plight of ad hoc instructors, he cautioned that not all of them had been well suited for their jobs.  In many cases, he said, the “loyalty” of candidates took precedence over who was best qualified for the job, with principals or teachers’ associations pulling for politically like-minded employees to be hired.  He urged greater scrutiny of recruitment decisions. “It’s for the college to explain: why did you continue to employ them for years if they were not very capable? If you found them fit to teach for eight to 10 years, why is it that now you don’t find them fit for a permanent position?”  Professor Apoorvanand said political parties, which have a strong presence on India’s campuses, viewed academic vacancies as a “golden opportunity” to get loyal supporters into teaching posts in many colleges. He warned that, if successful, such a large-scale push could lead to disastrous consequences for the institution.  pola.lem@timeshighereducation.com"

During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.

For Alaskans aged 15-34, the most frequent cause of emergency room visits and hospitalizations is motor vehicle crashes. (Dean Swope/KYUK)  Alaska’s death rate from traumatic brain injuries – or TBIs – is the highest in the nation. That’s according to a recent report from the Alaska Health Department.  Dr. Katherine Newell is an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assigned to Alaska. She put together the report.  “The fact that one in four deaths in Alaskans aged under 30 was related to a TBI is a shocking statistic and so many of these deaths are preventable,” said Newell.  Traumatic brain injuries range from a mild bump on the head to a deadly punctured skull. The report looked at rates of emergency room visits, hospitalization, and death for TBIs over five years–from 2016 to 2021.  Suicides and accidental falls caused the most TBI deaths in Alaska. And Newell said there was a lot of variation by age group.  “For older adults aged over 85 years, 72% of TBI-related deaths were due to unintentional fall, whereas in younger adults, the largest proportion of deaths were due to suicide,” said Newell.  According to the report, Alaska Native and American Indian people were disproportionately likely to have serious or deadly traumatic brain injuries — at a rate three times higher than the national average.  Vehicle crashes seriously injured or killed the most young adults. And for people in Northern Alaska, ATV and snow machine accidents were likely to cause serious head injuries.  Over 40% of deaths due to traumatic brain injury were suicide by firearms. In Alaska, suicide rates are higher for young men, age 25-34, and Native Alaskans and American Indian people.  Newell says traumatic brain injuries can have lasting effects, so prevention is the only real cure.  Because the causes of TBIs vary so much, in the report, she suggests a variety of ways to prevent injuries.  “A good strategy is to think about how we are supporting our older community and our elders to prevent slips and falls, especially in the winter months,” said Newell.  The report mentions existing community programs that distribute ice cleats to elders. Other suggested interventions include firearm safety education, healthcare screenings for elders, and free helmet giveaways.  The report also found many people in Alaska had trouble getting care after they experienced a traumatic brain injury, usually due to cost or geography.

House Bill 463, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed on a 71-24 vote. Rep. Joe Stagni, R-Kenner opposed the bill, while several Democratic lawmakers supported it.  The bill was passed with enough votes to withstand a potential veto. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has not said whether he will reject the bill if it ends up on his desk, but he has mentioned the recent onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation would have a negative impact on the already high suicide rate for transgender Louisianians.  When presenting his proposal, Firment pointed out several surrounding states have passed similar bans, arguing that Louisiana needed to do the same or else become a “destination for these type of procedures across the entire South.”  Other gender-affirming healthcare bans have been the subject of federal lawsuits. Similar restrictions in Alabama and Arkansas are currently blocked from taking effect pending a court judgment.  Speaking to colleagues on the floor, Firment shared several pieces of misleading or incorrect information, claiming the treatments are experimental and that minors in Louisiana are being sterilized.  “Why are we aggressively treating a social contagion with experimental treatments?” Firment asked.  The American Academy of Pediatrics supports gender-affirming healthcare, and the American Medical Association does not consider it experimental. Minors also rarely undergo surgical procedures, including top surgery, which adds or removes breast tissue, or bottom surgery, which constructs either a vagina or a penis.  Firment’s claims received bipartisan pushback.  “We want to talk about parental consent, but we want to talk about what other kids and their doctors do,” Stagni said, arguing the bill flies in the face of parental rights.  Rep. Joe Marino, I-Gretna, also took to the floor to give a speech in opposition to the ban.  “If this is really about protecting kids, why are we ignoring lots of things that protect kids?” Marino asked. “Gender-affirming care for transgender kids reduces depression, reduces suicide and other devastating consequences.”  Studies indicate approximately 80% of transgender youth have considered suicide, and 40% report at least one suicide attempt. Research also indicates gender-affirming healthcare leads to improved mental health outcomes.  Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, argued the bill is unconstitutional because it specifically targets transgender minors. The ban has exceptions for puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatments for cisgender youth.  The bill will next be heard in a Senate committee.  Firment’s proposal is the third piece of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation to clear the House.  House Bill 81, by Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, would forbid teachers and other school employees from using transgender minors’ chosen names and pronouns. The bill was advanced from the House last week.  Another proposal, House Bill 466, by Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, was also advanced from the House last week."

A CDC report found nearly three in five teen girls in the U.S. felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021, which is an almost 60% increase in the past decade.  The data also revealed 24% of high school girls had seriously considered suicide.  ""I see it everywhere, so no it doesn't surprise me,"" said Zanaya Bailey, a 16-year-old student at Everman High School. ""Because it's everywhere.""  Bailey is a member of her school's Hope Squad, a peer-to-peer suicide prevention program.  ""It's easier to talk to somebody that's your age because they might have gone through what you've gone through or they can relate to it,"" said 16-year-old Kayla Graham, another member of Everman High School's Hope Squad.  Both girls have listened to classmates who were struggling and connected them to trusted adults who could help.  ""Our Hope Squad members are the eyes, ears and maybe even heart of a school,"" said Kristi Wiley, the director of programs for the Jordan Elizabeth Harris Foundation, which has helped set up Hope Squad in 114 schools across 20 districts in North Texas.  Forty more schools plan to implement the program this fall.  Wiley said Hope Squad has saved countless lives.  ""When we can be direct about suicide and say, 'I saw you post this – are you thinking about suicide?' what we know is that it lowers anxiety, opens up communication, and reduces the change of a suicidal act,"" she said.  Initiating conversations about mental health and suicide is hard, but psychologists said they're key to reaching young people dealing with anxiety and depression.  ""People do want to be there for you,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Newton, who also serves as the Chief Medical Officer at SonderMind. ""As lonely as it may feel sometimes, it's not something that will last forever, and someone can help you.""  That support from someone at home or at school can make young girls feel less alone.  ""Now students, they know I can have somebody I can talk to, I have somebody I can go to for this, I don't have to do it alone, there's people I can trust,"" Bailey said. ""We provide that.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an “absolute miracle.”  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  “He drove off. He’s depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. “He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.”  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil’s Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.  He said he was not really depressed but that he felt down because times were bad in the world, according to the affidavit.  ""Asked if he felt suicidal, he said, ‘You know, not like a plan, not usually,’"" the affidavit said."

Statement from Casey Pick (she/her), Director of Law and Policy for The Trevor Project:  “LGBTQ young people in Florida deserve the same opportunity to lead happy, healthy lives as their peers. As the world recognizes International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, we are outraged to see Florida’s governor continue to cruelly target LGBTQ young people by signing this slate of harmful bills into law.  The Trevor Project’s research found that 45% of young LGBTQ Floridians have seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% have made an attempt. These young people are not inherently prone to suicide, but rather, placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society. These anti-LGBTQ laws target the very things that we know can support and uplift LGBTQ young people – such as affirming environments at school and in the community, education about their identities and history, and best-practice healthcare.  For LGBTQ young people in Florida and across the country who might feel scared or stressed by this news – we see you. The Trevor Project is here to support you 24/7, and we will never stop fighting for your right to be exactly who you are. We will continue working with our partners and allies on the ground to push back against these dangerous policies.”  Relevant Research  The Trevor Project’s 2022 U.S. National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health by State found that 45% of LGBTQ youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 16% made an attempt. 54% of transgender and nonbinary youth in Florida seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 1 in 5 attempted suicide.  At a national level, The Trevor Project’s data has found that 60% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, and those who have reported higher rates of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who have not.  Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies, and nearly 2 in 3 said that hearing about potential laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school made their mental health a lot worse.  A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who experienced bathroom discrimination had more than 1.5 times the odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not experience bathroom discrimination.  Research has found that learning about LGBTQ people or issues has been associated with significantly lower odds (23%) of a past-year suicide attempt in LGBTQ students.  According to The Trevor Project’s latest polling published in Jan. 2023, 86% of transgender and nonbinary youth say recent debates about state laws restricting the rights of transgender people have negatively impacted their mental health. A majority of those trans youth (55%) said it impacted their mental health “very negatively.”  However, research also shows that transgender and nonbinary youth who have access to gender-affirming spaces report lower rates of attempting suicide.  A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in Transgender Health, also found that transgender and nonbinary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from adults and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year.

(Photo Credit: Troy Darr) VIEW ORIGINAL  SEMBACH, Germany – David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shared his journey from mental “hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  Bartley said his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011.  “That was the day I was going to kill myself,” said Bartley. “That's the day that I call the monster convinced me of two sets of things.  “On the first hand, that I was worthless. I was useless. I was stupid. I was pitiful. I was grotesque. I was ugly. I was an embarrassment and a burden. Nobody said these things to me, and yet I believed those to be true, and if that wasn't enough, the straw that broke my spiritual, my mental and psychological back was on that day what I believed to be true was, if I killed myself, well, there's no way I could be selfish, because everybody would be better off without me.”  Bartley told the Soldiers that his journey started on Aug. 31, 2011, but his story started long before that.  Bartley’s father committed suicide when Bartley was seven years old. His older brother enlisted in the Army and raised him like a father. Bartley’s story might have started on that day.  Or maybe his story started the first time he thought that life was more difficult to live than to die.  David Woods Bartley, storyteller and mental health advocate, shares his story from “mental hellness” to mental wellness with U.S. Army NATO Soldiers during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. See the one-hour executive presentation at https://youtu.be/zf_9JWhsWr4.  “Please know I did not have a death wish,” said Bartley. “Now that may seem contrary. The three-headed monster is depression. It's trauma. It's suicidal ideation. That was this thing that was convincing me of all these lies that I took as true.  “So how can you say, if you admit you had suicidal ideations, that you didn't have a death wish?  “What I'd say is they're not the same thing. There was a chasm between a death wish and a suicidal ideation. I desperately wanted to live.  “The majority of the people … don't want to die, but what happens is, in that moment when a person is making sure the noose is going to hold tight, when they have calculated that I have to take enough of this to wash down with that, they're there for the sole reason that life has become more difficult to live than it is to die.”  Or maybe his story really started when he was 11-years old, and a youth organization leader repeatedly sexually assaulted him.  But his journey of survival started on Aug. 31, 2011, when convinced that everyone would be better off without him, Bartley drove to the Foresthill Bridge that spans the American River at a height of 730 feet.  He had left a note carefully placed in his vehicle to be easily found. It read:  -------------------------------------------------------------  To my beloved Deanna, my family, and friends,  I've decided that the time has come for me to go. I am choosing to end my life, so I can be free of the pain in my heart and soul, the betrayal of my mind and the depth of self-hatred that I feel most every moment of every day.  I have become the burden I wish I never would and a drag on those around me.  I'm a damaged shell and just a little boy, not yet close to what a man should be.  Everyone, yes, everyone I know will be much better off without me.  I am so incredibly sorry.  David  -------------------------------------------------------------  Bartley told the story of how a sheriff’s deputy found him standing 730 feet over the river thinking about how much he would miss his wife and the life they created together running an animal rescue shelter, A Chance for Bliss, in California.  “The sheriff's deputy approached me from the left-hand side and did the thing that is the foundation of this new set of beliefs for me,” said Bartley. “He created a connection.  “Connection is not just this broad conceptual thing. It is tangible. It is actual. We all know this to be true because when we connect with another person, we are seen, we feel heard, and we feel valued.  “Connection creates hope. Hope is a weapon. It's not just this cute cuddly thing. It is tenacious. It is the single greatest form of ordnance against this monster called suicide because hope saves lives, because in the moment … it can rob the monster of oxygen,” he said.  Bartley told the Soldiers of a series of scientific tests from the 1950s involving drowning rats. Rats placed in a bucket of water would drown in minutes, but rats that had previously been rescued from the bucket would continue to swim for days based on the hope they would be rescued again.  He said he believes the way the Army teaches suicide prevention; indicators of potential suicide behavior, intervention strategies, and services and resources available for people with suicidal ideations, is not as effective as what he came to realize on that day, Aug. 11, 2011.  “Making someone feel valued is the foundation of great leadership,” said Bartley and explained that more importantly making someone feel valued is the Army’s greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  Bartley said when he talks to people about suicide, he likes to describe four things he calls “the why, the feeling, the cause and the healing.”  He said asking why is a waste of time.  “A lot of people kill themselves, and what I like to say with all due respect, we have no idea why. We think we do,” he said. “Kay Redfield Jamison is an extraordinary researcher and has had her own suffering with bipolar (disorder). Here's what she says.  “Each way to suicide is its own: intensely private, unknowable and terrible. Suicide will seem to its perpetrator the last and best of bad possibilities and any attempt by the living to chart this final terrain of life can only be a sketch, maddeningly incomplete.  “We're asking the wrong question,” said Bartley. “If I had time, I would have every one of you take a piece of paper and write the question Why? on it, put a big X through it, and put it in a shredder.  “It is a totally useless question because every why requires justification. We're not going to ever answer the question. What we need to do is determine the foundation that caused somebody to kill themselves.”  Bartley said that why requires a logical answer, and people don’t commit suicide for logical reasons.  “People don't kill themselves because of what they think. What pulls the trigger finger back towards a person is a feeling. It's emotions. People kill themselves because of how they feel not because of what they think.”  Bartley said the starting point for suicidal ideations. The cause is likely some sort of trauma which he describes as “severe lasting emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.”  But the solution, the healing, is not based on the why or the feeling. It’s based on hope. And hope is based on connectedness. And connectedness Bartley said comes from being “seen, heard and valued.”  A search of the internet turns up thousands of self-help pages on improving social connectedness and developing a culture of connection in organizations.  During his presentation, Bartley discussed how he makes connections in his everyday life and how the sheriff’s deputy made a connection on that Aug. 31, 2011, day that literally talked Bartley off the ledge.  “I’m a freak about names,” said Bartley.  Bartley said he uses people names to make connections, and he has an acronym PARA he uses as a memory aid to talk about how he uses people’s names to make connections.  PARA stands for pause, ask, repeat, associate. During his presentation Bartley spoke about people he has connected with recently, Amanda, Steven not Stephen, Sarah, Mikael, and the importance of using people’s names to make a connection.  “When you see somebody with a name tag at the DFAC (Dining Facility) or the commissary,” said Bartley, “when a server comes up and they say ‘Hi, what can I get for you?’ you say wait, what's your name, because when you don't call them by their name, they're basically a thing.”  Bartley describes that as the pause and the ask. Then you repeat the name.  “Hi, Amanda. My name's David. You're new here.”  The associate part of PARA can be as simple as recognizing that someone is new, asking the spelling of the name, or asking where the name comes from.  Bartley talked about a senior officer he met in Alaska named Jody. Jody was not happy about his name growing up until when he was older his father told him he was named for his father’s friend who died fighting in Vietnam.  Bartley said that people suffering from depression, people considering suicide as their best option normally cannot create connectedness with those around them. But those around them are able to create connectedness by making them feel seen, heard and valued.  “Feeling seen, heard and valued creates connectedness,” said Bartley. “Connectedness creates hope,” and hope is the greatest tactic for combatting suicide.  And that, said Bartley, is exactly what happened on Aug. 11, 2001, as Bartley leaned over the rail of the bridge with almost half his weight over the rail. This is what the sheriff’s deputy said to create connectedness and give Bartley hope.  “I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. I get a sense you’re suffering.”  “Would you please tell me, because I would imagine you're feeling depressed, would you please tell me what does it feel like when you're depressed?”  “Wow, man. Thank you for sharing that. It had to be tough. When you feel like that, what's it like on your very, very worst days?”  “Gosh, I was just thinking. That's your worst day. Hey man, well, what's it like on your best day?”  “Wow, that'd be amazing. Wow, thank you. Thanks for sharing. That makes me feel good.”  “Hey, have you ever thought, well, what do you want the rest of your life to be like?”  With that question, Bartley said he felt seen, heard, and valued, and he shifted his weight back to the safe side of the bridge.  Earlier in the presentation Bartley asked the Soldiers in the crowd how many had lost someone to suicide. He also asked how many had seen the indicators of potential suicide behavior.  He said people with suicidal ideations are very good at hiding the indicators. He said the Army should be more focused on creating connections rather than recognizing the indicators of potential suicide behavior as the key to preventing suicide.  “Making the connection opens a door,” said Bartley, “because we’re not going to see the signs.  “This last quote puts this whole thing together so much more beautifully than I can,” said Bartley. “Drew Ramsey is a psychiatrist who specializes in suicide. Forget everything I said. Please take these words because it applies to every single one of us every single day. Here's what he says.  “Someone you see today is thinking about killing themselves. Your smile, your question, your love, you know what, it could save them. You know how I know? They told me it did.”  To see Bartley’s one-hour executive presentation go to the U.S. Army NATO YouTube page at www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf_9JWhsWr4 or click below."

Critics of House Bill 808 protest in the committee room after House Health approves the Youth Health Protection Act without hearing from any members of the public, due to the committee running out of time. The bill was taken up last with about 15 minutes left. #ncga #ncpol pic.twitter.com/OJWdaw8aAk — Avi Bajpai (@avibajpai_) May 2, 2023  Maddie wasn't at the legislature that day, but says she feels the impacts.  ""It hurts to be taken down by people who don't even get it,"" she says.  Some pieces of legislation would restrict health care available to transgender kids. They could even penalize health care providers for certain kinds of care. Any kind of limits on care — like access to hormone therapy or puberty blockers, or limits on insurance coverage for gender-affirming care — would impact Maddie and others in her position.  ""I've said it a million times, I don't know if I would be here if I wasn't like this,"" she says. ""It's life-saving stuff. People are so much happier when they realize who they really are.""  Health experts echo Maddie. Studies show that two-thirds of all transgender people thought about suicide before transitioning.  ""We have a lot of patients who self-harm. Cutting and burning and things like that,"" says Dr. Deanna Adkins, a pediatric endocrinologist who works with transgender youth.  She says there's a misunderstanding over what gender-affirming health care even is. For example, proposed legislation in North Carolina would ban gender transition surgery for anyone under 18. But Adkins says surgeries on minors happen only in the rarest of cases.  ""Someone who is already trying to cut their breasts off, or cut their penis off,"" she says. ""We would much rather have a surgeon, who knows what they're doing in a safe environment, do that, and keep that patient alive.""  Adkins says most gender-affirming care includes a lot of talk therapy, or simply working with parents to help them navigate what their child is going through.  ""Even just using [preferred] name and pronouns can reduce suicidality by half,"" she says.  In some cases, and only after months or years of talk therapy, doctors will prescribe puberty blockers. That's prescription medication to temporarily suppress puberty. Adkins says only later do teens start with hormone therapy, where they receive either testosterone or estrogen.  ""We're not putting them in a — as has been indicated — a pathway the minute they come in and say, 'This is what's going on with me,'"" she says. ""Everyone's pathway is totally different. Some get puberty blockers, some don't. Some stay on, some go off.""  Supporters of stricter rules around gender-affirming care say they want to protect children and keep them from doing something drastic they will regret later in life. As transgender rights have received more political attention lately, there has been an increase in claims that people regret a gender transition and then choose to stop treatment or detransition.  Courtesy Katie Jenifer / Katie Jenifer, right, with daughter Maddie at the N.C. General Assembly  Health experts say it's important to understand any case where a patient is unhappy with their care, but say that focusing too much on detransitioners misunderstands how care is delivered. It's not like getting a tattoo on spring break. Anything that dramatically changes a person's body happens only after years of therapy and with multiple medical providers signing off on treatment.  Maddie's mom, Katie Jenifer, says she thinks the latest rounds of legislation are simply aimed at ""othering"" people.  ""Maddie said something as a joke to me the other day, but it really struck me. She said, 'How am I supposed to live, love, laugh under these conditions?'"" she says. ""How is she supposed to? When she constantly has to worry about what rights they're going to take away next. How are they going to target her next? And for what reason? She's not doing anything or hurting anybody. She's just trying to be a kid.""  The legislature has moved fast on some of these bills, meaning they will likely pass some versions this year. Governor Roy Cooper has signaled he will veto some of these bills, but with strong majorities in both chambers, Republicans have a good chance of overriding those vetoes.  "

The proposal — referred to as medical aid in dying by supporters and assisted suicide by critics — is a perennial and emotionally charged subject of debate in the General Assembly.  In the eight years since state Rep. Paul Baumbach first introduced the proposal, some lawmakers have confronted the difficult end-of-life decisions at the heart of the bill themselves. Two weeks before a Tuesday House committee hearing, state Rep. Kevin Hensley – previously an opponent – helped his terminally ill mother secure a prescription for medication to end her life in California.  But the arguments surrounding the measure remain largely unchanged. For those with terminal illnesses like Dawn Lentz, it offers the option to avoid a prolonged and painful death.  “When it comes down to it, it must be me who will ultimately answer to my creator,"" she told the House Health and Human Development Committee on Tuesday. ""I don’t know if I will use this option, but I do know that I have the right.”  Sue St. Laurent, another supporter of the bill with a terminal illness, says she only remains active because of a $15,000-per-month medication. If the nonprofit assistance that helps her afford the medication were to dry up, St. Laurent says she would want the option to request medication to facilitate a faster death. ""I want the right to make my own decision about my life,"" she said.  Baumbach echoed the same reasoning, underscoring that the bill includes guardrails to prevent patients from being coerced into using the lethal medications. Those guardrails include a requirement that patients go through two waiting periods before receiving their prescription; their attending physician or nurse practitioner must also offer the patient opportunities to rescind their request. The bill would only allow people with a life expectancy of six months or less to request lethal medication.  Opponents include some disability rights groups, who argue that while Baumbach's bill explicitly prohibits requesting lethal medication ""solely because of the individual's age or disability,"" other states that allow medical aid in dying — namely Oregon — have expanded eligibility to include some disabilities; they worry that Delaware could follow the same path.  The bill has also drawn firm opposition from the Delaware Psychiatric Society. Former Psychiatric Society President Neil Kaye argues physicians’ life expectancy estimates for terminally ill patients are too unreliable to use as the basis for life-or-death decisions.  “This bill requires physicians to inform patients of their end-of-life expectancy,"" he said. ""We can’t do that with 50 percent accuracy — that’s like monkeys flipping quarters. How can we be asked to help a patient decide to commit suicide instead of seeking additional treatment and compassionate palliative care?”  Kaye also pointed out that Oregon has repeatedly updated the drug cocktail prescribed to people with terminal illnesses — a process he characterized as ""unmonitored experiments"" by physicians who aren't trained on how to quickly and painlessly facilitate death.  Other critics note that medical aid in dying generally relies on drugs produced by compound pharmacies — meaning they are not tested and approved by the FDA.  While the Delaware Psychiatric Society remains opposed to the bill, many of the state's other medical organizations — including the Delaware Association of Nurses and Delaware Healthcare Association — have changed their position on the subject. The Delaware Medical Society, for instance, shifted from opposing the bill to a policy of ""active neutrality"" to reflect divided opinions among its members.  Meanwhile, Delaware Association of Nurse Practitioners spokesperson Susan Conaty-Buck testified in support of the bill on Tuesday, attempting to assuage concerns that medical professionals might pressure patients to choose lethal medications over longer-term palliative care. ""It's not an opportunity to rush a person to death,"" she said. ""It's an opportunity for me to work with a patient and their family, to respect what they need and what they want.""  The bill would, however, allow healthcare providers to prohibit physicians from prescribing the lethal medications on their premises. If the bill becomes law, Baumbach says he does not anticipate that any Delaware hospital system would immediately allow its physicians to offer medical aid in dying. ""We fully expect hospitals to not allow this on their premises for at least five years,"" he said.  Once private practice physicians have time to demonstrate the safety of the procedure, Baumbach says he expects some hospital systems to come around. While Catholic hospitals cannot provide medical aid in dying in accordance with church doctrine, Delaware's largest Catholic hospital system — St. Francis Health Care — makes up a relatively small share of the state's total hospital beds and is not poised to merge with any competitors.  The bill passed out of committee with less opposition than in previous years, but no version of the bill has ever reached the House floor.  "

In an emergency resolution submitted at the RCN’s annual conference in Brighton, members called on RCN Council to lobby for the implementation of an evidence-based, integrated suicide prevention programme for the profession.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change"" Chantel Rose  Ruth Bailey, a nurse who presented the item, warned that nurses were working in settings where there had been an “explosion of poor mental health”.  Ms Bailey noted that while there were many examples of good practice, such as mental health first aid, access to staff counselling provision was “still inconsistent across the UK” and the incidence of suicide continued to rise.  She said: “We need a consistent and co-ordinated approach of an evidence-based suicide prevention programme, and we need the RCN to lobby for urgent action now.  “It is imperative that the RCN, as the voice of nursing, steps into this space and leads a co-ordinated UK response to this epidemic of distress and that it acts now to prevent further death by suicide in nursing and midwifery.”  Meanwhile, Chantel Rose, a registered mental health nurse, told RCN Congress that her workload was “getting harder and getting more distressing”.  She said: “Sadly I have more fellow nurses on my caseload than ever in my entire life.  “It breaks my heart that I could be next.”  Ms Rose added: “We can pull it back if council make a change – you’re doing it with pay [so] do it with suicide.  “We’re going to lost more of our colleagues if things don’t change.""  Separately, Eva Omondi, from the RCN Eastern region, said that the support system available for internationally educated nurses who were struggling with their mental health was the “bare minimum”.  She highlighted that during discussions about nurse suicide it was important to think about “the aggravating factors” which were specifically affecting internationally educated nurses.  One of the key factors she mentioned was how some internationally educated nurses have a lack of family in the UK to support them through poor mental health.  Meanwhile, Chloe Roberts, a student nurse and RCN ambassador, told RCN Congress that suicide was sometimes “a taboo topic” that people are afraid to talk about for fear of saying the wrong thing.  Ms Roberts, who lost her best friend to suicide two years ago, explained that she had taken part in suicide prevention training and called for the training to be mandatory for all NHS employees.  She said: “I urge you to support this resolution to help create change in our workforce, to make suicide prevention training course mandatory as congress you never know when this training could help you with the knowledge to save a life.”  The emergency resolution was backed overwhelming by RCN members, which could lead to RCN Council lobbying for a suicide prevention programme for the nursing workforce across the UK."

He’d come in and raid the fridge for a soda and ice cream and tell his grandfather he loved him.  Cook would come home at night and say “I love you” before bed.  “What we miss about him is his presence,” Abel said. “His presence filled our households. Every chance he got, he’d be telling us ‘Grandpa, I love you, Grandma, I love you.’”  Abel says his grandson killed himself inside a cell at Lemon Creek Correctional Center.  According to the Department of Corrections, Cook was the third person to die while in custody this year.  Abel says his grandson had gone to a local clinic for treatment on his back — but the treatment didn’t work. It made the pain even worse, and Cook yelled and threatened to sue people. The pain was so intense Cook couldn’t walk and was screaming out in pain.  The next day he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor charges of trespassing and property damage. Abel says Cook was put in solitary confinement because of an issue with another prisoner.  Abel believes that while Cook was in custody, he didn’t get the proper treatment and the pain persisted. He says at one point even using the bathroom for Cook was unbearable.  Then, one day, Cook hung himself. Abel says he put tape over the room’s security camera and that it was 30 minutes before security guards found him.  “He was calling me every day and telling me what he was going through. He was, he was suffering and pain,” Abel said.  According to the Department of Corrections, 18 people died in custody in the year 2022. Of those deaths, seven were ruled suicides.  That’s an increase over the previous years — only two people died by suicide in 2021 and five in 2020, according to DOC.  The DOC says 65% of the inmate population have a mental illness, and 75 people work as contractors providing mental health services statewide to a total prison population of nearly 4,500 people.  “We are the number one mental health providers of the people of Alaska by default,” DOC’s Chief Mental Health Officer Lisa Guzman said.  A former mental health professional who worked with inmates says the DOC’s care of those experiencing a mental crisis within the system is lacking. Her identity is being protected due to concerns of retaliation against her.  “I’m there to help them with the mental health care part — they’re in jail, that’s taking care of the law part, I had nothing to do with their punishment. So I have every obligation to treat them as a patient. So in that sense, since I wasn’t actually able to treat them adequately, it felt really shameful,” she said.  “I often had patients that were suicidal, telling me that, you know, well, I get seen, you know, once a day for a couple of minutes. And I think that was a lot due to staffing,” she said.  DOC admits there isn’t enough staff.  “We have consistently tried to make improvements on services,” Guzman said. “And I think, that despite not having enough staff, despite still having positions open, we’ve continued to provide the essential services we need.”  Megan Edge, director of the ACLU of Alaska Prison Project, said the DOC lacks the ability to take care of inmates’ mental and physical health.  “I’ve heard a lot of nice things come out of the mouths of DOC executives and legislative budget hearings and confirmation hearings. But what I’m seeing actually happen inside of our prisons and jails is not reflective of those nice words. Those words are hollow,” Edge said.  DOC says it is participating in Project 2025, which is a national movement to decrease suicide in the U.S. by 20% by the year 2025.  “Corrections was one of the kind of target populations that was identified because suicide rates are high in corrections nationwide,” Guzman said. “And so we are actively participating in that, we’ve developed kind of a suicide prevention readiness checklists that we’re going to be trying to go to all the facilities and collect data on how we can make improvements and hopefully contribute to that project and decreasing suicide nationally.”  Guzman goes on to say that many of those incarcerated already have mental health issues that haven’t been addressed.  “We are managing a high volume of mentally ill people who are not getting the care they need,” Guzman said. “So as much as you know, they, they come into our system, and we treat them and then we send — we do as much release planning as we can — and we send them back out into the community. And then at times, they’re not getting that follow-up care. And so it’s kind of a — it can become a cycle.”  Edge says what’s happening now is essentially a bandage for a much larger problem.  “When you start to understand why people go in, let’s take, you know, the suicides last year, they’re all fairly young, many of them had complicated mental health issues. One person was experiencing homelessness. Prison is not a solution for public safety. It’s putting a Band-Aid on the symptom. That’s it,” Edge said.  Abel says his grandson, Mark was looking forward to the birth of his second child, who is due in the fall.

The proposed consent decree resolves the department’s claims that the jail fails to provide adequate mental health care to incarcerated individuals at risk of self-harm and suicide, and fails to provide medication-assisted treatment, where clinically indicated, to incarcerated individuals experiencing unmedicated opiate withdrawal. The proposed consent decree requires the jail to provide adequate mental health care and medication-assisted treatment in those circumstances.  “The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country, and under our Constitution, jails and prisons must provide adequate medical care to incarcerated individuals,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Today’s proposed consent decree is a significant step toward improving the care of individuals incarcerated in Cumberland County who are struggling with serious mental health disorders, and toward protecting the civil rights that are guaranteed by our Constitution.”  “This consent decree marks a significant milestone in the Justice Department’s efforts to combat discrimination against those with opioid use disorder and to protect the civil rights of people in our jails and prisons,” said Assistant Attorney General for Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Under this agreement, Cumberland County must provide adequate medical and mental health care, including access to life-saving medications, treatment for opiate withdrawal, and protection for those with a heightened risk of self-harm and suicide. We commend Cumberland County for working collaboratively with us to implement the reforms in this decree to protect the safety and constitutional rights of incarcerated people at Cumberland County Jail.”  “The opioid epidemic is a public health emergency that plagues too many communities across the country,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “Medications are a critically important tool in combatting the opioid crisis, and they save lives. By providing medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated individuals experiencing opiate withdrawal, officials at jails and prisons can take significant steps to both combat the opioid epidemic and protect the constitutional rights of their populations.”  In June 2018, following suicides at the jail by six incarcerated people denied medication-assisted treatment, the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey initiated the investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. That statute authorizes the Justice Department to address a pattern or practice of deprivation of constitutional rights of individuals confined to state or local government-run correctional facilities. In January 2021, the Department found reasonable cause to believe that Cumberland County’s failure to provide medication-assisted treatment to incarcerated people with opioid use disorder, together with its failure to offer adequate mental health and suicide prevention measures, violated the rights of incarcerated individuals. The Department also identified measures necessary to remedy the unlawful conditions.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is available on its website at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section. Additional information about the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey’s Civil Rights Division is available at: https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/civil-rights-enforcement.

He wanted a career that allowed him to help children as much as possible by prescribing meds and providing therapy.  Bender, who still has a boyish face at 35, wears his hair neatly combed and prefers plaid shirts (he never wears a doctor’s coat). He’s a horror-movie fan: His office décor includes a poster from “Halloween” and small figurines like Pennywise, Wolf Man and Stripe from “Gremlins.” With his patients (who don’t see him in his office), Bender plays the role of curious, open-minded confidant. By the time he gets to them, some children are, as he put it to me, “so done” — frustrated by school, parents, on-and-off-again friendships, romantic relationships, their lack of control over much of anything, life. “They are mad, so mad,” he says. One threw apple juice in his face; two girls threatened to kill him after they said they found his address on the internet. “I tell kids, please hate me if you need to,” he says. “I prefer you hate me instead of your parents.”  His goal is to understand how it feels to be them, not to tell them what they need to do. “When you can’t make sense of your despair, I can make sense,” says Bender, who has won several teaching and clinical-care awards. “Not ‘expert’ sense, but a realistic sense of what may be going on. I can help them feel contained and engage them. Or not react in the same way as their family. I’m not going to understand everything while they are here. But we can find a closer gray about what the real story is. And, hopefully, help parents do so, too.”  As he talked, more children were waiting at the hospital’s Psychiatric Emergency Services, six floors below. The PES (pronounced Pez) is the first stop when children and adolescents come to Western Psych’s emergency department after passing through security and handing over their phones and bags. To fill out forms, they have to use soft, bendable plastic pens, so they can’t harm themselves or others. (For the same reason, the bathrooms’ metal toilets have nondetachable seats.) TVs play cartoons, cooking shows, Hallmark movies. The only available phone is attached to the wall. Patients often spend hours in one of two pediatric waiting areas, sometimes wearing hospital gowns after having been transferred from another medical center. They sit in the blue-and-orange plastic chairs around a table with board games or in leather chairs that fold out to become single beds. Some patients stay overnight — or several nights — when Bender’s unit cannot accommodate them.  Psychiatrists at PES interview children and their parents (or other caregivers) separately, to figure out if the patients needs to be admitted or if a referral for outpatient care, which can include crisis services, will be enough. Most teenagers who experience suicidal thoughts don’t need to be hospitalized and most don’t kill themselves (about 2,800 did in 2021). Psychiatrists have to weigh the possible protective factor of admitting a child against the reality of limited beds and the fact that hospitalization can make anxiety worse, which can drive adolescents away from mental health care altogether.  Medical professionals use the word “suicidality” to refer to a range of thoughts and actions, from passive death wishes, like the desire to go to bed and not wake up, to more active thoughts and, at the most extreme, suicide attempts and death. Though we know a lot about some causes of suicidality — mood disorders, child abuse, substance use — experts don’t understand why the numbers have been rising, on the whole, over the last decade. Some blame social media, which can both deprive children of sleep — the lack of which is associated with increased suicidal thoughts — and increase loneliness and feelings of being left out (even as it offers helpful communities for children, especially those who feel marginalized). Since 2020, the pandemic has likely been another factor.  Systemic conditions can also fuel anxiety, anger, dread and, in turn, suicidal thoughts and actions among particular groups — Black children facing trauma and persistent racism, for example, or trans children forced to use the wrong bathroom for them at school and made to feel ostracized, unseen and alone. Rates of suicidality in both populations have increased in recent years. “Ignore the social and family context at your peril,” says Brent, who has tracked the rise in adolescent suicide for years."

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), today announced more than $200 million in new funding for states, territories, and tribes to build local capacity for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and related crisis services.  “Thanks to President Biden, we are finally and seriously saying to Americans struggling with their mental health: Support is Here!” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Support is here in 988, the three-digit Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, and this new funding reflects our commitment to strengthening the crisis care system across our country so Americans can get the care they need.”  The $200.15 million in new funding opportunities for the 988 Lifeline includes:  $177.35 million to states and U.S. territories to: improve local response; enhance recruiting, hiring, and training of 988 workforce; implement additional technology and security measures to support infrastructure and effectively coordinate across the crisis continuum; improve support and service for high-risk and underserved populations, including quality assurance and review of critical incidents; and develop and implement comprehensive communication plans,  $17.8 million to federally recognized Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to: improve response, ensure access to culturally competent 988 crisis center support, improve integration and support and ensure navigation and follow-up care, and  $5 million for 988 Lifeline crisis follow-up programs that will allow call centers to provide systematic follow-up of suicidal persons who reach out to the 988 Lifeline, enhanced coordination of crisis stabilization, including with 911 and emergency service providers, reduction of unnecessary police engagement and improved connections for high-risk populations.  The Biden-Harris Administration has made an unprecedented investment of nearly $1 billion to support the 988 Lifeline, including an initial $432 million to support the transition to 988 in July 2022, to build up crisis center capacity and to provide special services, including a sub-network for Spanish speakers. Additional funding for the 988 Lifeline has been provided by the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the federal FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Prior to this investment, the Lifeline, which existed since 2005 as a 1-800 number, had been long underfunded and under-resourced.  “The timely investments in the 988 Lifeline at the federal, state and local levels are helping ensure that many more people in crisis are getting the help and support they need,” said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Data continues to show an increase in overall calls, texts and chats from the year prior, and at the same time, answer rates are significantly improving, which means that more people are getting help and they are getting help more quickly, which is crucial for someone in crisis.”  Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most 988 Lifeline callers are significantly more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed, and more hopeful.  In 2021, according to SAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 4.8% of adults ages 18 or older (about 12.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide, and among adolescents ages 12 to 17, 12.7% (about 3.3 million people) had serious thoughts of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people aged 10–14 and 25–34 years.

But saying which disease or condition causes the most pain is subjective because people experience pain differently.  According to U.S. News & World Report, passing a kidney stone is one of the most painful medical conditions you can have.  News Medical Life Sciences lists sickle cell disease as one of the 20 most painful chronic conditions, with episodes of pain occurring when sickle-shaped red blood cells block small blood vessels.  McGill University in Canada has a “pain index” based on a questionnaire that asks people to describe what kind of pain they experience. The index consistently lists CRPS as the worst known pain to humans.  Verywell Health reports that fibromyalgia is one of the most common pain conditions, affecting 10 million people in the U.S. and causing widespread body pain, sleep problems, fatigue and distress.  After living with multiple pain conditions for over 20 years and speaking with tens of thousands of other patients, I no longer believe it matters which type of pain a person has or who has the most pain. We all experience pain. How much pain we feel depends on the individual and a host of other factors, such as genetics, life experiences, and whether effective treatment is available and affordable. That is what matters.  When we do not manage pain effectively, suicides go up. We also see drug abuse and misuse rise. According to a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 5% to 7% of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are intentional suicides. Many of those deaths are pain patients.  Since 2011, we have seen a steady decrease in opioid prescribing. Be it acute or chronic, providers are weary of prescribing opioids for pain. It’s not because opioids don’t work. More often than not, the reason they stop prescribing is because they have invested so much into becoming a provider (education, cost, time, family and social connections) that they are now at risk of losing due to laws and medical guidelines based on misleading information about opioids.  We need to get away from the generalities of treating pain and into individualized patient care. It may or may not involve pain medication, surgery, implants, cognitive therapy and other treatments. For those who have the audacity to say that anyone else should remain in pain because you are not comfortable with their form of treatment -- shame on you.  I have chosen not to use opioids for over 10 years because I have other options that work for me. I want all people to get whatever treatment they need to control their pain. It will be different for each of us and whatever condition or comorbidities we live with. We all need and deserve to get the care we choose after careful consideration, research and discussions with our providers. Laws and guidelines should not be used to take away medications that have been available since the beginning of time.  At a recent pain education event I attended, I heard the argument that there were no long-term studies on the use of opioids for pain. But there are millions of patients who have taken opioids safely for years who will tell you otherwise. Opioids actually gave them more life, because they were able to work, exercise and function when their pain was properly managed.  As a pain patient myself, I want the freedom to do what is best for me. I am currently working on getting access to ketamine infusions again after my ketamine clinic closed down. I want that same right in selecting treatment to be available to others. It should be left to patients and their providers to decide on treatment, without interference from others.

She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), cordial partner of The Sting. The opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writers and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.  The COVID-19 pandemic has put significant pressure on healthcare systems and healthcare providers, leading to high levels of stress and burnout among healthcare staff, and has raised concerns about the increased risk of suicide among this group. Burnout can have a significant impact on the well-being of healthcare providers, as well as the quality of care they are able to provide to patients.  The exact number of healthcare staff who have been lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to determine as it varies by country and region. While it is difficult to determine exact numbers, some reports have indicated increased suicide rates among physicians during the pandemic.  A study published in JAMA Network Open in 2021 analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and found that between January and December 2020, 239 physicians died by suicide in the United States. This represents an increase from previous years, although it is important to note that suicide is a complex issue and cannot be attributed solely to the pandemic.  In response to concerns about physician suicide, organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have called for increased resources and support for healthcare providers. This includes initiatives such as providing access to mental health resources and promoting the destigmatization of seeking help for mental health concerns.  To address healthcare mental health and burnout, there are several steps that can be taken.    1: Healthcare organizations should prioritize the well-being of their staff by providing access to mental health resources, promoting self-care, and addressing workload issues. This can include providing time off, implementing workload management strategies, and adjusting staffing levels to reduce stress and burnout.  2: Healthcare organizations should promote a culture of teamwork and collaboration, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and overwhelm among healthcare providers. This can be achieved by creating opportunities for staff to connect with one another, work together on projects, and share ideas and experiences. Encouraging teamwork and collaboration can help healthcare staff feel supported and engaged in their work, reducing the risk of burnout.    3: Develop Support Networks: Healthcare providers benefit from a strong support network, including colleagues, mentors, and peer groups. Developing support networks within healthcare organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare providers. Let’s also raise awareness in public about how important mental health is to the healthcare staff in their community. Compassion for All.    4: Promote a Culture of Self-Care: Healthcare organizations can promote a culture of self-care by providing access to wellness programs, stress-management techniques, and mental health resources. Encouraging healthcare staff to take care of themselves can help prevent burnout and improve the overall well-being of healthcare providers.    5. Implement Work-Life Balance Policies: Healthcare providers often have demanding schedules and work long hours. Policies supporting work-life balance, such as flexible schedules, remote work options, and time off, can help prevent burnout.    6: Address Workload Issues: High workloads and long hours are major contributors to burnout in healthcare providers. Healthcare organizations can address workload issues by adjusting staffing levels, providing time off, and implementing workload management strategies that allow healthcare providers to focus on high-priority tasks.    7: Increase Staffing: One of the most important factors contributing to burnout is understaffing. To prevent burnout, healthcare organizations need to ensure that they have adequate staffing levels to meet patient needs. This can be achieved through a combination of recruitment, retention, and training programs.    8: Provide Mental Health Support: Healthcare providers may experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues because of their work. Providing access to mental health support, such as counseling and therapy services, can help prevent burnout and support the well-being of healthcare providers.    9: Ensure Adequate Resources: Providing healthcare staff with the resources they need to do their jobs effectively can help prevent burnout. This can include access to up-to-date technology and medical equipment, as well as adequate funding and support for research and development.    10: Increase Compensation and Benefits: Healthcare providers are often underpaid for their work. Increasing compensation and benefits can help reduce financial stress and prevent burnout.  11: Provide Professional Development Opportunities: Healthcare organizations should invest in professional development opportunities for their staff. This can help keep healthcare providers engaged and motivated in their work and prevent burnout by providing opportunities for growth and career advancement. This improves the overall quality of care provided to patients.  12: Policymakers should address systemic issues within healthcare systems that contribute to burnout, such as inadequate resources and administrative burdens. This can include implementing policies that provide funding and support for research and development and addressing issues related to healthcare access and affordability. Addressing these issues through policy changes can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of healthcare staff.    Implementing these strategies can help prevent burnout and improve the well-being of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a stronger healthcare system. It is important to recognize the impact of burnout on healthcare staff and advocate for policies that promote staff well-being and resilience.Overall, addressing healthcare burnout requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes the well-being of healthcare providers, promotes collaboration and teamwork, invests in professional development, and addresses systemic issues within healthcare systems.  It is important to prioritize the mental health and well-being of healthcare providers and to continue to raise awareness about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This can help reduce stigma and promote access to resources and support for those who may be struggling.

Ron DeSantis of Florida passed the “Paternal Rights in Education” bill also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill (HB 1557). The bill restricts “teachers and school districts from discussing gender identity and topics surrounding sexuality in the classroom.” The law has been in effect for the 2022-23 school year. Although this measure primarily affects Florida’s LGBTQ community and their freedom of speech, many anti-transgender bills similar to this one are being considered across all states.  Even here in the state of Connecticut, there is a bill proposed regarding a student’s “biological gender.”  Connecticut House Bill 6331 proposes that “public school educators are required to recognize each student by the biological gender of the student.” Even though the bill is unlikely to pass, I believe even the proposal of this bill can lead to an unsafe environment and disparities in health, particularly mental health, and it should be called out.  The author of HB 6331, State Rep. Joe Hoxha, (R-Bristol) does not seem to notice the difference between biological (assigned) sex and gender identity. Biological sex is the sex assigned at birth based on the infant’s anatomical and biological characteristics. Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of being; whether that is male, female, or something else.  There is no such terminology as “biological gender.”  Megan Gaffney  Why would Rep. Hoxha use that term rather than the proper term, biological sex? The wording shows that Rep. Hoxha does not understand the issue, nor has he done enough research to know what term to use when drafting the bill. Was Rep. Hoxha aware that biological gender is not the proper term? Why is he drafting legislation on a subject he hasn’t researched?  Schools need to provide a safe and accepting environment for all students, yet many LGBTQ young people experience bullying, harassment, and other discrimination because of their gender identity. A national survey by GLSEN has found that “75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who can persevere had significantly lower GPAs, were more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and were less likely to plan on continuing their education.”  If school administrators ignore these students by refusing to acknowledge their gender identity and even penalize them for expressing it, they can put kids at risk.  A survey by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community, provided some key findings, showing that approximately 45% of LGBTQ youth have had suicidal ideation within the past year, 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide within the past year, and 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted to receive mental health treatment were not able to receive it in the past year.  Federal and state laws and “the U.S. Constitution prohibits discrimination, bullying, and harassment against students because they’re transgender. This includes Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools.”  There are 16 states, including Connecticut, that have laws that prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals. In New Haven Public Schools “a student has the right to be addressed by a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required, and the student need not change his or her official records.”  But even though here in Connecticut transgender individuals have protection, there have still been debates about transgenders athletes in the news. Four cisgender women, formerly high school athletes in Connecticut, sued the state for its trans-inclusive policies, saying that, “allowing transgender women to compete in high school girls’ sports put them at an athletic disadvantage.” While they lost their case last year, they have sought to revive it.  We should recognize that we are lucky that Connecticut has strong protections for transgender individuals. While this bill is unlikely to pass, Connecticut residents should greet Rep. Hoxha’s proposal of the bill with a resounding “no.”  To repurpose a phrase from our Southern neighbors, “Don’t Florida my Connecticut!” The anti-LGBTQ policies of Florida do not have a place here in Connecticut.

A new retrospective study with up to 40 years of follow-up shows significant reductions in death rates from all causes and cause-specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants with severe obesity, according to a new study published in Obesity, The Obesity Society’s (TOS) flagship journal.  The study also found evidence suggesting increased risk of death from chronic liver disease, in addition to higher death rates from suicide in younger patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The study’s authors observe that the findings of increased suicide rates among younger patients who have had bariatric surgery may promote more aggressive, pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up.  As a result of the decades-long durability of bariatric surgery in reducing death from all causes and decreasing deaths related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer compared to matched participants, researchers note the findings may not only increase interest in bariatric surgery treatment for patients with severe obesity but, in addition, further stimulate important research related to the discovery of physiologic and biomolecular mechanisms leading to non-surgical treatment that results in weight loss and improved mortality similar to that achieved by bariatric surgery, said Ted D. Adams, Intermountain Surgical Specialties/Digestive Health Clinical Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine and Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Adams is the corresponding author of the study.  Experts explain that multiple association studies connecting bariatric surgery and mortality outcomes have been reported, predominantly retrospective, with wide variation in study design pertaining to participant number, control cohorts, mean follow-up, procedure type, age at surgery, clinical end points such as life expectancy and death rates for all causes and specific causes, and presence or absence of prevalent diabetes. The new study builds upon the groups’ reported mortality outcomes following gastric bypass surgery by extending follow-up to 40 years, tripling the number of surgical patients, and using four, instead of one, bariatric surgery procedures.  Researchers used data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) for the current study. The UPDB includes linked, population-based information from Utah with statewide birth and death certificates, driver licenses and ID cards, and voter registration cards. The UPDB creates and maintains links between the database and the medical records held by the two, largest healthcare providers in Utah.  Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in Utah between 1982 and 2018 were identified from three, large bariatric surgical practices in Salt Lake City, Utah, and from medical records from the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouses in Salt Lake City. Non-surgical participants were selected from Utah driver license records or ID cards. Because driver licenses are generally renewed every five years, multiple records were available for selection for matching to the bariatric surgeries.  Nearly 22,000 participants with bariatric surgery and without were matched (1:1) for age, sex, body mass index and surgery date with a driver license/renewal date. Mortality rates were compared by Cox regression and stratified by sex, surgery type, and age at surgery. Whereas mortality after gastric bypass surgery was previously reported from 1984 to 2002, this study extends mortality follow-up through 2021. The four bariatric surgery procedures included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and bilio-pancreatic diversion with duo-denal switch.  Results revealed that all-cause mortality was 16% lower in patients who had bariatric surgery compared to non-surgical participants. Lower mortality was observed for both males and females. Mortality after surgery versus non-surgery decreased by 29%, 43%, and 72% for cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, respectively. Death rates for males and females from chronic liver disease were 83% higher in patients who had surgery compared to non-surgical participants. The hazard ratio for suicide was 2.4 times higher in surgery compared with non-surgery participants, primarily in individuals with ages at surgery between 18 and 34 years.  “This important study adds to the mounting evidence that bariatric surgery, not only improves quality of life for patients, but will also increase their life expectancy. This work will hopefully improve patients’ access to this effective treatment for obesity, which is still limited to only one percent of qualified patients. Also, the study highlights the importance of providing more resources for pre-surgical psychological screening and post-surgery follow-up, especially for younger patients,” said Jihad Kudsi, MD, MBA, MSF, DABOM, FASMBS, FACS, Bariatric Surgery Division, Duly Health and Care, Downers Grove, Ill.

During the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, when farm foreclosures soared, crop insurance prices dropped and production costs went up, suicide rates among farmers began to rise. Brock stepped up to support farmers during those troubling times, said Scott Blubaugh, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative.  American Farmers and Ranchers Cooperative / A bronze relief of Mona Lee Brock.  “Most farmers were not equipped to handle the incredible stress and heartbreak for those that reached out,” Blubaugh said. “Mona Lee was one of the few that understood she was now not only ‘the angel on the other end of the line,’ but she was really a pioneer in farmers' mental health.”  Farmers and ranchers are almost twice as likely to die by suicide in the U.S. compared to people in other occupations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The uncertain factors that come with being a farmer, such as weather and changing commodity prices, can lead to a lot of stress.  “Mental health in our rural areas and our farming community, people were taught not to express your feelings, not to ask for help, pull yourself up by the bootstraps… and there's just certain times in people's lives that that's not enough,” Blubaugh said.  Farmers and ranchers who were helped by Brock also attended the dedication and shared how she impacted their lives and how they inspired them to go on and help others.  Jim Esbenshade, a farmer from Colbert, shared the difficult time in his life when his son had suddenly passed away at the same time his farm went under foreclosure and Brock helped him and his family through it.  “She let us know it wasn't the end of the world, that there's light out there and there's people to help us. And I’m proof of that today,” he said. “She filled a big spot in my life and in a lot of people's lives. And I went with her to see people that were on the verge of committing suicide.”  AFR offers mental health resources to farmers through its Farm Stress Management Team, as well as trains producers to work with struggling farmers. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated $500,000 to ODAFF to expand mental health resources to farmers and ranchers.  “The farm suicide rate is once again beginning to increase over the last decade, but I am proud to say that thanks to Mona Lee’s original efforts, we are more prepared this time, and there are many more people that are willing to answer calls and help our farmers and ranchers,” Blubaugh said.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize the need for greater connection to military members and veterans by designating Nov. 12, 2023, as ""National Warrior Call Day."" The duo led a similar resolution in 2022 that passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent. The resolution this year is initially supported by 20 senators.  Led by the Troops First Foundation, Warrior Call is a coast-to-coast push that engages all Americans to build and maintain meaningful relationships with servicemembers and veterans in order to help curtail suicide deaths.  Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it. Tweet this  Simple by design, Warrior Call asks Americans to make a call to a veteran or servicemember and connect them with support if they need it, because isolation often is a precursor to suicidal ideation. In addition, many veterans may be suffering from undiagnosed brain injuries that can mimic mental illness and other ailments that spur isolation.  ""We thank Sens. Shaheen, Cotton and all cosponsors for their help in elevating this initiative and helping push the message to the grassroots level,"" said Frank Larkin, COO of Troops First and Chair of Warrior Call. ""We are hopeful the resolution will again move through the Senate, that leaders in the U.S. House will join in too, and that ultimately as many people as possible will work this year to help troops and vets through simple yet critical connection. It is not hyperbole to say a single call can turn a life around.""  Sitting on key committees in the Senate, the senators are strong advocates for the troops and veterans.  According to the most recent data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 6,146 veterans died by suicide in 2020. The unadjusted rate of suicide among U.S. veterans was 31.7 suicide deaths per 100,000, compared to 16.1 per 100,000 for civilians. After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide was 57% higher for veterans than for non-veteran adults.  The government, however, may still be drastically underestimating suicide deaths. Many other deaths may not be reported or classified as suicide because the evidence doesn't support a death determination. This is a statistical ""gray zone,"" especially as society wrestles with alcohol and opioid addiction.

Within weeks of her passing the family named their charity ‘We Mind & Kelly Matters,’ emerging from their immense grief, shock, and anger that ‘Kelly mattered’. Following the charity set up, numerous fundraising events began, and the band of resolute fundraisers and followers were aptly named Kelly’s Heroes.  The two largest events, consisted of cycle rides from John O’Groats to Lands’ End in 2020, and again The Loneliest Road Cycle Tour across Europe, and New York to San Francisco in 2022. Teams of cyclists rode as Kelly’s Heroes, who not only raised in excess of £300k, created enormous awareness for mental health whilst breaking down stigma around suicide.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  John Hewitt, Kelly’s dad, and co-founder of the charity explained:  ‘The renaming marks an exciting new chapter for the charity. Having organised the Kelly’s Heroes cycle rides, I’ve trained and ridden with those heroes and the charity evolved, developing expertise and forming its own identity, growing from a foundation of pure grief to a place of hope. The family and also the cyclists have met with some of the recipients of where the funding goes, people who have used the support, accessed bereavement workshops and more, and it quickly became clear to us, that they are all heroes, each and every one of them. We will always want Kelly’s name to be remembered and we think the new name is a fitting tribute to her memory and the tireless work put in by our staff and supporters over the last 4 years’.  Kelly’s Heroes hopes to continue breaking down barriers and open up more conversations around the importance of not only managing your mental health but maintaining and promoting good positive wellbeing. Recognising the importance of early interventions, providing accessible mental health support, as well as offering bespoke training to local schools, businesses, and communities around mental health and suicide prevention. Mental health deserving a space for conversation.  CEO, Sherry Adams added:  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ‘The charity was founded around two purposes, to raise much needed funding, and to enable people in need to get support when they need it. The two are coming together under one name, one identity, all the events and work every fundraiser undertakes, all the donations they all underpin our support services, it became clear we needed just one name. Through changing to solely “Kelly’s Heroes”, it better reflects the ethos of all that we do, and that everyone who either works for the charity, fundraises for the charity, or bravely reaches out for support, they are all Kelly’s Heroes. If you cycle thousands of miles, run a marathon with tired limbs, have a cake sale, or be the one that reaches out and asks for help when you are feeling low, each and every person has mental health, and all of those actions are admirable, brave and determined, defining heroic’.  Rachael Hewitt, Kelly’s mum, and co-founder of the charity said:  ‘We are incredibly proud of what we have been able to achieve in the first four years, and in awe of all those who have reached out and recognised they needed support with their mental health. We are now looking forward to building on our identity as Kelly’s Heroes and aim to support more people and earlier, ideally before any crisis. We want to offer new services, support and activities that help promote and maintain good positive well-being, for adults and young people. Including all those who have found support and are in recovery, the earlier people get support the better for everyone, and our community. It’s our ambition and aspiration to help people live well and stay well, that will be fitting for Kelly’s legacy.’  Kelly’s Heroes will continue to support with free services, including 365 days of online support, every evening from 6-9pm, their ‘Listening Ear’ service offers emotional support to everyone, for anyone struggling to manage good positive wellbeing, to dealing with poor mental health, suicide ideation, and bereavements by suicide.

Services are on offer for everyone, whether it be someone who wants advice on staying well or wanting to make lifestyle changes, through to those looking for structured counselling and one to one support.  The training courses available range from Mental Health First Aid through to Safeguarding from Suicide, and are available to schools, colleges, universities, businesses, charities, and everyone in the community. All funds raised by delivering training go directly back to supporting people in need.  Amy Hewitt, Kelly’s sister, and co-founder of the charity added:  ‘Millions of people of all ages from all walks of life are experiencing issues with their mental health and so many struggle to find help, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to take the first step in getting support. With the charity and now the support services being known as Kelly’s Heroes it will broaden the awareness of the charity. It starts with where funds are being raised, through to accessing support services, and booking a training course and coming along to an awareness event. You can be one of Kelly’s Heroes, no matter how you are involved, in whatever capacity, whatever you do, or wherever you are.’  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad"

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Today marks the anniversary of the end of the Azovstal siege, sometimes described as “Ukraine’s Dunkirk”.  The three-month battle for Mariupol ended with a last-ditch defence of the city’s steelworks that inspired a wave of international sympathy.  Russia almost completely flattened Mariupol with endless airstrikes and artillery barrages. The destruction of the one of the city's maternity units and Mariupol's theatre, where hundreds of people were taking shelter, shocked the world.  READ MORE: Bombing hospitals, gassing children - the bloody atrocities of ‘Butcher of Mariupol’  But the massive Azovstal iron and steel works remained, described by witnesses as a “fortress within the city”.  Putin ordered his troops to blockade the plant, “so not even a fly can escape”.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  The main Ukrainian unit sealed inside the sprawling steelworks was The Azov Regiment, a force developed from a far-right all-volunteer militia that was often used in Russian propaganda broadcasts as evidence that Ukraine was run by “Nazis”.  They were reinforced by regular Ukrainian marines and foreign volunteers.  Hundreds of civilians had also taken refuge in the factory's miles of tunnels.  (Image: Interior Ministry of the Donetsk)  Conditions inside the dark, freezing and badly-ventilated underground base started as bad, and became truly horrific as stocks of food, water and vital medicines dwindled.  Amputations were carried out with little or no anaesthetic and the defenders ran dangerously low on ammunition.  One defender said: “It feels like I’ve landed in a hellish reality show in which us soldiers fight for our lives and the whole world watches this interesting episode. Pain, suffering, hunger, misery, tears, fears, death. It’s all real.”  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  A desperate helicopter airlift was put in place to resupply the defenders.  Between March 21 and May 11 last year, a total of 15 helicopters and 45 aircrew made nearly 30 rescue missions to Azovstal.  They delivered communications gear from Elon Musk’s Starlink company as well as ammunition and medicine. On the return flights the helicopters were loaded with wounded Ukrainian fighters.  (Image: Ukrainian President Administrati)  Six flights successfully completed the mission and returned. More than 20 did not.  The helicopters were stripped of any non-essential gear to make the deadly journey through a ring of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.  Colonel Hryhorii, a squadron leader in the 12th Brigade of Army Aviation, told The Times: “Everything that was unnecessary was unloaded from the aircraft to make way for the cargo, even the machineguns.  “The pilots saw their task and understood it was dangerous to the point of impossible. But no one refused.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  One of the pilots, who gave his names “Ginger” explained that while the first resupply missions caught the Russians by surprise, subsequent mission were more dangerous: “The next flights looked like impudence on our part,” Ginger said.  “They were waiting for us. Every helicopter was fired upon, many of them taking damage.”On March 31, four Mi-8 helicopters made the trip, escorted by a Hind Mi-24 attack helicopter for cover.  As the Hind took on Russian anti-aircraft emplacements two of the transports here hit with shoulder-mounted ground-to-air missiles: “One was shot down and the other returned with only one engine,” Ginger said. “But he brought 22 wounded back.”  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  As the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest reached its climax, the frontman for the winning basin – Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra, begged the massive TV audience: “I ask all of you, please help Azovstal, right now!”  Finally, on May 16, President Zelenskyy told the defenders it was time to surrender. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” he said.  Even then, the fighters’ torment was not over.  Oksana, an Azovstal employee, told The Guardian: “No one came out of there unchanged. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.”  (Image: ALESSANDRO GUERRA/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  One of the fighters, Mykhailo Dianov, told Sky News after his release from a Russian POW camp he thought he would never survive: “We thought this every day. At Azovstal we thought it was the end.  “After a month of starvation, when you close your eyes, you forget about your family, everything. The only thing you think about is food.” He lost over six stone during the siege.  In the Russian prisoner-of-war camp, he said, the guards “treated us like animals. It was impossible to eat.”  (Image: President.gov.ua)  As the 2,500 Ukrainian fighters emerged from the ruined steel plant, they were loaded onto buses and shipped off to destinations in Russian -occupied territory. For months their fate remained a mystery.  The Kremlin hinted at trials, and possible death sentences.  But then, in September, Kyiv announced that over 200 POWs had been returned as part of a prisoner swap deal, including Lt Colonel Denys Prokopenko, the Azov Battalion’s commander.  But by the end of the year, some 1,000 Azov soldiers remained prisoners of war. And Ukrainian officials say that the bodies of an unknown number of soldiers still lie buried under the rubble of Azovstal.

A notable exception is the suicide rate among children and adolescents.  According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate among people aged 17 and under was 1.2 per 100,000 in 2000. However, the figure more than doubled to 2.7 in 2021. The comparable rate primarily for middle school students aged 12-14 jumped nearly fivefold, from 1.1 to 5.0 persons.  That, along with Korea's lowest birthrate worldwide, casts doubt on this society's health and sustainability. So many buds wither or are trampled long before they blossom. What has gone wrong?  Suicide by teenagers, and its weaker or preceding stage of reclusion, are due to the avoidance of social activities such as study and play. Another possible cause is society itself teeming with limitless greed and competition. All parents here wish the worldly successes of money and reputation for their children ― and only that. Kids unable or unwilling to go all the way drop out of the rat race.  Korea may not be alone. But nowhere else are these phenomena more severe than here. This country industrialized and democratized itself over the span of just two generations and is the only one among 140 nations that became independent after World War II. It is the fifth hardest-working country in the OECD and perhaps the only one that can make Japan appear lazy. Korea and its establishment deserve praise for that and may as well have pride.  However, according to a survey conducted by the vernacular daily Dong-A Ilbo, 29.4 percent of people in their 20s said they ""don't like being Korean."" As reasons, they pointed to their country being ""too competitive,"" ""complicated,"" and ""exhausting."" Young Koreans think they have nothing to do with their country's or parents' accomplishments. These only pressure and discourage youngsters who will not and cannot repeat what their seniors did. For the poor, the increasingly hierarchical society also appears hopeless.  In this gloomy social atmosphere, various websites and online communities are mushrooming into the dark side of this IT-savvy country.  About a month ago, a girl in middle school jumped to her death from a 19-story building in Seoul's Gangnam District. The suicide was streamed live on Instagram and viewed by dozens of people. The operator of the website believed to be responsible for abetting the suicide has rejected a police request for a voluntary and temporary shutdown, maintaining that other online sites will continue to remain open. The Korea Communications Standards Commission does not enforce its closure, citing ""freedom of expression."" Meanwhile, two more teenagers attempted copycat suicides but failed.  The incident reveals two problems.  First, numerous ugly and wicked adults are bent on abusing and exploiting disoriented teenagers. They approach young victims online disguised as helpers, but abuse them sexually and financially offline, encouraging self-harm and suicide and extorting money. More and more teens fall prey to them amid social ignorance and legal leniency. Second, as one former victim said, there is the problem of having ""no other adults to talk to,"" forcing teenagers to visit these websites and risk danger. Parents and teachers are of no help to these desperate kids, some of whom are already injured, mentally if not physically.  What society should do is clear enough.  In the short term, the government must punish individuals and organizations that abuse children and adolescents. It should force relevant online communities to shut down voluntarily by enacting laws if necessary and prosecuting those responsible. Protecting young lives is far more important than freedom of expression. It should also open many ""anonymous"" ― instead of open and public ― websites through which these youth can communicate freely and frankly.  In the long term, this society and the country should rethink its direction. Korea, where its people, especially younger ones, are almost the unhappiest worldwide, should be where most can live while doing what they want to do without social alienation or economic want.  Aiming to be a wealthier and stronger country is okay. However, what good is this if people are unhappy?    (END)"

Suicide prevention services can also be reached at 888-568-1112 or 800-273-TALK (8255).First responders' jobs are traumatic almost by definition. They run toward the danger. They go into the burning building. They put themselves on the line to help the rest of us. How could that not take an emotional toll on them?Tragically, Bangor experienced a gutting recent reminder of that toll. A young firefighter, Jacob Madden , died by suicide in late April.""Jake was a loving and caring man, who always kept humor at the center of his life. His bright smile and consistent banter brought joy to everyone that he interacted with,"" his obituary reads. ""Jake had an eccentric and quirky personality that was irreplaceable. Those closest to him knew him as nostalgic, sentimental, and a true romantic. Above all, Jake was an extremely proud father and family man.""Bangor firefighter Jared Willey , president of Local 772 of the International Association of Firefighters , spoke with Bangor Daily News reporter Kathleen O'Brien about first responders struggling with mental health and the high risk of dying by suicide. Firefighters and police officers are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, according to the U. S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .Willey said that mental health support is available, but stigma and a ""suck it up and be a man mentality"" can be barriers to getting help.""We have to talk about mental health and suicide because, if we don't, we're not going to see change,"" Willey said. ""We don't want to lose another firefighter, so we have to make sure everyone feels comfortable enough to sit down and talk about it. If my back hurts because of a fire last week, I'm going to sit with others and complain about it and get it fixed. The same needs to go for mental health.""We could not agree more. That is true this month, with May being Mental Health Awareness Month, and it is true all year long. And this is an instance where everyone can help to be part of the solution. Across society, we need to normalize talking about and addressing mental health challenges. We owe it to the first responders who put their physical and emotional well-being on the line, just as we owe it to our neighbors, friends and family. There is nothing wrong with needing help.Aside from this universal, interpersonal step to help support firefighters and other first responders, there is also a much more bureaucratic step to take. O'Brien explained how the U.S. Fire Administration has only recorded six firefighter suicides since its On-Duty Firefighter Fatality Program's started in the 1970s. Other firefighter groups estimate that there are roughly 100 firefighter suicides each year in the U.S.Clearly, the Fire Administration's reporting system isn't fully tracking this issue, and that is a problem. To better address an issue like this, policymakers and the public need to be fully aware of its scope. That requires having accurate and comprehensive data.As O'Brien reported, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has said the Fire Administrator's system only counts on-duty deaths and relies on voluntary reporting, so the seemingly obvious steps would be to update those elements of the system. The federal government should find a more proactive way of collecting this information from departments across the country, and make sure to include off-duty deaths by suicide — because the trauma doesn't just shut off when a first responder is off the clock.""After that call and when you're left with your own thoughts is when it haunts you,"" Willey told O'Brien about witnessing tragedies on the job. ""Many people have night terrors because when you don't process those traumatic events, your brain re-lives it when you sleep.""First responders need to know that resources exist to help them process that trauma and that there is nothing wrong about needing that help.___"

That’s why one set of parents is bringing it to the forefront after losing their son to suicide.  Anthony Salas said his son, Ben was happy and cheerful. In a home video of a younger Ben, he can be seen sledding down a winter slope of snow and laughing the whole ride down. That laughter continued in another video of an older Ben, but the smile is just the same.  The videos showed snippets of what Ben revealed to the world, but it faded behind closed doors.  “Ben hid it so well, so to speak, and he covered it with mounds of normalcy,” Salas said.  In late April, Salas and his wife received a text message from the 21-year-old college student they would have never expected.  “He said that he made the tough decision to take his life,” Salas said.  On all accounts, Salas said his son was happy. Ben was a junior at North Carolina State. He was recruited to the rifle team and was talking about the future with his girlfriend.  “I couldn’t believe it. I just couldn’t believe it. To get a text message like that from someone that just I would have never in a million years suspected that he was going through, having these kind of thoughts and going down this path,” Salas said.  The grief is very much there, but Salas said he is not going to stay behind the wall of trauma.  He and his wife are choosing to share Ben’s story as well as theirs in hopes this won’t happen to someone else’s Ben.  “It is personal. It is hard. You know we lost our baby, so but I think it’s important my wife and I are committed to sharing Ben’s story and share our story,” Salas said. “Don’t settle for, ‘I’m okay’. It could be more and that’s where you really have to dig in and ask questions.”  If you or someone you know is considering hurting themselves, there’s help and hope out there.

The convict, S. D. Gafoor, complained to Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge court in Rangareddy court complex that at the behest of the prison superintendent an under-trial prisoner assaulted him by fingering his private parts. “I have attempted suicide unable to bear this third degree torture of fingers being forcibly put into my anus. Officers hitting me with lathis. I am unable to practice my religion and having to face daily torture and humiliation,” Gafoor said in his complaint to the IV Additional MSJ.  Mr. Gafoor was serving sentence in the prison and facing a couple of other cases. He was brought to the court by the prison authorities for appearance in other cases on Tuesday. Soon after being presented before the judge, the prisoner started narrating the alleged torture by the prison authorities. Mr. Roy, Krishnamurthy, Venkat Reddy and Satya hand-cuffed and beaten with fiber lathis, he charged. “Venkat Reddy kicked me in my face and my legs. I got bleeding injuries in my mouth,” he told the judge.  With the judge asking him to give a specific complaint, advocate D. Suresh Kumar of Indian Association of Peoples Lawyers (who was present in the court) volunteered to file vakalat to represent Mr. Gafoor. Mr. Kumar informed the court oral statement of the prisoner was sufficient for the judiciary to act upon on the issue. As Mr. Gafoor spoke in Urdu and Hindi, a young lawyer Rizwan present in the court came forward to assist the court.  He translated Mr. Gafoor’s complaint into English and presented it to the court. The prisoner explained to the court that he had slashed his head and neck with a blade on Monday, a day after being tortured by the prison officials.  The prisoner charged that constables of the prison made him consume soap water. According to him, Venkat Reddy and Satya threatened to implicate him in narcotics cases. Mr. Gafoor told the court that magistrates were not visiting the under-trial prisoners who were confined in single cells. They were only visiting the general barrack, he said.  On receiving the written complaint of the prisoner, the judge directed the prison authorities to take him to conduct medical examination of the injuries Mr. Gafoor had sustained. When the government counsel requested the court to hear prison officials’ contentions, the judge said he would listen to them eventually. The matter was posted to May 30 for next hearing."

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Sign up for news and features from our diverse communities  A mental health hospital accused of attempting to 'cover-up' failures that contributed to a patient’s suicide has an 'issue with transparency', a senior staff member has admitted. Winbourne Charles, 58, died in his room at Goodmayes Hospital, North East London, on April 10 2021, having spent five months undergoing treatment for depression with psychotic symptoms.  In an inquest last month, a jury ruled that the dad-of-two’s suicide was 'contributed to by neglect' and failure to protect him from an 'obvious risk of self-harm'. Senior coroner for East London Graeme Irvine accused staff at North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT) – which runs the hospital – of attempting to 'cover-up' evidence of failing to regularly check on Winbourne’s welfare.  READ MORE: Met Police officers investigated after man Tasered before falling to his death from fifth floor balcony  Nurses' notes claimed he was alive 2 days after he had died  These included 'factually inaccurate' records of when Ilford staff had observed him and 'governance process failings' that saw its failings left out of three internal reports about the suicide. Two nurses' entries to Winbourne’s observation notes claimed he was alive and 'wake in his bedroom' two days after he died.  NELFT’s integrated care director Bob Edwards told Redbridge Council’s health scrutiny committee that the trust has 'an issue with transparency', despite encouraging staff to speak up. He said: “We absolutely strive to make sure that safety is the highest possible objective.""  He continued: “I think for people in the inpatient services included in this particular case, we could have done very much better, which we accept as an organisation, and we need to make sure we do so in future.”  Where to get help if you're struggling You don't have to suffer in silence if you're struggling with your mental health.

Concerns raised in a 'prevention of future deaths' report issued by the coroner last week include the fact that an investigation signed off by the integrated care director 72 hours after Winbourne’s death did not admit that observations had been missed.  The trust’s final serious incident report, handed to the coroner before the inquest, also failed to address “poor” assessments of Winbourne’s risk of self-harm and “inadequate” information in previous reports.  Witnesses to the inquest reported nurses using the “cut and paste” function to record when they observed patients and senior staff admitted medical notes appeared “dishonest”.  Mr Irvine noted that two staff members declined to answer questions about the accuracy of their notes, instead invoking an inquest rule protecting themselves from self-incrimination.

Londeka is popularly known for her character as Nkanyezi on Showmax’s drama series, Adulting, produced by Tshedza Pictures.  During an interview with Lungelo KM on Engineer Your Life, the actress revealed that she wanted to kill herself because she felt like there was no purpose to her life.  “I remember that falling pregnant was the only thing that stopped me from killing myself. Before my daughter, Liyana, my life was not worth living.”  Bagging a role in Adulting  The actress said scoring a role in Adulting restored her acting dream she had already gave up on because she felt inadequate and thought she did not deserve a chance in the industry.  She also shared that acting alongside her real-life crush Thembinkosi Mthembu, who plays Bonga on the show, was quite a shock to her, especially after finding out that she would be playing Bonga’s love interest.  “The crush is gone now. We are all good and well. He has and continues to teach me a lot about the industry,” she said, adding that fame has brought a lot of attention to her from other male celebrities.  ALSO READ: REVIEW: ‘Adulting’ gets off to a sexy start  “Having sex on TV“  Londeka shared that her mother is a pastor, and she was nervous about telling her about her role as it included a lot of explicit scenes.  “When I told her that I was going to shoot this, she was excited for me because this is something I have been wanting to do. But I did not give her context to say this is exactly what we are shooting. When the first episode aired, she was excited and told the congregation, and I had to get off my phone for a while. We never spoke about it again,” she said.  Showmax aired the 8th episode of Adulting last Monday, which marked the end of season 1. However, the show topped the trending topics on Twitter yesterday as fans complained that Monday was not the same without the show.  The eight-part drama series tells the story of four varsity friends who are trying to find love and success after varsity. Their strong bond has held them together even as their journeys in life have taken them in very different paths.  NOW READ: Who is the anonymous witness in Senzo Meyiwa trial?

Huntsville Police Department (HPD) officers Pegues and Beckles were dispatched to the call. Upon arrival, Pegues drew her pistol and made a partial entry through the front door, thereby exposing half her body to the inside. She observed Parker sitting on a couch with what appeared to be a gun at his own head. She told Beckles, still outside, what she saw. Beckles informed police dispatch that Pegues had seen Parker with a gun to his head. [1]  Officer Darby heard Beckles’ radio call about “a guy with a gun … threatening suicide” and responded. Darby arrived and saw that Pegues had her gun drawn but pointed down. He commanded her to point her gun at Parker because he thought that Parker “could kill her.” Pegues moved completely into the residence and briefly raised her gun but almost immediately lowered it. Both Beckles and Darby followed her inside and demanded that Parker drop the weapon.  Pegues also pleaded with Parker to drop the weapon, but he kept it pointed at his head and refused to drop it. Darby, believing that all three officers were in danger of being shot, fired at Parker and killed him.  The Darby murder trial  Darby was charged with murder. After a jury trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Officer Pegues testified at Darby’s trial that prior to Darby’s arrival, she attempted to de-escalate the situation, but that once Darby entered the residence, she “could feel the tension just rising.” She testified that Parker didn’t threaten her or “do anything to make her believe he wanted to do anything other than commit suicide.”  Officer Beckles testified that “at no time during this event did he feel the need to take deadly force action.” He stated that Parker “didn’t make any overt action to” indicate that he was about to point his weapon at the officers. He estimated that Parker was ordered to drop the weapon about seven times but failed to comply.  An HPD detective investigated the shooting incident and testified that he found no evidence that Parker “ever made a hostile determination towards anybody other than himself.”  Officer Darby testified that upon entering the residence he realized that all three officers had no cover between them and Parker. He ordered Parker to drop the gun twice, but Parker refused. Darby shot and killed him. “Darby also presented testimony from three other law enforcement officers (expert witnesses) who each testified that Parker's refusal to put his weapon down constituted an imminent threat to the responding officers' lives.” [2]  After both sides presented their evidence, Darby requested the trial judge to charge the jury as follows: ""The reasonableness of an officer's actions in using deadly force must be objectively reasonable judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, the fact that officers are forced to make split-second decisions, and in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them at the time.”  In support of his requested jury instruction, Darby cited the United States Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [3] The trial judge rejected Darby’s requested instruction. Instead, the judge provided the jury with a general self-defense instruction that is available to all citizens who assert self-defense as a justification for their actions. This permitted the jury to examine Darby’s conduct from the perspective of an ordinary citizen rather than a trained law enforcement officer.  Darby appealed and argued that the trial judge delivered an erroneous self-defense instruction that permitted the jury to ignore, as irrelevant, the expert testimony from several witnesses that reasonable law enforcement officers would believe they were facing an imminent threat to their personal safety.  The decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals [4]  The Alabama Court of Appeals reversed Darby’s conviction and ordered that he receive a new trial. The court ruled that it was not bound to accept Darby’s offered instruction that was based upon the Supreme Court’s opinion in Graham v. Connor. The court explained that Graham does not govern a state court’s application of state criminal statutes because it “involved a civil action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” (The federal civil rights statute). [5] Nonetheless, the court observed that the Alabama legislature passed a self-defense statute designed for Alabama peace officers that states: ""A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes it necessary in order … [t]o defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force."" [6]  The court ruled that the trial judge erred by giving the jury a self-defense instruction designed for ordinary citizens instead of an instruction intended by the Alabama legislature to be used for peace officers in self-defense situations. The court explained, “[T]he Alabama Legislature has made clear that there is a unique standard to be used in judging a police officer's use of deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer. Thus, the proper perspective from which to evaluate a police officer's use of deadly force in such situations is indeed that of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  The court observed that the ordinary citizen self-defense instruction given to the jury permitted the jury to ignore “extensive testimony from multiple witnesses regarding the training a police officer receives with respect to confrontations with an armed person.” The court noted that this testimony “supported a finding that a reasonable police officer in Darby's situation could have concluded that Parker's conduct represented the imminent use of deadly force. In other words, that testimony supported a finding that Darby acted in self-defense or defense of another when he shot Parker.”  Lessons learned  Here’s a summary of the lessons law enforcement officers can take from this case:  Parker called the police himself and threatened suicide. There was no indication that there were other civilians in immediate danger. Once the first officer saw Parker with a gun to his head, her tactical response should have been to back out, take cover, call for help, set up a perimeter, request a mental health professional, and attempt to de-escalate and negotiate a peaceful surrender.  The tactical decision(s) by all three officers to completely enter the room and expose themselves to a person holding a gun was extremely dangerous and unnecessary. This involved an unforced error that dramatically escalated an already dangerous encounter.  Once the officers placed themselves in this precarious predicament, a strong argument can be made that the officers were faced with a significant threat to their personal safety.  An action/reaction study conducted by Dr. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, involved students holding training guns loaded with marking cartridges to their heads while being confronted by officers 10 feet away with training pistols pointed at the students. Each confrontation involved one student and one officer. The confrontation was repeated several times with different students and officers participating each time. Once the officers ordered the students to drop the guns, the students would attempt to shoot the officers as quickly as they could. The average time for the students to fire was .40 of a second. The average officer response time to fire was .40 of a second. The study demonstrates how fast a situation can turn from encountering a potential suicide subject to becoming the victim of a cop killer.  This case demonstrates the sobering reality that in prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter etc., state court judges can, as the court did in the instant matter, reject an officer’s legal defense grounded in the “objective reasonableness” use of force standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Graham v. Connor. [7]  As discussed, the murder conviction reversal was based not upon Graham but rather upon an Alabama statute that treated peace officers differently than ordinary citizens who claimed self-defense for their actions. The court ruled, “[W]here there is evidence to support a defendant police officer's claim that he used deadly force in self-defense or defense of another while acting in his capacity as a police officer, the trial court should instruct the jury to evaluate the defendant's actions from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the same situation.”  Police officials and police attorneys should ensure that officers under their command or counsel are made aware of the state deadly force standard that they would be judged by if charged with murder or manslaughter. Further, if the current state deadly force standard for officers criminally charged, is not favorable to law enforcement, strong consideration should be given to attempting to influence the state legislature to change the law to reflect more favorably upon law enforcement officers.  In 2019, the California legislature passed a new unfavorable deadly force statute for police officers that changed the deadly force standard for police officers from “reasonable” (Supreme Court’s Garner/Graham standard) to “necessary.” [8] Commenting on the new law, a recent University of Toledo Law Review article observed, ”the proposed law was tempered to allay concerns raised by police associations … the bill was watered down in an attempt to ensure its passage.” [9] The proposed law was amended by the California legislature to make it more acceptable for law enforcement due to pressure from police advocacy groups. The result, although unfavorable to police, could have been much worse.  The California law doesn’t define “necessary” but does state that deadly force may be used to “defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” [10] The law also contains language that suggests that imminent means immediate. [11] The California statute also permits examination of an officer’s pre-shooting conduct (which the Supreme Court suggests is not relevant in Graham v. Connor). [12]  The effect of the new California statute on prosecutions of police officers for murder/manslaughter is yet to be seen. Suffice it to say that California’s move away from the Supreme Court’s “reasonableness” standard to an undefined statutory “necessary” standard to govern police use of deadly force is likely to result in more criminal prosecutions and convictions of police officers in that state.  References  1. It would later be determined that Parker was holding ‘a flare gun that had been intentionally painted black,’ but there is no evidence indicating that any of the officers were aware of that fact.  2. Quote is taken from the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals opinion.  3. 490 U.S. 386 (1989}. In Graham, the Supreme Court created an objective reasonableness standard for police use of deadly force grounded in the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that “the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Further, the Court ruled that when police use of force situations are evaluated, the fact that officers are “forced to make split-second judgments” must be considered.  4. Darby v Alabama, (CR-20-0919) (3/24/23).  5. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals determined when reviewing state criminal statutes, it is not bound to follow a constitutionally grounded Fourth Amendment-based opinion of the United States Supreme Court regarding the standard for police use of deadly force. The Alabama court cited a quote from a California case, People v. Perry, 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 465, 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 522, 536 n.10 (2019) as authority for declining to follow Graham v. Connor regarding its application to a state’s criminal statutes. The California court ruled, “Perry contends throughout his briefing that we are bound to apply the standards articulated in Graham in this case. Graham was a civil rights action brought pursuant to section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code and it involved an alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment. Long-standing and deeply held principles of federalism counsel that we have no obligation to import those standards into our state law defining criminal offenses."""

A Border Police spokesman said the suspect ran toward the checkpoint near the settlement of Shaked, known as “checkpoint 300,” while brandishing a knife. “Border Police troops operating at the crossing fired at the terrorist and neutralized him,” the spokesman said. The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry identified the man as 33-year-old Ahmed Muhammad Atatreh, and said he had died of his wounds.  “Lone wolf” stabbing and car ramming attempts that result in the death of the attackers happen about once a week; there have been at least 13 of them this year  But the perpetrators of these attacks have different demographics than the Palestinian terrorists killed in arrest raids. They are usually older, often with families of their own, and they are sometimes women.  These incidents happen often enough that the attackers know very well what is going to happen. The soldiers they attack will almost never be injured, and the attackers will probably end up dead.  It doesn’t take much thinking to realize that these aren’t terror attacks. They are suicides.  If you are a troubled Palestinian, with emotional, relationship or money problems, traditional suicide is not an option. It is a major sin in Islam; Muslims who commit suicide are taught that they do not enter Paradise, and a suicide would bring shame on the rest of the family. But martyrdom is the opposite: it is honorable, and brings honor as well as monetary compensation to the families.  There are two guaranteed consequences of these attacks: the attackers will be honored as heroic martyrs, and their families will get a guaranteed income from the Palestinian Authority.  Suicidal Palestinians have an easy decision on how to kill themselves: one path towards shame and hellfire, and the other towards honor, Paradise, and guaranteed family income and security.  Although this is only a theory, it seems to be a compelling one. There are huge disincentives to traditional suicides and giant incentives to “suicide by IDF.” The way to verify it would be if the media would investigate the personal lives of the would-be stabbers and car rammers to see what their family situations were like, what their personalities were, and to dig beyond the relatives claiming that they were angry at Israel to see of there were any other things going on in their lives.  But, of course, no media bother to do that. Even though they have enormous resources at their disposal – look at how they reported on Shireen Abu Akleh’s death – as far a I know, no mainstream media have ever investigated the circumstances of these attackers’ lives.  And the reason for that is just as obvious: they have a narrative of Israeli evil, and they have no desire to disprove what “everybody knows.” Especially when doing so would bring the exact dishonor to the victims that they were trying to avoid.  This is another example of media bias by omission. And the world only sees the simplistic lies of desperate Palestinians driven to act by how terrible their lives are under “occupation.”  {Reposted from EoZ}"

In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to grow up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  “The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,” said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study. “This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.”  Recent research shows that since 2019 half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death – whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence – increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community. Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don’t own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020. The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  “For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,” said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center. “However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.”"

This conclusion has been made after the revenue department reached out out nearly five lakh families of farmers in the region as part of a survey conducted in December last year, Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrekar told reporters on Tuesday.  The Marathwada region, which comprises Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad and Parbhani districts, reported 1,023 farmer suicides in 2022.  As many as 10,431 farmers committed suicide in this region since 2001, as per figures provided by the divisional commissioner’s office.  Kendrekar said the administration studied the socio-economic condition of farmers and their families in the eight districts of Marathwada.  “The survey was conducted to find the families where farmers were vulnerable to taking the extreme step due to various conditions. The farmer suicide rate in Marathwada is more (compared to other parts of Maharashtra,” he said.  “Less crop yield, no good returns on crops, climatic conditions, problems due to wild animals and costly farming inputs were some of the main reasons for farmer suicides in the region. We called four such families and had discussions with them,” the official said.  He said the families get aid after they lose their member to suicide.  “To find such suicide vulnerable farmer families, we decided to reach out to the cultivators through a survey comprising 104 questions. It was like a psychological test,” the official said. Through this survey, the farmers families were found that were tired of their (socio-economic) condition, he said.  “The situation is serious. There are families with girls to be married, children who have left their education. If a family has five-seven acre of land and doesn’t have ample water, it yields less crop. They take loans from banks and private money lenders,” he noted.  Kendrekar said farmers need money in this “risky” business of farming.  “Like the Telangana government, I think the farmers should be given an aid of Rs 10,000 per acre before a crop season. They can purchase seeds and make their farms ready for sowing. After this, they can purchase other farming essentials without any debt and interest. We will recommend this to the state government soon,” the official said.  Market reforms are also necessary to prevent farmer suicides, he added."

GARNER, N.C. (WTVD) -- Local Emergency Rooms are under pressure to help those facing mental health episodes.  Last year, WakeMed Hospital admitted 4,000 adults and children with suicidal thoughts. That represents a 15 percent increase from the previous year.  Victor Chambers knows people suffering, but they're having difficulty accessing resources.  ""(They're) just mostly peers. I'm still kind of young myself so it's very prevalent in my age range,' said Chambers.  Wake County is committing about $30 million every year to support behavioral health services, but a newly released report shows there are several gaps in getting people the help they need.  The report notes that right now ""there is an overreliance on calling 911 for behavioral health crisis"" and then a ""lack of coordination with the new 988 crisis call line.""  One recommendation is to increase funding to the mental health facility WakeBrook and turn it into a crisis hub.  The report is being released as WakeMed is inching closer to building a new medical health hospital in Garner.  WakeMed Behavorial Health Department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Micah Krempasky said only about half of the people, who are admitted to the ER and need a psychiatric bed, actually get one.  ""We are vastly underserved in the amount of in-patient psychiatric beds available,"" she said. ""There are people that wait days, weeks, months or are actually never able to access that level of care. Instead, we stabilized them in the hospital. We connect them with out-patient services. We do the best that we can.""  WakeMed said there was a 104 percent jump in the number of pediatric patients since 2020.  Hospital leaders are trying to tackle the problem and building a new medical health hospital in Garner. The site is located near the intersection of White Oak Road and Timber Drive.  The facility will eventually have a 150 psychiatric beds and help with a shortage.  ""The need for behavioral health care is far bigger than what WakeMed can handle alone. We have to come together to come up with community solutions for the overwhelming need that is here and that has been under addressed for year,"" said Krempasky.  Ground is expected to be broken on the new mental health center in 2024 and supposed to open in 2026."

Health chiefs from countries that have given ill people control over how they die shared a range of experiences in a debate on a potential change to the law in the UK.  Professor Brian Owler, a consultant in New South Wales, said hearing the horrific ways people had taken their own life was a “very powerful argument” in assisted dying being made legal in the Australian state.  He told the story of a woman who went through chemotherapy for Leukaemia and took her own life before the legislation was available.  “The sadness was that her husband who cared for her for I think about 10 years went to work one day and had to come home and find her dead and that was really unfair on her and of course her husband and her whole family,” he told the Commons health select committee.

It really is about understanding people’s autonomy and respecting their decision and their choice when they are in a situation where they are suffering or when they are dying about the timing and the manner of their death.”  South Australia’s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Kyam Maher said 10% of suicides police attended in the area were of elderly people with terminal illnesses.  He said: “There has to be a better way that someone at the end of their life can die with the same dignity with which they lived their life.”  Dr Chandana Banerjee, a professor in palliative medicine in California, said having the option of assisted dying gives patients “peace of mind”.  “It allows them and their families to really plan for things rather than wait for the disease to get so debilitating that they can’t enjoy their lives for those last six months.”  There are strict rules in most countries that have legalised the practice.  Dr Banerjess said most people still think assisted dying in the US is “for anyone and everybody” but added: “That’s not the case. It really is highly regulated for those who have a prognosis of six months or less.”  Dr Lydia Dugdale, director at the centre for clinical medical ethics at New York’s Columbia University, highlighted the importance of safeguarding with the case of Canada, which has been highly criticised for its right-to-die laws.  Image: Getty Images/Westend61) Getty Images/Westend61)  She gave the example of more than 1,700 euthanasias having been carried out for loneliness in the country.  Dr Dugdale said: “What kind of society do we want to live in where we solve the problem of ageing and lack of access and poverty by Euthanisa?  “That’s what we’re seeing in Canada which has not had it legalised for that long. People can’t pay their rent, they get euthanised. People can’t afford their medicines, they get euthanised. People need a wheelchair lift and the veterans’ affairs office offers them euthanasia.”  Professor Roderick MacLeod, a former senior palliative care consultant in New Zealand, was the voice of general concerns about assisted dying.  Saying he’d like to see the law reversed, he said: “For a long time I’ve spoken about the fact, as a palliative physician, people would ask me quite frequently if there was anything that I could do to end their life and when I was in practice I would say I couldn’t because it was illegal.  “But requests for a hastened death are not uncommon in palliative care because people are essentially saying ‘I don’t want to live like this’ and that is a very reasonable statement to make.  “What I know from my own practice and the practice of my colleagues is after a variable length in the palliative care service those requests for hastened death melt away.”  Last month, crossbench peer and chair of the charity Dignity in Dying, Molly Meacher, told MPs the reality of end of life could include vomiting faeces, endless nausea and bad-smelling decaying tumours.  She has long campaigned for reform to laws in the UK, where assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.  British retiree David Hunter is currently on trial in Cyprus after killing his cancer-stricken wife after she begged him to help end her misery.  He wept as he told the court on Monday: “It was her decision that she wanted to die, not mine - hers. It was her decision that she didn’t want any more treatment.  “She has her own mind and she asked me. I would never in a million years have done it. She wasn’t just my wife - she was my best friend.  “I didn’t just decide to kill her. I loved her so much. I still love her.  “You don’t know what we went through. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”  If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

The university student named Ho sustained injuries to his head and right leg after he jumped onto the tracks at about 7.40 pm and was hit by the moving train before becoming trapped beneath it.  He was rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital in critical condition.  Police found a suicide note at the scene, and a preliminary investigation revealed Ho had been conned on a social networking app.  Sources said Ho could not repay the debts, and the stress might have led to his suicide attempt.  The service of the East Rail Line was once suspended and resumed at 8.30 pm.  In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy was also defrauded on a social networking app by being blackmailed with indecent clips and photos of himself.  Police said the boy was recently lured into a nude chat, with his mother receiving some of the indecent images taken by the scammer, asking for HK$10,000.  It is unknown whether the mother paid the ransom.  Officers recommended that parents explain more about online pitfalls to their children and remind them not to be naked in front of the camera, click on suspicious links, or download programs from unknown sources. When children encounter unreasonable demands when making friends online, they should ask their parents or teachers for help.    If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts, help is available.

(WJBF) – The National Institutes of Health reports insomnia as a common sleep disorder, affecting up to half of patients with schizophrenia. Insomnia can also increase the risk of suicide in schizophrenic patients.  Doctors at the Medical College of Georgia at AU are investigating ways to lower this risk and improve patients’ quality of life.  Insomnia disorder affects about 10 percent of adults.  “Insomnia was a risk factor for suicidal thinking, suicidal behavior and suicide death,” said Dr. William Vaughn McCall, Chair of Psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.  During his earlier studies, Dr. McCall says he wanted to see if treating insomnia in people with active suicidal thinking would make a difference.  “It did,” said Dr. McCall. “Treating insomnia appeared to mitigate people’s tendency towards suicidal thinking. And this was the first time that it had been shown.”  Now, he and Dr. Brian Miller, professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, are working to treat this occurrence in patients with schizophrenia- using a drug called clozapine.  “We use it because it dramatically changes people’s lives when it works,” said Dr. Miller.  “I’ve started patients on clozapine who’ve been able to go back to school and finish degrees. And pursue advanced degrees. And get meaningful employment.”  Dr. Vaughn notes that a person’s ability to think clearly is noticeably diminished if they don’t get enough sleep.  “The decision they land upon is ‘I might commit suicide’, which is a decision they might not make if they slept better,” said Dr. McCall.  The doctors are also looking at ways to better recognize signs and symptoms of high alertness, which is often linked to insomnia.  Using a device called a pupillometer, they can measure the rate of pupil responses to determine the patient’s level of physiological excitement.  It has proven to be a helpful instrument in the stages of both diagnosis and treatment.  “We have an additional study with the pupillometer to measure these pupillary responses to light in patients before and after they get treated with clozapine,” said Dr. Miller.  “We think that the autonomic nervous system will tell us things about the patient that they may not be able to even access themselves,” said Dr. McCall.  Drs. Miller and McCall tell us they remain committed to proving their hypotheses and providing better care for patients in need."

Matt Pinkett’s new book proposes that classes centered around anger management, friendship, and active listening could potentially reduce male suicide rates.  Pinkett’s book delves into key research that explores factors influencing boys’ mental health, discussing topics such as body image, pornography, and self-harm. Additionally, it offers practical strategies for teachers to initiate positive change. The guide is grounded in evidence gathered from teachers, school staff, well-being experts, and therapists.  Research indicates that teenage boys are twice as likely as girls to die by suicide, a rate that triples when boys transition into adulthood. According to official data used by the U.K.-based researcher, 264 people between 10 and 19 years-old committed suicide in 2020 in England, Scotland, and Wales — with boys constituting 72 percent of these cases. In England specifically, suicide is the leading cause of death among men under 45.  Despite these grim statistics, Pinkett remains optimistic. In his book, “Boys Do Cry: Improving Boys’ Mental Health and Wellbeing in School,” he urges teachers to refrain from stigmatizing anger, suggesting they should instead help boys understand the neurological and physiological roots of their feelings.  “Anger isn’t inherently bad. Telling boys it is only leads to shame and concealment. Instead, we should teach them that anger is as natural as joy or sadness, and equip them with the tools to manage it and the language to express it,” the author says in a media release.  Pinkett also believes that teachers should normalize loving, male relationships. He maintains that every social interaction in the classroom is observed and internalized, hence, male teachers should openly compliment male colleagues, speak affectionately about others, and acknowledge and applaud male emotional vulnerability whenever possible. He advocates for teaching boys about bromances, as this can furnish young men with the skills to listen actively and exhibit compassion and affection towards one another.  “I am not suggesting that we should ever try to be therapists – that would never work. However, the fact is that we are in front of these children for significant portions of their lives. If we can speak positively about male emotions and demonstrate ways of dealing with problematic feelings, that would be a powerful thing,” says Pinkett, who also co-authored the book, “Boys Don’t Try.”  He further adds that the challenge lies not in encouraging young men to talk, but rather in teaching their peers to listen. Pinkett’s research suggests that boys don’t listen as effectively as girls.  “There is so much discussion about encouraging boys and men to speak up, but are we teaching them how to support each other through effective listening?”  His research proposes that boys yearn for emotional intimacy and the liberty to express themselves without ridicule. However, he identifies toxic masculinity as an obstacle to nurturing these beneficial peer relationships. He believes boys should be taught kindness, vulnerability, and emotional articulation. Pinkett hopes his book will embolden others to tackle difficult topics that will benefit everyone.  “This isn’t just a problem for teenage boys. If we can teach these boys to discard harmful and outdated expectations of masculinity, society as a whole will benefit. It is only through education that the blight of male-on-female sexual abuse, assault, and harassment can be eradicated.”  Armed with extensive research, Pinkett offers advice on intervening when a child may be at risk and provides tips on establishing group tasks that foster friendships while facilitating learning.  “This isn’t about turning teachers into therapists. It’s simply about having the courage to intervene and provide boys with an opportunity to learn a different way of being.”  South West News Service writer Alice Clifford contributed to this report."

Illinois has six crisis call centers statewide. In July 2021, the state was last in the country, with only 19% of crisis calls answered in state.  After the 988 launch in July 2022, that number jumped to 81% and new data just released for April 2023 found 87% of calls were answered in-state, the highest ever.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “You can call it and have your call answered in about 36 seconds is the average now, while it used to be close to 170 seconds. So that's a huge improvement,” Cummings said.  Nationwide, people in crisis contacted the 988 lifeline nearly 368,936 times last month. That’s 160,314 more contacts in April 2023 compared to April 2022.  A year over year comparison for the month of April also found calls answered went up by 52%, chats answered increased by 90% and text responses went up by 1,022%.  “I was thrilled, because a lot of the people who do the texting are younger people, and we want to get to them as soon as possible,” said Cara Levinson.  Levinson is the board chair for the Illinois chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Levinson lost her daughter, Elana, 18, to suicide in 2007.  “Not that every minute is occupied with missing her but it's, as you can see, it's, it's still, still there,” Levinson said, tears in her eyes.  Levinson said she can’t help but wonder if the outcome would have been different had the 988 lifeline been available to Elana.  “With anyone who dies, there’s always this feeling, especially with suicide, if… only….” Levinson said.  Levinson was recently at an event where people she spoke with weren’t aware calling or texting the three-digit code, 988, provides immediate access to trained counselors.  “I can't tell you how many people did not know of its existence.

None convinced North Charleston police not to charge him with murder. On May 16 Harris' plea for bond failed to persuade a judge to grant the request.  Harris, 20, is accused of murder in the July 5, 2021, fatal shooting of Anissa Shank, of Moncks Corner. He has been held in jail nearly two years without bond. After hearing from both sides on the issue of bond May 16, Circuit Judge B. Alex Hyman ruled against Harris.  The day Shank died, North Charleston police responded to a 911 call around 1 a.m. at his residence, 4853 Lecque St. The call was about a suicide. But North Charleston police officers who responded to the call and found Shank dead determined the fatal gunshot wasn't self inflicted. Detectives determined a charge of murder was appropriate for Harris, whom they believed tried to stage Shank's death as a suicide before he fled the scene.  Harris later told police he was ""playing"" with a gun and accidentally shot Shank, 9th Circuit Assistant Solicitor Kelsey Davis said during the May 16 bond hearing.  Her killing devastated an already grief-stricken family. Shank's mother died just three weeks before she was killed, according to Dana Rabon, who identified herself in the courtroom May 16 as the victim's aunt. Rabon implored the judge to deny bond.  Nicholas D'Angelo, of the Charleston County Public Defenders Office, said he is concerned for his client's wellbeing in the county jail. Harris has been held for 802 days awaiting trial. The attorney said he just learned his 22-year-old client had been placed on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center. Harris' mother and his new girlfriend supported him in the courtroom.  The case will likely not be scheduled for trial this year, D'Angelo said. Prosecutors and defense attorneys in Charleston's General Sessions Court are still working to resolve cases that predate Harris' case, which is nearing two years old.  The case backlog has grown to 14,000 pending cases. Last year, the typical case in General Sessions Court lasted 625 days — more than 1½ years — according to a recently released report by the Charleston County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council."

The fundraiser is being held at The Grand Roxy in Brighton-Le-Sands from 6.30pm and will raise money for the Black Dog Institute towards Mental Health Awareness and Suicide Prevention.  The night will be focused on personal stories from the family and other guest speakers, including Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Ahead of the fundraiser, The Greek Herald spoke with Glenn and Katrina to hear all about their personal connection to losing a family member through suicide.  Anna, Glenn and Liza.  Glenn Anthony:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I lost my brother Terry to suicide in 2017. He was suffering from mental health issues and depression for many years. We as a family had lived with this and tried to get help for Terry, but this was very difficult and challenging for my parents, sister and myself. After Terry’s passing, it was extremely difficult to process and all our lives were changed.  Personally, my views on life were altered and nothing seemed important anymore. I shut myself off to everyone and everything, and slipped into a terrible depression. I had many questions but no answers. I spent three years with my bereavement councillor to help me focus and see clearly again.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I do believe it is a taboo topic regardless of which community you come from. There is a stigma attached to suicide which generates thoughts within the community of weakness, blame, shame or even sin. The topic makes people uncomfortable and unsure of how to react.  Since my brother’s suicide, I have been able to understand a bit more about this disease and along with this better understanding, I have felt more comfortable discussing it. It is more frowned upon within the Greek community as it is looked at as a sin and having lack of faith.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we are open and honest about the topic, the more people will feel comfortable talking about it. When we don’t talk about our problems or our depression or dark thoughts, then it builds up and it always feels much worse. The more we talk, the more we raise awareness, people are likely to seek help and advice. Let’s talk, let’s make a difference, let’s save lives together.  What do you hope to achieve with your fundraiser?  The fundraiser is about bringing people together from all communities to raise awareness for mental health and suicide prevention. The Black Dog Institute will be there on the night sharing what they are doing and what programs they have to assist people affected. We hope this night shows people there is a lot of help out there.  People can expect some educational insight as to what is being done, they can expect to hear from people that have been affected by suicide, as well as plenty of good food, wine, music and fun, as this night is also a celebration of life.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  As far as dealing with mental health issues, there are many different organisations to help with advice on recognising mental health, what to do, what to say and how to deal with this debilitating disease.  As far as a message for someone dealing with suicide, I would say to talk about your feelings, be open with your family and friends and don’t shut yourself off. The sooner you understand and accept what has happened, the sooner you can get peace of mind and ease your soul. It’s not easy. It’s a type of bereavement that never leaves you, so you have to find a way to best deal with it as it becomes part of your everyday life.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos.  Katrina Tsaftaropoulos:  What is your personal connection to mental health issues and suicide?  I knew nothing about mental health. But when I lost my son, George, to suicide in 2012, I was unable to accept the tragedy. I developed post-traumatic stress and depression and became suicidal. In order to help myself, I had to obtain treatment and knowledge from mental health services. Now I use this knowledge to raise awareness and help others.  Do you think suicide and mental health is a taboo topic in the Greek community? Why / Why not?  I think it is a taboo subject in every community. Society in general, is very unaccepting and judgemental. The Greek community I found even more so. I found myself treated like a leper, people were cruel with their judgement and criticisms. Greeks don’t understand mental health is a chemical imbalance in the brain, a physical condition. They treat it as an aberration, a weakness, a lack of faith, and something to be avoided. They consider people be more religious and stronger.  Why do you think it’s important to be open and honest about the topic?  The more we talk openly about the subject, to bring it out of the shadows, the safer people will be. When they know others understand, and they can put up their hands and ask for help without judgement, they will seek help. This will save lives. My son did not seek help, fearing he would be labelled, and his teammates would think less of him.  Do you have a message for anyone else going through the loss of a family member by suicide or supporting someone with their mental health?  Losing a family member to suicide is devastating. My family unit imploded. We couldn’t deal with the grief, the mental health issues and beating the guilt of the ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybes.’ That ate us up alive.  My message is – you cannot fix them, you cannot take away their pain, but you can be there for them. Show compassion and understanding, be prepared to listen and support without judgement, have empathy, and give of yourself to share their grief.  Is there anything else you’d like to say?  There are many organisations dealing with mental health and there is a lot of assistance out there. There is a life lost to suicide every three hours, the toll is horrific. We need to raise awareness with our youth, teach them to recognise mental health, tell them where to get help, and how to build resistance. With knowledge and these tools, we can make a difference, we can save lives.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain  Black adults—particularly Black women—with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.  In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to have grown up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm, and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.  ""The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,"" said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study.  ""This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.""  Recent research shows that since 2019, half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.  Risk for injury and death—whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence—increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community.  Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don't own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020.  The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.  In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.  Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.  Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.  ""For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.  ""However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.""

Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public “when dysregulated and engaging in aggressive behaviour” in a fast food restaurant, and how the video was shared thousands of times on various social media sites.  Baroness Newlove told peers in Westminster how the youngster was filmed by a member of the public (Peter Byrne/PA Wire)  The Tory peer explained how the video was reported by the boy and his mother, but the sites would not take it down, and the teen “became overwhelmed” by the negative comments, eventually trying to end his own life.  Her remarks came as peers called on the Government to create an avenue of redress for individuals unhappy with how a platform has dealt with their complaint.  She said: “This footage was shared out of context across social media with much of the response online labelling Harry as a disruptive teenager who was engaging in unacceptable aggression and vandalising public property.  “This was shared thousands of times over the course of a few weeks.  “When Harry and his mum reported it to the social media platforms, they were informed it didn’t violate community guidelines and that there was a public interest in the footage remaining online.  “The family, quite rightly, felt powerless, Harry became overwhelmed at the negative response to the footage and the comments made about his behaviour.  “Harry became withdrawn and stopped engaging. He then tried to take his own life.  “It was at this point that Harry’s mum reached out to the voluntary-run service Report Harmful Content as she had nowhere else to turn to. Report Harmful Content is run by the charity South West Grid for Learning.  “They were able to mediate between the social media sites involved to further explain the context and demonstrate the real-world harm that this footage, by remaining online, was having on the family and Harry’s mental health.  “Then, and only then, did the social media companies concerned remove the content.”  Lady Newlove gave the troubling account as peers continued their line-by-line scrutiny of the Online Safety Bill.  Peers across the House called for an independent appeals procedure for social media users who have exhausted the internal complaints process of these sites – an ombudsman separate to Ofcom to provide an impartial out-of-court resolution.  This suggestion was rejected by the Government, with technology minister Viscount Camrose saying: “The Government does remain confident that service providers are best placed to deal with individual user complaints as they will be able to take appropriate action promptly.  “This could include removing content, sanctioning offending users, reversing wrongful content removal or changing their systems and processes.”  He added that the Bill includes “super-complaints provisions” that allow for systemic issues to be raised with Ofcom, who will be required to publish a response.  Individuals can also submit complaints to Ofcom but it “will not be able to investigate or arbitrate in individual cases” – instead, these reports will be used to inform its overall enforcement activity.  Liberal Democrat peer Lord Allan of Hallam, who worked as Facebook’s director of policy in Europe for 10 years, highlighted that online providers struggle to deal with the “vast funnel of reports”, most of which are “spurious or vexatious”, and the challenge of separating the “genuinely serious reports” from the “vast amount of noise”.  He argued an independent body is needed to identify circumstances where a platform has correctly enforced its policies, but that in a particular case, like Harry’s, it is “deeply unfair, problematic and harmful for an individual”, and provide an avenue for redress.  Children’s rights campaigner Baroness Kidron said the minister responding to the debate had been given “a sticky wicket here of defending the indefensible”.  The film director and independent crossbencher said: “The Government has chosen to give individuals no recourse under the Bill and that is the current situation as it stands, and there is no concession on that matter.  “I believe I have been in meetings with people when they have been promised such things and I think it’s really important that we state what the situation is.”  Offering a meeting with peers to discuss the matter further, Viscount Camrose said: “We are giving users greater protection through the Bill.”  Labour frontbencher Lord Stevenson of Balmacara told him: “This is a very complicated Bill and you and I are now learning the hard lessons.  “It’s quite clear there’s something here that needs to be resolved and the way the Government is approaching it, it is heading towards a brick wall.”  He added that the Bill is “reinforcing an inequality of arms” between individuals and companies, concluding:  “The Government is in a mess, please sort it.”"

House Bill 140, sponsored by Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, permits a terminally ill adult resident of Delaware to request and self-administer medication to end the individual’s life in a humane and dignified manner.  The bill was introduced last year, but didn’t survive the session.  Under HB 140, both the individual’s attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse and a consulting physician or nurse would have to agree on an individual’s diagnosis and prognosis and believe the individual has decision-making capacity, is making an informed decision, and is acting voluntarily.  Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, who was against the bill, was among those who thought the bill would prematurely end some people’s lives, saying citing religious belief and prayer sometimes prolongs life.  “My father was diagnosed with lung cancer and was given 18 months,” Briggs King said. “He lived 18 years.”  Rep. Mike Smith, R-Pike Creek, questioned a major talking point for proponents of the bill, which was that 70% of Delawareans support assisted suicide, and that is consistent nationally across surveys.  He said the survey question, which asked whether a health care provider honoring a terminally ill patient’s request to end his or her life should be subject to criminal or civil penalties.  “Doctors are not trained in this. Doctors are trained to treat disease,” he said. “They’re not trained to teach you when to die, or how to die.”  Rep. Stell Parker Selby, D-Milton, said she received dozens of emails from Sussex County residents that were in opposition to the bill.  She said when her mother died, she and her family agreed that she wouldn’t go on any machines or have doctors give her anything, and most people in Sussex agree that they want to die without any assistance.  One common form of assisted suicide that was discussed was a powder that is mixed with a small amount of water or other solution that a patient drinks and typically dies within a few hours.  However, the powder often causes nausea and patients can vomit it up causing a delayed reaction.  READ: Food service workers, paraprofessionals could get raises  Doctors from out-of-state testified that they give patients medications to treat nausea before giving them the solution to ensure it works as it’s supposed to, with a painless death a few hours later.  One speaker said 80% of patients who take the solution die within one hour.  Smith and some others pushed the fact that patients must be in the right state of mind while making the decision, and even suggested mandating a psychiatric evaluation prior to making a decision.  “The physicians regularly are assessing the mental capability of their patients,” Baumbach said.  The idea of assisted suicide legislation has been thrown around in the General Assembly for nearly a decade without success.  Personal anecdotes were shared throughout the meeting.  Kevin Hensely, R-Kevin Hensley, R-Middletown, said his mom, who recently died, wanted to go out her way, by her own choice.  “’I’m sorry to lay that all out here,” he said. “But it’s really fresh, and it’s helped me see it from a different perspective.”  Proponents of the bill said someone who is terminally ill and in pain should be the one to make a decision on their life.  Because several committee members left sometime during the meeting, the committee did not have enough voting members to declare if it was released or not.  That will be made clear hours after the meeting on the bill’s tracker site.  Also Tuesday:  House Bill 150, dubbed the Cover All Delaware Children Act and sponsored by Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Greenville, would help Delaware children who are undocumented and do not have access to routine or preventative healthcare, including vaccinations and physicals, because they cannot afford the services.  HB 150 directs the Department of Health and Social Services to develop and operate a limited medical assistance program for children in Delaware who are not otherwise covered, including children who are not documented.  A child resident in the state whose family income is low enough that they would qualify on that basis for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, but is not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, is eligible for coverage and medical care under this Act.  The coverage would be co-extensive with that provided by CHIP and Medicaid, except that it would not include in-patient care at a hospital or other healthcare facility.  HB 150 also requires the state to submit a plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services so that the state can take advantage of the federal CHIP option to include coverage of pregnant women regardless of immigration status.  HB 150 had enough voting members to constitute a quorum, and legislators voted to release the bill, which will now head to the House floor.  Senate Bill 98, sponsored by Sen. Nicole Poore, D-Delaware City, also was released and is on its way to the House floor.  SB 98 would allow dental clinicians possessing a DDS or DMDS to participate in the Health Care Provider Loan Repayment grant program. The bill also extends the time in which providers may apply for a Healthcare Provider Loan Repayment grant from six months to two years following completion of their graduate education.

We urge the Senate to follow through and help state authorities understand the root causes of this problem.  A 2022 state-mandated report on suicide prevention revealed that the number of suicides among Texas children in foster care jumped from one in 2017 to four in 2021. There are about 50,000 youths in the state’s foster care system.  Foster care youth experience higher rates of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Sadly, their suicide rate is three times higher than that of the general youth population in Texas, according to the state’s suicide prevention report. Still, it’s the job of Texas’ child welfare agency to protect children in its care from harm or death.  Understanding why children in foster care attempt suicide can help the state prevent deaths, said Angela Ott, a policy fellow at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health, a nonprofit affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin. Currently, the state is not required to report suicide attempts.  Opinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  House Bill 4065, which was approved 145-0 in the lower chamber, would require the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to maintain records and collect data on suicide attempts of children in foster care. The Senate now has to take up the bill.  The causes of suicide are complex, and they must be addressed as part of the state’s larger effort to support better mental health programming and infrastructure.  The Legislature is looking at increasing funding for mental health programs. Senate Bill 26, which has been forwarded to the House for debate, would fund grants for community-based organizations that work with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The bill would give priority to organizations that work with children considered high risk for mental health issues, according to The Texas Tribune.  Better data collection must inform the strategies that the state adopts to prevent suicides in the foster care system. These are Texas’ most vulnerable children, and they deserve our best effort.

Two days before the murder-suicide, Tavarez-Rodriguez called 911, claiming his wife had ""too much to drink.""  ""This is not an emergency, this is a call for service,"" he said to the 911 operator.  He said on the call that they had gone to the gas station and were eating dinner at home when he decided to call 911.

""I wouldn’t call it a disturbance; I just want to cover myself,"" Tavarez-Rodriguez said. ""I just want to make sure that everything is settled.""  The operator asked if they had access to any weapons. He said yes, they did have access to weapons, but said the weapons were locked in a safe.

In 2020, Congress passed the 988 National Suicide Designation Act, requiring a new and universal three-digit calling code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to how 911 is used for public safety emergencies. However, state and local governments were responsible for implementing the 988 system, which launched in July of 2022, though Congress allowed states to assess a fee on cell phone bills to recover the costs related to 988 and the associated crisis services.  House Bill 160, sponsored by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Senator Nicole Poore, would implement a 60-cent monthly surcharge on each wireless access line, establish a fund for the surcharge, and create a board composed state agencies and stakeholders to report on the state’s crisis intervention services. It would also institute a one-time, 60-cent fee on prepaid services. Under the bill, the funds collected through the surcharge would specifically be earmarked for operating the 988 system, providing crisis intervention services and staffing associated services. Unspent money would revert to the fund each year and could not be used for general state expenses.  “People in crisis need to know when they call 988 that they are being connected to knowledgeable, caring professionals who will help steer them through incredibly difficult situations. However, 988 calls in Delaware are currently funneled to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, which is chronically understaffed. We need to provide our behavioral health professionals with the tools and resources they need to save lives. Establishing a small monthly surcharge, similar to way we fund 911 emergency services, will strengthen our mental health services in Delaware and ensure that a person reaching out for help receives quality care. HB 160 builds on our ongoing efforts to address the mental health crisis and provide a continuum of care for residents,” said Rep. Longhurst.  “Delaware can’t sit by and hope that the behavioral health crisis that has been affecting our nation for decades will simply go away on its own,” said Sen. Poore, the Senate prime sponsor of HB 160. “That’s why I have joined with Rep. Longhurst and our colleagues in the Delaware General Assembly to make real investments in a system of care capable of helping people who need it most. This legislation builds on that work by giving our new behavioral health crisis and suicide prevention help line the staff and resources it needs to deescalate emergencies, quickly provide families with immediate access to support and services, and most importantly, save lives.”  Currently, Delaware’s crisis lines handle about 25,000 contacts, though state officials say they expect those numbers to increase due to a greater need for behavioral health services, with a possible growth of 60% or more.  HB 160 would allow funds collected to be used for the establishment and operation of the 988 system and center, including staffing, providing crisis intervention services, providing specialized training, raising public awareness, and data collection and analysis.  HB 160 has been assigned to the House Health & Human Development Committee."

The 29-year-old trot singer was found dead by the police on 12 May, reported Naver. This is the second death of a K-pop star to hit the South Korean entertainment industry in less than a month.  In mid-April, famous K-pop star Moonbin’s death had left fans shocked globally. The 25-year-old member of the boy band Astro appeared to “have taken his own life”, as per the police.  These tragic incidents have once again put the spotlight on the dark side of the K-pop world and the Korean entertainment industry.  Series of cases  26-year-old actor Jung Chae-yull was found dead in her home on 11 April. Another actor Yoo Joo-eun died last year at the age of 27.  Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), passed away in October 2019. The 25-year-old had faced cyberbullying throughout her career. A month later, her close friend and a K-pop star, 28-year-old Goo Hara, was found dead at home.  In a rare admission for a K-pop star, Goo had previously revealed in a video that she was suffering from depression.  In December 2017, the lead singer of the boy band Shinee, Kim Jong-hyun, died in a suspected suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.  In a note shared a day before his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt “broken from inside”.  “The depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,” Kim wrote, adding he “couldn’t defeat it anymore”, reported The Guardian.  The heavy cost of fame  According to experts, a variety of factors contribute to higher pressure on young entertainers in South Korea than pop stars of other countries.  This includes presenting a perfect image in public, a stringent training schedule and a culture of online bullying, noted Variety magazine.  K-pop artist Amber Liu opened up about the intense industry pressure in 2020. She told CBS Mornings, “If you aren’t under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut”. “You’re told what to do, what to say, what to think.”  As per CNN, a K-pop star works for an average of 16 hours or so a day, doing everything from dance practices and singing lessons to language classes and camera training.  K-pop artists have to undergo a rigorous training period, even preparing for 10 years or more sometimes before they can make their debut.  There is also extreme competition in the industry for K-pop stars or “idols” as they are called.  “The control from celebrities’ agencies and fan culture are two main contributors to the massive stress Korean stars face,” Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine, told BBC.  South Korea has “fandoms” or organised groups of admirers who spend time and money to prop up their favourite stars and target their opponents, reported Daily Mail.  The stars, in return, have to maintain their perfectly crafted image.  In South Korea’s conservative society, scrutiny of entertainers starts once they debut, with their every move being closely watched by everyone, especially the fans.  As per Daily Mail, drug use or drunken driving can end careers in the industry.  “Korea has a very strict moral standard for celebrities compared to other countries,” Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-kun told BBC.  “If a star behaves only a little different from what’s perceived ‘decent’, the public would attack them. And it’s hard for a star to ignore this kind of assault because of the high social pressure from strong collectivism.”  “Koreans have a strict moral code for their celebrities,” Jeeheng Lee, a culture expert at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, was quoted as saying by Variety. “Demonising the K-pop industry alone doesn’t solve the problem. Sulli and Hara suffered more from misogynistic attacks than from K-pop fans.”  As The Diplomat said in December 2022, while the Korean Wave overtakes the world, “mistreatment, suicide, slave labour contracts, gruelling training schedules, ‘no dating’ clauses, sexual assault, and sexualisation of minors by K-pop agencies cannot go unnoticed”.  ALSO READ: How toilet paper in Japan is helping suicidal youth  Mental health stigma  South Korea has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, as per Bloomberg.  BBC noted that suicide cases among people in their 20s are increasing in the Asian country.  While the stigma around mental health is not limited to South Korea, the added pressure from the country’s entertainment industry has made matters worse for its young celebrities.  Royce Lee, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, told Variety in 2019: “All cultures have a stigma against mental illness. It’s not uniquely Korean”.  “But when talking about celebrities, the intersection of culture and psychology becomes very important. The idea that one must please everybody is both a very Korean idea and a very common problem with fame. So it is a double whammy.”  According to Paik Jong-woo, a psychiatrist and the director of the Korea Suicide Prevention Center, artists are hesitant to approach mental health professionals due to “fear of public shame” and their hectic schedules, CNN reported in 2019.  Speaking to CBS This Morning, Liu, who was a former bandmate of Sulli, talked about the stigma against mental illnesses in the country. “When (people) hear you’re getting help they’re like, ‘What? Why are you getting help? That’s weird’,” she said in 2020.  “That stigma against mental health is just so strong.”  As per reports, while several agencies have started therapy sessions for trainees and stars, the problem of stigmatisation continues to persist.

""As a kid, it’s very disappointing,"" eighth grader Josiah Pope said.  ""I get pretty scared because you don’t know when it can happen,"" eighth grader J.R. Crooks said. ""It can happen at any time to anybody.""  For the past year, students in a class titled ""Youth for the Future"" created a new way to market 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number that replaced the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline last July.  News 5 The students pose with advisers Sally Bradley and Joslin Seeds and their poster after a presentation with area leaders at the Ashtabula County Building Resiliency Together (BRT) Collaborative meeting on May 10.  ""We want to change how people look at [988],"" classroom adviser Joslin Seeds said. ""It isn’t just suicide. It’s everything.""  The goal of the poster, which features a student wearing a hoodie, is to connect with students that the lifeline could also be used for other mental health challenges instead of strictly suicidal thoughts.  The idea, Seeds explained, came from watching school shooting after school shooting and learning that in some cases, the shooter tried to reach out for help.  RELATED: She checked her Instagram. She didn't expect a message from The Covenant School shooter.  ""Young kids shouldn’t be dying,"" Pope added. ""We want to get our program out there to as much people as we can.""

""When I was in third grade, my mom home-schooled me and the rest of my siblings because she was scared of someone coming into the building and shooting us,"" Haiden explained.  988 launched in July 2022  Last year, 988 was unveiled across the country as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, replacing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  The new number is a chance for anyone across the country to call or text and reach a trained professional who can help those experiencing a mental health or an addiction crisis.  In Ohio, experts were expecting around a 40% increase in calls when the number changed, but tell News 5 they’ve only seen a slight uptick.  Across the state, that averages out to about 8,600 calls per month handled by counselors.  Help Network of Northeast Ohio handles the 988 calls for those living in Mahoning, Trumbull and Ashtabula counties.  ""Today, the effects of the pandemic appear to be more mental health,"" said Vince Brancaccio, CEO of the Help Network of Northeast Ohio.

It comes at a time when, whether it’s trauma, or the harmful effects of technology and social media, the impacts on our children's mental well-being are everywhere.

Wright County Public Health is offering a pair of training sessions this month addressing suicide prevention.  Keith Bennett is a Health Promotion Coordinator with Wright County Public Health. He says the first suicide prevention training is titled “QPR” (Question, Persuade, Refer.) The QPR training is planned for Wednesday, May 24th from 12 noon to 1:30 PM in Conference Room 1103 at the Wright County Government Center in Buffalo. No registration is required, but it is encouraged. Register at; https://www.eventbrite.com/e/qpr-suicide-prevention-training-tickets-624365503027.  Bennett says the second training session is a more comprehensive online session called “CALM, or Counseling on Access to Lethal Means.”  You must have completed suicide prevention training before attending CALM. This course reviews public health data on suicide and access to lethal means. It highlights why and how to work with at-risk clients and their families or support persons to reduce their access to highly lethal means, in a way that is collaborative, respectful, and practical. The CALM session will be from 10 AM to 1 PM on Wednesday, May 31st, and will be conducted online on Zoom.

Now parents tell The Post how their families have suffered as social media severely impacted their teenage children, even driving them to suicide.  The American Psychological Association released 10 new recommendations last week on protecting teens while they use social apps, underlining the growing concern among parents, experts, and lawmakers about interacting with others through phones and screens for hours unchecked.  The guidance does not suggest specific daily limits for teens. But it urges parents to keep children away from content about “beauty” and “appearance” – saying comments on photos can lead to poor body image, eating disorders, and depression, particularly among girls.  Parents protested at Snap’s headquarters last week, saying their children died as a result of the company’s Snapchat platform. One mom who spoke to The Post, Rosellene Bronstein, said her son took his own life after being bullied on it. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  It also tells parents to make sure children are not stopped by social media from getting eight hours of sleep, to keep them away from screens an hour before bedtime, and to monitor usage for problematic content.  “Within the field, there is pretty clear consensus that it is not how much time kids are on screen that matters as much as what they are doing during that screen time,” the APA’s chief science officer, Mitch Prinstein, who helped develop the advice, told The Post.  Prinstein said teens should focus on homework or reading the news instead of passive scrolling or exposure to potentially destructive content.  “It may be easiest for parents to consider how much their children are balancing social interactions that allow for the development of mature social competence as compared to the amount of social interaction that is via social media,” Prinstein said.  Protests from the parents of dead teenagers are only part of the pressure on social media platforms, with members of both parties in Congress proposing bans on its use for under-13s and new restrictions for other teens. Courtesy of Rosellene Bronstein  Social media giants, including Meta’s Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and smaller platforms including Roblox, Discord, Reddit, and Twitch, are facing not just criticism from parents and psychologists but calls from both parties in the Senate for an all-out ban on their use by under-13s and severe restrictions for 13- to 18-year-olds.  And relatives of the 10 people murdered by a racist gunman in the Buffalo, New York, supermarket shooting last May are now suing Meta, Snapchat’s parent company Snap, Discord, Reddit, 4chan, YouTube’s owner Alphabet and Twitch’s parent company Amazon. They claim the platforms radicalized the teen gunman before the mass shooting.  One school resource officer told The Post he tells parents to keep kids off social media until “at least 13” because of the risk that they will be exploited for nudes or money by extortionists.  Corp. David Gomez, an officer with the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said he operates multiple fake accounts to see what “kind of drug issues” are impacting the area, as well as to search for local runaways. He regularly gets contacted by men and women while portraying both boys and girls, he said.  Corp. David Gomez, of the Boise County Sheriff’s Office, said “dangers” await young users of social media sites, including scammers in search of money or sexually explicit content.  “I just regurgitate what the kids say and then I get adult predators who want to meet for sex,” Gomez, 50, said. “As a community, we need to increase our education of parents and kids about social media dangers.”  He also cultivates relationships offline with students, but he realizes authorities are outnumbered.  “This is like emptying the river with one cup at a time,” Gomez said. “Most adults cannot fathom the amount of kids that are becoming victims to these things.”  SNAPCHAT BULLIES TOLD MY SON: ‘GO KILL YOURSELF’  Rosellene Bronstein, 49, of Chicago, traveled to California for a protest outside Snap headquarters in Santa Monica on Friday because she does not want another family to lose a child to suicide – as she did last year.  She joined dozens of parents calling for stricter regulations on social media companies and expressing support for the proposed Kids Online Safety Act. The measure, proposed by a bipartisan group of senators, would require annual independent audits assessing risks to teens and increased parental controls.  Nate with his parents, Rob and Rosellene Bronstein, during a trip in 2020, roughly two years before the bullied teen committed suicide. Social media sites deliberately use algorithms to “create addiction” among young users, his mother told The Post. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “The algorithms are deliberately designed to create addiction to the content our children are exposed to,” she continued. “And couple with our children’s desire to be validated by likes, shares and views, these online environments are extremely harmful to our children’s mental health.”  Bronstein’s son, Nate, took his own life in January 2022 following relentless bullying by more than 20 classmates at the Latin School of Chicago.  Just weeks before hanging himself, the 15-year-old had received a Snapchat message from a basketball teammate urging him to “go kill yourself,” she recalled.  Bronstein said Nate reported the abuse to school officials, but his parents weren’t informed until it was too late. She and her husband Rob Bronstein later filed a $100 million lawsuit against the school, alleging their son was initially targeted by bullies who wrongly believed he was unvaccinated.  “Social media platforms do not care about our children. They only care about profits.” Rosellene Bronstein  They also joined a class-action lawsuit that accuses platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and others of being designed to maximize screen time and encourage addictive behavior, often resulting in emotional, mental or physical harm.  “It’s really up to us parents to come together to create our own societal shift and say, ‘Enough is enough, we’re not going to put our kids on social media,’” Bronstein, whose daughters Mia and Sydney are 19 and 15, told The Post.  Nate Bronstein, 15, was found hanged in his family’s home just one month after he received a Snapchat message urging him to “go kill yourself,” his mother told The Post.  She said parents should consider keeping their teens away from social media altogether if possible, likening abuse of sites like Facebook or TikTok to smoking or doing drugs.  “It’s the same idea, it has to be applied to social media,” Bronstein said. “But parents aren’t there yet. And what really upsets me is that parents have their heads down in the sand, thinking this is not a crisis. That’s the issue.”  She also wants Snapchat to allow parents to monitor all the content its teenage users receive by permitting third-party apps such as Bark to monitor messages, something the platform does not currently allow.  A $100 million lawsuit filed by Robert Bronstein, left, and his wife Rosellene alleges the Latin School of Chicago committed “willful failure” to stop continual bullying of their son Nate. Courtesy of Bronstein Family  “If I would’ve been able to use Bark with Snapchat, the minute he would’ve gotten that message, I would’ve gotten like a three-alarm alert on my phone,” she said. “We would have been able to save our son.”  Users must be at least 13 to create a Snapchat account and teens receive an alert if they’ve accepted a friend request from an adult. The app also recently launched its “Family Center,” a tool allowing parents to track friends of their teens without getting access to their messages, a company spokesperson told The Post.  PREDATORS AT PLAY  April Veneigh, 39, wants other parents to know that young adolescents – like her 12-year-old daughter Kaelyn – can be targeted outside traditional social media giants such as Instagram or TikTok.  Kaelyn, then 11, connected with another user on the online gaming platform Roblox early last year. The chat later moved to Discord, a voice-video-text service where most conversations are private.  The other user claimed he was 14, and started to “groom” Kaelyn, now in the sixth grade, by sending explicit videos and requesting nude photos from her, Veneigh told The Post.  April Veneigh, 39, of King City, Oregon, with her two daughters, Kimberly, 16, and Kaelyn, 12. An online predator recently targeted Veneigh’s younger daughter, she told The Post. Courtesy of April Veneigh  “He claimed he was 14, but was very advanced for a 14-year-old,” said Veneigh, of King City, Oregon. “He got her to think we were abusive and that she could only trust him with everything.”  Veneigh said she noticed changes in Kaelyn’s behavior after she connected with the stranger, including severe anxiety and panic attacks.  That led her to contact her cellphone provider, Verizon, which was able to show the files Kaelyn had been sending, leading to the horrifying discovery that she had been groomed into sending naked images.  Veneigh then called cops, who told her the investigation would include FBI officials since the other user was suspected to be in Wisconsin. No arrests have been so far, she said.  “I’m still waiting to hear back from police and what they find,” Veneigh said.  Veneigh said other parents should regularly check with cellphone providers to find out what files are being sent since all data, including sexual content, is backed up. The “cloud doesn’t lie,” she said.  “You don’t know who is really on the other end of that computer. There are too many face filters. People can be older but make themselves look like a child. It’s scary,” Veneigh continued. “You also don’t know who’s going to be grooming your child.”  The mother of two urged other parents to get their kids away from screens with exercise or running errands.  “I’m embarrassed and ashamed this is happening to my family,” Veneigh said. “It’s so depressing.”  HOW TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM LED TO ANOREXIA  Jon Sayah, 61, of Dallas, said his three children use TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat at least four hours per day. “They’re hooked on social media,” he told The Post.  But three years ago, at the peak of the pandemic, his eldest daughter, Lucy, 20, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, an illness he believes was exacerbated by her social media use.  “She is just getting better now,” Jon told The Post. “Social media provided detailed strategies on eating less, strategic foods to eat, behaviors to avoid the professional check-ins, and most important what her friends were doing and what she was missing or not included.”  Jon Sayah, his wife Julie, and their children (from left) Betsy, 18, Lucy, 20, and Dustin, 13. The couple tried to enforce restricted use of social media, but that only caused more friction, Jon told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Lucy, now a sophomore at Northwestern University, said she wishes she had not become so invested in social media. She first logged onto Instagram at 13, later joining TikTok.  “Social media has caused me to constantly compare myself to others online and has greatly contributed to the onset of my anorexia nervosa,” she said, adding she no longer uses others’ posts to gauge herself.  “I would encourage parents, especially of young teens, to set boundaries with their children on social media use and time spent as it can have an extremely negative and maladaptive impact,” Lucy told The Post.  “Social media does not allow children and young teens to live in the present and instead forces them to view false realities of other individuals’ lives, which has the potential to be harmful.”  Dustin, 13, Betsy, 18, and Lucy, 20, would rather be in front of a screen instead of spending time together as a family because “they’re hooked on social media,” their father told The Post. Courtesy of Jon Sayah  Sayah’s 13-year-old son, Dustin, has already learned plenty on social media about sex and alcohol – topics normally associated with high schoolers, he said.  “Not sure yet what the impact is of growing up too fast,” said Sayah, who said attempts to restrict and lessen social media usage only caused more drama and tension in the family. Algorithms tailored for young users make them especially vulnerable, possibly triggering harmful behavior that seemingly appears “normal and popular,” he said.  “It is dominating their time and allows them to connect without ‘real connections,’” Sayah said. “It is a substitute for so many other activities.  “Conversations in the car, figuring out how to spend downtime, being creative, being uncomfortable trying to make friends or spending time on passions are all sacrificed when they can ‘kill’ several hours on social media a day during any time.”"

State Rep. Brandon Guffey, 54, told CNN that he got the Instagram message on the day his son Gavin would have turned 18 — and less than a month after he found him dead last year at their family home in Rock Hill.  “It said, ‘Did I tell you your son begged for his life,’ with a laughing face emoji,” Guffey told the outlet.  The sick, tragic crime was behind Guffey introducing “Gavin’s Law,” which was passed by state senators Thursday and is expected to be signed into law soon.  It threatens scammers who extort a minor or an at-risk adult with up to five years in prison for a first offense.  Guffey said he had no idea his son, a recent high school grad, was being blackmailed when he found him dead in the bathroom last July after hearing the loud thump of his body hitting the floor after he shot himself.  The lawmaker only realized 17-year-old son Gavin was being blackmailed after sextortionists started messaging him, too. Facebook / Gavin âGoopâ Guffey Remembrance  “My initial thought was, this is my fault — I left the gun out,” he said, adding he will never forget the pain of realizing his son died by suicide.  The sick plot emerged in part after the sextortionists started barraging Guffey and his family — including his younger son, Coen, 16 — with Instagram messages demanding more money.  They then realized that Gavin thought he was sharing nude photos with a young woman who first sent him pics — only to be told they’d be released to everyone he knew unless he paid blackmail.  The sextortionists started messaging the family of Gavin (here on his graduation day) after his death. Family Handout  Gavin had used Venmo to send the scammers all the money he had: $25.  “He was telling them he would get them more money, please don’t send these images out,” Guffey told CNN.  “They didn’t care.”  The grieving dad said the scammers used disappearing messages to make “kids feel safe” that their intimate pics would be scrubbed.  “What they don’t realize is, someone has another device recording that device,” he said.  “If you can extort 10 teenage boys that aren’t gonna say anything for $100 each, and do all that with one image that you got from a girl, it’s fairly simple.  “And teenage boys, whenever they see they’re getting that attention (from a girl), they’re not necessarily thinking.”  The FBI said that last year there were at least 7,000 reports of sextortion of minors, with at least 3,000 victims, mostly boys. More than a dozen are known to have died by suicide.  The true number may well be way higher because “the shame, fear, and confusion children feel when they are caught in this cycle often prevents them from asking for help or reporting the abuse,” the FBI says.  When Gavin died, his dad was in the middle of his successful run for state representative — and briefly considered quitting to focus on hunting for his son’s scammers.  “My wife said, ‘Absolutely not. You’re one of the few people that have a voice that can get out there and truly make a difference,’” he recalled.  The lawmaker’s wife persuaded him to use his office to help other young victims. Facebook / Brandon Guffey  He stayed in office, with “Gavin’s Law” his first order of business.  “I feel like he (Gavin) would want me trying to save additional kids from ever having to feel the way that he felt at that time,” he said proudly.  An FBI spokesperson told CNN that no arrests have been made in the Guffey case. The rep declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing investigation.

University Boston University  Researchers have uncovered a marker in the brain that could help identify people at a higher risk of suicide.  Every day in the United States, an average of 130 people take their own lives. In 2021, 12.1 million Americans seriously considered suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3.5 million of them even made a plan.  For the loved ones left behind after a suicide, grief is often clouded with regret and guilt: Why didn’t they know things were so bad? Could they have stopped it?  Although many of suicide’s risk factors are well known—depression, chronic pain, family violence, presence of guns—it’s not always clear why some people, and not others, slip from ideation to planning to attempt.  As reported in the paper published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, researchers found important connections in the brain differed among veterans with a history of suicide attempts—even before they tried to end their lives—and those with similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but without a suicide history.  The differences were in the functional connectivity between brain networks involved in cognitive control (adjusting our behavior or choices to fit a certain task or goal) and self-referential thought processing (reflecting on what we’ve done today or something embarrassing that happened years ago or thinking about what we need to do tomorrow).  “Our study provides evidence that this brain connectivity marker may be identifiable before a suicide attempt, suggesting that it could help identify those at risk for suicide,” says lead author Audreyana Jagger-Rickels, assistant professor of psychiatry a Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry. “This could also lead to new treatments that target these brain regions and their underlying functions.”  To look for indicators of suicide risk in the brain’s inner workings, researchers turned to post-9/11 veterans who’d been exposed to trauma. Participants were given a resting functional MRI scan, which tracks communication between brain regions and networks when no specific task is being performed—a common way of mapping the brain and how different areas interact.  The researchers then zeroed in on those who reported a suicide attempt at a one- to two-year follow-up assessment, but who had not reported any prior attempts. They examined brain connectivity before and after the suicide attempt and compared it to a matched control group of veterans with equivalent symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no reported suicide attempts.  The comparison revealed that brain connectivity between cognitive control and self-referential processing networks was dysregulated in veterans in the suicide attempt group, who were all part of a VA Boston Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) longitudinal study measuring brain, cognitive, physical, and psychological heath. Critically, this brain connectivity signature was present both before and after the attempt, suggesting that the marker may be a novel suicide-specific risk factor.  The findings may eventually help clinicians overcome one of the major challenges in suicide risk assessment—its reliance on self-reporting, Jagger-Rickels says.  “Interventions to reduce suicide risk are limited to people who feel comfortable enough to disclose—self-report—suicidal thoughts and behaviors,” she says. “Identifying measures that do not require self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors may help us identify people who are overlooked, and may also aid in the development of novel treatments targeting the brain mechanisms underlying suicidal thoughts and behaviors.”  The study also indicated that connectivity of the right amygdala, a brain region important for fear learning and trauma, differed between the suicide attempt and the control groups, but only after the reporting of a suicide attempt.  “This suggests that there are brain changes that occur after a suicide attempt, which could be related to the stressors surrounding a suicide attempt or due to the trauma of the suicide attempt itself,” says Jagger-Rickels, who’s also a principal investigator in the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “This would indicate that suicide attempts themselves impact the brain, which could increase future suicide risk.”  The Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute of Mental Health supported the work.

A new report by the Centers for Disease Control shows that an alarming number of adolescents are engaging in suicidal ideation, and the numbers are especially high among girls, and among youth identifying as Indigenous, Hispanic, multiracial, or LGBTQ+.  The report, The Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data Summary & Trends Report: 2011–2021, focuses on a decade of research on youth sexual activity, substance use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, violence, poor mental health, unstable housing, school connectedness, and parental monitoring, while also exploring the data by sex, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, and sex of sexual contacts.  CDC data from 2021 showed “significant increases in the percentage of youth who seriously considered suicide, made a suicide plan, and attempted suicide,” and that was true across all demographic categories. It was up to 22% compared to the 2011 report which showed that 15.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 months before the survey. In this latest study, female students were 16% more likely than males to make this consideration, at 30% and 14%, respectively. By race and ethnicity, the youth with the highest rates of ideation were youth identifying as Native American at 27%, followed by youth identifying as multiracial at 24%, youth identifying as white at 23%, youth identifying as Black or Hispanic both at 22%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander at 21%, and youth identifying as Asian at 18%. The rates spiked even higher for youth identifying as LGBTQ+ at 45% compared to 15% among youth identifying as heterosexual. The report noted that nearly 60% of female students and 70% of LGBTQ+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness and that 10% of female students and 20% of LGBTQ+ students had gone as far as attempting suicide.  “As we saw in the 10 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health among students overall continues to worsen, with more than 40% of high school students feeling so sad or helpless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year—a possible indication of the experience of depressive symptoms,” the report stated. That’s 14% higher than 2011.  “Nearly all indicators of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased from 2011 to 2021,” the report noted, although it showed no increase in the number of students treated for suicidal injuries.  Contributors to Instability in Mental Health  While the data showed an overall decrease in bullying and risky behaviors involving sex and substances, and a high level of parental monitoring among most youth, there was plenty of alarming data that could help to account for the continued decline in mental health among female students. For example, in 2021, almost 20% of them reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and 14% had been physically forced to have sex.  Other contributing factors for mental health decline among all students might include unstable housing, not feeling connected at school, and fear of violence. The report notes that a high level of parental monitoring, defined as “parents or other adults in a family most of the time or always knowing where they were going or who they would be with, and school connectedness, which it defines as “the feeling among adolescents that people at their school care about them, their well-being, and their success,” both correlate to decreased sexual risk, substance abuse, experiences with violence, and suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Overall, only 3% of students had experienced unstable housing, although the rates were disproportionately higher for Black and Native American students, as well as among youth identifying as LGBTQ+ who had any same-sex partners. Overall, 7% of students had been threatened or injured by a weapon at school, down about 3% from 2011 among males and unchanged among females. The percentages decreased among Asian and Hispanic students and there was no change among Blacks and whites. However, LGBTQ+ students were more likely than their peers to be threatened or injured in this scenario. And overall, 9% of students had to go to school in the past 30 days because of fear of violence. The rates in this category were especially high among students identifying as Native Americans at 13%, Black at 12%, Hispanic at 11%, and LGBTQ+ at 14%, and females were 3% more likely to stay home than their male counterparts who reported not going at 7%.  Finally, it’s debatable whether school, the setting where 95% of youth spend their daily lives, was a welcoming and safe environment. While white students felt more connected than any other group at 65%, only 61% of all youth surveyed said they felt close to people at school. Females were even less likely to feel that way at 58% compared to 65% among males. Only 54% of Native American and Black youth felt close to people at school and the numbers were only slightly higher among Hispanic youth at 58%. Meanwhile, only 58% of LGBTQ+ youth felt close to someone at school compared to 65% of their heterosexual counterparts.  Recommendations  “These data make it clear that young people in the U.S. are collectively experiencing a level of distress that calls on us to act,” the report said in its key findings section. “Although the primary goal of school is academic learning, they play a key role in shaping mental, physical, and social growth.”  To address this, the CDC made the following recommendations:  Increase school connectedness across all grades.  Increase access to needed services by improving school-based services and connecting youth and families to community-based sources of care.  Implement greater health education for all grades.  The report also recommended that schools reference the CDC’s What Works in Schools program, an evidence-based approach to the above recommendations that have led to improvements in sexual behavior, substance abuse, violence, and missed school due to safety concerns. It also noted that “schools that implemented policies and practices to support LGBTQ+ youth not only saw improvements in health and well-being for young people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, but also their heterosexual counterparts.”  An Intersectional Perspective  While the ten-year report did not explore the prevalence of these issues at the intersection of race and gender identity, a supplemental study released in April did use unadjusted logistic regression models to explore prevalence across some subgroups from 2019 to 2021. The study, titled Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among High School Students — Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 2021, showed a significant spike in serious consideration of suicide among Black, Hispanic, and white females students. For example, suicide ideation was up 6% among Hispanic females, 6.8% among Black, and 7% among white females, compared to 4.6% among multiracial females, 2.2% among Asian females, and .2% among Native Americans. It also showed a higher increase in suicide attempts requiring medical treatment for multiracial, Black, and Hispanic females, up 3.7%, 1.7%, and 1.1% respectively compared to an increase of .3% among Asian females and .6% among white ones, with no change for Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander females.  While this supplement does not include data on suicidal tendencies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender identity, UnidosUS knows Latinx students identifying as LGBTQ+ already are indeed struggling with mental health and safety issues. According to the 2021 UnidosUS fact sheet Latinx LGBTQ+ Students and Their Experiences, 22% of Latinx students identify as LGBTQ+, 40% have experienced assault and/or harassment due to race or gender orientation, 57% feel unsafe at school due to their gender expression, and 35% are likely to miss school because they feel unsafe there. The fact sheet also notes that 70% of these students experience symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, 64% major depressive disorder, 43% have considered suicide, and 18% have attempted suicide. And a new UnidosUS factsheet on mental health shows that Latino LGBTQ youth are 30% more likely to attempt suicide than non-Latino LGBTQ youth.  “The data shows that youth with intersectional identities, such as students of color who also identify as LGBTQ+ are disproportionately at risk and therefore it is important to recognize their unique experiences in order to equitably address their mental health and offer culturally and linguistically relevant supports and interventions,” says Amalia Chamorro, education policy project director at UnidosUS.  South Florida-based Afro-Latina LGBTQ+ youth human rights advocate Ayari Aguayo says the pandemic contributed to feelings of isolation, as well as exposure to violence and unwanted sexual behavior. She cited societal phenomena such as the hypertextualization of girls of color as contributors to exploitation and low self-esteem, and she fears feelings of sadness and hopelessness are likely to get even worse in a state like Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis has pushed through legislation banning classroom discussions of gender identity and some Black studies curricula, further adding to the fragile mental health of youth who feel further stigmatized.  “It’s all layered with not being in an empowered community, not having the tools, workshops, or the support services,” Aguayo said, adding that during the pandemic, she and her colleagues found they were able to combat these concerns by helping to introduce youth to inspiring characters who had been in similar life situations.  “We brought role models who were courageous and vulnerable, who said, ‘I grew up with abuse and this is how I became resilient, this is what I did to overcome it,’” said Aguayo.  This type of intervention is congruent with CDC study’s goal of maintaining high-quality surveillance systems, conducting, and translating youth supporting scientific research, and helping school systems provide health education for safer, more supportive learning.  In its fact sheets and other policy and advocacy materials, UnidosUS’s policy team encourages schools and districts to fund GSA, ethnic clubs, and staff professional development programs focused on improving mental health and creating diverse and inclusive learning environments. It also urges the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to enforce existing federal laws created to prevent and combat gender and race discrimination. And it also wants to see that same office disaggregate data to reflect multiple identities of students related to race, ethnicity, and gender identity when conducting student-focused research on topics like this one.  A February announcement by the U.S. Department of Education that it had received $188 million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support mental health and student wellness can help schools provide critical and necessary support. UnidosUS supported the passage of this legislation.  “As the President outlined in his State of the Union address, we must do more to tackle our nation’s growing mental health crisis, which is particularly acute among our youth,” Domestic Policy Advisor to the President Susan Rice said in the U.S. Department of Education’s February 16 announcement.  “Mental health and wellness have profound implications for our students, their academic success, and their overall outcomes, and we know that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in that same announcement. “The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act represents an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to supercharge efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students.”"

Some of this comes in the wake of the alarming CDC report released in February showing unprecedented levels of sadness and suicidality, especially in teen girls. Some say social media is to blame for this recent rise in mental health problems, and I remain skeptical.  But before we try to understand what variables might be causing the problem, we should first clarify whether there is, in fact, a problem, and what exactly the problem is. Some of this depends on how we interpret mental health trend data. Is the American adolescent suicide rate at an all-time high? And how do we compare to the rest of the world?  While it is the case that the suicide rate among American teenagers increased over the last 10 to 15 years, if we pull back the lens a bit, things get more complicated. Across recent history, we can see that overall, the teen suicide rate is about the same now as it was in the 1970s. In fact, the suicide rate amongst teen boys was higher in the 1990s than it is now. Following this, it dropped in the late 90s and early 2000s (no one knows why), before rising again in the 2010s. Look for yourself at the CDC data here.  Still, even if teen suicides are lower than last century, it is still alarming to see them rising in recent years. Something is definitely going on. If, for example, we hypothetically found out that cancer or pregnancy death rates were increasing over the past few years, the notion that they had gone down 30 years ago and were now returning to baseline would be cold comfort. But is the recent increase in youth suicide a worldwide phenomenon? The answer appears to be no. In most other countries throughout the world, the suicide rate among adolescents has not increased over the past 10 to 15 years. A paper published in 2020 by a group of researchers from Britain found that the suicide rate amongst teenagers has risen only in Australia, Canada, the UK, and USA. Whereas in France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, Japan and Korea, the teen suicide rate has fallen.  These researchers characterize the four countries with rising teen suicidality as being unique in several ways. These are “populous high-income predominantly English-speaking nations” which also have high levels of economic inequality. These four countries were all in the top five highest for economic inequality (measured by Gini index) out of all the countries studied. Simply put, the people in these countries are “W.E.I.R.D” relative to the rest of the world. The researchers also point out that social media cannot be an explanatory factor for the rise in teen suicides, since all countries studied throughout the world have the same media access as American teenagers do. If social media was the key variable that explains the rise in teen suicide, we’d be seeing comparable rises in most other countries. But we don’t see that in the data.  The study authors also ran analyses examining whether the places with an increase in teen suicides also had a greater increase in social media usage compared to the other countries. They did not find any statistical difference. They also looked at the proportion of young people who used social media for more than one, three, or six hours per day, and it was also not statistically different across those countries. Simply put, social media usage does not appear to be different across the countries with rising vs. flat suicide rates.  If you’re interested in looking at other countries besides those discussed in this research paper, Our World In Data provides a resource based on data from the World Health Organization. The same decrease in adolescent suicides over the past decade can also be found in countries such as New Zealand, Russia, Argentina, India, and Iran. For other countries such as Israel, Cuba, Norway, and Denmark there is virtually no change across this period.  What do all these countries have in common? This is for future research to discover. Some studies show that cultural factors such as strong social norms are a variable that predicts suicide in various countries, but this does not necessarily explain stability or changes in youth suicides across time. It would also be useful to consider specific subpopulations (e.g., young secular girls/women on the political left), to see if there are trends in suicide-related distress occurring in other countries besides America.  One thing does seem clear. The suicide rate among young people is not increasing throughout most countries around the world over the past decade, or even since the year 2000. Furthermore, we cannot blame social media for the rise in suicide among American teenagers. The data simply do not support this conclusion, for the simple reason that teenagers in other countries also have access to the same media that we do. It would be unwise and incorrect to declare that social media usage plays a role in suicidality."

In a place to promote healing, Dr. Emily Bullock offers the space for people to process at her psychotherapy clinic in Woods Cross, Utah.  “All different kinds of traumatic events that people have gone through, sometimes from long ago, sometimes current, sometimes accidents, sometimes sexual trauma, military trauma, things like that,” Bullock explained.  The kinds of therapy found in her clinic include EMDR, assisted psychotherapy, clinical yoga and ketamine.  “Ketamine is used as a tool to help people in their therapy to be able to accomplish whatever their goal is that they’re working on in their treatment,” she said.  She’s seen clients who utilize ketamine as medicine and has found it brings “a lot of hope and promise” to their lives.  “These psychedelic medicines and ketamine specifically — which is the one that’s FDA approved right now — have been incredibly beneficial and impactful for people in their lives when they’re used as a tool to aid them in their recovery or their mental health journeys,” Bullock said.  Something else has been impacting her this week, as those in the psychedelic medicine community talk, discuss and express emotions following what took place at a different clinic over the weekend.  “When you hear about a tragedy like this, it’s very confusing. It’s very distressing,” Bullock said.  Police said Dr. Parth Gandhi died by suicide after shooting and killing his 16-year-old son inside Salt Lake City Psychedelic Therapy and Research Saturday. It’s unknown if any substances were used prior.  Gandhi was known in the healing world for his work with psychedelics, specifically as they relate to autism, concussions, addiction and depression.  “It’s terribly upsetting for everyone in the psychology community in the medical community, in the psychedelic medicine field,” Bullock expressed.  Dr. Scott Allen, a physician and anesthesiologist who runs a psychedelic medicine clinic, knew Gandhi.  “Dr. Gandhi was a fairly influential educator within the psychedelic movement within Utah and sort of nationally to here,” he said. “He led a fairly large training course that a lot of people attended.”  He indicated how the people who are used to helping others are now working themselves to process this terrible event.  “We’re trying to figure out a way going forward in which we can help support each other,” he said.  Allen said they would host their next professional journal club in a couple of weeks and have been discussing ways to support each other’s thoughts, feelings and emotions as they work to take care of other physicians.  “We’ve been discussing ways that we can offer services to people and have a venue for people to kind of talk about what they’re feeling personally,” he said.  He said this one tragic act does not represent the psychedelic medicine community as a whole.  “Psychedelics, in general, tend to promote a lot of feelings of love, of connectedness, oneness with the universe. That’s usually what people experience is, is more love and more compassion for other people, more empathy. That’s usually what we see,” Allen said. “And so, for somebody involved with the psychedelic community, I think it kind of compounds the shock of it because most of us who have engaged with it, we’re like, ‘Wow, these substances make us so loving towards others.'”  Dr. Bullock, who specializes in working with complex trauma and led the Traumatic Stress Response Team in the U.S. Air Force, explained that in horrible traumas like this, it’s normal to experience a range of different emotions, and she talked about how crucial it is to reach out, get support and speak with others.  “It’s so, so important to be able to get take care of yourself and your basic needs following a tragedy,” she said. “But then also, getting the right kind of help and support immediately and thereafter.”  For anyone wanting to reach out for services, Bullock said the Utah Psychological Association is always available and is currently on standby to be able to refer people affected by last weekend’s events to the appropriate agency.  She said anyone in a dangerous or emergency situation should call 911, and there’s also the 988 mental health emergency line. That line will link people to a crisis response center, and they can deploy a team of mental health experts to intervene. The 24/7, free, confidential domestic violence hotline is also at 1-800-897-LINK.  The Utah Psychological Association released the statement below in response to the situation. It explains their sorrow for Gandhi’s daughters, his son’s mother and others close to them, and how they’re ready to help his clients.

Alexandre Baril: “I coined the term suicidism to refer to an oppressive system in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence. Our society is replete with horrific stories of suicidal individuals facing inhumane treatment after expressing their suicidal ideations. The intention is to save their lives at all costs and interventions range from being hospitalized and drugged against their will, to being handcuffed and shot by police, to losing their jobs, to having their parental rights revoked, to even being kicked off university campuses. Thus, suicidal people often remain silent and complete their suicide without reaching out to anyone.”  “Worse, I argue that suicide prevention services do more harm than good. Simply put, suicide prevention often increases deaths by suicide rather than prevents them. This is especially true for marginalized suicidal people such as Indigenous, racialized, homeless, poor, queer, trans, disabled, neurodiverse and Mad individuals, for whom suicide intervention often increases the racist, colonialist, classist, sexist, heterosexist (or homophobic), cisgenderist (or transphobic), ableist and sanist violence they experience. My thesis is that suicidal people are oppressed by suicidism and the oppression they experience remains under-theorized.”  Q: Support for suicidal persons is not working. Please explain why that is.  AB: “Suicide statistics remain relatively stable and have not improved significantly over the past decades. Despite decades of multiple strategies and billions of dollars invested in outreach initiatives, studies show that those most determined to die carry out their suicidal plans without reaching out for help. In sum, our prevention strategies do not work.”  “My work found current prevention services generally fail to connect with suicidal people, who do not feel safe asking for help. This silencing effect, due to suicidist consequences (experiencing forms of harm when revealing suicidal plans) leads suicidal people to not feel supported to share their distress.”  Q: You believe that offering assistance in dying to suicidal patients would better prevent unnecessary deaths. How?  AB: “The most radical idea of my book is to theorize suicide as a positive right that would involve supporting suicidal people in their quest for death through assisted suicide. This support would be delivered through a suicide-affirmative approach. This might save more lives than current prevention strategies.”  “This non-stigmatizing approach would provide suicidal people with the chance to speak freely and to benefit from an accompaniment process to reach an informed decision about their desire to live or die. My approach has the potential to drastically reduce rates of suicidality, particularly among marginalized groups, by opening channels of communication with people who are currently too afraid to reach out for help.”  “Even for the small minority of people who would go ahead with an assisted suicide, they would have a less lonely and violent death and a relational process of dying that would also be less traumatic for family and friends.”  Q: Should this idea ever come to fruition, what kind of impact would you expect to see? How would this influence a person’s suicidal ideation?  AB: “My approach is a radical de-stigmatization of suicidality. Slogans such as ‘Speak Up, Reach Out’ or ‘Let’s Talk’ urge suicidal people to share their distress. But suicide prevention services send a paradoxical message since those who open their hearts often experience harm, forced treatments, and rights violation in the name of care and of saving vulnerable people from themselves, all because suicide is never an option.”  “Through my approach, suicide becomes an option, one that should be carefully thought through within an accompanied process during which various options would be seriously considered to help the person make an informed decision. By removing the suicidist violence suicidal people experience when they share their suicidal ideations and plans, and by supporting the assisted suicide of the person if they determine that this is indeed the best option for them, suicidal people would finally feel safe to speak up, reach out for help and talk about their distress. In my approach, the priority is the suicidal person, not life itself. Instead of completing their suicide without speaking with anyone, they would be accompanied as they contemplate making this crucial decision, weighing all the pros and cons, informing their relatives and family members, and preparing for this passage from life to death.”  Q: Are there examples of this model working elsewhere in the world?  AB: “There has never been a model such as this before. Throughout history, some philosophers, bioethicists and thinkers have promoted the right to die by suicide, but it’s always a negative right. Those in favor of a positive right to die limit this exclusively to the context of assisted death in the case of disability/sickness/illness.”  “My work questions why we offer assistance in dying to people who, in the vast majority of cases, don’t want to die and ask for better living conditions. And those who do want to die, such as suicidal people, are denied any assistance and are forced to die alone in atrocious conditions. If such an idea was adopted, it would lead to a completely different social, political, and legal landscape than the one we are used to. This is an out-of-the-box idea, which invites us to radically rethink both our perspectives on suicide and assisted suicide.”  Q: The inspiration comes from the support that transgender persons receive. Please elaborate on this parallel.  AB: “The positive right to assisted suicide for suicidal people may be new, but my suicide-affirmative approach is inspired by trans-affirmative approaches to rethink the care offered to trans people – not based on forms of control and gatekeeping – but to support their autonomy. My suicide-affirmative approach is anchored in self-determination, informed consent, and harm reduction. Instead of trying to cure trans people of their transness or suicidal people of their suicidality, we develop safer spaces in which we can examine their suicidality with them and discuss a variety of options.“  “A shift from prevention to accompaniment would empower suicidal people. Similarly to a trans-affirmative approach, the suicide-affirmative approach offers care and support through an informed consent model, taking for granted that the expert in the decision to transition—in this case, from life to death—is the person making the decision.”  “Regarding the theorization of suicidism and the rights and recognition of suicidal people, we are currently where trans people were regarding trans rights and recognition in the 1930s. Indeed, everything needs to be imagined, theorized, and transformed, as was the case for trans people several decades ago when transitioning was not even an option. My work constitutes a first step in this direction; it allows us to open our hearts and imaginations regarding the possibility of envisioning suicide and assisted suicide from a different point of view, from the standpoint of suicidal people.”  Baril, Alexandre.

The campaign targets 26-70 year-olds and shows the impact of simple, direct dialogue about suicide and how to initiate those conversations when they are more important than ever. In 2021, 48,183 died by suicide , an increase of 4.79% from 2020.  Talk Away the Dark Father showing emotional distress  Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9170651-american-foundation-for-suicide-prevention-talk-away-the-dark-campaign/  Research shows that suicide is preventable. The more we openly, honestly, and directly talk about suicide, the more we can help to prevent it.  The campaign anchor is a public service announcement (PSA) produced by TBWA\Chiat\Day New York through a pro bono partnership with AFSP. It depicts a daughter having brave conversations with her father as she recognizes in him common warning signs of suicide. The PSA ends with the daughter asking her father directly about suicide, bringing him back from the shadows and into the light. Its message is clear: we can't begin to address suicide if we don't take the first step and start the conversation.  ""In the past several years, we have made tremendous progress in our openness surrounding mental health. However, many people are still unsure about what to do when someone they know is struggling with their mental health,"" said AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia. ""Our campaign is a powerful reminder that we all have the ability to help.""  ""I have experienced loss from suicide, so our work on this is incredibly meaningful to me,"" said TBWA\Chiat\Day New York Chief Creative Officer Amy Ferguson. ""To partner with AFSP and put the talent and efforts of our agency to use on such an important issue is so incredibly rewarding.""  AFSP will be hosting a virtual event on its Instagram channel with experts at 4 p.m. ET on May 16 to discuss best practices for having important mental health conversations with loved ones. The PSA will appear nationwide across broadcast, digital, social, and print and it connects with Spanish-speaking communities, offering translated resources.  The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention is dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide. AFSP creates a culture that's smart about mental health through public education and community programs, develops suicide prevention through research and advocacy, and provides support for those affected by suicide.

On Monday, the company said it will soon display messages that people searching about suicide could use to ask for help. Based on specific templates, the prewritten messages will contain different requests to speak or chat with a friend, family member, or other trusted contact.  If you need help, visit: The International Association for Suicide Prevention  The idea behind Google's initiative is that a person thinking of suicide might run an online search looking for answers or guidance or information, especially if they don't know where else to turn. In that case, the person might not even know how to describe what's wrong or why they're having suicidal thoughts. And they may be reluctant or embarrassed to contact a friend or family member directly.  Designed to remove some of the difficulty and stigma involved in reaching out to another person, the messages will offer direct requests such as the following:  Also: Is ChatGPT an effective therapy alternative? 80% of this study's participants thought so  ""I'm struggling right now and just need to talk to someone—can we chat?""  ""This is really hard for me to say but I'm having painful thoughts and it might help to talk. Are you free?""  ""I don't want to die but I don't know how to live. Talking with you may help me feel safe. Are you free right now?""  The person could choose the message that best expresses their feelings and thoughts and then text it directly to a loved one, who hopefully will be able to intervene and provide aid and comfort to that person.  The pre-written messages were developed by Google in partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention. But this isn't the first time Google has made an attempt to help individuals thinking of suicide.  For several years, suicide prevention information has been available at the top of relevant search results. Last year in the US, the company updated this information to display the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of state and local call centers from the US Department of Health.  A 2022 survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 90% of the people polled felt that the US is facing a huge mental health crisis. On its end, Google said that searches for ""mental health crisis"" have risen each year. In this environment, people in crisis need easier access to mental health resources and to friends and family members for support.  Also: Generative AI could lower drug prices. Here's how  ""People often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments,"" Dr. Megan Jones Bell, Director of Consumer and Mental Health at Google, said in a blog post. ""In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on.""  Google has also directed certain resources to teenagers and young adults. For people in the 10-34 age group, suicide is the second leading cause of death, according to the CDC. In response, the company offers crisis support resource panels on YouTube to help young people connect with live crisis professionals for suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. To address that last issue, Google has started to remove content from YouTube that shows or promotes eating disorders such as binging and purging."

It will recommend appropriate action if the allegations are found to be true after a police investigation.  Commission chairperson Leena Gangopadhyay told PTI it has spoken to all concerned, including the complainant – a woman student residing in a state-run Kazi Nazrul University hostel near Asansol on Saturday. The members of the commission recommended to the police that all the points referred to in the woman's complaint, including the alleged life threat sent to her by the accused via SMS, be examined.  Gangopadhyay said the commission received a complaint from the post-graduate student that the accused had raped her at her cabin at a private hospital where she had been admitted after her “death by suicide attempt” as their relationship had turned sour. ""Apart from our members who had met her personally, I have interacted with her more than once over the phone and heard her views.  ""We have also been informed by her that when she lodged a complaint with the police, she got a threat via SMS allegedly from the professor. We know that the accused was arrested and then got bail. We have nothing to comment about the judicial process but will ensure that the complaints are investigated thoroughly by the police. If the charges are found to be true, the accused should be punished as per law,"" Gangopadhyay said.  ""The commission has spoken to all stakeholders to arrive at the truth, she said. There are some inconsistencies in the alleged incident of rape at the nursing home and the claims of the university authorities,"" the chairperson of the commission said.  ""We want to ensure the security of the girl student. We have sent certain recommendations to the police and university to see that no physical harm is done to her,"" she said. A Bangladesh Deputy High Commission spokesperson said ""We have received an official complaint from the student. We have forwarded the same to the university authorities and the police urging them to look into the issue, examine the complaint and take suitable action.""  A university spokesperson told PTI that the student concerned has 18 months left to complete the course. He said the university will extend all cooperation to the investigating authorities and take appropriate action if the charges are proven correct. ""As of now we don't have anything else to comment on the alleged incident,"" he said. The name of the accused, who got anticipatory bail after lodging the complaint last week, was withheld as investigations were on."

Gujarat BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama. (File Photo)  As per the complaint lodged by Chag’s son Hitarth Chag at Veraval police station, his father had lent about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.75 crore to Naran Chudasama who wanted it for his business. On being asked to return the money, Chudasama and his son refused to do so and had threatened to kill the complainant and his father, as per the complaint. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.  The FIR is filed under IPC Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  Dr Chag, 59, who is also a philanthropist in the coastal town of Veraval, was found hanging at his residence with a suicide note beside him on February 12.  The one-line suicide note written in Gujarati blamed Rajesh Chudasama and Naran Chudasama for his death. Hitarth alleged that the names mentioned in the suicide note are Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh-Gir Somnath and Naran Chudasama is his father.  On February 17, Hitarth lodged a complaint with Veraval police, demanding that the MP and his father be held accountable for his father’s suicide.  As the police did not immediately register an FIR against the MP and his father based on Hitarth’s application, he approached the Gujarat high court in March.  In his plea he alleged that police had acted in contempt of the Supreme Court’s Lalita Kumari judgment by refusing to lodge an FIR in the case. The SC judgment lays guidelines for registering FIRs in cognizable offences and prescribes a time-bound inquiry for non-cognizable ones.  The petition was disposed of by the court earlier this month on the grounds that the appropriate forum should address the grievance."

The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said. (Representational Image/Getty Images)  Police said that the student was depressed after learning of her poor performance in the board exams, the result for which was announced on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) GS Sidhu said that the student had left a suicide note saying she was upset over the result and had walked out of her home on Friday. Police did not clarify how far away the drain was from the victim’s house, but said it was in the same neighbourhood.  “We have not found any foul play behind the death so far,” the officer added.  The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said.  DCP Sidhu said that the girl was dejected. Her parents said that around 3.30pm, she quietly walked out of her home and it was only later that they discovered the suicide note written by her, after which they approached the police at around 9.30pm, police said.  “We launched an extensive search operation to find her. We also took all other legal steps to trace her by informing the police control room (PCR) and flashed wireless messages to all the station house officers in Delhi and all the deputy commissioners of police by describing the student. The details of the missing girl were also uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet) but we got no response,” said the officer.  On Sunday morning, police received a call about the partly submerged body of a girl being found in a drain. “The body was taken out from the drain with the help of locals and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. She was soon identified as the missing victim by her father,” said the DCP.  Since there was no indication of foul play, the police initiated proceedings under the CrPC instead of registering an FIR.  This is the third known case of a student dying by suicide in the Capital due to performance issues in the Class 12 board exam since Friday. In the first instance, a 19-year-old woman student died in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri after failing. In the second case, a 16-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar hanged herself to death after scoring 75%, which was lesser than what she had hoped.  A senior official from the Directorate of Education said that the department offers a helpline to students where they can reach out for counselling. “Students can call up the Yuva helpline and get in touch with education and vocational guidance counsellors on the toll-free helpline.

The charity has temporarily removed mascot Pudsey’s eye covering to show “not all of the challenges that children and young people may be facing are visible”, the broadcaster said.  The campaign encourages conversations between children and parents, carers and other trusted adults “to ensure no child faces their emotional and mental health challenges alone”.  Behind The Bandana ambassador Dr Alex George (BBC/PA)  Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, who has campaigned for better mental health after the death of his 19-year-old brother Llyr by suicide in 2020, has been named Behind The Bandana ambassador.  He said: “I know how important early intervention is in helping make a difference to the emotional wellbeing of children and young people and so I am very proud to be the ambassador of such a powerful campaign that really shines a light on the mental health crisis we are facing.  “As highlighted by Pudsey bear himself, mental health issues can be less visible on the outside, but conversations and positive relationships really can help.”  As part of the campaign, Children In Need has released the findings of a new Censuswide survey shedding light on how comfortable children feel when asking for help with their feelings and how often they feel the need to put on their “metaphorical bandana” and hide their emotions.  While nine in 10 parents surveyed said they talk to their child about their mental health at least once a month, more than a quarter of young people surveyed said they had not talked to someone they trust about their mental health in the last six months.  Children In Need’s boss Simon Antrobus said: “This research is a clear indication that our Behind The Bandana campaign is urgently needed.  “What’s also clear is that we can all play a role in addressing early signs of worry and anxiety by showing children and young people that we’re here to listen and to support them.  “By recognising and acknowledging that some feelings of worry and anxiety can be hidden means early conversations, sensitively delivered with kindness and empathy, can make a real difference to a child’s wellbeing and can help prevent mental health problems from becoming embedded.”"

Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney at just 17 to chase a contract in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns throughout a rollercoaster career that almost broke him in more ways than one.  The 28-year-old spent seasons on the sidelines battling a foot injury that left his chances of running again uncertain and his playing career in freefall.  A product of a tough upbringing, Brown struggled when he moved to Australia and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide.  While playing with Cronulla at age 19, Brown says he felt isolated and disconnected from everyone.  Bulldogs backrower Fa'amanu Brown pictured with his mother who passed away in 2020  Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney to play in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns that almost broke him in more ways than one  'I went and signed papers at Cronulla Leagues Club … and I was, like, 'Man, I'm done. I want to go home or else I'm going to commit suicide',' he told ABC News.  And one night when the pressure became unbearable, Brown swam out into the ocean as far he could.  'God, if you're going to take me, take me now because, man, I'm done,' he recalled thinking at the time.  'But, for some reason, I floated on my back, swimming backwards back to the shore … I remember just crying,' he said.  Brown spoke to his mother afterwards and she encouraged him to be strong.  The young footy star started earning big bucks with the Sharks, but without proper guidance Brown soon developed a gambling problem.  'I ended up becoming broke. I went through a gambling phase. There was a point where I had to ask [the club to be paid] in an advance,' he admits.  It was his mother's cancer diagnosis that finally made him pull himself together and became the defining moment of his life.  Brown struggled when he moved to Australia to play footy and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide  Brown (pictured with his partner) started earning a large wage with the Sharks, but without proper guidance the youngster soon developed a gambling problem  'There was a time where Mum was going to be put into a rest home, where people look after them until they pass, or we had an option where me and my brothers look after our mum,' he explained.  Brown thought a care home would be the best idea, but his brothers talked him out of it.  'But my brothers know the Samoan way more than me … My older brothers said: 'Trust me, you'll understand once you start looking after her.'  'This beats my NRL debut, making whatever money … I don't think getting married will top this.'  In a social media post from 2020, the footy star detailed how he was feeling while looking after his dying mother.  Brown says his mother's cancer diagnosis pulled him together and became the defining moment of his life  Brown thought about putting his mum in a care facility for her final days, but was glad he spent the time with her instead  'What I've learnt through my relationship with mum is there's no point in holding grudges towards others,' he wrote.  'Life is too short to darken your heart. Every time you say goodbye to your loved ones that could be the last time you will hear or see them. Now she is sick, I regret so many things.  'I should've would've could've but i know it's made me who i am today. Realise before it's too late.  'Everyday embrace your loved ones. Tell them you love them. Say it sincerely. Record memories. Be present. Say sorry. Talk it out. Continue to love & forgive even when it hurts.'"
