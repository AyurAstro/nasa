NASA announced it selected billionaire Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin to make its lunar lander for Artemis V, a mission slated to put astronauts near the moon’s south pole in 2029.  And with the Friday announcement came the unveiling of the moon lander’s official name(opens in a new tab), sure to thrill orange-flavored wheat beer enthusiasts: Blue Moon.  SEE ALSO: Get ready: SpaceX Starship will try to fly again soon    “We always hoped Blue Moon (the beer) would land in space one day, but we’re excited to see it will land on the moon in such an iconic mission,” the brewery said in a statement to Mashable. “While we won’t be involved in this lunar landing, we’ll be excited to welcome the team back home on Earth at the bar with a Blue Moon Belgian White on draft.”  Their excitement wasn’t unexpected: Soon after Blue Origin’s proposed lander name surfaced in 2019, the brewers designed a limited edition keg in the form of a lunar lander with the Blue Moon logo prominently displayed.  The product overlap didn’t escape Elon Musk’s notice, founder of SpaceX and Bezos’ chief competitor:  “But putting the word ‘Blue’ on a ball is questionable branding,” he tweeted then.  The Blue Origin contract will provide NASA with a second ride to the moon. The U.S. space agency intends to use SpaceX Starships to land astronauts on the lunar surface during Artemis III and IV(opens in a new tab), two upcoming missions which could come as early as 2025 and 2028, respectively, with an extended contract worth $4 billion. As part of the deal(opens in a new tab), the company will need to demonstrate an uncrewed test flight to the moon beforehand.  During Artemis III, Starship will transfer astronauts from NASA’s Orion spacecraft to the lunar south pole and back. But in the fourth mission, Starship is expected to dock at a moon-orbiting space station, the yet-to-be-built Gateway, and ferry astronauts back and forth to the moon.  That is also the expectation for Blue Moon, which will perform several test flights without passengers using the company’s rocket, New Glenn, said Blue Origin vice president John Couluris, a launch vehicle that hasn’t flown in space yet.  This outcome for Blue Origin, a $3.4 billion contract, follows a bitter rivalry between the two big private space companies. Bezos’ company lost its bid for the first lander contract to SpaceX, and NASA opted to extend its deal with the competitor for Artemis IV. Wanting to overturn the decision, Blue Origin unsuccessfully sued the space agency in a U.S. federal claims court last year.  Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up for Mashable’s Light Speed newsletter today.  Under the Artemis V contract, Blue Origin will work with several industry partners: Lockheed Martin, Draper, Boeing, Astrobotic, and Honeybee Robotics.  During a news conference in Washington on Friday, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said using private vendors will help the agency buy down the technical risks and costs for the Artemis program, which seeks to use the moon as a springboard for eventual missions to Mars.  “I’ve said it before: We want more competition. We want two landers, and that’s better, and it means that you have reliability. You have backups,” Nelson said. “These are public-private partnerships. It’s the new way that we go to the moon.”  People within the ispace mission control center react to losing communication with the Hakuto-R lander on April 25, 2023.  Credit: ispace / YouTube screenshot  Over the past four years, the private sector and other spacefaring agencies have tried and failed to land on the moon with crewless spacecraft. An Israeli nonprofit and company collaborated in 2019 on the Beresheet mission, which crashed on the lunar surface after an orientation component failed. Just last month, a Japanese startup, ispace, crashed as it tried to land. Company officials said a preliminary investigation determined the lander ran out of fuel.  Couluris told Mashable during the news conference that Blue Origin is up to the task, in part because of its esteemed partners, such as Lockheed and Boeing, which bring loads of experience to the team. NASA is also providing insights.  “It’s kind of like a perfect blending of what we’re trying to do, of lessons learned, so we don’t repeat those ‘lessons’ again,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbXlkcm9sbC5jb20vYmV6b3MtbHVuYXItbGFuZGVyLWZvci1uYXNhLXdpbGwtYmUtbmFtZWQtYmx1ZS1tb29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"volcano eruption","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T11:44:34","The Earth’s hot and largely turbulent interior remains a mystery to scientists. Even at shallow depths, our planet’s crusty outer surface contains many unknowns.  Magma deep in Earth’s mantle that rises to form continental crust Inherently different to the magma seeping from the hills in the middle of the ocean. The magma that erupts from volcanoes on Earth contains less iron, which makes it noticeably lighter. This is the key that allows the Earth to float above the Earth’s mantle, while the oceanic crust forms a lower basin.  However, experts can only speculate as to why this difference exists. Now, a major hypothesis proposing a source for the volcanic magma that formed the continental crusts has come under scrutiny by scientists in the United States.  In 2018, researchers Proposal That the iron-depleted nature of the continental crust stems from the way tectonic plates interact with each other at subduction zones. The authors argued that as one plate slides under the other, pressure crystallizes the silicate material in the rising magma, sucking iron out of the molten rock in the process.  Geologist Elizabeth Cottrell is not convinced.  Very high pressures are needed to remove the iron by crystallization of the silicates, she says, and some parts of the Earth’s crust where iron-deficient magma flows are not that thick.  So the pressure is not too high. Explain Cottrell, who works with the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History.  Simulating the heat and pressure of these subduction zones in the lab, Cottrell and colleague Megan Hollickross, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University, measured levels of iron and iron oxide in simulations of continental crust.  They used a piston cylinder that could compress small samples of molten rock with extreme pressures and temperatures to match the conditions of magma chambers in the Earth’s crust.  Even with pressure 15,000 to 30,000 times greater than Earth’s atmosphere, crystals of a silicate substance, known as garnet, fail to remove enough iron from rock to account for the unique composition of Earth’s continental crust.  Agate crystal, the authors He says“not likely to be responsible” for the “trend of iron depletion observed in the continental crust”.  “It is likely that conditions in the Earth’s mantle below the continental crust create these oxidative conditions,” he said. He says Cottrell.  “If the agate is not crystallizing in the crust and is something to do with how magma got out of the mantle, what is going on in the mantle?”  Just this year, scientists using seismic waves discovered a new layer of partially molten rock hiding deep in Earth’s interior, which could fundamentally change our understanding of how the mantle belches magma.  One of Cottrell’s colleagues is now investigating whether oxidized sulfur could play a role in removing iron from mantle magma before it erupts.  The puzzle continues.  The study has been published in Sciences.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25vZmxhcm9uZ2UuY2EvYS1tYWpvci1oeXBvdGhlc2lzLWFib3V0LWhvdy10aGUtY29udGluZW50cy1yaXNlLXdhcy1qdXN0LXNoYXR0ZXJlZC1zY2llbmNlYWxlcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But if you want to take a day trip from Rome to explore even more of Italy’s rich history, you should consider visiting Pompeii. This ancient city is located about 150 miles from Rome and is one of Italy’s most popular tourist destinations.  Pompeii was famously destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and only rediscovered in the 18th century. Today, visitors can come and explore the ruins of this once-thriving city and get a glimpse into what life was like in ancient Rome. In this article, we will guide you through planning your day trip from Rome to Pompeii, exploring the top sights and attractions, and providing recommendations and tips to make the most of your visit.  Introduction to Pompeii and its History:  Pompeii, once a bustling Roman city, fell to the destructive eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Up to 20 feet of ash and pumice buried the town, preserving it for centuries until rediscovery in the 18th century. Now, as one of the most well-preserved Roman cities in the world, it offers visitors a glimpse into life in ancient Rome.  How was Pompeii destroyed?  Did you know that when Mount Vesuvius blew up, it wrecked Pompeii? It was one of the most dangerous volcanic eruptions ever! Scientists think the explosion released 100,000 times more heat than the bomb that hit Hiroshima. The eruption lasted two days and buried Pompeii and several other nearby towns under thick ash and pumice.  The Significance of Pompeii:  The preservation of Pompeii has provided valuable insights into the daily life and culture of ancient Rome. The city has helped historians and archaeologists better understand ancient Roman architecture, engineering, art, and everyday life.

"volcano eruption","2018-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T00:59:00","Actress Jennica Garcia. Dreamscape Entertainment  MANILA — Jennica Garcia cannot be happier that Pie Channel recently gave her a chance to host with the weekly program, “Ur Da Boss,” with Melai Cantiveros.  “When I started acting in showbiz, I became very dependent on the character I portrayed to build my confidence, to build the how-to’s on how I will present myself,” Garcia told ABS-CBN News.  “So I did the same way for hosting. It’s so nice when I hear Melai or Jolens [Magdangal] say they watch on the Pie Channel ‘yung tunay na sila. I want to see that, too.”  Admittedly, Garcia’s real self is not ideal for hosting yet. “Ini-isip ko na lang na for this show, I’m going to be the nineties version of Jean Garcia.”  She can hardly keep up with her loaded showbiz schedule.  “With ‘Ur Da Boss,’ ‘Fractured,’ then I have TV guestings,” Garcia said. “Sometimes, I don’t even know what day is it. I am often not aware anymore. I just make sure I have my schedule for the week. It can really get overwhelming. Hindi ko agad tinatanong ang schedule ko sa handler ko.”  Her two daughters, 7 and 4, are also part of her schedule. “The activities that they do in school, the field trips, I make time for them,” Garcia said. “Also, if my presence is needed.”  She wrapped up lock-in taping for the romance drama, “Fractured,” in the island, but she is still doing scenes in other location, although lock-in is no longer required.  Garcia is aware this is her second shot at showbiz. “I don’t think many people know, but my mom also had her second shot at showbiz,” she said.  “She made it big with ‘Pangako sa ‘Yo’ [2000]. So, I’m praying na sana pareho kami ng kapalaran ni Mama kasi, after my seven-year hiatus, when I returned, that was the same age as Mama then. History repeats itself. Ayos na ayos sa akin ‘yun. This is my second wind.”  Garcia only got important advice from her mom. “The first one was when I was 17 and she told me to be nice to everybody. Basta katrabaho mo sila, regardless of their position, be respectful,” she said.  “Her second advice to me, when I returned to showbiz, she told me that was exactly what happened to her. She went to Japan, migrated and worked there. But when the ABS-CBN offer for ‘Pangako sa ‘Yo’ came, Mama accepted it.  “Since then, she never left the country again. Nagtuloy-tuloy na ang trabaho niya. My mom told me, ‘Anak magaling ka ng artista. Kailangan lang mabigyan ka ng tamang project. Magtiwala ka lang’.”  Garcia is surprised why all the good breaks are happening to her right now. “Dalawa ang anak ko,” she said. “Hiwalay ako sa asawa. Ang daming artista ngayon. Hindi ko alam kung ano ginagawa ko why they are giving that kind of support to me.”  She is simply thankful for all the good breaks now and that her family is helping her take care of her kids. “People think that I’m strong, I can do everything. No. I have people behind me that’s why I am able to do it,” Garcia asserted.  “My Papa [actor Jigo Garcia] and his wife, Amy, I leave my kids to them when I have work. At times when my dad couldn’t take care of my kids, my Ninay from Bicol, comes to Manila to take care of my kids. She was the one who helped raise me.  “Once is a while, when my mom is not busy, she also helps me take care of my kids. Thank you, God, for the gift of family. When I cannot count on my Papa, my Ninay, my Mama, I really cannot work because no one will take care of my children.  “As long as I know my kids are happy, I can also happily do my work. In my dad’s house, five floors ‘yun. My kids happily see their cousins and play with them.”  When she’s not busy with work, Garcia finds time for her daughters. “I can take them out and we can eat out, go to our favorite restaurant,” she said.  Garcia worked as medical officer in the Alliance Search and Rescue, especially when Taal Volcano erupted.  “Galit na galit sa akin si Mama, kasi daw lahat ng tao sa Taal bumababa, ako naman, umaakyat. Kulang tayo talaga sa rescuers. Takot din sila for their health because of COVID.  “Hindi lang ‘yun ang problem. Lupus din. Leptospirosis kung susulong ka. May mga patay na rin. I get my confidence from the Lord.”  Although she is now open to dating, Garcia is hardly entertaining any suitors. Interestingly, she gets linked to showbiz guys like Ryan Bang and Christian Bables.  Last Mother’s Day, Bables surprised her with flowers and took her out to dinner. “Parang kapatid ko si Christian that’s why we’re close. He’s very close to his family. When he’s not taping or shooting, Christian is always in Cavite with his family.”  “That day, wala kaming taping so I got to meet his mom. But even before that, sobrang kilala ko na ang mom niya kasi palagi niya ka-Face Time while we’re taping ‘Dirty Linen.’ I’d like to think that we’ve very close already,” she said.

Click to go to the game:  Da Nooz:  *There’s only a bit more than a week left until the U.S. hits its debt limit, and until yesterday things looked as if there would be a rapprochement between Biden and the Republicans that would stave off a default. Now things have hit a snag again.  Negotiations between top White House and Republican congressional officials over a deal to raise the debt limit hit a snag on Friday when a G.O.P. leader in the talks said it was time to “press pause,” complaining that President Biden’s team was being unreasonable and that no progress could be made. It was a setback in the effort to avert a debt default before a June 1 deadline, though it was not clear whether the delay was a tactical retreat or a lasting blow to chances of getting an agreement. The halt came one day after the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus declared that Republicans should cease negotiations with Mr. Biden and insist on their debt limit legislation, which demanded steep spending cuts in exchange for raising the federal borrowing cap and is a dead letter in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The abrupt announcement of a pause also came just a day after Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, told reporters that he believed negotiators could reach a deal in principle as early as the weekend. But on Friday Mr. McCarthy and his deputies sounded a starkly different tone, saying that White House officials were refusing to come their way on spending cuts. . . .“We’ve got to get movement by the White House, and we don’t have any movement,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol not long afterward. “We’ve got to pause.” He hinted that a major sticking point was over how to cap federal spending. House Republicans passed a debt limit bill last month that would raise the nation’s borrowing limit into next year in exchange for freezing spending at last year’s levels for a decade.  It’s getting down to the wire, and I’m hoping that, given the gravity of this situation, the desire to compromise outweighs a partisan fight for “victory.”  *Salman Rushdie made a surprise appearance, and a short speech, at Thursday’s PEN America Gala, and I’m very glad that he’s able to do this. He even had some booze!  Salman Rushdie walked onstage at PEN America’s annual gala on Thursday night, his first public appearance since he was stabbed and gravely wounded in an attack last August at a literary event in Western New York. His appearance at the gala, which had not been announced, was a surprise. But no surprise, to those who know him, was that he began his speech with a joke. “Well, hi everybody,” Rushdie said, as the crowd at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan greeted him with whoops and a standing ovation. “It’s nice to be back — as opposed to not being back, which was also an option. I’m pretty glad the dice rolled this way.” His remarks, just a few minutes long, in accepting an award for courage may have been uncharacteristically terse. But Rushdie, who lost sight in one eye because of the attack, was his voluble self during the cocktail hour, for which he had slipped in through a side door before taking his place for a red-carpet photo op. Flashbulbs popped. And as the crowd began to notice him, friends headed over for handshakes and hugs. “I just thought if there’s a right thing to chose as a re-entry, it’s this,” he said in an interview. “It’s being part of the world of books, the fight against censorship and for human rights.”  Here’s a photo with the caption from the NYT:  What’s a bit ironic about this is that six PEN America members refused to show up at this gala in 2015 when Charlie Hebdo was getting a “courge” award. Their reason? Because the French magazine was making fun of Islam, held by “marginalized people”. Well, that’s why Rushdie was given a fatwa that was supported by many in the West.  *Here are three items from Nellie Bowles’s weekly news summary at The Free Press, called this week “TGIF: The suburbs are back.” Speaking of PEN:  → Masha Gessen resigns from PEN Board: Prestigious literary group PEN America was hosting their annual World Voices Festival of International Literature and decided that Russian dissident writers were still too Russian to attend. So they canceled the Russian writers panel. The writer Masha Gessen, one of those Russian dissidents, resigned as vice president of the PEN board over it. Anyway, it’s a typical mess. Amid bad publicity PEN apologized, calling it a big misunderstanding. I’m all for helping the Ukrainians and am pro–Team America World Police, but liberal America’s intensity on this war has gotten to the point where we’re going to have to watch out for suburban dads terrorizing local pierogi joints.  I disagree with PEN, which is woke, but I also disagree with Bowles’s ire towards “liberal America’s intensity” about the war.  → Because the culture war was getting boring: The LGBTQ advisory group of Massachusetts is recommending that the commonwealth expand child abuse laws to include “the withholding of gender-affirming care for LGBTQ youth.” (H/t Wesley Yang for finding that.) Tasking child protective services with taking children away if they’re not immediately put on hormone therapy will surely calm the conversation around this. Meanwhile, Texas Children’s Hospital said they would stop performing hormonal and surgical interventions on gender nonconforming children but has not stopped, according to a City Journal investigation. And The New York Times, in attempting a takedown of pediatric patients who detransitioned, accidentally confirmed that 15-year-old girls are getting mastectomies. → MeToo is out: There were a few years when the focus of modern society was on women and the slogan was #BelieveWomen and make them feel safe and comfortable. Now, #MeToo is #done. Case #1: The group of sorority sisters in Wyoming who are suing their sorority for allowing a biological male who occasionally IDs as a woman to join, alleging that the new member had a boner while they changed clothes. The villain in the modern telling? Those girls! (Also I will say, the “transwoman” here doesn’t seem totally legit, as it were, in that they haven’t changed the sex on their driver’s license, haven’t had surgery, and apparently rarely even wear women’s clothes. I’m gonna need to see a little more effort before you can go full Kappa Kappa pillow party.) Case #2: In Seattle, a city official who is a rape survivor didn’t want a convicted repeat sex offender to serve on the homelessness council but was overruled this week. The new line: believe none of these crazy ladies! They’re being a little touchy, don’t you think? A little. . . hysterical?  *In his Weekly Dish column, “The Queers versus the homosexuals,” Andrew Sullivan takes a look at what the “queer movement,” including transgender activists, has done to the gay and lesbian movements, and he doesn’t like it. First, he argues that “queers now run the gay rights movement, and adds:  The core belief of critical queer theorists is that homosexuality is not a part of human nature because there is no such thing as human nature; and that everything is socially constructed, even the body. . . . To be homosexual, in contrast, is merely to be attracted to the same sex, and gays and lesbians run the gamut of tastes, politics, backgrounds and religions. Some are conservative, some radical, some indifferent. Some gays are queers. But most aren’t. And queers now run what was once the gay rights movement. (For a longer, piercing reflection on the takeover, read historian Jamie Kirchick’s new essay in Liberties. For a discussion of the homophobia of the new queer activism, see Ben Appel’s excellent essay in Spiked.). . . Gay hook-up apps now include biological women seeking gay men and straight men looking for chicks with dicks. “NO MEN” some profiles now say — on what was once a gay man’s app. There are fewer and fewerexclusively gay male spaces left. Lesbian bars? Almost gone entirely. Lesbians themselves? On their way out. Dylan Mulvaney is exemplary of the new queer order: a femme gay man who had to take female hormones to stay relevant. (Compare and contrast with disco icon Sylvester’s view of gay liberation: “I could be the queen that I really was without having a sex change or being on hormones.” We are going backward, not forward.) Then the queers upped the ante and did something we gays never did: they targeted children. If they could get into kids’ minds, bodies and souls from the very beginning of their lives, they could abolish the sex binary from the ground up. And so they got a pliant, woke educational establishment to re-program children from the very start, telling toddlers that any single one of them could be living in the wrong body, before they could even spell. . . . The queers regarded any therapy exploring other possible reasons for a child’s transgender identity — autism, family breakdown, abuse, bullying — as “conversion therapy,” and have made it illegal in some states. But the original Dutch study on which this entire medical regime stands specifically excluded any child with any other mental health challenges. It’s not as if the queers ignored the original safeguards, or didn’t know about them; they just consciously threw them away. . . .You might imagine that, given this record, the queers would go out of their way to reassure us, to show how tight the safeguarding is, how they screen thoroughly to ensure that gay kids are not swept up in this. But they regard the very question of whether gay kids are at risk as out of bounds. Children are regarded as the ultimate authority on their own treatment: not the doctor or the parents, but the child. Here’s a queer activist writer, Masha Gessen, saying that one thing “should be off limits” in this debate: [In the NYT] there’s a [paraphrased] quote from Andrew Sullivan, the conservative gay journalist, who says, Well, maybe these people would’ve been gay—implying they’re really gay and not really transgender. That really clearly veers into the territory of saying ‘These people don’t exist. They’re not who they say they are.’ So that’s why it’s so painful. No it doesn’t. It’s perfectly possible to believe that transgender people exist, but that children may not know who or what they are before they’ve even gone through puberty. . . . But we have to be insistent that the gay experience is distinct and different and not intrinsically connected to either queer ideology or the trans experience. We have to demand that children’s bodies — gay, straight, trans, gender-conforming and gender-nonconforming — be left alone. And we must do all we can to make sure that the trans-queer revolution does not result in what it seems to be moving toward: the eradication of homosexuality from public life.  He goes on to claim that this kind of activism is driving gay men and women away from liberal politics. I’m in no position to evaluate that, but Sullivan does make some credible claims.  Oh, and a bit of self-aggrandizement: from the “Money quotes” for the week section:  “White-throated sparrows have four chromosomally distinct sexes that pair up in fascinating ways. P.S. Nature is amazing. P.P.S. Sex is not binary,” – Laura Helmuth, editor-in-chief of Scientific American. The sparrows have just two sexes, as Community Notes corrected. Jerry Coyne has a beaut of a piece on this.  *If you’re into good but inexpensive red wines, and who’s not, then have a look at the WSJ’s article “Italy’s Best Bargain in Red Wines Now“.  What’s your favorite bargain red? That’s a question I’ve fielded many times, and after a recent tasting I have a new reply: Montepulciano d’Abruzzo. Produced in the central Italian region of Abruzzo, a good Montepulciano d’Abruzzo can cost as little as $9, though many cost more and tend to be, correspondingly, more complex. I hadn’t tasted much Montepulciano d’Abruzzo in recent years, but the 15 bottles I bought, priced between $9 and $28, were, with a few exceptions, so good that I will definitely be buying more. . . .I’ve never been to Abruzzo, but I’ve heard it described in such captivating terms that I’m determined to rectify that fact. San Francisco-based restaurateur and wine director Shelley Lindgren is a big fan who’s visited Abruzzo seven times and described it as “hauntingly beautiful.” Although the region has long been undersung and overlooked, Lindgren thinks that thanks to the heightened quality of Abruzzo wines and the beauty of the region, it’s “having a moment and deservedly so.” Lindgren said that Montepulciano d’Abruzzo wines are always among the bestselling by-the-glass offerings at both of her A16 restaurants, in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif.  Author Lettie Teague recommends five wines between $9 and $26, and here’s one that intrigues me:  And how can the lush, aromatic 2021 DeAngelis Montepulciano d’Abruzzo cost a mere $12 a bottle? It seems the DeAngelis family, whose winery is located in Marche, just across the border from Abruzzo, maintains a long-term contract to buy organic Montepulciano grapes from a great Abruzzo source.  Meanwhile in Dobrzyn, Hili and Andrzej are philosophically sardonic:  Hili: even narcissuses wither with time. A: But they do not stop thinking highly about themselves.  In Polish:  Hili: Nawet narcyzy z czasem więdną. Ja: Ale nie przestają o sobie dobrze myśleć.

Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment put out alerts and advisories for Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon for much of the eastern half of the state, including Denver. It warned that air quality may be unhealthy during that period.  “People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion; everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion,” the department said.  Particle pollution led the air quality index along parts of the Front Range to reach 168 on Saturday, the department said. A reading between 151 and 200 indicates unhealthy conditions that can affect sensitive groups as well as some members of the general public.  An air quality alert was also in effect Saturday in Montana, with the greatest smoke concentrations in central and eastern parts of the state, according to the Department of Environmental Quality.  Utah's Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it was starting to see the smoke on its monitors in northern and eastern parts of the state. It urged residents to avoid outdoor exertion in areas with visible smoke or haze.  The smoke created widespread haze across Idaho earlier in the week, according to its Department of Environmental Quality.  The fires in Canada have been burning mostly in the province of Alberta, where thousands of residents have evacuated and regional officials have issued state of emergency alerts. There have also been fires in British Columbia.  In Calgary and Edmonton, the two biggest cities in Alberta, the health impact was determined to be of “very high risk” on Saturday by the Canadian government's Air Quality Health Index. Sensitive groups such as children and older people were advised to avoid outdoor physical exertion and the general population was urged to limit outdoor activities.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc21va2UtY2FuYWRhLXdpbGRmaXJlcy1wcm9tcHRzLWFpci0wMTI4MDU2OTAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"volcano eruption","1972-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Managua"", ""Managua"", ""Nicaragua""}","2023-05-20T20:02:49","There are many reasons natural disasters are of interest. Personal safety requires being aware of the hazards where you live, work, or travel. Disasters can have more profound impacts than shaking, burning, or flooding your home and community. In some cases, they have changed the course of history.  Climate changes have had the most profound impacts. Prolonged droughts led to the fall of the Mesoamerican Mayan civilizations about 1,200 years ago. But geohazards have left their mark as well. The volcanic unrest of Santorini, associated earthquakes, tsunami, and cataclysmic eruptions contributed to the downfall of the Minoan civilization in the Mediterranean roughly 3,600 years ago.  Even in the modern world, the indirect tentacles of disasters can have widespread economic and political consequences. The 1994 Kobe, Japan earthquake in 1994 affected the global economy through trade disruption and the failure of banks and the 2011 Japan tsunami caused a shortage of critical parts for global manufacturing. Every Californian paid extra taxes after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to pay for the recovery.  How a government is perceived to have prepared for or responded to a disaster can have unexpected consequences as well. Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle was in power in 1972 when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck beneath the capital city of Managua. Nearly 10,000 people died and 300,000 were left homeless. The Somoza government received millions of dollars in aid from the United States and other countries, but graft was rampant. Somoza owned the country’s cement plant, and ‘Somoza Cement’ became the catchword for Somoza’s pocketing of funds and profiting from the reconstruction.  The poor response and corruption exposés consolidated Nicaraguan opposition groups leading to civil war that ultimately toppled Somoza in 1979. Civil unrest delayed reconstruction of Managua for nearly two decades. When the Sandinistas emerged victorious, it set the stage for the Sandinista — Contra conflict that embroiled the U.S. in the Reagan era.  The 1972 Managua earthquake is still producing political aftershocks today. Economic hardship and chilly relations with much of the world in the Sandinista era have spurred record-high emigration. Unauthorized Nicaraguan migrants at the U.S. border increased 52-fold in 2022 over 2020, putting them in the sixth place for country of origin in the current U.S. migrant crisis.  Disasters can elevate as well as topple regimes. Argentina experienced its worst earthquake in the summer of 1944. The January 15 magnitude 6.9 earthquake was centered close to the city of San Juan near the Chile border. The Peru-Chile trench parallels the west coast of South America and Chile bears the brunt of the continent’s seismic activity. But the tectonics affect neighboring Argentina as well.  Most large earthquakes in Argentina are deep, several hundred miles below the surface near the bottom of the Peru-Chile subduction zone. The great depth mutes shaking at the surface. But the 1944 earthquake was shallow and only 4 miles away from the city of San Juan, with more than 100,000 residents at the time. The earthquake killed 10% of the population, destroyed 90% of the buildings, and is acknowledged as Argentina’s deadliest natural disaster.  At the time, Col. Juan Perón held the relatively insignificant post of Labor Department head under the military dictatorship of Gen. Rawson. A populist, Perón pushed through a series of progressive social reforms and gained support from Argentine labor unions before the quake. Afterward, Perón grabbed the spotlight by mobilizing earthquake relief efforts and international fundraising. The earthquake provided him the platform to expand his influence and eventually propel him to head of state. It was during an earthquake fundraiser that Perón met Eva Duarte who would later become his wife. If you have seen the musical “Evita,” you have also been touched by the 1944 earthquake.  General elections were held last week in Turkey. The elections pitted incumbent president Recep Erdoğan against Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and two other minor party candidates. Prior to the Feb. 6 M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes of this year, there was little thought that opposition parties could mount a significant threat to Erdoğan’s tenure. But, like past tremors, the earthquakes shook not only buildings but the power structure.  The two earthquakes struck South Central Turkey and Northern Syria, killing nearly 60,000 people, and costing almost $120 billion (US dollars) in losses. As the dust settled, two problems dogged Erdoğan. The first was the perceived slow pace of relief efforts. All great disasters overwhelm the capacity of local and regional governments to respond. Conditions were exacerbated by the scale of the event — the double quakes expanding the area of very strong ground shaking, the frigid winter weather, and the refugee crisis due to the Syrian civil war.  Three problems stand out in the government response: inadequacy of planning, coordination of response, and politicizing the disaster. Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes and had instituted a number of response/resilience programs after the 1999 Izmit, Turkey earthquake. Response officials had recently planned for and practiced response to a M7.5 earthquake in the region. But the damages in 2023 were far more massive and the Turkish military, the only organization with the capacity to respond to an event of this scale, had not been included in any of the plans and exercises.  The second problem for Erdoğan was the damage itself. The president had encouraged rapid development in the region, using construction to drive economic growth over the past two decades. But many of these newer, supposedly earthquake-proof structures collapsed in the earthquake while a number of older buildings were relatively untouched. The finger has been pointed to shoddy construction practices, poor oversite, and corruption.  Last week’s election ended up in a virtual tie with both Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu receiving less than 50% of the vote, forcing a runoff in a week. Erdoğan’s performance was stronger than many had predicted even in the hardest-hit earthquake areas. The earthquake has changed the landscape in Turkey but it remains to be seen if the 2023 earthquakes will end up in the regime change column (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/opinion/turkey-election-erdogan.html).

George Santos (R-N.Y.) put himself in charge of his current campaign’s purse strings this week despite his recent federal indictment over alleged financial crimes related to his last campaign.  Santos, 34, listed himself as treasurer on documents filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday. He replaced a man named Andrew Olson, a mystery figure whose address was listed as the same apartment building where Santos’ sister was accused of owing $40,000 in unpaid rent.  Santos said in a statement that Olson had resigned and that he already found a new treasurer not named George Santos, but that he would reveal that person’s name at a later date.  After his election in November, the freshman congressman instantly made a name for himself as an accomplished liar, having misrepresented key information about his employment record, educational record and personal background.  He turned himself in to authorities at a Long Island courthouse on May 10 and pleaded not guilty. The 13 counts against him include wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and lying to the U.S. House.  He has refused to resign and maintains that he will run for reelection in 2024.  Prosecutors say that Santos used $25,000 in campaign funds on luxury items for himself in 2022 and that he took $24,000 in emergency pandemic unemployment benefits from New York state while earning a six-figure salary in Florida. He also allegedly misrepresented his personal assets on House paperwork by millions of dollars.  Still, Santos defended his decision to helm his campaign’s finances.  “On Friday, May 19, I was properly notified by my campaign’s then Treasurer, Mr. Andrew Olson, of his resignation. I appreciate the work Andrew and his team have done for the campaign and appreciate his willingness to ensure a smooth transition,” Santos wrote.  “To ensure compliance, upon the resignation, I was named as Treasurer. A treasurer must be appointed within ten (10) days of the resignation of the previous treasurer,” he continued, citing campaign finance law.  Story continues  “My intent is to operate above reproach,” Santos said. “We will continue to build our campaign around professionals with subject matter expertise. I have retained the professional services of a new Treasurer to ensure the campaign moves forward in compliance.

"volcano eruption","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T18:00:07","The role of great men and women in history has diminished since its dominance in 19th-century writing. Historians have continued to rate the achievement of individuals, good and bad, but few champion the advocacy of Thomas Carlyle, who gave a series of lectures on heroism in 1840.  Others have refined the theory, giving credit to those whose superior intellect, heroic courage, extraordinary leadership abilities, or divine inspiration have made a difference. In this century, Carlyle expert David Sorensen, in an introduction to a 2013 edition of the heroism lectures, noted the “antipathy to superior statesmen and to human excellence is peculiarly zealous, parochial, and antiphilosophic”.  It would be hard to imagine historians in the future ignoring the impact of such men as Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping, who respectively have launched a war or are threatening one to expand their notions of imperial power.  Publishers still find plenty of interest in biographies of such people, but another thread has also become popular. These play down the contribution of individuals in favour of other forces, often to the exclusion of any human agency.  Moreover, these books are ambitious in their sweep of history. Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs and Steel (1995) and Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens (2014) – to name just two – trace the rise and fall of civilisations through social, geographic, and economic factors using the modern insights of archaeology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, genetics, linguistics, and ecology.  More recently, Jonathan Kennedy’s Pathogenesis views the entire arc of human life through the lens of germs, infectious diseases, and great plagues. Another addition to this genre has already become a bestseller.  Peter Frankopan.  The Earth Transformed, by Peter Frankopan, is a whopping 700-plus pages – so much so that its 200 pages of source notes, but not the bibliography or index, must be accessed through a website. Frankopan teaches global history at the University of Oxford and has already established a reputation with his two Silk Roads studies of Central Asia and early globalisation.  Historians’ traditional concerns  These were based on historians’ traditional concerns of war, economics, and political power. His new book is far more ambitious: the role of climate change in its widest sense, with particular emphasis on natural disasters. Not just storms and floods but earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, solar activity, and even crashing meteors.  A benefit of this “whole of history” approach is that it draws on research using modern tools such as laser imaging, spectroscopy, isotope data, and climate-related information on fossil use as well as conventional historical sources.  His claim that this is “an untold story” is bold but justified. However, he cautions against rushing to easy conclusions that surround the debate on global warming and the doomsday scenarios of climate activists. To the contrary, he is more concerned about the impact on the environment of nuclear escalation, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and volcanic activity.  He quotes research that last year’s eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano was equivalent to largest of the US nuclear tests in the 1950s and that “so much water was vapourised and sent into the atmosphere that it might lead to surface warming and intensify climate trends”. Since publication, those effects have been linked to extreme weather events.  The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic eruptions was equivalent to the largest US nuclear test in the 1950s.  For Frankopan, environmental factors, including the climate, are not “actors in the story of our species”. Rather, “they provide the very stage on which our existence plays out”. This was at its rawest state in the origins of life on Earth as land masses moved and volcanic activity was rife. Alternating ice ages and warm periods dictated movements of early populations, influencing their food sources, the development of urban living and, in turn, the spread of diseases, often with catastrophic consequences.  In general, global warming led to expansion of civilisations and associated prosperity, while cold periods did the opposite. The Roman Empire rose through one of these warmer periods known as the Roman Optimum (100BCE to 200CE) but declined in the third century as reduced solar activity, volcanic explosions, and increased sea ice led to rapid cooling, less food and, eventually, political, economic, and military crises.  The Little Ice Age (1550-1800) in northern Europe was another period of climatic extremes, resulting in poor harvests, food shortages and famines, plagues, and conflict. Perverse human trends included the persecution of women as scapegoats, clinical depression, and mental health.  Plagues spread through Europe from the 14th century.  Human behaviour subject to other influences  These cooler temperatures were not universal. The climate in southern Europe remained warm, though human behaviour was subject to other influences such as the invention of new weapons of war.  European expansion, fuelled by shipping technology, religion, and the knowledge explosion, created the ‘great divergence’ as the civilisations of China, India, and the Americas were subjugated. The global imperial powers valued their colonies’ supply of minerals; calorie-rich food crops such as potatoes, sugar, and maize; and textile fibres, which generated the Industrial Revolution.  Stable climatic conditions continued through the 19th century and up to the middle of the 20th century. This period of human history downplayed the impact of environmental and climatic factors. Coal and oil during the 1920s provided a cheap source of energy and consumer products.  Warmer and cooler periods occurred between the 1890s and 1940s, creating heatwaves and droughts, as well as extremely cold winters in the late 1930s and 1940s. Frankopan drills into some of the more egregious human violations of the environment. One example was Lenin’s adage: “Communism is Soviet power plus electrification.” The price was high in both human and environmental costs.  “Faith in technology, exaggerated support for decisions made by high-ranking party officials and the obvious consequences of dissent meant that there was little or no pushback about the pollution, increased salinity, loss of topsoil or other disastrous consequences…”  This Soviet-era nickel smelting plant shows extent of environmental damage.  Meanwhile, in the West, soil degradation and erosion led to the dust storms in 1930s America and the beginning of moves to protect the environment with more sustainable practices, such as the development of national parks.  In his final chapters, Frankopan cites concerns such as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) on the use of pesticides, defoliants in the Vietnam War, and fears of world hunger from rising populations and exhaustion of resources. While these were allayed by the “green miracle” of plant genetics, other threats were identified, including the first worries about the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 1957.  Forces of nature  Ironically, it was the Pentagon and the CIA that first raised climate-related issues such as food shortages in a ‘nuclear winter’ and rocket flights being affected from the destruction of the ozone layer by nitrous oxides.  While there’s reason for optimism in climate-friendly advances – such as long-life lighting, water conservation, clean energy, waste management, and the phasing out of coal – Frankopan is less convinced about human efforts to counter the bigger forces of nature.  History is a “story of resourcefulness, resilience and adaptation.” But this can lead to a false sense of security. “We are living on the edge of our means and indeed beyond them.”  His pessimism was shared by the UK government’s Office for Budget Responsibility, which in a report said it would be nature, rather than human action, that ultimately brought net emissions towards zero. “It will do so through catastrophic depopulation, whether through hunger, disease, or conflict.”  Avoiding that future remained an open question historians could not predict. One can only hope some “great men and women” will continue to play their part in forging a future on Earth rather than leaving nature to do its worst.

And May 9 of this year — less than two weeks ago — has certainly become a date that will remain on our national calendar as an anniversary of immense political significance.    So, it would be an appropriate question to initiate a discourse on how one had reacted to a particular situation that had arisen on a particular date. In this case, the arrest of Imran Khan by the Rangers had triggered a response from the supporters of his party and protests in major cities had greatly disrupted the lives of a large number of citizens.  At an emotional level, the impact was more widespread because of the strong feelings that the former prime minister has activated in a deeply polarised society — to the extent that talking politics with an adversary in a civilised manner is almost not possible. For this reason, also, the date and the day became important.  But how important would this date become in our history? Is it another day of infamy that will remind us every year of a tragedy of large proportions and underline the loss of a national sense of direction? Will it figure significantly in the catalogue of our deviations from the path of sanity and reason?  Obviously, I am distracted to think about many other dates that stand out as potential turning points, dates that marked the culmination of a series of misadventures and missteps. I have a long list of such dates and I feel that they are connected in some random manner to define the present reality of Pakistan. I think of them as milestones on our journey to May 9, 2023.  Where does one begin? There was the sixteenth of December not just in 1971 but also in 2014, when 132 children were massacred by the Taliban gunmen in Peshawar’s Army Public School. There was the fourth of April in 1979 and the twenty-seventh of December in 2007.  In my view, the thirteenth of April in 2017 deserves a high place in this because of how Mashal Khan was lynched not by a mob in a bazaar but by his fellow graduate and post-graduate students on a campus in Mardan. In the same category, Salmaan Taseer was assassinated by his own guard on the fourth of January in 2011.  The performance of the higher judiciary should have some linkage with what happened on May 9. For that matter, there is this date that is generally not remembered, that of the judgement of Justice Munir in the case of Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan that changed the course of our destiny. It was March 18 in 1955. Coincidentally, it was the same date — March 18 —in 1978 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to death by the Lahore High Court.  As I said, there are so many other dates that I can recount and one segment of this register of shame relates to military interventions at the cost of the democratic principle of civilian supremacy. Pakistan’s first martial law was imposed on October 7, 1958, with the abrogation of the constitution by President Iskander Mirza, who was himself deposed by Gen Ayub Khan on October 27, 1958. There are other generals and other dates.  Coming back to the present, there is still no clarity as to how dark and deadly the shadow of May 9, 2023 will be and what its impact will be on the future of politics and the nature of governance in Pakistan. What is certain is that this date is now stamped in blood in the history of Pakistan.  Actually, May 9, did not reveal its secrets all at once. It took some time for the volcano to erupt. Yes, there were suggestions immediately that the PTI rioters had crossed a red line and the ISPR had issued a scathing statement the next day, stressing that “May 9 will be remembered as a dark chapter”. It also noted that a large number of “PTI supporters” had barged into the residence of the Lahore corps commander and had ransacked it, setting fire to its furniture.  However, the gravity of the situation and the ruthless crackdown on PTI leaders and supporters emerged gradually. It now seems ironic that when Imran Khan was summoned to the Supreme Court on May 11, he did not appear to be under any threat. Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial greeted him with words that may survive as a footnote in history: “Good to see you”.  So much so that when Imran Khan was given an unprecedented blanket relief by the Islamabad High Court on May 12, the lead in an English daily the next day said: ""‘Victorious’ Imran returns home after blanket relief”. But that impression, created by the benevolence of the higher judiciary, has totally dissolved and the prospects for the leader and his party look bleak indeed. The reverberations of May 9 are becoming seismic in nature.  In the heat of this moment, there is little opportunity for a patient and thoughtful analysis of how Imran Khan has led himself into a direct confrontation with the establishment. A number of issues related to civil liberties and due process have also surfaced after the resolve, validated by the National Security Committee, to try rioters under particular laws. There is an aggressive campaign to whip up popular emotions against the arsonists. The tempo is dangerously rising. Imran Khan has protested “the brutality of our security forces”.  One big question is whether and when Imran Khan will be arrested. There is suspense about an operation at his Zaman Park residence and negotiations have been held to capture ""terrorists"" who the Punjab government insists are hiding inside. Something dire and drastic is lurking in the shadows. Is another date to remember around the corner?  The writer is a senior journalist.

"volcano eruption","2019-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Puyallup"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T14:29:07","Unexplainable, low-frequency sounds in the Earth's atmosphere are leaving scientists scratching their heads.  A group of scientists from Sandia National Laboratories have detected mysterious recurring sounds in the Earth’s stratosphere, the origins of which are unknown to experts.  “[In the stratosphere,] there are mysterious infrasound signals that occur a few times per hour on some flights, but the source of these is completely unknown,” said Daniel Bowman, senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, in a press release.  The stratosphere is a layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, and is known to be a relatively calm environment where sounds can be heard that may not be picked up elsewhere, as it is filled with ultraviolet-blocking ozone.  At a height of 21,336 metres, the low-frequency noises were detected by solar-powered balloons sent out to pick up on different sounds.  The balloons, which Bowman describes in a press release as looking like giant plastic bags, were about seven metres wide, and were fastened with infrasound sensors, called microbarometers.  To make the balloons float, they filled them with charcoal dust, making them dark enough to allow sunlight to heat up the air in the balloon.  “We build them using painter's plastic from the hardware store, shipping tape, and charcoal powder from pyrotechnic supply stores. When the sun shines on the dark balloons, the air inside heats up and becomes buoyant. This passive solar power is enough to bring the balloons from the surface to over 20 km (66,000 ft) in the sky,” said Bowman.  Although the scientists' initial intention was reportedly to record volcanic eruptions, they surprisingly made a new discovery.  The balloons also picked up a mixture of other low-frequency sounds, some familiar ones such as thunder, ocean waves and rocket launches, to name a few. But the mysterious, unknown low-frequency sounds left Bowman and his team without answers - although they have some theories that could potentially explain the noises.  They speculate the sounds could be from a previously undetected form of atmospheric turbulence, or perhaps are echoes of noises from the ground that are now unrecognizable.  More investigation will be done to better understand these sounds in the stratosphere, the researchers said. They’ll also trace more sounds back to where they came from and examine their variability across seasons and in different geographic areas across the world to try and figure out what they are.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5paGVhcnRyYWRpby5jYS9jdHYtbmV3cy1jb250ZW50L3NjaWVudGlzdHMtZGlzY292ZXItcGVycGxleGluZy1sb3ctZnJlcXVlbmN5LW5vaXNlcy1pbi10aGUtZWFydGgtcy1hdG1vc3BoZXJlLTEuMTk2ODY4MDLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Since its publication on May 17, the agreement has introduced an innovative system wherein the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (STPS), in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and other domestic and international authorities, can investigate goods imported into Mexico that are suspected of being produced wholly or partly through forced labor. If these allegations are confirmed, the Mexican Government could prohibit these goods from entering the country.  Investigations can be initiated either upon the request of individuals or legal entities established in Mexico, or informally by the Ministry of Labor if substantial evidence exists. The authorities will have a 180-day timeframe to investigate the goods in question, considering the International Labor Organization’s indicators of forced labor.  The STPS and the Ministry of Economy have made available a guide titled “Guide for the Implementation of the Mechanism to Restrict the Importation of Goods Produced with Forced or Compulsory Labor” to inform the public about this new system.  Through this measure, the Mexican Government underlines its commitment to eliminating forced labor from global supply chains and to counteract unfair competition practices that negatively impact Mexican businesses and the North American region’s economic dynamics.  The Ministry of Labor acknowledged that this development positions Mexico as a global leader in adopting a new foreign trade paradigm based on human rights and respect for human dignity, especially for the historically disadvantaged sectors.  Moreover, Mexico is aligning with Article 23.6 of the Labor Chapter of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which mandates member countries to create mechanisms prohibiting the import of goods made wholly or in part with forced labor.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbGxhcnRhZGFpbHkuY29tL21leGljby1pbXBsZW1lbnRzLW5ldy10cmFkZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtYWdhaW5zdC1mb3JjZWQtbGFib3ItZ29vZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He jumps in a fisherman’s boat, and when they spot an island where the fishing is good, he wades ashore, the dustbin keeping his other meagre possessions (rope, a sheet, a toothbrush) dry, too. The fisherman will collect him in a week or perhaps a month. He uses the tarp and dustbin to harvest rainwater and eats whatever he can catch from the sea or find on the island, growing or washed up.  In 2015, he spent 11 days on an island in Tonga that had been newly formed by an underwater volcanic eruption. He was the first person to spend a night in Hunga Tonga, which was only two months old at the time and had no vegetation. He survived by eating squid and bird eggs.  After an eruption in December 2021, which caused tsunamis around the world, the island disappeared. Even when Stuart was there, it was unstable. At one point, the ground gave way under his feet and he was washed into the sea — he is unable to swim. He also got stuck up to his waist in compressed lava dust.

Taal Basilica, founded in 1572, is considered the largest church in Asia. Damaged by a massive volcanic eruption in 1754, it has been reconstructed to its original architecture several times over, yet it continues to reign on top of a hill, overlooking the entire town filled with old houses and other memorabilia like a guardian angel. \!\[20221128\_103127\.jpg\]\(https://storage\.googleapis\.com/mb\-mkt\-neo\-prod\-1\-uploads/20221128\_103127\_129e875bf7/20221128\_103127\_129e875bf7\.jpg\) Famished after an hour’s drive from Rosario town and a long and winding, extended novena-prayer by my sisters, Cely, Marlyn, Marie, and Nellie, we proceeded to the town market at high noon to pick up the town’s famous signature products. The Taal public market is surprisingly neat and clean. It has long rows of stalls selling basically two products, tapang Taal and suman Taal. We find the much celebrated tapang Taal too salty for our gall stones, although the suman’s sweetness in aromatic coconut milk is just right for this non-diabetic. We pause by a small store, by Gina Tamayo, where Mac, the friendly storekeeper, gives us a discount on a dozen pieces of suman and 10 packs of sinaing na tawilis wrapped in banana leaf (too salty, too, I must say. Taal town must have salt beds by the hectares). \!\[20221128\_103055\.jpg\]\(https://storage\.googleapis\.com/mb\-mkt\-neo\-prod\-1\-uploads/20221128\_103055\_ce138672c8/20221128\_103055\_ce138672c8\.jpg\) The cheap, yet not-so-cheap purchase makes us even hungrier, as we set out to snoop at more cooked items, notably kalderetang kambing and sinaing na tulingan, around the public market. It was then that we stumbled upon this lovely events place along Diversion Road upon recommendation of good friend Teddy Razon, former high school classmate at La Salle Lipa, who’s now a golfer-businessman in Texas. \!\[20221128\_104524\.jpg\]\(https://storage\.googleapis\.com/mb\-mkt\-neo\-prod\-1\-uploads/20221128\_104524\_686a41ca96/20221128\_104524\_686a41ca96\.jpg\) Taal Bistro presents a beautiful mix of romanticism, old-world charm, excellent food, cool breeze, open spaces, and friendly service.

It sits proudly like a queen mother within a sprawling compound with, to put it mildly, acres and acres of parking space. This makes it ideal for weddings, banquets, and birthday celebrations, says Dong Razon, who runs the place with his wife, Mia.

Change is healthy and important, but change can be frightening too. Nothing remains as it was originally created for the duration of its existence. Rivers change. Landslides alter shorelines. Rocks are smoothed by weather. Volcanoes erupt.  These examples might be on the calamitous side, but caterpillars turn into butterflies, and people love that change. Hurricanes dissipate into rainstorms. Seeds grow into crops. Buds turn into beautiful flowers or leaves. Eggs develop into birds. Tadpoles mature into frogs. Change is vital. Change is beautiful.  As humans we tend to try to maintain sameness. We monitor temperature indoors. We watch calories. We want to grow old near where we grew up. We want that same job all-career long. But the Greek philosopher born in 540 B.C. named Heraclitus said, “The only constant in life is change.”  Somewhere around day three after my most recent surgery, I carefully walked outside to get some fresh-outside air. I was feeling a little emotional as I had made all the preparations God had led me to which meant big change. Change that had started in my heart some time ago, but only came to life very recently. Change that would redefine how I saw myself, how I tend my home, and how I interact with the world. Change that would demand reliance on God as I have been comfortable in this stage, the arena for nine years. On this occasion of slow stepping out the door, God revealed a truth to me using a magnificent butterfly.  As soon as I opened the front door, I was awed by the breathtaking beauty of a butterfly lazily fluttering its wings while poised on a piece of gravel. This butterfly had vivid, electric blue wings, brighter than any sky or ocean. The blue wings were outlined in velvety black. The bottom of the wings were serrated and had symmetrical blue dots lining the black bottom outline.  Naturally, me being a resident of 2023, I thought, “I wish I could take a picture of this beautiful butterfly.”  I felt in my spirit God saying, “Just watch and enjoy. It’s not beautiful because you can hold onto it, but because you could experience it and let it go.”  I was so humbled by God’s whisper that seemed to come on the wings of a stunning butterfly. I considered how I had so focused on my physical needs, the surgery, that I had forgotten my emotional needs as change was in the air. Through this one purposeful moment, I realized the place of security I was being called out of was still beautiful and wonderful and precious and special to me and to God, but it is beautiful because I had the privilege to be part of it for a time and am now being called to let it go.  An ice cream cone isn’t fantastic because it lasts, but because for a short time it’s sweet and cold and delicious. A baby’s smile isn’t adorable because it stays the same, but because excitement rises with each new tooth that comes in. Puppies and kittens aren’t lovable because they stay tiny and vulnerable forever but because they grow and mature into our faithful companions.  Flowers eventually wilt. Ice cream melts. Tomatoes decay. Sunsets fade to black. Change is imminent. We can choose to walk gracefully with God through change because there will always be change. We can choose to be present and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us in the moment knowing it won’t last forever. Or we can go through change by ourselves, pouting, lamenting, and fretting. The choice is ours.  Dr. Seuss said, “Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.” I smile because I have been blessed.  “Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

That’s the spot. Just imagine how fun it would be around Halloween,” said Clayton while using Visine drops. “I considered the bowling alley, but it’s loud, and I like keeping my shoes on. Trying to get a down payment together for a mortgage has been a bummer. My deadbeat dad won’t even help me at all. He keeps saying ‘it’s just a fucking picture on the TV, it’s not a real place. Why can’t you be more like your brother? He actually has a job and a real house.’”  Clayton’s father confirmed that his 32-year-old son has lived in his furnished basement for ten years.  “This little prick has been living down there rent-free since May 2013, after he graduated from college. I wanted to put a bar down there, and one of those little putting greens, but he’s down there stinking up the joint. All he does is watch that Cuckoo City video game and smoke marijuana cigarettes,” recalled the elder Mr. Clayton. “I’ve gone down there to tell him he really needs to get out of the house sometime, but he never listens. He just calls me ‘man’ and tells me to ‘stop blocking his view.’ ”  Marisa Boyd of Rocket Mortgage spoke regarding her recent phone conversation with the younger Clayton.  “He inquired about loans I’d recommend to first-time home buyers. I suggested a 15-year fixed loan,” said Boyd. “Then he rambled on and on about an active volcano erupting near the property, something about King Kong, and then had a coughing fit. That’s when I understood that he was talking about Roku City, like, the screensaver from the streaming device thing. I stressed that since the property is imaginary, we could not process his application. I wasted six hours of time on this guy when I could have been working with an actual client, I hate these dorks.”  At press time, both Clatyons were seen leaving the house together to go to a real-life bowling alley, though Remy secretly downloaded the Roku app onto his iPhone without knowing his “future home” wouldn’t exist on mobile.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGFyZHRpbWVzLm5ldC9jdWx0dXJlL3N0b25lZC1tYW4tZmluYWxseS1kZWNpZGVzLXdoZXJlLWhlLXdhbnRzLXRvLWxpdmUtaW4tcm9rdS1jaXR5LXNjcmVlbnNhdmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Madang Pariwa has announced that out of the three possible scenarios of the future of Manam people, he had decided on the resettlement at Andarum permanently. That is a choice between, remaining in the care centres, returning to the island or to resettle at Andarum.  “As a the government responsible for Madang, looking into the future I will develop Andarum because tomorrow in 20 years and 50 years time, the population of Manam will increase; and it will be impossible to keep living in the Care Centres,” Governor Pariwa said.  The people who had been living in Care Centres for almost 20 years had waited in vain to be resettled, but now they are being given alternatives of settlements to choose from.  “Whoever wishes to go to Andarum, may go, whoever wishes to remain in the Care Centre, you can stay, whoever wants to go back to the island like Baliau villagers, that’s ok too.

The event followed a recent warming trend and significant snowmelt.  The slide washed out an 85-foot bridge, damaged the roadway, and severed power to Johnston Ridge Observatory. No one was injured because of the incident and twelve members of the public who were stranded overnight at Johnston Ridge Observatory were safely flown out the following morning.  In coordination with federal agencies, the Washington State Department of Transportation WSDOT closed the highway to all travelers. Travel along SR 504 remains open with multiple scenic viewpoints up to milepost 43 near the Science and Learning Center at Coldwater.  There is currently no access to Coldwater Lake, the Hummocks Trail, and the Johnston Ridge Observatory. For safety, WSDOT and federal agencies strongly encourage people not to venture beyond the highway closure location due to the severity of the unstable hillside.  The USDA Forest Service is in the process of exploring alternative options for visitors who would like to visit the north side of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument this summer and develop a plan to manage the influx of visitors in a safe manner. Several other visitor centers located along SR 504 remain open to the public, including scenic viewpoints where visitors can see Mount St. Helens and learn about the history, eruption, and recovery of the volcano. As the snow melts and US Forest Service roads open for the season, additional sites on the Monument and surrounding communities will begin to open for visitors to explore.  WSDOT and federal agencies are working together to assess the slide area and develop next steps. Due to continued landslide instability, data collection is being conducted from the air.  WSDOT conducted a fixed wing aircraft LIDAR (Laser Imaging, Detection and Ranging) flight over the area on Friday, May 19 to gather preliminary data, weather permitting. This is an important step in collecting data to help inform when on-site access, cleanup and work can begin. It is too soon to tell when crews may be able to access the slide from the ground or when the highway may reopen.  A National Incident Management Organization team arrived on Friday, May 19 to support coordination across agencies.

An explosion of yellow and black lava that flooded the pitch to destroy what was almost a defining day in Leinster’s dynasty.  There was wreckage across the pitch, victims of a devastatingly physical 80 minutes. Leinster had built up a 17-0 lead but it was burnt down by a breath-taking La Rochelle comeback, as Ronan O’Gara stepped out of the rubble to be crowned king of Europe.  You could trawl through all the archives of club rugby and struggle to find a game of such intensity. The likes of Will Skelton and Gregory Aldritt fought with such physicality that they swallowed up a team of Irish internationals who are fancied to win the World Cup.  Outside this giant stadium, on Shelbourne Road, Leinster’s sponsors had plastered the street with campaigns about their bid to stitch a fifth European star onto the blue jersey. That is how the Stuart Lancaster and Johnny Sexton era was supposed to end. O’Gara had other ideas.  It was a game worthy of the biggest stage. La Rochelle would have beaten most national teams with their show of power. It was loaded with fight and drama, from the moment Gregory Aldritt called out James Ryan for showing a lack of respect at the captain’s coin toss.  La Rochelle celebrate after completing the biggest comeback in Champions Cup final history  La Rochelle staged a brilliant fightback that was capped by Georges-Henri Colombe's late try  Terse words were exchanged between Sean O’Brien and O’Gara in the tunnel at half-time and Sexton made his thoughts known to referee Jaco Peyper at the final whistle.  For 12 minutes, Leinster lived up to their billing and more. They produced one of the greatest openings ever seen, transporting their fans into a fantasy land with three quick tries. Dan Sheehan scored after 41 seconds, capitalising on a trick play at the lineout, creating a hole by shifting La Rochelle’s lifting pod.  Five minutes later, following a massive 50-22 from James Lowe, Leinster scored again. They fired players into the ruck like human kamikazes, using miss passes and dummy runners to narrow the defence, before Jimmy O’Brien scored on the wing.  The breakdown was like a mosh pit. Leinster’s defence was ferocious, tackling runners in twos and threes, swarming around ankles like a pack of jacked-up hyenas. A team possessed. With Tawera Kerr-Barlow in the sin-bin, his opposite man Jamison Gibson-Park’s threw a miss pass to take out five defenders, allowing Sheehan to put Leinster 17-0 up after 11 minutes.  La Rochelle clung on by their giant fingertips. Sexton’s understudy, Ross Byrne, missed two conversions and one more score could have been fatal. But there was no sense of panic.  ‘We were on the ropes, big time,’ said O’Gara. ‘We’d been steamrolled. Within 11 minutes, it’s 17-0 so you’re not a long way from getting hosed. It would have been easy to jump ship but they did the opposite. good. We’ve got data for everything but we don’t have data for character.’  A turnover from Levani Botia and a knock-on from Lowe helped them get back into the fight. The way O’Gara’s side flexed their muscle was reminiscent of the Springboks. Jonathan Danty bounced off Garry Ringrose for a desperately needed score, slowly taking charge of the territory and possession after two penalties from Byrne.  Just before the break, UJ Seuteni went through a gap to narrow the deficit in the highest-scoring half in Champions Cup history. Things boiled over in the tunnel and the travelling team came back out with a point to prove.  ‘Obviously Leinster were the home team in terms of accommodation for the families, post-match gigs,’ said O’Gara, when asked about Aldritt’s comments that he felt disrespected. ‘We couldn’t get a room in this place. It’s disappointing on that front. We’ve got to accept that we’re seen as the little teams, but that’s about to change.’  One by one, Leinster fans slowly woke up from their fantasy land. Their star-chasing side become consumed by nerves, fluffing their exit plays and growing fatigued from their first-half efforts. Antoine Hastoy kicked a couple of penalties and suddenly the 17-point lead was reduced to one score. The ruck speed swung in La Rochelle’s favour as they launched their heavyweight carriers, swarming the pitch like a cloud of volcanic ash.  La Rochelle broke Leinster's hearts for the second year running in a pulsating final in Dublin  Leinster's 17-0 lead that had been built up was burned down in front of them by the French side  The size and weight of the French size saw Leinster's resistance break late in the fixture  Leinster rode their luck, conceding penalties at the breakdown as they attempted to absorb the pressure.  But after 72 minutes, the resistance broke, crippled by the size and weight of their opponents’ maul. When the ball squirted out the back of a ruck, Georges-Henri Colombe pounced to snatch the lead for the first time after 72 minutes.  Ronan Kelleher was sinbinned but so was Danty. There was a chance to strike back but a late penalty was just out of range for Bryne, so Leinster kicked for the corner.  They got agonisingly close but play was stopped when Michael Ala’alatoa flew into the ruck for a clear-out worthy of a red card. Victory belonged to La Rochelle, Leinster were left broken.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvcnVnYnl1bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMTA3MDI3L0xlaW5zdGVyLTI2LTI3LUxhLVJvY2hlbGxlLUNvbG9tYmUtc2VhbHMtc3R1bm5pbmctY29tZWJhY2stRnJlbmNoLXJldGFpbi1DaGFtcGlvbnMtQ3VwLmh0bWzSAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L3J1Z2J5dW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjEwNzAyNy9hbXAvTGVpbnN0ZXItMjYtMjctTGEtUm9jaGVsbGUtQ29sb21iZS1zZWFscy1zdHVubmluZy1jb21lYmFjay1GcmVuY2gtcmV0YWluLUNoYW1waW9ucy1DdXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"volcano eruption","2023-05-15","15:15:00","{""Pahoa"", ""Hawaii"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T18:10:00","May has been a big month for scientific discoveries on Mars, as NASA’s Perseverance rover has continued to find more convincing evidence of what could have once been a “deeper and faster-moving” river than data initially suggested. New images taken by the rover’s main camera show two mosaics of course sediment grains and tall, curving layers of rock that suggest the river once flowed powerfully through the region.  But Perseverance isn’t alone in its discovery, as the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Mars Express orbiter has also had a busy month, as it studied the Martian planet’s second tallest volcano, and has captured new, stunning images of its fissured flank. These images provide a deeper glimpse of how the grooves on the surface were created, whether by water or lava.  Mars is the most explored planet in the Solar System (outside of Earth) due to its interesting landscape that could harbor signs of ancient microbial life. Perseverance landed on Mars in February 2021 and since then has been working with its helicopter companion, Ingenuity, to study its surface and cache samples of the Martian surface to return to Earth. Mars Express has been surveying the Red Planet since its launch in 2003 and continues to surpass what was expected to be only a two-year mission.  A wilder ancient river  Since its landing on Mars, Perseverance’s primary task has been to study and cache samples from Jezero Crater, a crater located to the west of a flat plain called Isidis Planitia. The crater was chosen as the spacecraft’s landing location as it is believed to have once been home to an ancient river delta.  The spacecraft has made several discoveries that suggest the former existence of an ancient river, but only now has it found that the water’s flow could have been much wilder than expected. Perseverance is currently exploring the top of a “fan-shaped pile” of 820-foot-tall sedimentary rock which was formed with curving layers. Scientists have been trying to figure out whether it once hosted shallow streams or a deeper, more powerful water system.  With new images captured by the rover’s Mastcam-Z instrument, which is mounted on its mast and considered the ‘main eyes’ of the spacecraft, scientists have found that two new mosaics showing coarse sediment grains and cobbles suggest the former existence of “high-energy river”.  See Also Perseverance Updates  Mars Missions Section  Space Science Coverage  Click here to Join L2  With this new glimpse, scientists are now trying to identify what kind of river this could have been (i.e. whether it’s like the Mississippi with a “snakelike” landscape or a “braided river” like Nebraska’s Platte). From Perseverance’s view, the curved layers have been arranged in rows that ripple out across the landscape, suggesting either remnants of sandbars that formed in the river, or riverbanks that have shifted over time.  “The more powerful the flow of water, the more easily it’s able to move larger pieces of material,” said Libby Ives, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  These images were taken from the location of the ‘curvilinear unit’ within the Jezero Crater. The first mosaic features one part of the unit, called ‘Skrinkle Haven.’  The second mosaic, an isolated hill called ‘Pinestand’, shown in the new images and located about a quarter mile from Skrinkle Haven, depicts 66-foot-high sedimentary layers that point toward the sky. The scientists also believe that these unusually tall layers of rock were formed by a river but are seeking other explanations as well.  “These layers are anomalously tall for rivers on Earth,” Ives continued. “But at the same time, the most common way to create these kinds of landforms would be a river.”  NASA’s Curiosity rover, another rover that has been studying Gale Crater on Mars since 2012, has found evidence of an ancient river much less powerful and shallow than what could have existed in Jezero.  More signs of water at Belva Crater  Adding to the already growing signs of water at Jezero Crater, Perseverance has taken 152 new images of a nearby crater that “indicate the presence of a large Martian sandbar.”  Belva Crater was likely created by the impact of a meteorite long ago and features 0.6 miles of exposed bedrock and sedimentary layers of rock that are angled downwards. The images, taken on April 22 and released on May 18, show “dipping beds” that could prove a sandbar made of sediment was deposited by a river channel flowing into the Jezero Crater lake.  “Mars rover missions usually end up exploring bedrock in small, flat exposures in the immediate workspace of the rover,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance’s deputy project scientist at JPL said. “That’s why our science team was so keen to image and study Belva. Impact craters can offer grand views and vertical cuts that provide important clues to the origin of these rocks with a perspective and at a scale that we don’t usually experience.”  Scientists studying the images are trying to figure out whether the large boulders were either formed by the meteorite impact or moved into the crater by the river system.  In a blog post from NASA posted on May 16, Perseverance recently performed an abrasion called “Ouzel Falls.” The image shows large grains created by the abrasion, and could be useful for “exploring elemental and mineral composition,” the blog post explains.  Mars Express captures Ascraeus Mons  ESA’s Mars Express orbiter arrived at Mars in December 2003 and was developed to study the planet’s atmosphere, surface, subsurface, and Mars’ moons Phobos and Deimos. Currently, the orbiter is exploring Martian volcanoes, and just imaged the pitted, fissured flank – the side of a volcano where lava can erupt from – of Ascraeus Mons.  The volcano is located in the Tharsis region of Mars and was discovered in 1971 by NASA’s Mariner 9 – the first spacecraft to ever orbit another planet, just ahead of the Soviet Union’s Mars 2. Ascraeus Mons is 18 kilometers high and is just shy of the tallest volcano on Mars – and in the entire Solar System – Olympus Mons, which is 25 kilometers high.  The image was captured by the orbiter’s High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), which can combine images at two different resolutions and provides 3D imaging to reveal the topography of Mars in color.  Mars Express’ image shows many interesting discoveries of the lower southern flank of the volcano, as well as a 70-kilometer patch of collapsed terrain depicting lava flows and tubes, chains of craters, and large fissures.  To the right of the image is “wrinkled lava flows,” which meet chains of “pit craters” where strings of circular depressions have combined and coalesced to form troughs.  “These chains and troughs likely form where hidden voids lie below the surface, causing the ground to become unstable and collapse – a bit like a sinkhole,” ESA said. “The subsurface voids are thought to be created as the surface layer of a lava flow rapidly cools and hardens; the lava flow beneath then ceases and ebbs away over time, leaving tube-shaped pockets of space lurking several meters below ground.”  The surface to the left of the image shows the “sinuous rilles” — small, snaking channels without rims — which remain a mystery to scientists. ESA scientists are still unsure how these are formed but believe it may involve flows of lava, ash, water, or all of the three combined.  📷 This #MarsExpress image taken in April 2022 shows snaking chasms at the foot of Mars's second-tallest volcano, Ascraeus Mons. See this and more amazing pics at 👉https://t.co/HiF1hOJv89 pic.twitter.com/jY4h8xEuaP — ESA (@esa) May 10, 2023  In the left part of the image, large fissures of up to 40 kilometers long are seen, with “braided channels” that branch out and create separate islands of Martian terrain. Again, ESA believes these are likely to have been formed by water, or even from melted ice build-up on the flanks of the volcano.  Mars continues to be one of the most interesting planets to explore, and activity will only ramp up in the future, with SpaceX’s Starship expected to transport humans to Mars. Scientists will also eventually get an even closer look at the Martian planet, as NASA and ESA unveiled updated architecture for their ambitious Mars Sample Return mission in July 2022, which will do, as the name suggests, return Mars samples that have been collected by Perseverance to Earth.

In early March, Juno passed some 32,044 miles from Io. On May 16 Juno returned, traversing just 22,060 miles from Io and capturing rich imagery.  Over the coming year, it's only going to get closer, ultimately traveling within 930 miles, or 1,500 kilometers, from Io. That's darn close.

""Io is the most volcanic celestial body that we know of in our solar system,"" Bolton said in a statement(opens in a new tab).

""We're marching closer and closer.""  Io is blanketed in volcanoes because it's stuck in a relentless ""tug-of-war"" between the massive Jupiter and two of Jupiter's other big moons, Ganymede and Europa — a world that might harbor a sizable ocean.

Villamaría (Colombia) (AFP) – Screams, dismembered bodies among the thousands dead, and his town buried in mud.

Advertising Read more  ""I just don't believe that"" threat alert, the 73-year-old with a gray mustache scoffed recently when asked about the underlying risk of another eruption.  Like him, many of the 57,000 residents who live in the danger zone surrounding the Andes volcano refuse to evacuate despite the government's request and an orange alert that has been in force since March.  That's when the recorded seismic tremors inside the crater soared, from 50 per day to 12,000.  Still, Suarez stubbornly believes the more than 5,300-meter (17,400-foot) colossus that elders call ""sleeping lion"" -- and which lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire that contains many of the world's most active volcanoes -- will not erupt again for ""about 50 years"" or so.  Authorities fear a major Nevado del Ruiz eruption could cause the kind of devastation that shattered the area back in 1985.  William Suarez, a survivor of the last big erruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, stands in front of the church of the Rio Claro village in Villamaria, Colombia © JOAQUIN SARMIENTO / AFP  In a matter of hours, an expulsion of lava melted part of the volcano's snowcap, creating raging torrents of mud, ash and rocks that streamed down the mountainside and buried the town of Armero. Some 25,000 people were killed in the worst natural disaster in the country's modern history.  Still, practical matters weigh on the choices facing farmers, who must decide whether to stay put and tend to their crops and pack animals, or heed the evacuation call and abandon their livelihoods.  Suarez is a farmer from Viejo Rio Claro, a riverside village nestled between mountains and belonging to the town of Villamaria, one of the areas declared to be at high risk.  Almost four decades on, he recalls when the volcano roared to life with catastrophic consequences.  ""High up there you could see it belching fire, like the color of bricks, and the earth was shaking,"" Suarez told AFP of that November 13 night. ""People started screaming and running on the road.""  The next day ""there were pieces of hands, arms, half bodies, decapitated heads,"" he said, standing next to the church that remains intact.  'Astonishment'  Over the past several days, in Villamaria and the neighboring city of Manizales, an unusual stench has been noticed by many.  According to the Geological Service (SGC) it could be due to the dispersion of a high concentration of sulfur dioxide, combined with ""ash components"" and moisture.

The SGC has warned that settlements on the banks of the rivers near the volcano suffer a high risk from potential flows of sediments, mud and volcanic debris.  Yet locals in Viejo Rio Claro feel prepared in the event of an emergency.  Jose Jaramillo, 71, said he is relying on training he received as a first responder and firefighter in the event of an eruption.  ""(We are) eager for the event to happen so we can end this anxiety... and put into practice everything we've learned,"" says Jaramillo, who arrived in the town after the 1985 eruption.  Felix Giraldo, head of risk management for the area, estimates that in the rural confines of Villamaría there are some 1,200 families at risk from a new eruption.

"volcano eruption","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T17:32:39","(BIVN) – From this week’s Volcano Watch article, written by U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists and affiliates:  May 3rd, 2023, marked the fifth anniversary of the start of Kīlauea’s historic 2018 eruption that resulted in extensive lava flows from the East Rift Zone and major collapses of the summit caldera floor. Since that 2018 activity, Kīlauea has experienced nearly constant change with distinct episodes of calm, unrest, eruptions, and everything in between.  When we think about volcanoes, we often first think of eruptions and lava. However, there is more to volcanoes than alluring molten rock appearing at Earth’s surface. Even when a volcano isn’t actively erupting lava, it is often still changing shape and deforming. These movements cause the Earth’s surface to change, which scientists call “ground” or “surface deformation.”  Measuring surface deformation is one of the main ways that scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) monitor activity at Hawaiian volcanoes. If the ground surface surrounding a volcano is moving upwards (towards the sky), the volcano is inflating and expanding. If the surface is moving downwards (towards the center of the Earth), it is interpreted that the volcano is deflating.  Surface deformation on the Island of Hawaiʻi is measured primarily with three techniques: tiltmeters, GPS (Global Positioning System), and satellite InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar). These measurements give scientists clues about how ground motion is related to magma movement below the surface of a volcano and what could potentially come next. Rapid changes in the rate of deformation often precede or accompany new eruptive activity.  At Kīlauea volcano, we are used to constant deformation and change. Following the large lower East Rift Zone eruption from May–August 2018, Kīlauea began a period of calm during which HVO’s deformation instruments measured almost no significant surface movements. Then in March 2019, tiltmeters and GPS instruments started to measure uplift once again, indicating inflation of the summit.  That inflation continued relatively steadily until December 2, 2020, when there was an abrupt and rapid increase in uplift rates (approximately 15 centimeters or 6 inches of uplift over a couple of days), which were interpreted to be the result of a magma intrusion into the shallow reservoir of magma beneath Halemaʻumaʻu crater.  On the night of December 20, 2020, Halemaʻumaʻu started erupting lava again and the water lake in the crater boiled away. The onset of this eruption was immediately followed by over 20 centimeters or 8 inches of downward motion at the summit within a day or two of lava appearing at the surface.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpZ2lzbGFuZHZpZGVvbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC92b2xjYW5vLXdhdGNoLXVwcy1kb3ducy1hdC1raWxhdWVhLXN1bW1pdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The ash was the result of activity in the nearby Popocatepetl volcano, according to Reuters.  ""After removing the volcanic ash, checking the runways and verifying favorable wind conditions, we resumed takeoff and landing operations starting at 10.00am,"" the airport reported on Twitter. ""Check with your airline the status of your flight.""  Operations at the airport ceased around 4.25am, leaving flights suspended for more than five hours. Some flights were delayed while others were canceled.  The volcano is approximately 45 miles (72km) from Mexico City. It has been active since 1994, and is regularly monitored by scientists due to its proximity to the 22 million residents in Mexico City and the surrounding region.  Airport officials were not the only ones closing up shop due to the volcanic activity - 11 villages in the region were forced to cancel school due to the falling ash, according to the Associated Press.  The volcano — known as ""El Popo"" locally — became active in 1994 after a long period of dormancy. Since then, it has occasionally launched toxic fumes and rock into the air during periods of activity.  The monitor team uses a network of sensors and cameras to keep watch over Popocatepetl. That system includes 12 seismological monitoring stations, six cameras operating 24 hours a day, and a command centre in Mexico City staffed by 13 scientists who work on shifts.  The command centre is run by the nation's National Disaster Prevention Centre — CENAPRED — and is the first line of defense for the city. Unlike earthquakes, which strike without warning, the monitoring team can use readings from the volcano to predict when there might be trouble — like flight-disrupting ash clouds — and issue warnings to city officials.

Green means safety, yellow is a warning of potential activity, and red means the volcano poses a danger.  The stoplight has typically been in a ""yellow"" state since it was introduced.  CENAPRED and the National Autonomous University of Mexico issued a statement on Wednesday saying they were anticipating increased activity at the volcano, noting the activity was not necessarily indicative of anything especially worrisome.  “The explosions taking place inside Popocatépetl… are a normal phenomenon and not necessarily indicative of increased volcanic activity,” the institutions said in a joint statement, according to Mexico Daily News.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlL25ld3MvbWV4aWNvLWNpdHktdm9sY2FuaWMtYXNoLXBvcG9jYXRlcGV0bC1iMjM0Mjc3MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cameras pointed at the Popocatépetl volcano, which is about 40 miles southeast of the capital city, have shown increased clouds of gasses and ash leaving the volcano after a reported uptick of activity inside the mountain.  The Mexican government has issued a yellow alert and urged residents to stay away from the volcano due to falling debris.  Earlier in the week, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported communities nearest to Popocatépetl closed schools and opened evacuation shelters.  According to the Global Volcanism Program, the current eruption cycle has been ongoing since 2005 and has included numerous episodes of increased emissions.  4 CLASSIC TYPES OF VOLCANOES  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  During the shutdown of Mexico’s busiest airport, personnel inspected and cleaned critical infrastructure from ash.  Planes are highly susceptible to volcanic material, and the U.S. Geological Survey reported there have been 79 cases of ash damaging aircraft worldwide since 1953.  Ash particles can damage a plane’s fuselage, blades and greatly hinder an engine’s performance and electronics.  So far, local authorities have reported only minor-to-moderate explosions occurring in Popocatépetl.

This according to today’s print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews.  Despite remaining Inter captain, Handanovic has not been the first-choice in goal for the bulk of this season.  The 38-year-old had initially held onto his spot despite the arrival of his long-term successor Andre Onana. However, in the fall the Cameroonian’s convincing performances in goal relegated Handanovic to a backup role.  This has not meant that the Slovenian has been without his chances, however.  Inter coach Simone Inzaghi has handed his captain a number of Serie A starts in recent weeks. The ex-Udinese man has worn the armband in league matches against Spezia and Empoli among others.  Moreover, Handanovic had been given the start against Juventus in the Coppa Italia.  The 38-year-old was Inter’s starting keeper in the first leg of the semifinal tie against the Bianconeri. However, the captain was sent off for his role in the very late brawl that erupted. Both Handanovic and Bianconeri winger Juan Cuadrado saw red for an altercation they had.  This meant that Handanovic was unavailable to play in the second leg, which Onana started.  Samir Handanovic To Return For Inter Milan Vs Fiorentina  According to the Gazzetta, however, the Nerazzurri captain will return for the final.  Handanovic has served his one-match suspension in the second leg against Juventus. Accordingly, he can be called up for the final against La Viola next week.  The Gazzetta report that Inzaghi will give his captain the nod for the final.  Handanovic is have his last opportunity to win silverware as a starter at Inter. This will partly be a show of respect for the years of service that the Slovenian has given Inter.  Moreover, the Gazzetta report, Inzaghi wants to reward Handanovic for the role that he’s played in helping Onana to settle in.

""Suffering defies comparison and measurement. Each person's experience is unique and complex. Consider the plight of those compelled to abandon their homes amidst a rapidly deteriorating situation. Civilians, including the elderly, mothers, children, and individuals with disabilities, find themselves trapped in cities like Khartoum, Al-junaina, Zalingay, and Nyala. Their circumstances are dire, with critical shortages of food and water, and no means to escape.""  What are the key challenges you, as a humanitarian worker, are currently encountering in providing assistance and relief in Sudan?  It is deeply disheartening to witness the immense suffering in Khartoum, Darfur, and other parts of Sudan, as well as the border areas with Egypt and Chad. Despite having the necessary resources and means, including supplies and a dedicated team in Port Sudan, it remains incredibly frustrating that we are unable to provide assistance and relief at the scale and speed that the people of Sudan desperately require. Sometimes, this is due to the administrative and bureaucratic hurdles; others, due to the lack of provision of security guarantees for us to assume the calculated risks we are ready to take; sometimes, both at the same time.  An essential aspect of aid delivery---communication---has been significantly disrupted. With poor internet connection and phone lines disrupted, operations face tremendous challenges. These are my primary sources of frustration today.  How have attacks on healthcare workers and hospitals impacted the provision of medical services in Khartoum during the conflict?  In Khartoum, the situation regarding healthcare services amidst the conflict is dire. Approximately 80 per cent of hospitals and health facilities have ceased functioning due to attacks, resulting in a critical shortage of essential supplies, including food.Operating theatres and other crucial services require electricity and maintaining proper hygiene standards is challenging due to water scarcity. This clearly shows how interconnected systems and sub-systems are in a city; and how warfare can disrupt that interconnectivity, increasing the impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.  Furthermore, there is a pressing need to collect, identify, and register the deceased. This task is typically carried out in collaboration with our colleagues from the Sudanese Red Crescent Society, who are doing this in Khartoum, El Obeit or Zallingey, with our support. The activity is critical since it prevents these people from going missing; we would be able to answer the request of their loved ones when they are able to come to us. We have managed to establish a 'hotline' to receive requests from families about missing relatives, who were maybe detained or displaced. The dead are amongst them, unfortunately. The challenges faced in Khartoum are immense, affecting the well-being of healthcare workers, access to essential resources, and the overall functioning of medical facilities.  What role does the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) play in encouraging the implementation of international humanitarian law (IHL) in the conflict?  It is not only a legal duty, but a matter of life or death. We continue to urge the parties to follow international humanitarian law both publicly and privately. The situation in Khartoum or Darfur today offers a perfect opportunity for the parties to the conflict to put ""paper into practice"", to make IHL happen on the ground. We are telling them we are ready. The ICRC has the history, the experience, the mandate and the capacity to support them, together with the Sudanese Red Crescent Society, to do so.  What actions has the ICRC taken so far?  To date, the ICRC has donated medicines and medical supplies to three hospitals and provided body bags to the Sudanese Red Crescent Society for the collection of over 40 human remains, with the operation continuing as we speak. We have carried out important neutral intermediary role operations, such as the transfer of Egyptian soldiers captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). A hotline, collecting allegations of arrest, has been put in place. The ICRC has been also one of the first international organizations able to fly to Port Sudan with tons of medical aid and highly experienced colleagues. Perhaps it is minor, but we have also been able to ensure a regular presence in Khartoum, showing solidarity with our resident colleagues, and trying to safeguard our delegation from looting. Right now, a team is getting ready to come back to organize a transfer of wounded Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers; or the would-be first visit to a place of detention. However, these actions are small compared to the larger scope of work required, and to our current preparedness and readiness. Urgent humanitarian efforts are still needed.  What needs to happen today?  A month after the conflict, we want to emphasize the importance of adhering to the Jeddah agreement and principles of international humanitarian law and translating it into actions on the ground that benefit the Sudanese population. In addition, it is crucial for all parties to streamline administrative procedures and processes to allow for efficient and effective humanitarian action. This includes unblocking stocks in Port Sudan and providing aid to those in need in Khartoum and Darfur. By doing so, those with the power to act will be contributing to saving human lives.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcmVsaWVmd2ViLmludC9yZXBvcnQvc3VkYW4vc3VmZmVyaW5nLWRlZmllcy1jb21wYXJpc29uLW9uZS1tb250aC1kZXZhc3RhdGlvbi1zdWRhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Representative photo: iStock.  Some 70,000 years ago, a few thousand of a newly evolved species — Homo sapiens, the modern humans — decided to migrate from their small exclusive home in a corner of Africa. Based on geological and paleoclimate evidence, one could call it a distress migration — logically, the first episode for us.  Unprecedented climatic events, including a super volcanic eruption, nearly crushed modern humans, leaving just a few thousand of them. The planet was under a climate change episode after the Ice Age. They needed to move out, seeking food, water and a suitable climate to prosper.  Also read: Match migrants’ skills with needs of ageing countries to drive global growth: World Bank report  The planet was an open geographical mass without any political boundaries. There were no rulers to claim subjects. So, they declared homes wherever they landed. Within a few thousand years, Homo sapiens set up homes in nearly all ecological regions of the planet.  Homo sapiens, about eight billion in number, have self-demarcated into nation-states with enforced boundaries; and, in the last 122 years, altered the natural environment so much that another climate emergency has descended upon us. They are no more descendants of a common ancestry that once upon a time had to migrate out to sustain.  Settled across the world, they fiercely protect their own home turf. Though long back self-designated as “social animals”, the settlements are like ghettos. But reshuffling this way, the species distribution is skewed even though Homo sapiens have been breeding profusely — from a billion in 1900 to over eight billion currently.  Some nation-states have more humans than others; some breed faster than others, and some are just reaching a point of life expectancy that is considered healthy in the modern world. All along, however, the migration of humans remained a key strategy to ensure the human world remains what it is today.  At the turn of the 21st century, we experienced an outrage over immigration, mostly from the countries that are rich and have cornered much of the wealth of the world. Restrictions were put in place; policies were being drafted to restrict the migration of people from one country to another, and all these were in the name of protecting the local economy and the local interests.  However, the latest World Development Report, published by the World Bank, says the world is in such a crisis that a new wave of migration among countries is needed, or there might be a situation that we didn’t imagine for long. Currently, there are 184 million migrants in the world, forming a defining workforce that dictates many countries’ prosperity. Since 2014, nearly 50,000 people have died while attempting to migrate, indicates the latest report. This shows the desperation of people to migrate for survival.  At the core of this crisis is the demographic change in the world of Homo sapiens. There is a scarcity of people who can work and have the skills to do so. This is because there is a fast dip in the working population in high-income countries, leaving behind an ageing population to be taken care of.  Read more: Busting the myth of population rise threat  In middle-income countries, the population is getting older before they attain a certain income level. And in the countries where the population is booming, mostly in Africa, the working group lacks the skills to exploit this void. One way, the world is again looking at a situation when it has to seek out the suitable among its own species, though in a desperate way.  Demographic changes have sparked an intensifying global competition for workers and talent, says the World Bank report. It means the rich countries that sealed their borders to humans from the outside would have to open up again, not as a charity but as an existential necessity.  The middle-income countries will experience a situation where their own workers will have to compete with those who have to be brought in from outside. And the poor and developing countries with a booming working-age population will have to undertake massive skill-development exercises to grab the opportunity that needs massive in and out-migration of people. But as the World Bank has warned: The developed countries will have to increasingly depend on human migration to sustain economies and also to meet the responsibilities towards their ageing population.

Read more  Summary Khartoum residents say law and order has collapsed  Say police disappeared from streets when fighting began  Army accuses RSF forces of looting, RSF denies charge  Each side blames other for jailbreak of 17,000 convicts                DUBAI, May 18 (Reuters) - Mass looting by armed men and civilians is making life an even greater misery for Khartoum residents trapped by fierce fighting between Sudan's army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), witnesses said.  While the RSF dominates the capital on the ground and the army conducts frequent airstrikes, the witnesses said police had simply vanished from the streets when the fighting started in Khartoum on April 15.  ""Nobody protects us. No police. No state. The criminals are attacking our houses and taking everything we own,"" said Sarah Abdelazim, 35, a government employee.  As mayhem grips Khartoum, the army accuses the RSF of looting banks, gold markets, homes and vehicles. The RSF denies the charge and has released videos showing its men arresting looters. The paramilitary force say some people wear RSF uniforms and steal to make them look bad.  Some witnesses said the RSF was stealing vehicles and setting up camps in people's houses. The RSF also denies this.  More than 17,000 men who were jailed in Sudan's two most dangerous prisons -- Kobar and Al Huda -- were released early in the fighting. Both sides blame the other for the prison break.  'THE DEVIL'S CITY'  ""We are now living in the devil's city. People are looting everything and neither the army nor the RSF nor the police, none of them want to protect ordinary people. Where is the state?"" said Mohamed Saleh, 39, a primary school teacher.  The fighting erupted after disputes over plans for the RSF to join the army and the chain of command as part of a political transition. It has caused some 200,000 to flee to nearby countries and over 700,000 have been displaced inside Sudan, triggering a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region.  Intense battles have continued to rage in Khartoum and its sister cities of Bahri and Omdurman despite Saudi and U.S.-brokered talks between the army and the RSF in Jeddah aimed at securing humanitarian access and a ceasefire.  Most attention is focused on the battles, not the chaos which is demoralising the population, or the rapidly depleting supplies of food, cash, and other essentials that drive much of the looting.  Huge groups have been seen looting mobile phone, gold, and clothes stores.  Factories including a wheat mill belonging to DAL Group, the country's largest conglomerate, were looted in Sudan's main industrial zone, which contains key food and industrial manufacturers.  ""They were brandishing machetes, they wave them in the air,"" said Qassim Mahmoud, a bank general manager who passed through the zone as he fled Khartoum for Egypt and saw people carrying away sacks of wheat and large appliances.  Three commodities and storage facilities were burned down in Omdurman. On Thursday, people could be seen in a video stealing mattresses and clothes and loading them onto trucks. Others used donkey carts.  ""Yesterday thieves came and burgled my house in Omdurman. Who do I complain to,"" said Ahmed Zahar, 42, a trader.  Many Khartoum residents have put posts on social media seeking assistance in retrieving stolen cars.  At one bank where money had already been looted, people were also seizing televisions and furniture, said a Reuters witness.  Aid warehouses have also been targeted by the looters.  Medical aid agency MSF, one of few entities continuing to provide aid in Khartoum, said armed men had broken into its warehouse in Khartoum on Tuesday and taken two cars filled with supplies.

"eruption","2023-05-19","16:41:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T13:51:20","The Western Conference finals will head to Los Angeles with the top-seeded Denver Nuggets up 2-0 on the Lakers. Here are five observations to consider as the series continues.  Murray's shotmaking the difference  Garrett Ellwood / NBA / Getty Images  One of the biggest questions facing the Nuggets entering the postseason was whether the team had a championship-level shot-creator and shotmaker beside two-time MVP Nikola Jokic. The answer to that question was always going to hinge on whether Jamal Murray, who missed the last two postseasons recovering from a torn ACL, could repeat his playoff performance from the 2020 bubble.  So far, so good.  Murray has scored 68 points on 52-45-92 shooting through two games of the West finals, with his fourth quarter of Game 2 especially impressive.  Much of the talk between Games 1 and 2 focused on how the Lakers had guarded Jokic in the series opener (specifically, how Rui Hachimura guarded Jokic in the second half), how Los Angeles might start Game 2 because of it, and how Denver would counter. But the story to start Game 2 was that Jarred Vanderbilt returned to the starting lineup to give Los Angeles a new defensive look against Murray.  It paid off, as Vanderbilt hounded Murray the same way he did Steph Curry early in the West semis. Though the offensively challenged Vanderbilt only played 16 minutes and didn't guard Murray for much of the game, his early work on the Canadian guard - plus contributions from other Lakers - helped keep Murray at bay through three quarters.  After scoring 14 points through those first three quarters, Murray then erupted for 23 points in the fourth; more than any Laker scored over the course of the entire game.  Jamal Murray finished with 23 points in the 4th quarter.    It was his 4th career 20-point 4th quarter in the playoffs, the most of any player over the last 25 years. pic.twitter.com/x48ubxrtth — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) May 19, 2023  Some of that can be attributed to a waning Lakers defense down the stretch, but for the most part, Los Angeles just got beat by a great shotmaker making tough shots. Even more impressively, Murray put together these last two performances while battling an ear infection that had him listed as questionable for Game 1 and noticeably fatigued at various points.  With Jokic, Murray, and a bevy of shooters and cutters around them, the Nuggets' offense is incredibly tough to stop. Trying to defend them while being buried by an avalanche of buckets in Denver's thin air must feel hopeless.  LeBron showing (subtle) signs of age  Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times / Getty Images  The level LeBron James has played at this season remains ridiculous for a 38-year-old with more than 65,000 NBA minutes under his belt. James is still capable of summoning even more at times, as he did in a Game 1 loss just a few nights ago. But the league's all-time leading scorer can't dominate every minute he's on the floor anymore.  It didn't cost the Lakers in a first-round victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, when Austin Reaves carried the team home in a Game 1 win, for example. It didn't cost L.A. in a second-round upset of the defending champion Golden State Warriors, when James struggled to score over Steph Curry in the post. But James' offensive drop-off might prove to be too much for the Lakers to overcome against the West-leading Nuggets.  To be fair, James dished out 10 assists in Game 2 after recording nine in the series opener, and his defense was excellent, particularly when matched up with Jokic (LeBron finished Game 2 with four steals and two blocks). But his shot selection in the second half was a microcosm of his age-related limitations.  Despite struggling with his range all night, James attempted and missed four consecutive 3-pointers over the span of 4:41 between the end of the third quarter and the early portion of the fourth. The last of those bricks, in particular, stood out. With the ball in his hands on the perimeter, the Lakers down one, Nuggets forward Jeff Green guarding him, and Bruce Brown and Michael Porter Jr. serving as potential helpers, the stage appeared set for a vintage James drive.  The old LeBron would've barreled his way to the rim, run over anyone in his path, and either slammed it home or at least drawn a foul. Instead, James used the space created by an Anthony Davis screen to launch another 3-pointer despite having missed his first five attempts from deep. Davis' screen didn't even make much of a difference, because Green was already playing well off of James, daring him to shoot. James took the bait, which was a win for Denver's defense.  James, who rolled his left ankle late in the game, went 9-of-13 in the paint, with many of those coming in the restricted area. The story of his game on the offensive end was the times he didn't - or couldn't - get there, though.  The Lakers' midseason turnaround and run to the conference finals has been more about the vastly improved team around James and Davis than it has been about James needing to stand on his head the way he did in postseasons past. But if the Lakers are going to get past Denver and advance to the Finals, let alone win the championship, they'll need LeBron to be better.  No one's better than Jokic  Garrett Ellwood / National Basketball Association / Getty Images  Jimmy Butler and eliminated stars like Giannis Antetokounmpo might disagree, but Jokic continues to show that he's the best player on the planet right now.  After pouring in 34 points (on 70% shooting), 21 rebounds, 14 assists, and two blocks in Game 1, Jokic battled through a rougher individual offensive game Thursday. The big man shot 9-of-21 from the field and needed 23 shooting possessions to score his 23 points, but he also added another 12 assists, grabbed 17 rebounds (including four offensive boards), and recorded three steals in 42 minutes of action.  Perhaps most impressive of all, Jokic played tremendous defense on Davis (though the Lakers star also couldn't make the Nuggets pay with Jokic in drop coverage). That might not have captured the average fan's attention the way Jokic's usual eye-popping numbers did, but his teammates noticed.  Michael Porter Jr. says Nikola Jokić got the Defensive Player of the Game chain tonight and said he deserved it with his defense on Anthony Davis tonight. — Ryan Blackburn (@NBABlackburn) May 19, 2023  Jokic's pick-and-roll defense has been exposed at times, and he's far from a fearsome rim-protector, but his defensive limitations have also been overblown. He's got good instincts, great hands, and he's tough to move at 284 pounds.  Jokic's excellence was more understated in Game 2 than it was in Game 1, but a ""quiet"" game still had the Joker producing one point per shooting possession, leading both teams in rebounds and assists, and admirably guarding one of the best big men alive. Not bad.  Good luck beating this guy's team four out of seven, let alone four out of five, as the Lakers now need to do.  Moving AD  Tyler Ross / NBA / Getty Images  A big part of the reason the Lakers found some defensive success with Hachimura on Jokic in the second half of Game 1 was that Aaron Gordon was stationed in the dunker spot. Davis guarding Gordon rather than Jokic allowed the Lakers' best rim-protector to stay in prime help position. The obvious counter for Denver was to involve Gordon in more screening actions and get Davis moving the way the Warriors forced him to do in their second-round series.  Though they're headed to L.A. up 2-0, it still feels like the Nuggets can do more in this regard.  Davis once again started on Jokic, but he guarded Gordon plenty when James or Hachimura was on the Serbian, and Gordon made sure to avoid parking himself on the baseline. The Nuggets also made a more conscious effort to use Gordon as an off-ball screener more than they did in Game 2, with Denver's shooters and cutters using his screens to get open. Still, there's more for the Nuggets to explore. They can use Gordon as an on-ball screener for Jokic or for shooters like Murray and Porter more often. They can even have him initiate the offense more.  To be clear, Davis is dynamic and mobile enough to make a defensive difference regardless, but pulling him away from the rim, forcing him to make decisions in space, and generally making him cover more ground will lessen his impact on that end. Gordon and the Nuggets should do more of it.  The Lakers' math problem  The Lakers' shooting woes aren't exclusive to the conference finals. Even after trading for marksmen like D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley, L.A. remained 20th in 3-pointers made per 100 possessions and 18th in 3-point percentage while putting together the West's best post-deadline record. In the second round against the Warriors, the Lakers won a game despite being outscored by 45 points from behind the arc.  But the Nuggets aren't the Warriors. The Lakers survived what appeared to be a mathematical disadvantage against Golden State because they're a dominant interior team that gets to the free-throw line, while the Warriors are far more jumper-reliant. The Nuggets, on the other hand, are a great shooting team that won't be outdone by the Lakers inside the arc the way the Warriors were. With Jokic leading the way, more than 37% of Denver's field-goal attempts came at the rim during the regular season - good for sixth overall - according to Cleaning the Glass.  In addition, while the Warriors were the league's most free-throw-averse team and gave up the eighth-highest free-throw attempt rate on the other end, the Nuggets got to the line more and were the 10th-best team at limiting opponents' free-throw attempts. The Lakers, who get to the line at an elite rate and defend without fouling on the other end, averaged 11 more points per game from the free-throw line than Golden State did during the second round. Against Denver, that advantage is down to 6.5 per game.  Meanwhile, the Lakers have been outscored by 30 points from deep through two games. Fifteen points per game is a lot to overcome when you don't have the same advantages elsewhere that you usually do.  The Lakers' shooting woes were going to catch up with them at some point. L.A. might not have enough firepower to keep up in this matchup.

When tempers flare and the benches clear, it usually revs up everyone in the ballpark. But they’re typically duds. They include a lot of jawing and not a ton of action. That didn’t happen on May 19, 1998 during a game at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Orioles.  Manager Joe Torre’s club was on its way to winning a then-AL record 114 games before securing New York’s second World Series title in three years. At this point in the season, the Yankees were doing their best 2023 Tampa Bay Rays impression. The Bombers entered this matchup with a 28-9 record, while the O’s were struggling. They came to the Bronx with a 20-23 record, which already had them 11 games out of first place.  The Orioles had what they thought was a commanding 5-1 lead heading into the seventh inning. New York scored two in the seventh before erupting for a six-run eighth to take the lead and eventually win. There were some extra fireworks, though.  Armando Benitez was brought in with two outs in the eighth to try and preserve a 5-4 lead. He faced Bernie Williams, who took him to the upper tank for a three-run shot. The reliever then took out his frustrations on Tino Martinez, hitting him with the very next pitch between his numbers in the back.  That’s when all hell broke loose and this became one of the all-time great baseball brawls. The video I found with the entire ordeal is age-restricted on YouTube (which is bogus). So, if you’d like to see this in its entirety, check it out here.  The next best thing I could find was Stuart Scott and Rich Eisen covering it the next day on an old-school episode of Sportscenter. They catch all the pertinent highlights, including Graeme Lloyd taking things up a notch, Darryl Strawberry getting the punch in that he desperately wanted, Martinez being irate that this was the second time Benitez hit him for no good reason, Tim Raines homering on the first pitch once things settled down, and more.  An added bonus here? Comments from The Boss himself, George Steinbrenner. As usual, he didn’t mince his words, and it even ended with him suggesting he and Orioles owner Peter Angelos should settle the score by fighting one another. He claimed to be ready because he’s been “working out three times a week”.  Outside of Steinbrenner’s remarks, it was interesting to hear Lenny Webster, the Orioles’ catcher, essentially defend the Yankees and Martinez, while not backing up his pitcher (which was the right thing to do).  What was also interesting was how Baltimore manager Ray Miller felt that this ordeal would hopefully serve as a “coming together” for his club. Yea, I’ll take “Things that would never be said in 2023 for $300” on that one. It ultimately didn’t work for the Orioles, as they finished 79-83, which was 35 games behind the Yankees and 13 games behind the AL Wild Card spot.  It’s hard to believe this brawl happened 25 years ago. We can be certain that it won’t be forgotten, though — not with the way everything went down.

The Japanese government is engaging Pacific Island countries through infrastructure projects and multilateral forums to mitigate China’s Pacific presence.  Japan has increased its emphasis on an ‘all Japan’ approach toward Pacific Island countries since 2019. At the Ninth Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting in July 2021, former Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga announced the Pacific Bond Policy, which aims to strengthen Japan’s ties with Pacific Island countries to realise a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’.  Japan is paying greater attention to Pacific Island countries in its foreign policy to check China’s influence. Former foreign minister Taro Kono visited Papua New Guinea in November 2018, as well as Fiji and three Micronesian countries in August 2019 — the first Japanese foreign minister to visit these countries since January 1987. It has now become common practice for his successors and state ministers to travel to the Pacific Islands.  In April 2021, China and Solomon Islands signed a secret security agreement. Afterwards, Japanese Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kentaro Uesugi, visited Solomon Islands to directly convey his concerns to Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. In January 2023, Japan opened new diplomatic missions in Kiribati and New Caledonia, where the government perceives China’s influence to be growing.  Japan has engaged in several multinational infrastructure development projects in Pacific Island countries with Australia and the United States. Japan also became one of five inaugural members of the Partners in the Blue Pacific, established with Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States to coordinate assistance for Pacific Island countries in June 2022.  Japan’s Ministry of Defence is also increasing its presence. When it launched the Indo-Pacific Deployment as we know it today in 2017 to provide the Maritime Self-Defence Force with opportunities for joint exercises with other countries, its destinations were confined to Southeast and South Asia. Since the first Japan Pacific Islands Defense Dialogue was held in September 2021, the Japanese Indo-Pacific Deployment’s geographical area of activity has been expanded to include the Pacific.  In 2022, the Maritime Self-Defence Force conducted exercises with its counterparts in Tonga, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Palau. Japan also dispatched the Self-Defence Forces to work on disaster relief activities in Tonga after the eruption of an undersea volcano in early 2022.  As the May 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima approaches, Japan’s diplomacy has become more active, with increased attention on Pacific Island countries. During his visit to India on 20 March 2023, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced ‘Japan’s New Plan for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific’. The plan refers to the Pacific as a ‘strategically important region where sea lanes connecting Japan and Australia and sea lanes from the Indian Ocean through the South China Sea to the Pacific Ocean intersect’.  On 19 March 2023, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi visited Solomon Islands as the first Japanese foreign minister to hold face-to-face talks with Prime Minister Sogavare. Hayashi emphasised the importance that Japan places on its relations with Solomon Islands.  But it is uncertain whether Solomon Islands seriously considered Hayashi’s visit in addition to earlier visits by US National Security Council Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell. On 22 March, having received a delegation from China, Solomon Islands announced that it had awarded a Chinese state company a contract to upgrade an international port in Honiara. This again raised fears in Japan of China’s ‘dual purpose’ motivations as Solomon Islands could allow Chinese naval vessels to use the port in the future.  Hayashi also visited the Cook Islands — the first such visit by a Japanese foreign minister — and the Polynesian region. Hayashi and the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands Mark Brown had already met in Japan the previous month.  Just before officially taking up the position of Chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum at its Special Leaders Retreat on 24 February 2023, Brown travelled to Japan as the head of the Pacific Islands Forum delegation. At the forum, he discussed the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System-treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the sea.  This has been an outstanding issue between Japan and Pacific Island countries, although the President of the Federated States of Micronesia, David Panuelo, expressed his understanding of Japan’s position, and Hayashi protested that China’s remarks to the international community were not based on scientific evidence during his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang. During their meeting on 21 March 2023, Hayashi formally invited Brown to the Outreach Meeting at the G7 Hiroshima Summit along with other world leaders.  Given the strategic importance of Pacific Island countries amid the ongoing climate crisis and China’s growing regional presence, Japan needs to maintain constructive dialogue with Pacific Island countries with a view to hosting a successful milestone 10th Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting in 2024.

LAHORE, Pakistan -- Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan dialed down his campaign of defiance on Friday, saying he would allow a police search of his home over allegations that he was harboring suspects wanted in recent violence during anti-government protests by his supporters.  Khan, who is facing about 100 legal cases against him, also appeared before a court in his hometown of Lahore to seek protection from arrest in multiple terrorism cases that authorities have raised against the country's top opposition leader.  He also condemned days of violence in which his supporters attacked public property and military installations after he was dragged out of a courtroom and arrested in a graft case in the capital, Islamabad, last week. At least 10 people were killed in clashes between his supporters and police across the country.  The rioting subsided only when Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered Khan’s release. Police sought Khan on charges of inciting supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party to violence. He denies the allegation, saying he was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau in a graft case when the clashes erupted.  Khan appeared conciliatory as he appeared before an anti-terrorism court in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab. The judge granted him protection from arrest in three terrorisms cases until early in June.  “Yes, I condemn it,"" Khan told reporters at the Lahore court, speaking of the rampage. ""There is no Pakistani who will not condemn the violence.”  After Khan's release from arrest last week and return to Lahore, police surrounded his home, alleging that he was sheltering in his upscale residence of Zaman Park between 30 to 40 suspects linked to the violence.  Police, who have some 300 officers deployed around Khan's compound, threatened to raid the premises unless the suspects were handed over. The standoff was resolved with an agreement for the police to search the home. Khan's party claimed police failed to find any suspects there.  Hours later, Khan told reporters at his home that he will cooperate with the police in arresting those linked to the attacks on military installations. But he showed no sign of backing down from his drive to force elections and return to power.  “We will win the next elections even without launching any campaign,” he said, claiming his party still enjoyed mass popular support.  Since last week, small rallies in solidarity with the military have been held around the country denouncing attacks by Khan’s supporters.  Police separately announced they arrested six more suspects in Khan's neighborhood, allegedly as they were trying to flee. They had previously arrested eight others in the area, and a total of more than 4,500 suspects across the country.  Former cricket star turned Islamist politician, Khan was ousted by a no-confidence vote in Parliament last year. He has claimed his ouster was illegal and a Western conspiracy — charges his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, denies.  Khan remains hugely popular among grassroots followers — though two of his lawmakers and several politicians quit his party over the recent violence — and has campaigned against Sharif's government, demanding early elections.  His campaign, arrest and the subsequent violence have deepened the political turmoil and economic crisis in Pakistan, where authorities are also facing a surge in militant attacks.  On Friday, Sirajul Haq, the head of Pakistan's key Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, narrowly escaped a suicide attack in Zhob, a district in the restive southwestern province of Baluchistan, police said. The bomber detonated explosives strapped to his waist when Haq was entering Zhob in a convoy of cars.  Haq's party said he was safe but five people were wounded in the attack.  There was no immediate claim for the bombing but militants and other armed groups have staged attacks in Pakistan's Baluchistan for decades.  ___  Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad and Abdul Sattar in Quetta, Pakistan, contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvcGFraXN0YW5zLWltcmFuLWtoYW4tZGlhbHMtY2FtcGFpZ24tZGVmaWFuY2UtYWxsb3dzLXBvbGljZS05OTQ1MTgwMNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd2lyZVN0b3J5L3Bha2lzdGFucy1pbXJhbi1raGFuLWRpYWxzLWNhbXBhaWduLWRlZmlhbmNlLWFsbG93cy1wb2xpY2UtOTk0NTE4MDA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(AP Photo/Visar Kryeziu, File)  A new mayor has been sworn in in northern Kosovo after a vote that was boycotted by the ethnic Serb minority which dominates the area  MITROVICA, Kosovo -- A new mayor has been sworn in in northern Kosovo after a vote in April that was boycotted by the ethnic Serb minority which dominates the area.  Erden Atic, who is from the Bosnian minority, took up his post in the northern, Serb-dominated part of the divided city of Mitrovica on Friday, calling on citizens to cooperate.  “We shall work for all citizens of Mitrovica’s northern commune, without any discrimination,” said Atic, who represents the Self-Determination Movement, or Vetevendosje! of Prime Minister Albin Kurti.  A Kosovar police presence and officers from the European Union rule of law mission, or EULEX, were seen in the area. The ceremony was held peacefully.  Local elections were held last month in four Serb-dominated communes in northern Kosovo after Serb representatives left their posts last year in protest at the establishment of the association, which would coordinate work on education, health care, land planning and economic development at the local level.  With Kosovo's ethnic Serbs demanding autonomy, Kosovar Albanians fear that may turn into a new ministate like Srpska Republika in Bosnia.  A 2013 Pristina-Belgrade agreement on that plan was later declared unconstitutional by Kosovo’s Constitutional Court, which ruled that it wasn’t inclusive of other ethnicities and could entail the use of executive powers to impose laws.  Only 3.57% of the voters took part in the snap election in April.  Fearing a flare-up of tensions, the five Western powers — the U.S., France, Italy, Germany and the U.K. — called on the newly elected Albanian officials not to use force to take over the offices or public buildings.  “All parties should refrain from the use of force or actions that inflame tensions or promote conflict,” they said in a statement.  The chief Serbian negotiator for Kosovo, Petar Petkovic, described Atic's mayoral inauguration as “unacceptable” and an “occupation” orchestrated by Kurti.  Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic talked to EU mediator Miroslav Lajcak Friday. Vucic was cancelling part of his schedule to hold a series of discussions focusing on Kosovo.  “Vucic warned Lajcak of all the consequences of Kurti’s behavior and provocations that could turn into a new crisis and that they want to expel the Serbian people and provoke a war,” said Petkovic.  Local Kosovo Serb politicians in the north warned the ethnic Albanian authorities to stop alleged “repression” of Serbs by June 1 or face an unspecified response.  Washington and Brussels have stepped up efforts to help solve the dispute, fearing further instability in Europe as the war rages in Ukraine.  Both Serbia and Kosovo have been told they must normalize relations to advance in their intentions to join the EU. The two sides have tentatively agreed to back an EU plan on how to proceed, but tensions continue to simmer.  The conflict in Kosovo erupted in 1998 when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbia’s rule, and Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, died. NATO’s military intervention in 1999 eventually forced Serbia to pull out of the territory.  Washington and most European Union countries have recognized Kosovo as an independent state but Serbia, along with Russia and China, has not.  ___  Semini reported from Tirana, Albania, and Jovana Gec contributed from Belgrade.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3Rvcnkva29zb3Zvcy1uZXctbWF5b3ItdGFrZXMtcG9zdC1wZWFjZWZ1bGx5LW1pbm9yaXR5LWFyZWEtOTk0NTQ5ODjSAXFodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9rb3Nvdm9zLW5ldy1tYXlvci10YWtlcy1wb3N0LXBlYWNlZnVsbHktbWlub3JpdHktYXJlYS05OTQ1NDk4OA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Huron"", ""SouthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:38:27","ALPENA — Cases involving methamphetamine continue to spike as the Huron Undercover Narcotics Team struggles with manpower, according to HUNT’s latest annual report.  Meth — a powerful, highly addictive stimulant with dangerous side effects — made up 76% of all HUNT drug cases last year, compared to 23% of cases in 2018, according to the drug-fighting agency’s annual reports.  But HUNT in 2022 worked the smallest number of cases in at least five years as staffing shortages at its partner agencies led to fewer hours dedicated to HUNT activities, according to the latest report.  Prior to the onset of COVID-19, HUNT averaged 11,400 officer hours, Detective Lt. Stuart Sharp, the HUNT team commander, said in his introduction to the 2022 HUNT report.  Last year, that number fell to 8,900 hours.  Check out the interactive graphic below. Story continues below the graphic.  HUNT 2022 Annual Report by Justin Hinkley on Scribd  As a result, HUNT worked 46 drug cases and made 50 arrests on a total of 81 charges last year, compared to 70 cases and 117 arrests on 221 charges in 2018.  “The reaction to Covid 19 and the subsequent restrictions negatively affected policing, jails and the court system, backing up cases for several years,” Sharp wrote in the report. “Public perception of policing has deteriorated, social media has erupted with fallacies of abuse of power and the treatment of the public by officers. Many things have come together to create an era where interest in the profession has all but ceased. The inability for our partner agencies to fully staff their departments has inhibited the quantity of investigations, as our manpower is at an all-time low.”  Despite the dip in the quantity of investigations, the quality of investigations remained high, Sharp said in his report.  “Team members have adapted technology, ingenuity and downright tenacity while tackling our never-ending endeavor to disrupt the introduction of narcotics to northeast Michigan,” Sharp wrote. “We have followed drug dealers to Bay City, Saginaw, and Flint all to arrest them on their return to our area. We have partnered with other narcotics groups to interdict shipments, all with great success. A team member traveled to Tennessee to testify at the Federal trial of a subject that attempted to establish a nation-wide drug empire.”  In addition to drug cases, HUNT last year worked nine fugitive cases resulting in 12 arrests and worked four additional cases unrelated to drugs, including assisting other local agencies on a barricaded gunman and a runaway juvenile and working cases on guns, obstruction of justice, and impaired driving.  HUNT is a seven-officer team made up of four officers from the Michigan State Police and one each from the Alpena Police Department, Montmorency County Sheriff’s Office, and Presque Isle County Sheriff’s Office.  Alpena and Alpena, Presque Isle, Montmorency, and Alcona counties each also pay $8,000 a year toward the team and Rogers City contributes $5,000.  Thanks to a federal grant, HUNT’s total base revenue in 2022 was more than $191,000, down from a peak of more than $195,000 in 2019.  Drugs, especially meth, are a serious problem across Northeast Michigan. On a per-capita basis, drug-related arrests here vastly outpace the statewide rate, according to a 2021 News investigation (read The News’ entire investigation at tinyurl.com/ACommunityDisease).  According to the 2022 HUNT report, local meth labs have decreased in recent years — the agency shut down two labs last year — but the drug continues to flow from Mexico to big Michigan cities to Northeast Michigan.  Last year, in addition to 35 meth cases, HUNT also worked three cases each involving cocaine, fentanyl, and gabapentin, and one case each involving heroin and suboxone, according to the annual report. The agency took more than $53,000 worth of drugs off the streets last year.  The agency last year seized 12 firearms, nearly $17,000 in vehicles, and nearly $8,000 in cash.  About half of all HUNT cases were in Alpena, and another 20% were in other parts of Alpena County.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFscGVuYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3JlcG9ydC1tZXRoLWxvb21zLWFzLWh1bnQtbWFucG93ZXItYXQtYW4tYWxsLXRpbWUtbG93L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2021-04-20","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:18:00","The death of a loved one. It’s the least funny thing in the world, right? Try telling that to Sam Morrison, who has made a show about his bereavement journey since losing his partner to Covid in 2021. Sugar Daddy, already well received in New York and in London this week, is a wonderfully intimate offering from the 28-year-old that stints neither on big laughs, nor on honesty about Morrison’s grief. It’s a case study in the leaps comedy has taken, and continues to take, into territory that until recently most professional jokers would have considered out of bounds.  Morrison’s show is no outlier, as a piece in the New York Times makes clear: there is a rash of standup shows about grief. Why so? Consider it the logical endpoint – or latest stage – of the process that has seen comedy, growing in confidence as an artform, address itself over the last decade to ever less comical subject matter. All those shows about cancer, mental ill health and trauma; the dead-dad shows, supposedly so common as to become a cliche? They were the gateway. Now comics are handling the hard stuff: raw, recent, real-world bereavement.  They know, these comics, that “standup traumedy” is all the rage. They also know it’s not necessarily big box office: the Venn diagram is slender between audiences up for a laugh and audiences wishing to engage with death and loss. Morrison has a fun routine about this, a sarcastic eruption at the idea that his grief show might be some kind of careerist manoeuvre. Maybe it’s time to stop implying that comics who make “dead dad shows” are doing so cynically. Maybe we accept that for a healthy artform – even one that stands or falls on making you laugh – no subject is out of bounds, least of all the one to which artists have been drawn since time immemorial. The terminal subject, the infinite mystery: the end.  That’s how Morrison justifies making a show about his partner Jonathan’s death. There is, he tells us, no reckoning with or rationalising that loss. He can’t make sense of it – but he can make jokes of it. And to do so is cathartic. It also, in a way, brings the dead back to life: when Morrison speaks about his partner, he lights up. Jonathan was his big bear of a better half and Morrison leaves us in no doubt this is a quality to appreciate. The show opens with a wickedly well-argued paean to blubber over bone, to the virtues of outsized bodies. Why, marvels Morrison, do we valorise toning and the accrual of muscle? – for which there is (he illustrates, with ironic examples) little practical use in our 21st-century lives.  That set-piece is one among several that could stand alone, independently of Morrison’s grief show – but which enrich the show, by relieving its tension, and (in this instance) fleshing out the picture of the relationship at its heart. There’s more of that, plenty of it cheerfully lubricious: in its battle against Thanatos, Morrison declares strongly for Eros tonight. Two anecdotes, meanwhile, give the show its anchor points, as Morrison flits back and forward in time across the span of his relationship. One finds him resisting a mugging, because were he to relinquish his phone, he would lose his only photos of Jonathan. Another finds him assaulted by gulls on a beach when he tries to eat “gay little raisins” to top up his blood sugar – drained by the constant crying.  But for all that Morrison self-identifies as an “anxious, asthmatic, gay, diabetic Jew”, what is striking about the show is how un-anxious it is in performance. Morrison delivers it in a mode that is all his own: conversational, contemplative and intensely present. It feels safe, which is important for a show about grief: you don’t want to feel the performer is emotionally at risk. But it does feel too as if Morrison is still living this, feeling his way through the material performance by performance, trying to work out what it represents (is it glib? Is it triumph over adversity?), savouring the unusual feeling when the balm of laughter is applied to an open wound. It’s a fantastic show, that made me eager to see what Morrison does next, and lays respectfully to rest any suggestion that death and grieving might be beyond comedy’s reach.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3RhZ2UvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTkvc2FtLW1vcnJpc29uLXNob3ctYWJvdXQtaGlzLXBhcnRuZXJzLWRlYXRoLXByb3Zlcy1ncmllZi1pcy1ub3QtYmV5b25kLWNvbWVkeXMtcmVhY2jSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3N0YWdlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L3NhbS1tb3JyaXNvbi1zaG93LWFib3V0LWhpcy1wYXJ0bmVycy1kZWF0aC1wcm92ZXMtZ3JpZWYtaXMtbm90LWJleW9uZC1jb21lZHlzLXJlYWNo?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(images: (Getty Images/NRL)  The NRL world has lauded Clint Gutherson after the Parramatta Eels fullback produced a moment of magic to stop a try against the Rabbitohs on Friday night. The Eels bounced back to stun the NRL with a huge 36-16 win over the Rabbitohs on Friday night and it wasn't without the help of Gutherson's brilliance.  In the first half, Cody Walker kicked in behind the Eels defence as Alex Johnston charged towards the ball. As the Rabbitohs winger dived to gather the ball just short of the line, Gutherson came rushing across.

The winger then moved past the ball without gathering it. This saw Gutherson save an almost certain try in remarkable fashion.  Gutherson's decision could have gone horribly wrong. The fullback could have got his ankle caught or made contact with Johnston, which could have seen a penalty try awarded. However, the fullback timed it perfectly.  “Clint Gutherson, take a bow,” NRL great Cooper Cronk said. “Look at the effort of Clint Gutherson. Foot on the ball denies Alex Johnston there. That’s a hell of an effort from Gutherson.”  “The more you watch it, it’s brilliant from Gutherson because he actually just places his foot on top of the ball which in the end Johnston puts his hand on,” Greg Alexander added.  Arguably NRL's greatest ever fullback Billy Slater added: ""Incredible"", after claiming he had 'never seen this before"".

"eruption","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Marietta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:28:02","A fifth-inning onslaught helped Marietta College kick off Regional Tournament play with an 11-10 victory over Adrian Friday at Don and Sue Schaly Field at Pioneer Park.  The top-seeded Pioneers trailed the fourth-seeded Bulldogs 4-3 entering the fifth, when they erupted for eight runs to take control of the game. Marietta survived Adrian’s late rally to hold on for the win.  The Pioneers (35-11) will play Western winner at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in the winner’s bracket, while Adrian (25-20) will play Mary Washington at 11 a.m. in an elimination game.  “What a tough, gritty group Adrian was,” said Marietta head coach Brian Brewer. “They played really, really hard and they never got their heads down. We knew it was going to be that kind of game because of how well they’ve played of late. Fortunately we were able to hold on at the end.”  Adrian starting pitcher Daniel Gutierrez lost command in the fifth, plunking Trent Valetine with the bases loaded to tie the game before walking Austin Amburgey and hitting Ben Kaplin to bring in two more runs. Nine-hole hitter Matthew Busby then smacked a two-run single to center to plate two more runs and make it 8-4. Adrian brought in Michael Swanson out of the bullpen and he was greeted with a two-run double by Nick Bonnizzio followed by an RBI single from Alex Richter to make it 11-4.  “We’ve made a lot of outs this year swinging at balls out of the strike zone,” Brewer said. “We did not do that in that inning. I thought we were patient, I thought we were committed to a really good two-strike approach, and we just hit it. We just need to string a few more of those innings together. I thought we moved the ball and applied pressure.”  As it turned out, each one of those runs proved crucial as Adrian came all the way back to climb within a run.  Ryan Davis singled in a run in the seventh before Easton Rogers’ two-run triple got Adrian within four. Rogers then scored on Linken Hayward’s groundout to make it 11-8.  The Bulldogs added two more in the eighth on Edward Wagner’s RBI single and AJ Miranda’s sacrifice fly.  With Marietta’s lead down to one, Gabe Torres delivered on the mound. Torres, who entered in the seventh, never let Adrian sniff a ninth-inning rally, tossing a quick 1-2-3 frame to shut it down.  “Gabe was really a bright spot of last weekend (during the OAC Tournament) and obviously that carried over to today,” Brewer said.  The Bulldogs got on the board first via Wagner’s RBI double in the opening inning.  Richter got that run right back the following half-inning, blasting a solo home run to right field to knot the score at 1-1. It was the sophomore’s seventh longball of the season.  With runners at second and third and two outs in the second, Bonnizzio cashed in with a two-run single to center field, giving Marietta a 3-1 advantage.  Adrian loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the fourth. Catcher Logan Loeffler produced a bases-clearing double to left-center to put the Bulldogs back in front, 4-3, and chase MC starter Valentine from the game.  On to pitch in relief, Kail Hill got a groundout before walking a pair of batters to load the bases with one out. Hill got three-hole hitter Wagner grounded softly to short. Busby charged and fielded it cleanly, flipped to Richter at second, who turned and fired to Amburgey at first. Amburgey picked the throw off the turf to complete the double play and get Marietta out of the inning.  “Bases loaded, we just needed that double play to get out of it,” said Richter, who went 2 for 4 with two RBIs. “Busby made a really good glove flip to me and Austin picked me up with the scoop so that helped us out a lot.”  Some more solid glove work from the Pioneers helped prevent a couple Adrian leadoff batters from getting on base early in the game. In the second, Hayward hit a sharp liner to right field, but Cole Rieman made a nice diving snag. Then to start the third, Jakob Charles appeared to have a line drive double down the right field line until Amburgey made a leaping snag.  All those plays added up in a game that ended up being decided by just one run.  Bonnizzio went 3 for 5 with a game-high four RBIs. He had two hits in the pivotal fifth inning for MC.  “I felt like I was seeing it pretty well,” Bonnizzio said. “I was trying to be more aggressive in the earlier counts and find my pitch early. When I did I was pretty successful.”  Brett Carson added three hits for the Pioneers.  Hill earned his 10th win of the season, going 3 1-3 innings out of the ‘pen. He issued four walks. Valentine lasted three innings, walking three and striking out one. Torres recorded the final eight outs with no strikeouts or walks.  Gutierrez pitched 4 2-3 innings in a losing effort. He walked three and fanned two. Swanson got the final out of the fifth before Jaxon Clark, Griffin Firestine and Lincoln Lipinski each pitched a scoreless inning of relief to keep the Bulldogs in it.  “That’s huge,” Adrian skipper Craig Rainey said of his bullpen. “That’s kind of what those guys have done all year. We gave them a chance to go in and hold us there and they gave us a chance to win.”  Although the Bulldogs couldn’t stop the bleeding in time in the fifth, Rainey was pleased overall with how his team played.  “We knew we had to play clean baseball, and for the most part we did except for one inning,” Rainey said. “That inning kind of got away from us. We let Marietta get a substantial lead. We fought back. We knew it was going to be dogfight the whole game.”  Rainey, in his 30th year at Adrian, watched his Bulldogs battle back from a game 1 loss in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association Tournament to win the whole thing.  “We’re just going to try to survive game to game now,” he said.  The Etta Express can place itself in the driver’s seat with a win Saturday. Brewer said the 309 in attendance Friday provided a big boost for the Pioneers.  “The crowd support was great for an 11 o’clock game on a Friday,” Brewer said. “That was huge for us. It’s a big lift for us and hopefully we can pile them in again tomorrow, maybe even a little moreso.”  Jordan Holland can be reached at jholland@mariettatimes.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmlldHRhdGltZXMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIzLzA1L2V0dGEtZXhwcmVzcy1vcGVucy1yZWdpb25hbC10b3VybmV5LXdpdGgtd2luLW92ZXItYWRyaWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police arrested Cynthia Lewis on a preliminary murder charge in the killing of 23-year-old Deante McKinzie, who died May 17 after being shot in the chest.  Indianapolis police were called to the shooting, reported in the 3400 block of East 38th Street, and later told the victim was being taken to a nearby hospital. Officers found the car at the hospital and saw blood in the back seat. In the area where the shooting happened, police found two shell casings, one fired bullet and more blood.

The witnesses told police they saw an argument erupt between McKinzie’s girlfriend and Lewis, who are neighbors. The account was corroborated by McKinzie’s girlfriend. Court records do not specify what the argument was about.  The fight ended, but a short time later, McKinzie returned outside and got angry after seeing Lewis sitting on his car. One witness described she was “jumping” on the vehicle. Lewis is then said to have taken out a gun.  One witness told police they heard McKinzie say he “don’t care about no gun,” before they heard a gunshot. McKinzie then ran toward a house and collapsed next to the front door.

After a unanimous vote on Thursday, dancers at the Star Garden Topless Dive Bar in Los Angeles have joined the Actors' Equity Association, making them the only active unionized strippers in the United States. And they're hoping others will follow suit.  ""When they finally announced the victory, I was, like, bawling,"" dancer and union organizer Reagan told As It Happens host Nil Köksal. ""Just a sobbing mess.""  CBC has agreed to identify Reagan by her stage name to protect her safety.  Lawyers for Star Garden said in a statement that the club ""is committed to negotiating in good faith with Actor's Equity a first of its kind collective bargaining agreement which is fair to all parties.""  Dancers felt unsafe  The union fight started in March 2022 after security guards at the club ""repeatedly failed to protect"" dancers from abusive or threatening patron behaviour, and the club's managers fired those who voiced concerns, the Actors' Equity said.  ""That was the really galvanizing thing that brought us together,"" Reagan said. ""There was this kind of Wild West sort of attitude towards safety measures.""

Brown/AFP/Getty Images)  Reagan says dancers weren't allowed to ask security guards to intervene when customers harassed or threatened them. Instead, they had to take it to management, who would decide whether it met the bar for intervention.  The security guards, similarly, had to get the green light from management to intervene if they spotted rowdy customers at the club.  ""There's this very strange situation of a middleman when we're in a small club and there is alcohol at this club, and sometimes patrons are drunk and they're acting disorderly and they're acting out of line,"" Reagan said.  ""It got to a point where it really became intolerable.""  The unionizing dancers also joined the Writers Guild of America picket line in solidarity. The WGA is currently striking to demand better pay, improved working conditions and higher streaming residuals. (Submitted by Reagan)  Dancer Lilith — also a stage name — told The Associated Press that customers were also allowed to stay in the bar after closing, which made the dancers feel unsafe because patrons could see them dressed ""out of our stripper personas"" and identify which cars they drove when they went home, she said.  But when Reagan pushed back against this policy, she says she was fired. Another dancer was fired for intervening when she noticed a customer filming a coworker on stage without her consent, Lilith said.  That's when the Star Garden dancers banded together and delivered a petition to management calling for better security conditions and demanding their colleagues get their jobs back.  ""What ended up happening was the dancers that signed the petition were locked out of the club, not allowed to come back into work the next day,"" Reagan said. ""That's what spurred the picket line, the strike.""  The workers remained on the picket line, she said, for the next eight months.  15-month battle  After getting locked out, the dancers joined forces with Actors' Equity, which filed for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) guild election on their behalf.  The NLRB conducted the election via mail and planned for a November vote count. But those results were put on hold when Star Garden challenged the eligibility of some voters, and filed for bankruptcy protection.  The union announced this week that the club's management had agreed to a settlement.  ""Star Garden decided to settle, as it has always been a fair and equal opportunity employer, that respects the rights of its employees,"" attorneys Josiah R. Jenkins and An Nguyen Ruda, who represent the club, said in a statement.  The vote count proceeded on Thursday. All 17 dancers who cast ballots voted to unionize.  The Star Garden Topless Dive Bar — seen here on May 18, 2023 — will soon reopen and bring back fired or locked-out dancers. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)  ""Had we known on Day 1 that this was going to be 15 months of our lives and that it was going to be really difficult and not an easy path, I don't know that we would have made those choices,"" Reagan said.  ""And so I'm actually kind of glad for the naiveté that we had, and we just kind of put one foot in front of the other, and then here we are. And it was so worth it, thank God.""  As part of Tuesday's settlement, Star Garden agreed to dismiss the bankruptcy filing, reopen the club and offer fired and locked out dancers their jobs back.  ""I'm feeling really optimistic about going back,"" Lilith said. ""It will definitely be surreal being back on that specific stage, but I know we're going to have our community rallying around us.""  Reagan, too, is looking forward to getting back to work.  ""I do plan to go back, first of all, because I think that it's a really beautiful fairy tale ending to be able to walk back in that club as a victorious unionized dancer. That is just such a dream,"" she said.  ""And then also, what's a dream is working in the only unionized strip club in America.""  The newly unionzed dancers celebrate their victory. (Submitted by Reagan)  The only — but not the first.  In the late '90s, dancers at San Francisco's Lusty Lady organized the Exotic Dancers Union. But that club was shuttered in 2013.  ""I visited that sort of on like a pilgrimage of like, oh wow, what would it be like to work at a unionized strip club? And that was, like, years and years and years ago. So this is really a dream come true for me,"" Reagan said.  Actors' Equity Association President Kate Shindle says this sets a new precedent for strippers in the U.S.  ""I'm not sure that the enormity of what these workers have accomplished has entirely sunk in yet,"" Shindle said in a statement. ""If the Star Garden strippers could do it, despite the massive and unique barriers to organizing within their industry, so can everybody. I'm so, so proud of them.""  Reagan, meanwhile, is excited for what comes next.  ""I definitely hope that other strippers across the United States are inspired,"" she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9yYWRpby9hc2l0aGFwcGVucy9sYS1zdHJpcHBlcnMtdW5pb25pemUtMS42ODQ4MzI30gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjY4NDgzMjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The judiciary's website Mizan claimed that Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaghoubi's charges were based on their confessions that they were involved in killing three members of the regime's forces during protests in Isfahan last November.  Protests in Isfahan and other cities across the country erupted in September after 22-year old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for not fully abiding with the mandatory hijab rule of the country, died in police custody.  At least 22,000 people had been arrested across the country in the ensuing protests, as the Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 537 people were killed by the regime which never accepted the responsibility of what happened to Amini.  After Iran's Supreme Court upheld the execution sentences of Kazemi, Mirhashemi and Yaghubi, families of the men executed Friday and members of the Iranian public pleaded with international bodies to take any action to stop the Islamic Republic from carrying out the sentences.  Amnesty International said the men's fast-tracked trial was flawed and then pointed out there were significant procedural flaws, lack of evidence, and torture allegations that were never investigated.  In a last message that the three men reportedly signed and smuggled out of the prison, they asked the public to help them stop the regime from executing them.  ""Hello, we ask you dear fellow citizens not to let them kill us. We need your help. We need your support,"" the message signed on May 17 reads.  In December, Mohsen Shekari was the first person hanged for alleged crimes related to the protests after allegedly holding up traffic and assaulting a guard. Less than a week later, 22-year-old Majid Reza Rahnavard, who had been convicted on charges of ""waging war against God"" amid protests, was executed.  According to the Iran Human Rights group, 13 executions were recorded on May 18 and at least 90 people have been executed since the start of the month.  United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said on May 9 that Iran is executing a ""frighteningly"" high number of people, with over 209 executed so far since January.  ""On average so far this year, over 10 people are put to death each week in Iran, making it one the world's highest executors,"" said Türk.

Honourable Carlos James, the country’s Minister of Sustainable Development, made the call during the High-Level Meeting on the Midterm Review of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which will be held on Thursday, May 18, 2023, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  The High-Level Meeting gathered leaders from all sectors together to discuss disaster risk reduction and its role in expediting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and other key international frameworks.  Minister James asked leaders in his presentation to the United Nations General Assembly to focus on expediting disaster risk finance since it is intimately related to the broader framework of reforms needed in international development financing.  Recognizing the critical nature of disaster risk reduction, St. Vincent and the Grenadines continues to commit significant resources across the spectrum, from disaster preparedness to recovery, strengthening its disaster risk reduction management programs while exponentially increasing investments in all aspects of resilience, according to Minister James.  “My country remains committed to pursuing partnerships at all levels to address these challenges…to effectively reduce risk and build resilience, we must ensure a better alignment of these frameworks with climate change adaptation,” Minister James stated.  The Sendai Framework focuses on implementing policies that address the three elements of disaster risk (hazard exposure, vulnerability and capacity, and hazard characteristics) in order to prevent the emergence of new risks, reduce current risks, and build resilience.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines has prioritized resilience since the adoption of the Sendai Framework, making it a significant component of its policy agenda as it recovers from repeated natural disasters and the explosive eruption of the La Soufrière volcano.  The High-Level Meeting provided a forum for Member States, United Nations system partners, and other stakeholders to reflect on the Midterm Review’s findings and recommendations, examine context shifts and emerging issues since 2015, and identify course corrections and new initiatives to more effectively address the systemic nature of risk and achieve the outcomes and goals of the Sendai Framework, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement.

(AP Photo/Juan Karita)  A Bolivian priest has been detained on suspicion of abusing seminary students a decade ago in a case that emerged after news broke earlier this month of a pedophilia scandal involving a late Jesuit priest in the Andean country  LA PAZ, Bolivia -- A Bolivian priest has been detained on suspicion of abusing seminary students a decade ago in a case that emerged after news broke earlier this month of a pedophilia scandal involving a late Jesuit priest in the Andean country.  Milton Murillo, a Catholic parish priest at the Church of San Roque in the southern region of Tarija, was sent to pre-trial detention for three months during a hearing late Thursday, regional prosecutor Sandra Gutiérrez Salazar said.  “With this, we want to express that the Public Prosecutor’s Office is taking stern action to ensure these crimes are punished,” she told reporters Friday.  The Murillo case came to a head in part because of the scandal that erupted earlier this month over Spanish Jesuit Alfonso Pedrajas. Pedrajas died of cancer in 2009 and left behind a personal diary in which he confessed to having abused around 85 minors in Bolivia during the 1970s and 1980s in Catholic boarding schools, as reported by the Spanish newspaper El País.  The Catholic Church and the Society of Jesus have asked for forgiveness and pledged to support any investigations that emerge from the Pedrajas case.  Prosecutors called on victims of Pedrajas and other priests to testify as authorities also investigate whether there was any cover-up. Although there had already been allegations of abuse by Murillo, new testimony by alleged victims helped lead to his detention.  The Bolivian government said this week it will create a Truth Commission to investigate allegations of sexual abuse against children and said it will push for a law that would get rid of statute of limitations for these types of crimes.  “This horror cannot be repeated; these crimes, whether committed by priests or anyone else, cannot be subject to statutes of limitation,” said María Nela Prada, the minister of the Bolivian presidency.  A small group of people gathered outside the archbishop's palace in downtown La Paz to demand justice for the allegations of sexual abuse by Church authorities.  “We're devastated,"" Alejandra Casas said while protesting Friday. ""We know the Catholic Church is covering up cases.”  Although there have been several allegations of pedophilia involving priests in the Andean nation, human rights organizations say that, until now, few have been properly investigated.  Child Rights International Network, one of the organizations that has worked extensively on cases of pedophilia involving religious authorities, stated in a 2019 report that only three cases had resulted in convictions, including that of a priest who was sentenced for abusing 30 children in a poor rural town in the central region of Cochabamba.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvYm9saXZpYW4tY2F0aG9saWMtcHJpZXN0LWRldGFpbmVkLXN1c3BpY2lvbi1hYnVzaW5nLXNlbWluYXJ5LXN0dWRlbnRzLTk5NDY2NjQy0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2JvbGl2aWFuLWNhdGhvbGljLXByaWVzdC1kZXRhaW5lZC1zdXNwaWNpb24tYWJ1c2luZy1zZW1pbmFyeS1zdHVkZW50cy05OTQ2NjY0Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

To keep you sated between episodes, we’ve brought on food writer Heather Arndt Anderson, a Portland-based culinary historian and ecologist, to highlight different aspects of the region’s food ecosystem. This week she offers a recipe for a pleasantly tart, no-bake rhubarb meringue pie.  Click here to subscribe. For previous stories, go here.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  This week had us a bit in the weeds — between having to hook up irrigation in the garden to prevent all our tender seedlings from getting cooked, to rescuing a swarm of bees that tried to escape backyard hives, to developing a recipe that just would not cooperate, it’s definitely been a busy time! But we emerged triumphant, and with a pie at the end of the tunnel. One highlight was inventing new ways to cook with rhubarb — our favorite vegetable that masquerades as a fruit. Though it does have the drawback of wanting to lose its beautiful cerise color when cooked, we in the Superabundant kitchen have a few science hacks up our sleeve. What common ingredient can you add to bring back rhubarb’s color (and then some)? Read on to find out!  Small bites: Warm weather means more fruit, smart compost bins, a tribute to Oregon’s Berry Goddess and more  Freshly picked morsels from the Pacific Northwest food universe:  Remembering an Oregon berry icon  Bernadine Strik, a horticulturist, researcher, professor and Oregon State University’s own “Berry Goddess” died last month at the age 60. Strik’s groundbreaking scientific research and knack for collaboration directly with berry farmers resulted in a tenfold increase in blueberry production in Oregon — from 1,200 acres to 15,000 acres in a 15-year period. So wide-reaching is Strik’s legacy that her obituary even garnered coverage in the New York Times, but OPB’s Crystal Ligori wrote her own loving tribute, noting that Strik “leaves behind her husband, two daughters, and an unmatched legacy as the Berry Goddess of Oregon.”  New tech for an old problem  Oregon State University may have lost a legend, but the Cascades campus in Bend did receive a grant to pursue research on developing a smart compost bin that tracks household food waste. Household food waste accounts for roughly 37% of all food waste in the United States — a problem that amounts to around $400 billion each year and most egregiously, in a country where 10% of the populace is food-insecure. Tracking food waste in homes could be an important first step in reducing it, and can eventually be expanded to reduce food waste in the institutional sector as well.  A promising start to the growing season  The Capital Press reports that Pacific Northwest fruit growers are cautiously optimistic about this year’s growing season. Following a cold, wet spring, the sudden burst of warm May weather has helped bees get to the busy work of pollinating. Cherry, apple and pear growers are expecting a strong showing this year, particularly compared to last year’s paltry yields. Cherry lovers, keep an eye out mid-June, when picking should kick off.  Remembering the Mount St Helens eruption  …or as we like to call it, “when Loowit blew it.” This week in 1980, locals may have been surprised to see white ash snowing down from the sky, but all that fine tephra made for some very productive soils. In fact, the Northwest has many volcanoes and many millennia of ash fall to thank for its soil richness.  Watch the Soils episode of “Superabundant.”  Good things in markets  All this warm weather means a productive growing season, so look out for early strawberries and the first basil. The sweetest carrots, leeks and snap peas are plentiful now as the salad turnips, beets and radishes begin tapering off. Tender fennel bulbs are showing up as well, and local asparagus is still going strong. Chive blossoms are beginning to show up as well. Elders have begun to bloom, so expect elderflowers to start showing up on menus in finer restaurants. East of the Cascades, most farmers’ markets will be kicking off around Memorial Day weekend — get ready!  If at first you don’t succeed, pie, pie again. Heather Arndt Anderson / OPB  Recipe: No-bake rhubarb meringue pie  Rhubarb season is at its peak, and the recent unseasonably hot weather has made it more important than ever to have a solid no-bake pie recipe under your belt. But we’re going to be honest about something: this recipe was a challenge to develop* — the eggs and butter turned the beautiful magenta rhubarb syrup into a pale peach curd; like us, Swiss meringue wants to melt in hot and muggy weather. The first attempt refused to set and the recipe was adjusted accordingly (don’t worry, the runny curd and melted meringue were salvaged and turned into cake). It helps to have a growth mindset while undergoing recipe development — as with any scientific endeavors, we can learn from our mistakes! — especially when the recipe can be abandoned at several points and still give you something wonderful to show for your trouble. We’ve noted these so you can feel good about throwing in the towel at any point along the way. Serves 8.  Note: this recipe comes together fairly quickly, but plan a couple extra hours for chilling between steps.  Ingredients:  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Pie shell:  6 ounces plain butter shortbread cookies or vanilla wafer cookies  4 tbsp butter, melted  3 tbsp sugar  Pinch of salt  Rhubarb curd:  1 ¼ lbs rhubarb (about 3 large stalks)  1 ½ cups sugar  2 c water  ½ tsp citric acid or ¼ cup lemon juice (to brighten the color from beige-y purple to bright fuchsia)  4 egg yolks (reserve the whites for the meringue) + 2 whole eggs  4 tbsp cornstarch  6 tbsp room-temperature butter  Swiss meringue:  4 egg whites  ½ cup sugar  ¼ tsp cream of tartar  Instructions:  Make the pie crust: crush the cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing the cookies in a zip-top bag and bashing the daylights out of them with a rolling pin. Stir the melted butter, sugar, and salt into the crumbs to form a thick paste, and then press the paste into a greased 9″ pie dish, applying enough pressure to make the paste reach up the sides of the pan as evenly as you can muster. Chill the pie shell in the fridge for an hour. Make rhubarb syrup: trim any leafy bits off the rhubarb and roughly chop it. Add the sugar, water, citric acid or lemon juice and rhubarb to a medium size saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the rhubarb is very soft, about 5 minutes. Strain the syrup through a fine-meshed sieve, mashing gently with a rubber spatula — you don’t want to scrape all the pulp through but you do want to try and get as much of the liquid out as possible. Reserve the pulp for another use. (If you want, you can stop here and use the syrup in granitas, soda, or a rhubarb margarita; either way, you’ll have some leftover syrup.) Make the curd. Whisk 1 ½ cups of the syrup with the egg yolks, eggs and cornstarch in a medium saucepan, taking care to whip out all the lumps. Heat over medium low, whisking constantly (and taking care not to let it scorch!), until the curd becomes very thick like custard. Turn off the burner and whisk in the butter one tablespoon at a time until it’s melted in and fully incorporated. If it looks a bit lumpy, use a hand mixer to smooth things out. Lay a slip of plastic wrap on top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming and set aside until cooled completely; if you’d like to expedite the cooling you can scrape the curd into a shallow pan and set it on ice packs. (If you leave out the cornstarch you’ll have about 2 ¼ cups of spectacular rhubarb curd to spoon onto scones, shortcake, or pound cake but sadly, it will be peach-colored, not bright pink.) Make the Swiss meringue. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the egg whites and sugar. Bring a pot with an inch of water to a boil and set the bowl on top (make sure the pot is slightly smaller than the mixer bowl — we’re making a bain-marie/double boiler). Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the egg whites, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed to keep the sugar from settling at the bottom. Once the sugar is dissolved and the egg whites have reached 175º, transfer the bowl to the stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until stiff peaks are formed. (Alternatively, you can whisk by hand.) Assemble the pie. Scrap the cooled rhubarb curd into the chilled pie shell and smooth the top with a spatula. Pile the meringue on top, making artful swirls and dollops with the back of a spoon. Torch the meringue on top (or use the broiler, but keep a VERY close eye on it!) until golden brown. Serve chilled and eat it the same day, if possible — meringue topping will start to weep if it sits on a custard pie for too long.  * On the first stab at the rhubarb syrup, Heather wandered off for a moment to answer a few emails and then smelled the aroma of dark caramel wafting into her office.

Media accounts often emphasised her coolness. The Morning Post reported that ""her Majesty betrayed no feeling of alarm"" and had the ""complete self-possession"" to courteously acknowledge groups of cheering spectators as her carriage made its way back to Buckingham Palace.  This description of the Queen as resilient, unflappable, and committed to duty chimes with her popular image, both then and now. Victoria's famous quote – ""we are not amused"" – may never have passed her lips, but it has come to symbolise the sangfroid of the Queen and the mood of an era. Many people imagine the 19th Century as a time of repressed emotions, while others celebrate its supposed stoicism. (Read more about the origins of the ""stiff upper lip"".)  Despite her public façade, Victoria's personal journals reveal an emotional side. Looking back on the attack from the safety of Buckingham Palace, she wrote that it now seemed ""like a horrid dream"". As her account of the incident unfolded, fear and confusion gave way to anger, and she came to see the ""outrage"" as ""the most disgraceful and cowardly thing that has ever been done"". Victoria wasn't the only one to feel some emotion. Prince Albert was ""dreadfully shocked"", while Sir George Grey, the home secretary at the time, arrived at Buckingham Palace ""greatly distressed & in tears"". In the hours after the attack, Victoria was still ""shaken, nervous, & unable to eat"".  Still, she ventured to the opera where joyful crowds threw their hats in the air and serenaded her with spontaneous renditions of ""God Save The Queen"". While not all Victorians were enthusiastic monarchists, attacks on the Queen prompted these outpourings of emotion. As Victoria herself quipped, ""it is worth being shot at to learn how much one is loved"".  Her determination not to hide away in the wake of the attacks was typical of Victoria in her younger years. Back in 1842, a teenage boy named John Francis had pointed a pistol at her carriage as it drove up Constitution Hill. Albert spotted him, but Francis didn't fire and managed to slip away. Knowing that a potential assassin was on the loose, Prime Minster Robert Peel urged the Queen to stay at home while his new police force hunted the attacker. Victoria refused. The next evening, she and Albert rode out in their open-top carriage flanked by guards but still exposed. Sure enough, Francis made another attempt, this time managing to fire his pistol at the royal couple moments before being seized by a policeman. Victoria emerged unhurt, but it could have ended very differently.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vZnV0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMzA1MTktaG93LWFzc2Fzc2lucy1yZXZlYWxlZC1hLWhpZGRlbi1zaWRlLXRvLXF1ZWVuLXZpY3Rvcmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.  A hush came over Mt. Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem as a choir sang a four-part harmony during their rendition of “People Get Ready,” a song composed in 1965, the year following the March on Washington and President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.  In front of the singers was a congregation mourning the loss of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old man who died on May 1, after Daniel Penny, an ex-Marine, placed him in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway train.  Following his death, demonstrators took to the streets in protest, with some jumping onto subway tracks and shutting down intersections, resulting in the arrests of multiple people.  Penny, 24, has since been charged with second-degree manslaughter. His attorneys have previously said that their client didn’t intend to harm Neely and “could not have foreseen his untimely death.”  Hundreds of people came to the church Friday to pay their respects and express their condolences.  Attendees included Dr. Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered Neely’s eulogy, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, a group of teenaged boys wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989.  Sr. Pastor Johnnie M. Green, Jr. conducted the ceremony. He previously led the funeral service for Neely’s mother, Christine Neely, after she was killed in 2007.  During his address, Sharpton vowed to continue fighting for people struggling with homelessness and mental health difficulties.  Until change happens, Sharpton said, “There will be no justice, there will be no peace,” leading the crowd to erupt into chants of “No justice! No peace!”  Sharpton took issue with Penny being described as a good samaritan by some, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who encouraged his Twitter followers to donate to Penny’s legal defense fund last week. The fund has garnered over $2.6 million in donations.  “A good samaritan helps those in trouble,” Sharpton said. “They don’t choke them out.”  The reverend also criticized officials for releasing Penny from custody the night of Neely’s death, after officials questioned him about the incident.  Neely spent most of his late teens and early 20s imitating Michael Jackson to the amusement of tourists and subway commuters, before a lack of housing and mental health issues took over his life.  Mildred Mahazu, his great-aunt, spoke during Friday’s ceremony, but her comments were brief.  In an interview with ABC News, she described her nephew as a “very, very sweet person.”  “He liked to be loved and he loved people.”  When asked what justice looks like for her family, Mahazu appeared unsure, though she stated that she believes Penny should “make some time” for his actions.  “He don’t need to walk a free man,” she continued.  “Why would you put your hand around someone’s neck and choke them when you know they would die in less than two to three minutes?” she asked.  “That means murder.”  After the ceremony, family members made their way to Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, N.Y. for a private burial service.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vcmVja29uLzIwMjMvMDUvaGUtbGlrZWQtdG8tYmUtbG92ZWQtYW5kLWhlLWxvdmVkLXBlb3BsZS1qb3JkYW4tbmVlbHlzLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9ub3JzLTMwLXllYXItb2xkcy1saWZlLmh0bWzSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL3JlY2tvbi8yMDIzLzA1L2hlLWxpa2VkLXRvLWJlLWxvdmVkLWFuZC1oZS1sb3ZlZC1wZW9wbGUtam9yZGFuLW5lZWx5cy1mdW5lcmFsLWhvbm9ycy0zMC15ZWFyLW9sZHMtbGlmZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

FDNY members say the scene could’ve been much worse if it weren’t for the speedy reactions of store employees and firefighters.  Firefighters on scene say the scooter began smoking inside of the store, erupting and starting the fire.

The ""solar maximum,"" which peaks in 2025, is expected to bring the northern lights to a sky near you more frequently in the years ahead, especially if you live in the northern parts of the U.S.  How solar max will affect Earth's magnetic field  Every 11 years, the sun goes through a ""solar cycle."" A cycle is the increase and decrease in the number of sunspots observed on the sun. With the number of sunspots, there's an increase in solar flares and plasma energy and other types of space weather. Large eruptions on the sun send bursts of energy and material toward Earth.  According to predictions made by NASA scientists, the solar maximum, or the next peak in solar activity, will occur in July 2025. As a result, the northern lights will start to get stronger and more frequent as the solar maximum approaches.  Can't see our graphics? Click here to reload  Current solar cycle beginning  Scientists monitor the development of the solar cycle and sunspots. These dark spots on the sun are signs of solar activity and frequently serve as the starting point for the massive explosions that can shoot light, energy and solar material into space. These explosions include solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  ""This material and radiation is what interacts with the Earth resulting in aurora,"" said Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.  Earth's magnetic field is a protective shield  Earth's magnetic field creates an invisible barrier that shields us from the solar winds. The magnetic field of Earth occasionally becomes disrupted by stronger solar winds. Stunning auroras are created when the particle stream interacts with gases in the planet's magnetic field.  What causes the northern lights?  As the sun releases solar flares, it carries plasma particles toward the Earth.  Atoms in air molecules in Earth's magnetic field are stimulated when charged electrons from the sun collide with them. As the molecules settle, they emit light. Green and red light are emitted by oxygen. The color of nitrogen is blue and purple.  The University of Alaska and NOAA tracks auroras using the Kp-index, a global auroral activity indicator which has a scale from 0 to 9. It measures the fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field, tied to specific geographic locations.  Auroras appearing more in Arizona: See where and when to look.  During very large auroral events, the display can be seen throughout the U.S. and Europe, but these events are rare. During an extreme event in 1958, the aurora was visible from Mexico City, the University of Alaska reported.  Do northern lights occur on other planets?  Yes; auroras occur on planets with atmospheres and magnetic fields. On Jupiter and Saturn, NASA has captured these breathtaking auroras.  Not only are those auroras huge, but they're also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth.  “These auroras are very dramatic and among the most active I have ever seen,” said Jonathan Nichols, of the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.

Friday afternoon, an employee at Shenanigans in Hollywood said the place was packed just hours earlier, as the game — the sixth longest in NHL history — went into one overtime after another, still tied to 2.  “We stopped serving, but people still stayed here until the end of the game,” she said.  Just before 2 a.m. on Friday, after six hours of play and four overtimes, Matthew Tkachuk scored the goal that brought the game to a thrilling end.  Cameras captured fans at a massive Panthers watch party at Backyard in Fort Lauderdale as they erupted in cheers.  Cameras during the telecast captured some fans at the game struggling to stay awake, so it’s likely many of these local fans didn’t make it into work Friday.  After all, six hours is a long time. Travelers can catch a flight from New York City to Los Angeles in less time.  Tkachuk scored the winning goal with just 13 seconds left of fourth overtimes, meaning the came came dangerously close to being even longer.  Hours later, the Panthers tweeted out permission slips for anyone who might have been dragged out of bed Friday morning.  Panthers and Miami Heat fans might feel tired during the remainder of the month. Between both teams, there will essentially be an Eastern Conference final game every night of the week for a while.  The Heat will be aiming for win #2 Friday night against the Boston Celtics after winning Game 1 on Wednesday.  The local teams are rooting for each other. The Heat’s Jimmy Butler posted a video to social media sporting a Tkachuk jersey which practicing.  Not to be outdone, several Miami Marlins players showed up in Panthers gear. The baseball team is currently in second place in the East.  Shenanigans owner Patrick Utter said they’re ready to welcome sports fans all throughout the finals.  “It’s completely packed. There’s never a cover, $4 drafts, best chicken wings in the state,” he said.

Prior to the suspension, Anheuser-Busch had a CEI score of 100, the group’s top rating.  “What we’re seeing play out here is an example of companies making a decision to have and construct inclusive marketing, which is great — but a business should be standing by those decisions,” Eric Bloem, HRC’s senior director of programs and corporate advocacy, told The Associated Press. “The Anheuser-Busch (case) is a textbook example of what not to do.”  On April 1, as part of a March promotional contest for the beer brand, Mulvaney posted a Instagram video of herself cracking open a Bud Light.  A cascade of criticism and hate surrounding the video soon erupted, notably among conservative figures — with Kid Rock posting a video of himself shooting cases of Bud Light and others calling for a boycott of the brand. In the following weeks, the beer brand’s sales also took a leave of absence.  In an April 14 statement, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth said that the company “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.”  Anheuser-Busch’s actions and Whitworth’s statement did not not signal clear support for Mulvaney, however, or directly address the transphobic rhetoric perpetuated during the backlash — sparking concerns among the LGBTQ+ community and activists. Meaningful solidarity is especially important in a time where dozens of anti-LGBTQ+ bills are signed into law across the country, Bloem added.  In an April 26 letter, also seen by the AP, HRC called on Anheuser-Busch to issue a public statement expressing support for Mulvaney as well as transgender customers, shareholders and employees. The group also asked the company to hold a “meaningful conversation” with LGBTQ+ employees about their concerns and recommended actions for leadership and conduct a workplace transgender inclusion training for executives.  HRC said it received no response from Anheuser-Busch, the advocacy group said, prompting the May 9 letter informing the company of its CEI score suspension. To date, Bloem said Friday, HRC has still not heard from the company — but the organization’s goal is to work with the company and “discuss strategies to show up and reaffirm that support for the LGBTQ+ community.”  Anheuser-Busch said Friday that the company remains “committed to the programs and partnerships we have forged over decades with organizations to drive economic prosperity across a number of communities, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.” The Bud Light maker, which is part of the Belgium-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, did not address HCR’s letters.  Mulvaney took a few weeks before commenting publicly on the backlash — but posted a video to her Instagram page at the end of April thanking supporters, but did not mentioning Bud Light by name in the post.

As Sudan’s civil war enters its second month, ethnic killings are terrorising civilians in the troubled West Darfur region.  Residents told Al Jazeera that no place is safe and that Sudanese Arab fighters stormed a hospital to execute 12 wounded non-Arab civilians on May 14. Government buildings, food markets, schools and internally displaced camps have also been attacked, looted and burned.  “They are killing all residents … and committing crimes against humanity,” said Jamal Khamis, a human rights monitor in el-Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.  “The militants especially know who the political and human rights activists are,” he added, suggesting that he could be targeted.      Since a conflict erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on April 15, the two sides have redeployed thousands of fighters from across the country to try to consolidate control over Khartoum, Sudan’s capital.  That has left a power vacuum in West Darfur where Arab militias have reportedly killed hundreds of people in el-Geneina.  The region has long been a source of tension between Arab and non-Arab communities because of disputes over land and water resources. The grievances date back to 2003, when non-Arab armed groups rebelled against the central government for neglecting and exploiting Darfur.  Sudan’s former president, Omar al-Bashir, responded by outsourcing suppression efforts to Arab tribal militias who were later repackaged into the RSF. Between 2003 and 2008, up to 300,000 people died in the violence as well as from diseases and famine brought on by the conflict, according to United Nations officials.  Now, residents in West Darfur are afraid of living through another civil war.  “It’s the Arabs who are attacking,” Fadil Barus, a member of the Arab Rizeigat tribe, told Al Jazeera from el-Geneina. “But war isn’t good … and I am not fighting. I’m a citizen that has humanity.”  False promises  Months after al-Bashir fell from power following a popular uprising in April 2019, West Darfur witnessed some of its worst violence in years.  In December 2019, 72 non-Arabs from internally displaced camps were killed, according to local rights groups. Survivors told Al Jazeera that uniformed RSF fighters were involved in coordinating and directing the attacks.  Despite the acute protection concerns in the region, the UN Security Council did not renew the peacekeeping mission for Darfur which expired at the end of 2020.  Peacekeepers in Darfur were often criticised for failing to effectively protect civilians, yet rights groups said that their presence somewhat dissuaded attacks since they monitored and reported atrocities that threatened to identify and expose perpetrators.  After the peacekeepers left, hundreds of more people were killed in subsequent attacks despite promises from the RSF and the Sudanese army to provide security in Darfur.  Both forces are now fighting an existential battle for Khartoum as the death toll mounts in el-Geneina.      “Snipers are targeting many people who have influence [in the community] such as doctors, engineers and teachers,” said Ibrahim Musa, a resident in el-Geneina from the non-Arab Masalit tribe.  Musa said that he has lost more than 20 friends and relatives since the fighting erupted last month. A sniper shot his younger brother near their home, but he survived, he added.  “RSF snipers are located on high buildings … we try to [avoid] them by staying very close to walls … [and not walking] in the middle of the street,” Musa told Al Jazeera.  ‘It’s a disaster’  Masalit displacement camps have also been looted and burned, residents have said.  Speaking to Al Jazeera from Khartoum, Nahid Hamid, a human rights lawyer and the wife of Sultan Sa’at who represents the Masalit in tribal disputes, said that fighters entered their home in el-Geneina and stole cars, money and gold jewellery  “The situation is a disaster. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster,” she told Al Jazeera. “Homes are burning … all the homes will burn.”  Hamid added that Arab fighters stormed the home of her colleague and stole his valuables, killed his father and then evicted him.  Last month, many non-Arabs armed themselves by looting weapons from the local police station, but they have remained outgunned by much more powerful Arab militias who are fighting with RSF support, residents said. Since fighting began, some blamed the army for not defending them.  Al Jazeera contacted army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah to ask why the army has not stepped in to protect civilians, but he did not respond.      ‘Nowhere to hide’  Fleeing the violence is challenging because of the insecurity on desert roads exiting the city, where thieves and armed groups look to stop cars at gunpoint, said Mathilde Vu, the head of communications for the Norwegian Refugee Council.  “[We heard] that there were cars trying to leave when they were shot at. There is heightened criminality on the roads,” she told Al Jazeera from Nairobi, Kenya, where she is monitoring the situation in West Darfur.  “[In el-Geneina] there is nowhere to hide, nowhere to escape and nobody to protect you,” Vu added.  Beyond the killings, food prices are soaring due to acute shortages across the city. Prior to the conflict, most displaced people were heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance and about 42 percent of all residents in the state relied on aid, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.  In March, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that about one of three children suffered from chronic malnutrition in Darfur.  But humanitarian assistance has been suspended because of the fighting and food supplies have been disrupted due to insecurity on the roads.  “Just like in Khartoum, people will die from bullets or hunger in West Darfur,” Vu told Al Jazeera. “The big difference with Khartoum is that el-Geneina was already an open-air camp in some way.”  For now, a number of community activists have been risking their lives to communicate to the world about the violence.  Jamal Khamis, the human rights monitor, said that his peers are constantly fixing electricity grids, so they can access the weak internet connection.  “It’s difficult for people to focus on how to get their voices out to the foreign media,” Khamis said. “They are still grasping how they escaped death and how they survived [attacks] from [Arab] militias.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTkvbm8tZXNjYXBlLW5vLWFpZC1hcy1maWdodGluZy1pbnRlbnNpZmllcy1pbi1zdWRhbnMtd2VzdC1kYXJmdXLSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xOS9uby1lc2NhcGUtbm8tYWlkLWFzLWZpZ2h0aW5nLWludGVuc2lmaWVzLWluLXN1ZGFucy13ZXN0LWRhcmZ1cg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The family of a man who died during a fire at Marathon’s Galveston Bay refinery on Monday are demanding answers and accountability.  The fire erupted Monday morning after a leak caused an explosion at the site’s ultraformer-3 unit at the northwest side of the refinery. The flames lasted about five hours before being extinguished. In the end, two contractors were hospitalized and an employee named Scott Higgins was dead.  During a press conference on Friday, Attorney Tony Buzbee — who’s representing the Higgins family — announced the filing of a 202 petition, which would require Marathon to provide depositions within the next 30 days.  “We will know what repairs were made, what repairs were needed and what were put off to the next turnaround,” Buzbee said. “We’re going to figure out how this happened and why this happened.”  According to the petition, the family is looking to bring claims of wrongful death, negligence and gross negligence against Marathon.  Buzbee also accused Marathon of delaying necessary maintenance “based on price of oil and gas.”  “Higgins died because Marathon and others failed to properly and adequately manage, inspect, maintain, and repair Ultraformer Unit #3 and its surrounding machinery,” the petition read.  Marathon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but shared their “deepest sympathies” to Higgins’ family through a statement on Monday.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” the statement read.  During Friday’s press conference, Higgins’ two daughters spoke about their father and his impact on the family.  “My dad protected me. He protected my sister.

The sparks caught wood dust on fire, and the flames spread to the bag collection system.  Crews from Fleetwood, Walnuttown, Blandon and Kutztown responded about 1:30 p.m., Manmiller said.  Manmiller said the operation involved taking apart duct work to reach the flames.  Students were evacuated school-wide and 8 rooms were ventilated.

In this photo provided by the Government of Alberta, Canada, the Eagle Wildfire burns, Saturday, May 13. Wildfire officials in Alberta say hot, dry and windy weather has pushed fire conditions even further into the extreme in the province's north this weekend, and the situation in the south is now a growing concern. (Government of Alberta Fire Service/The Canadian Press via AP)  Has the sky looked a bit hazy to you lately? Have sunsets seemed a bit off? You’re not imagining it — northern wildfires are the culprit.  Wildfires began to sprout in Alberta, Canada, in early May, bolstered by unusually warm dry weather and strong winds. The province declared a state of emergency on May 6 as more blazes erupted. As of May 10, 136 wildfires burned throughout Canada — 31 of which were uncontrolled at the time. More than 29,000 residents have since evacuated Alberta and the neighboring province British Columbia.  The resulting smoke from the blazes has wafted over much of the northern U.S. It started noticeably clouding Iowa skies around Tuesday, creating cloudlike cover and red, hazy sunsets. That smoke was between 15,000 and 20,000 feet in the air.  Advertisement  But as another round rolls through the state, it will be closer to the ground — and, as a result, bring more of a health risk. The smoke started fanning across northwest Iowa Thursday morning.  “We've had smoke in the summer several years in a row” prior to last summer, said meteorologist John Haase of the National Weather Service’s Quad Cities bureau. “This is, I would say, the earliest (in the year) I've seen it.”  How did the smoke get here?  Some of the wildfires in question are more than 2,000 miles away from Cedar Rapids. So, how did their smoke make its way to Iowa? And why is it just now becoming a health concern?  Winds aloft — or, the winds at different levels of the atmosphere, up above surface level — are the cause. Specifically, their northwest direction that pushed them out of western Canada and toward Iowa, Haase said.  While Iowa skies have been hazy since Tuesday, the situation turned a bit riskier because of the cold front passing through the state. The cooler air sinks to the ground — bringing the smoke with it. The cold front hit Cedar Rapids in the early hours of Friday morning.  Visibility fell as low as one mile in Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas, Haase said. Visibility in Eastern Iowa should only drop to around four miles.  Want a weekly dose of local environmental news?

Please add erin.jordan@thegazette.com and brittney.miller@thegazette.com to your contacts  Will the smoke impact our health?  While the haziness has been in the air for a few days, the smoke didn’t significantly register on the Iowa Department of Natural Resource’s Air Quality Index until Thursday morning in northwest Iowa.  That’s because the monitors are close to ground level and didn’t catch a whiff of smoke until it sunk with the cold front, said John Gering, unit leader of the Iowa DNR’s ambient air monitoring group.  On Thursday afternoon, the AQI Fire and Smoke Map depicted a wave of unhealthy air quality passing through Iowa. At first, locations would experience levels unhealthy for sensitive groups — like older adults, children and those with respiratory or heart disease. Then, as more smoke settled in, levels turned to those considered unhealthy for everyone.  Gering advised sensitive groups to move activities indoors or reschedule outdoor activities. The population should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion and take more breaks during outdoor activities.  Will the smoke impact agriculture?  Farmers may be tending to their fields with smoke overhead — but it shouldn’t affect their crops, Haase said.  If the smoke gets thick enough, it could act like a cloud layer. Temperatures on the ground may be cooler than they would be otherwise. But sunlight will still make it through to the plants below.  “It's kind of like filtered sunshine,” Haase said.  Smoke rising from Canadian wildfires can be seen via NASA satellite imagery on May 18, 2023. (NASA Worldview) Smoke from Canadian wildfires passes across the upper U.S. on May 18, 2023. The orange marker indicates where Cedar Rapids is. (NASA Worldview)  How long will the smoke stick around?  The northwest winds are changing course Friday; streams should start coming from the west. So, smoke should clear out of Iowa by Friday afternoon, aside from some intermittent patches that may pass over through the weekend.  But that most likely won’t be the last Iowa sees of the haziness. With around 30 wildfires still raging out of control in Canada, more smoke is bound to travel southeast at some point, Haase said.  “It's all about which direction the winds are coming from,” he said. “You’ve got to wait for another pattern change to a northwest flow again. At some point, it'll happen again, and I'm sure the smoke will come back again.”  Brittney J.

More than 400 firefighters, including 50 agents from the army’s Military Emergency Unit, are battling to bring the fire under control in Las Hurdes, a hilly area west of Madrid.  Officials suspect the fire, which began Wednesday night, was started intentionally as they say two separate blazes erupted almost simultaneously.  The president of the surrounding region of Extremadura, Guillermo Fernández Vara, said the person responsible “knew very well what they were doing” to cause the most damage by starting the blaze at night, making it more difficult to extinguish.  Many wildfires in Spain are believed by police and officials to be started intentionally. The reasons why are said to vary.  Fernández Vara said the problem Friday was not a lack of means to fight the blaze, but the winds.  “With 60 kph (40 mph) winds, it's difficult to predict how it will evolve,” he told reporters, adding that the pine trees in the area were virtual “cans of gasoline, flame throwers,”  Some 267,000 hectares (666,000 acres) burned last year in Spain, making 2022 its worst year of fire destruction since 1994, government statistics say. That was three times the national average for the past decade.  According to the European Union’s Copernicus satellite observation service, Spain accounted for 35% of all burnt land in European wildfires last year.  Spain recorded its hottest and driest April ever last month and nearly 30% of the country is now in a drought “emergency” or “alert.”  ___  Follow AP’s climate coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvaHVuZHJlZHMtZXZhY3VhdGVkLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1pbnRlbnRpb25hbC13aWxkZmlyZS1oaXRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tc3BhaW4tOTk0NTgzNjfSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvaHVuZHJlZHMtZXZhY3VhdGVkLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1pbnRlbnRpb25hbC13aWxkZmlyZS1oaXRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tc3BhaW4tOTk0NTgzNjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The district unveiled the Bearcat Advantage, a scholarship program covering up to 100% of tuition and fees for Michigan colleges as well as nearly 100 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), thanks to the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  BCPS Superintendent Kimberly Carter made the surprise announcement to seniors in the 2023 graduating class, who are immediately eligible for the scholarship. The room erupted in applause and a standing ovation.  Andre Hollins, a senior in BCPS who’s going to Western Michigan University this fall, was expecting a much duller announcement -- that graduation would be held outdoors.  “I can go to college without worrying about my finances and how I’m going to pay. I can put all of my thoughts and all of my knowledge into my studies,” Hollins said.  With the Bearcat Advantage, all of his tuition will be covered.  The program covers 100% of tuition for students who’ve been in the Battle Creek district from kindergarten through 12th grade. Students who moved into the district later will get a portion of their tuition covered, depending on how long they’ve been in the district.  RELATED: Michigan school district announces students will get free college tuition  Without cost as a barrier, this will keep students from being left behind after high school, former BCPS student and University of Michigan student Abigail Arndt said.  Everybody should have access to a program like this, a handful of students said.  “Kids want to go to these big schools and they have these big ambitions, but they just can’t pay for it,” said Taylor Solis, a BCPS senior attending WMU in the fall.  The announcement is “historic” and “groundbreaking” said Sarah Cox, a visiting faculty member from Grand Valley State University. Cox helps students apply to college and has seen how anxiety-provoking it can be. One student Cox worked with applied for tuition reimbursements and scholarships, but still couldn’t cover the costs.  “They were completely devastated, they thought it was over,” Cox said. Through the new scholarship program, those roadblocks are erased.  The scholarship will last for at least the next generation, Carter said.  Battle Creek typically has about 300 students in each class, with roughly 200 graduating on time each year, according to MI School Data.  Why HBCUs are included  Incorporating HBCUs into the program is a unique aspect of the scholarship. The idea to include those came from the district’s equity imperative, Carter said. Black students are the largest racial group in the district at 40%, according to state data.  “For a long time, students have not had the level of access needed to actually be a part of that community,” Carter said.  Bearcat Advantage resembles the longtime Kalamazoo Promise program in offering 100% college tuition to all eligible students. But the Kalamazoo Promise only applies to Michigan schools, while Battle Creek’s also includes those HBCUs across the U.S.  Kapree Richardson, a sophomore at BCPS, said everyone should have the choice of whether they choose a predominantly white (PWI) college or university versus an HBCU, because the experience at an HBCU could be more fulfilling.  “As a Black kid in Battle Creek, there’s a lot of eyes on us. We’re supposed to fall into the system,” Richardson said. “(If) I go to college at an HBCU for free, I get to know my heritage for free ... They let us get our heritage.”  Attending college wasn’t a guarantee for Richardson before Thursday. Richardson would be the first in his family to go to college, he said. The Bearcat Advantage is a “huge game-changer,” he said.  Want more Kalamazoo news?

Less than 58% of students graduated on time in 2022, per state data. Comparatively the statewide graduation rate was 81% in 2022. Graduation rates were around 70% pre-pandemic.  Maintaining and boosting enrollment has also been a challenge.  In 2022-23, Battle Creek schools had about 300 students who lived in other districts, while about 3,900 students who lived in the district boundaries enrolled elsewhere.  The 2022-23 district enrollment was 3,734 students.  Carter said the Bearcat Advantage is an investment in the district’s “economic vitality.” Increasing enrollment was also a motivating factor in the decision.  “There’s a lot of different residual effects the scholarship will have,” Carter said. “But first and foremost, it’s about making sure that students have access.”  Want more Kalamazoo-area news?

"eruption","2023-05-18","09:00:00","{""Charlotte"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:38:00","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (CBS NEWS) - One worker has died after firefighters battled a massive, five-alarm blaze that broke out Thursday morning at a construction site in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The deceased worker was identified as Demonte Sherrill. His father confirmed his death.  A second worker remains missing. The fire captain told CBS News that on Thursday night, structural engineers deemed it unsafe for heavy machinery to operate overnight, so search and rescue efforts were paused until morning. Efforts resumed in the morning as machinery was used to search under debris.  There are concerns that the entire structure is unstable and could collapse, the captain said.  More than 90 firefighters were called to the scene and had not yet extinguished the fast-moving flames, said Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson at a news conference held hours after flames initially erupted around 9 a.m. Exposed wood at the construction site allowed the fire to move quickly, reaching scorching temperatures well over 2,000 degrees, according to the chief.  Crews rescued 15 workers from the blaze, Johnson said. Fire officials previously told CBS News that a tower crane operator, who was working at the construction site when the fire broke out, was rescued and safely on the ground. The operator was transported to a hospital with injuries that are not life-threatening.  Johnson said two workers remained unaccounted for at the time of the news conference, citing confirmation from the construction site foreman.  Videos and images shared on social media show bright orange flames engulfing part of a large building complex in the North Carolina city’s South Park neighborhood, an area known for its large namesake shopping center. Additional footage taken by CBS affiliate WBTV captured a thick plume of black smoke rising up from the burning structure.  Huge flames are seen billowing out from the roof of the structure in a separate video, recorded by the Twitter user @mr_veal from inside a building across the street.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police announced multiple road closures in the SouthPark area in a tweet after the fire broke out. At least one road has since been reopened. A spokesperson for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools told WBTV on Thursday morning that schools had not been impacted by the blaze.  Fire crews will likely remain on scene for “a period of time,” according to the chief, who said at the afternoon conference that responders had already called mayday — which happens when crews are trapped or otherwise have issues escaping — twice since arriving. Investigators will determine what caused the fire, he said. At this point, investigators believe it was accidental.  Mill Creek Residential, which is developing the property under construction in South Park, said in a statement to CBS News that the company was “gathering as much information as possible on what occurred” at the site.  “Our No. 1 priority is the health and safety of the people who were working there today and those in the surrounding area,” the company said. “Our thoughts are with those who were impacted and their friends and family members. We are gathering as much information as possible on what occurred and will take the appropriate measures to address today’s incident.”  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

No matter how they throw us, we fall standing...but on our heads - 2023, an artwork by Houmam al-Sayed.  Qatar’s burgeoning art scene is taking a unique turn, thanks to the growing appreciation of art by citizens and those who call the country home, an international arts manager has said.  “I think it (Qatar) is setting itself apart, thanks to the locals and people of Qatar who are appreciating art in a different way than we’ve seen. Over this... the GCC as a whole has changed its approach and point of view towards art,” Garo Bardakjaian, in charge of international relations for renowned Belgian-Lebanese artist, sculptor, and painter Jean Boghossian, said as he lauded Qatar’s vibrant art scene.  He noted that people like Boghossian and a number of participating Middle Eastern artists in the ‘Eruption’ exhibition at Msheireb Downtown Doha have showcased their works with pride, serving as ambassadors of the region to the world as well.  According to Bardakjaian, the warm reception extended to these artists underlines the welcoming atmosphere for Middle Eastern artists returning to their homeland.  “It is always a welcoming and heartwarming scene when we see us being welcomed back to the Middle East,” he said, noting that the globally-renowned artist is a Belgian-Lebanese of Armenian descent.  Other exhibiting artists at the Eruption exhibition at Msheireb include Amal al-Aathem, Anachar Basbous, Anastasia Nysten, Clara Carvajal, Houmam al-Sayed, Jumanah Abbas, Mahmoud Obaidi, Maryam al-Homaid, Morrison Pierce, Nadim Karam, Nicolas Panayotou, Nourbanu Hijazi, Peter Zimmermann, Said Baalbaki, Tamara Haddad, Yasmina Nysten, and Zheng Lu.  The exhibition was organised by Anima Gallery and Msheireb Properties, and brought together the works of local, regional and international artists at Msheireb. The show will run until June 10 at Sikkat Alwadi.  Bardakjaian said Boghossian, who become popular for his unique experimentation with fire as his medium of choice, is exhibiting his work titled ‘Ready, Aim, Fire’, which “depicts the tension and beauty of a canon blast with billowing smoke, reminding us of the fragility and power of anticipation.”  He explained that the painting itself has inclusion of damage (by fire), which is part of the artist’s process.  The artist, Bardakjaian noted, comes from a family of jewellers and at a very young age was exposed to fire as a medium to create jewellery. Over the years, he then pursued his passion and transitioned to becoming a full-time artist.  The artist’s exceptional work at the exhibition, he pointed out, captures the split-second moment when smoke puffs out after a cannon explosion – a depiction of the readiness to pursue his passion and aim for excellence in his chosen field.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNjYxMzYxL3FhdGFyL2EtdW5pcXVlLXNoaWZ0LWluLXFhdGFycy1idXJnZW9uaW5nLWFydC1zY2VuZdIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNjYxMzYxL3FhdGFyL2EtdW5pcXVlLXNoaWZ0LWluLXFhdGFycy1idXJnZW9uaW5nLWFydC1zY2VuZS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-11-22","11:31:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:17:59","General Daily Insight for May 20, 2023 Passionate disputes could erupt with the slightest provocation today. When the bubbly Gemini Moon debates gloomy Saturn, our ideas may land wrong with others. We should attempt not to take whatever pushback we receive too personally. Any excuse to get heated might be eagerly embraced as aggressive Mars blasts into flamboyant Leo at 11:31 am EDT. Mars then opposes intense Pluto, cranking up the conflict further. We are capable of directing this energy toward the battles that are truly worth the trouble.  Aries March 21 – April 19 You may currently want to express your personal views, but someone in your social network could come down on you hard. As passionate Mars in your individualistic 5th house opposes brutal Pluto in your community sector, you’ll have to ask yourself what’s more uncomfortable — dealing with a fight or feeling alone because no one knows who you really are? Speaking your truth should ultimately help you find your people, even if they’re not in the crowd you’re with right now.  Taurus April 20 – May 20 Experiencing a power struggle with a family member is likely at the moment. Although turning to your friends for advice could be tempting, it might leave you disappointed. Not everyone has the same priorities in life, so a strategy that sounds plausible to a pal may not be a good fit for you. On the plus side, hearing an idea that rubs you the wrong way can give you an opportunity to define more clearly what you do want. Chart your own course!  Gemini May 21 – June 20 You’ll likely be eager to chat with the people around you today. However, while energetic Mars in your conversation sector challenges turbulent Pluto in your philosophy zone, it may be easy to blunder into a messy fight about politics or religion even if you weren’t really looking for that. Although social norms concerning the limits of polite chatter might sometimes seem to stifle your free spirit, consider the possibility that they’re there to protect you from damaging the relationships that you rely on.  Cancer June 21 – July 22 A money issue could have you feeling threatened at present. You may get aggressive in defending your interests, especially if you seem to be up against a shadowy bureaucracy that potentially lacks a human element. Although you might have a sense that you’re being victimized and treated unfairly by a harsh opponent, be realistic about how closely you’ve followed the stated rules up to this point. There are likely some factors within your control, even though the overall situation probably isn’t ideal.  Leo July 23 – August 22 Pushing back against someone who’s been pushing you around could currently feel like a reasonable response. As pugnacious Mars enters your sign, you’re probably ready to defend yourself! Seeking sympathy from your friends after an intense fight might be complicated, though. You may feel obligated to hold back some parts of the story for privacy reasons, but perhaps your narrative doesn’t quite add up without those details. In the end, whatever validation you seek will likely have to come from within.  Virgo August 23 – September 22 Your frustration regarding routine responsibilities is possibly in danger of bubbling over. You might be reluctant to ask others involved in the situation for the help you need out of fear that you’ll be seen as controlling. Letting your resentment fester, however, is likely to create a bigger problem. Even if people aren’t thrilled to do a particular task, they may quietly realize you have a point in speaking up about it. Don’t mistake their lack of open enthusiasm for hostility.  Libra September 23 – October 22 You’re equipped to work any room you enter, Libra! That said, giving the impression that you’re mainly interested in people for what they can do for you can speedily spoil the mood. Although your personal needs may loom large in your mind throughout the day, you could be better off accepting a distraction from them. Let your social interactions remind you that the world is a big and interesting place, and once your thoughts have settled, return to your own problems later.  Scorpio October 23 – November 21 Figuring out who’s really fueling a current family conflict could be a challenge for you now. It’s often easy to assume that the loudest person involved is the one to blame. On the other hand, if someone quieter keeps subtly provoking them, maybe they’ve got a reason to complain! Your own desire for a quick fix that lets you feel righteous might need to be reined in before you can objectively seek the truth. Listening closely can genuinely bring you important rewards.  Sagittarius November 22 – December 21 Communicating on multiple levels is a risk for you today. While dynamic Mars in your philosophy sector provokes subversive Pluto in your 3rd House of Conversation, a political debate could accidentally wind up conveying a lot of personal baggage. Feeling emotionally deprived may lead you to fear that asking directly for what you need will have a disappointing outcome. Using a passive-aggressive approach might just add to your problems, though. Be honest — at least with yourself — about what you’re looking for.  Capricorn December 22 – January 19 Getting your way in a negotiation could be a high priority for you now. Instead of taking a loud and flashy approach, you may prefer to wait the other person out, frustrating them with endless delays and stonewalling. While you’re quiet, you might as well think through any potential concessions that would sweeten a deal with the opposing side for you. Sometimes being right is priceless — but don’t pass up a key opportunity to make your daily life more comfortable.  Aquarius January 20 – February 18 Your close relationships could seem volatile out of nowhere! Still, as provocative Mars in your partnership sector pokes seething Pluto in your sign, you might have to look at the signals you’re putting out. Even if your attention is focused on practical matters that seem more pressing than your feelings, you probably give away your emotional state — whether you mean to or not. It’s possibly easier to let someone else be the dramatic one, but try to admit it if that’s what you’re doing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJhbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvZ2VuZXJhbC1kYWlseS1pbnNpZ2h0LWZvci1tYXktMjAtMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Utes, who are now 38-13 in 2023, will move on to play the Ole Miss Rebels on Saturday at 1 p.m. MT with a spot in the regional final on the line. Utah's 38 wins are the most in a single season since they won 40 games in 2006.    ""First win for the Utes in postseason for a long time,"" said head coach Amy Hogue. ""I was really proud of what they did endure the ups and downs of that game. There were many, but our offense really took control. I'm proud of them for controlling this game and winning this game.""    Utah's offensive onslaught started right away, as singles from Aliya Belarde, Julia Jimenez and Sophie Jacquez plated the game's first run and another RBI knock, this one by Abby Dayton, made the score 2-0. Davison then blasted a three-run homer to center to cap her team's first inning eruption. Jacquez struck again with another RBI single in the second that boosted the Utes' lead to 6-0.    The Salukis refused to be bamboozled by this early deficit and started the third by stringing together six straight hits that brought in four runs and a Sidney Jones sacrifice fly tallied the fifth run of the frame to slice Utah's lead to one. The Utes quickly answered, however, thanks to a Belarde two-run knock in the bottom of the third that upped Utah's advantage to three.    An Ellessa Bonstrom RBI double in the fifth made the score 9-5, but SIU's offense came to life again in the sixth, using an error, a walk, two singles and a two-run Rylie Hamilton double to draw level. The Salukis had a chance to pull ahead later in the frame, but Mariah Lopez escaped a bases-loaded jam and the game remained tied.    Despite SIU's comeback, Utah's lineup had one more rally in their bones and it started with singles from Jacquez and Dayton that brought up Davison. The Utes' freshman shortstop roped a 2-0 pitch into left-center, bringing in both runners to give the home team one more lead. Lopez allowed a lead-off single in the seventh, but set down the next three hitters to seal the victory.  Bonstrom's run-scoring double in the fifth put her at 175 career RBIs, tying the program record set by Cyndee Bennett.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcGFjLTEyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvbm8tMTUtdXRhaC1zdXJ2aXZlcy1zbHVnZmVzdC12cy1zb3V0aGVybi1pbGxpbm9pcy1uY2FhLXJlZ2lvbmFsLW9wZW5lctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Kalemie"", ""Katanga"", ""DemocraticRepublicCongo""}","2023-05-19T10:54:47","Hoes on their shoulders, Kalonda and Samueli laugh and chat as they stroll home after a hard morning working the fields outside their village of Sango Malumbi, in the south eastern province of Tanganyika, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Friends since they first met as children beneath the tree that served as their classroom, the two men were forced to flee in different directions in 2017 when escalating inter-communal conflict between Kalonda’s Twa community and Samueli’s Bantu community reached their village. Kalonda, 41, fled to the nearby forest and Samueli, 39, to the city of Kalemie, 30 kilometres away.  ""The conflict began all of a sudden, and we all had to flee our homes to save our own lives,” said Kalonda. “Each of us sought safety where we could. Sami sought refuge in Kalemie, while I found safety with my family in the bush. Those were the hardest times.”  Deep down we knew that we were still friends.  At the time, inter-communal conflicts were flaring in Tanganyika Province, tearing apart communities and villages, clawing at the social fabric and and eroding trust between neighbours and communities. When tensions eased and they could return months later, Kalonda and Samueli rekindled their friendship becoming symbols for how the two communities could heal their divisions and live together in peace and safety.  ""Deep down we knew that we were still friends and when we returned to our village, we would continue to be friends,” said Samueli. “Between my family and Kalonda's there was no conflict. The confrontation was between the militias. We can't even imagine being enemies.”  ""Our friendship is a childhood friendship,"" added Kalonda. “When I got married, Sami gave me money to help pay the dowry.”  Role models  Kalonda and Samueli were among the many thousands who have returned to their homes since the end of 2018 to resume their old lives. But tensions and distrust remain, not least because residents often found their homes burned and crops destroyed, while widespread food shortages added to the stress and anger. “We faced enormous difficulties and the ensuing hunger was terrible,” said Samueli.  Today, Kalonda and Samueli have made themselves role models for forging and strengthening inter-communal relations. ""The conflict brought a lot of unrest and exacerbated distrust and grievances between the inhabitants of Sango Malumbi. We wanted to participate in restoring ties and consolidating peace in our village. This is our motivation,"" said Samueli.  The pair put themselves forward and were elected to the Sango Malumbi Village Peace Committee, one of 80 such groups set up by local people across Tanganyika since 2019. With the financial and technical support of the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, and its local partner AIDES, the committees are helping communities to live together in harmony once again.  Members of the Village Peace Committee talk to villagers in Sango Malumbi. © UNHCR/Gwenn Dubourthoumieu  Each committee is made up of 20 elected men and women from the Twa and Bantu communities, tasked with various awareness-raising activities to improve communication and dialogue between inhabitants, and strengthen social cohesion.  ""We are trained on protection and human rights, and we build awareness around different themes related to peace, and contribute to peaceful resolution of conflicts and prevent them from degenerating."" said Kalonda.  “The village chiefs and the populations in surrounding villages know of our Village Peace Committee and ask us for help with awareness raising, and when a problem occurs,"" added Samueli.  Rebuilding trust  Alongside this grass-roots peacebuilding, the committees are involved in rebuilding trust, for example through the creation of community fields such as the one Kalonda and Samueli were returning from, where men and women, Twa and Bantu, work together to plant, tend, and harvest crops for sale at the market.  Samueli (centre) and other members of the Village Peace Committee at work in their community field. © UNHCR/Gwenn Dubourthoumieu  UNHCR and its partners are working to support the ongoing return of over 195,000 displaced people to safe villages in different parts of Tanganyika Province, a process to which Village Peace Committees have proven integral, encouraging local communities to strive for peaceful coexistence and to overcome a dangerous legacy of conflict and tension. In total, some 367,000 people remain displaced in sites or host families in the Tanganyika Province.  But with only 15 per cent funded of the $232.6 million the UNHCR, as of the end of April, needs for its response in the DRC in 2023, such vital initiatives risk running out of funds.  “Our village is a place where both communities live,” said Samueli. “The Village Peace Committee allows the village to continue to move forward and to resolve effectively small conflicts that could separate us. We hope to inspire others by maintaining peace, and that our children can grow together in peace.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaGNyLm9yZy9uZXdzL2Nsb3NlLWZyaWVuZHNoaXAtYnVpbGRzLXBlYWNlLWJldHdlZW4tY29tbXVuaXRpZXMtZHItY29uZ2_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","1992-07-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T23:43:54","With the support of the military and the police, Ecuador’s President Guillermo Lasso triggered on Wednesday a “mutual death” clause to dissolve Congress before it could vote to impeach him on corruption charges.  The legislative building and the streets of downtown Quito were heavily militarized as the armed forces threatened to “act firmly” to defend the decision. Highlighting the authoritarian dangers posed by Lasso’s measures, the military high command had held a closed-door meeting with Defense Minister Luis Lara on Tuesday in the “War Room,” where Lasso’s next steps were discussed.  The military and police leadership issue statement endorsing Lasso's dissolution of Congress [Photo: @Presidencia_Ec]  The “mutual death” provision was enacted in the 2008 Constitution under the presidency of Rafael Correa, whose party Union for Hope (UNES) was leading the impeachment drive against Lasso. The clause allows the president to rule by decree for up to six months until a new administration takes office and sets a three-month deadline for presidential and congressional elections.  Lasso has sent an extensive package of long-planned economic decrees to the Constitutional Court, which takes over legislative powers and quickly approved Lasso’s “mutual death” on Thursday. The economic decrees reportedly include a regressive tax reform, a free trade zone project, an Investment Act, reforms to the Social Security Institute and measures related to oil extraction.  US Ambassador Michael J. Fitzpatrick backed Lasso’s actions, declaring: “The government of the United States respects the internal and constitutional processes of Ecuador.”  This endorsement has again exposed US imperialism’s hypocritical pretensions to defend “democracy.” Just five months ago, when the pseudo-left Peruvian president Pedro Castillo shut down Congress citing similarly vague constitutional provisions in response to an impeachment drive based on corruption charges, the US ambassador, Lisa Kenna, a CIA veteran, gave a green light for ousting and arresting Castillo, as well as violently suppressing protests.  Washington has consistently backed the authoritarian measures taken by the Ecuadorian government. The Trump administration supported the repression of mass anti-austerity demonstrations in October 2019 that forced then-president Lenín Moreno to temporarily relocate his government to the coastal city of Guayaquil, resulting in 11 dead.  In 2021, Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Quito to proclaim that “exceptional measures” were “required” as the already beleaguered Lasso was resorting to dictatorial states of emergency and threatening to violently repress strikes in 2021. Amid mass protests and a national strike sparked by food and fuel price increases in 2022, the Biden administration defended Lasso after a crackdown that left at least seven dead and hundreds injured.  The opposition parties have insisted that there is no “grave political crisis or civil commotion”—the cause cited by Lasso as the grounds to trigger the “mutual death” clause—and that Lasso’s actions are illegal.  However, the UNES party has refused to call for protests, with Correa tweeting: “The measure is unconstitutional, but what is best for the Fatherland is to hold elections. The future is in your hands. Will you let them fool you again?”  The Indigenous federation CONAIE, which has led repeated anti-government protests and whose presidential candidate came third in 2021, also called off protests.  Even before Lasso’s announcement, CONAIE leader Leonidas Iza, who has been promoted by other indigenous leaders as a likely presidential candidate, sought to preempt a social eruption by calling off any demonstrations or “roadblocks” that were reportedly already being prepared.  “If the government makes the wrong decisions and provokes a social reaction… we will declare a national mobilization,” he said in a press conference. “We are standing by.”  Only the Stalinist-led “Popular Front,” including the Teachers Union UNE, organized a handful of roadblocks in Quito. The trade union federation FUT announced a convention in June to decide on a response to Lasso’s package of economic measures.  So far, there have not been any major demonstrations. However, Lasso’s attacks against democratic and social rights will inevitably provoke massive opposition. Workers and all oppressed sectors must conclude from the soporifics and stalling by the official leaderships that they are determined to isolate and suppress any struggles by channeling them behind empty electoral promises.  The Ecuadorian ruling class has been facing a decades-long political crisis involving repeated resignations and impeachments. Such political instability, including conflicts between the old banking and agro-export oligarchy and the newer finance-industrial bourgeoisie, has been the norm since the end of the military dictatorship in 1979.  The 1971 and 1975 general strikes and growing union movement had rattled the ruling class as the urban working class had surpassed the rural population, demonstrating its enormous power.  In response, the so-called “return to democracy” saw an attempt to integrate an elite of the still massive rural indigenous population into the bourgeois political establishment, beginning with 1979 provisions to expand the electoral participation of indigenous peoples. By 1986, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) was formed to unite regional leaderships, and a decade later it formed its electoral wing, the Pachakutik party. Shortly after, basing its program on “land rights,” “anti-globalization” and “anti-neoliberalism,” the CONAIE gained control of dozens of provincial and municipal governments and won hundreds of municipal council posts.  Along with the Stalinist-led trade union bureaucracy, the CONAIE repeatedly placed itself at the front of mass protests to channel opposition against austerity, environmental destruction and land rights abuses behind illusions in the election of one or another bourgeois politician, as well as in the capitalist constituent assemblies of 1997-98 and 2007-08.  In 1998-2000, a pre-revolutionary crisis erupted that saw most banks collapse, a currency run leading to a chaotic dollarization of the economy, rampant inflation that sent over 70 percent of the population into poverty, and untenable debt levels. The CONAIE, the Stalinist Communist Party, along with the trade union bureaucracy and their pseudo-left apologists, scrambled to channel the resulting mass upheaval, ultimately backing the former colonel Lucio Gutierrez (2003-2005), who integrated several CONAIE and Pachakutik leaders into his cabinet. Gutierrez then defended the dollarization and agreed to another IMF structural program, which led to mass protests and his own downfall.  Then these same forces of the official “left” backed the coalition Alianza País under Rafael Correa, a US-trained economist. By then, Chinese demand was driving up prices of commodities like oil and minerals, allowing the Ecuadorian economy to grow more than fivefold between 2000 and 2014.  This allowed Correa not only to pay back the public debts and provide massive profits for the local ruling elite and the transnationals, but also to increase spending on public education, health care and social assistance. At the same time, Correa used states of emergency and troop deployments to crush indigenous protests against the rapid expansion of natural resource extraction. In 2017, he handpicked his right-wing successor Lenín Moreno, who moved to implement austerity measures and regressive labor reforms to pay back new massive debts. He also withdrew the asylum granted WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, handing him over to the British police.  Moreno’s reactionary policies paved the way to the election of the right-wing multi-millionaire banker Lasso. Under Lasso and amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the eruption of war in Ukraine, a continued slowdown of the Chinese economy and growing US pressures against Chinese influence in Latin America, Ecuador has suffered an economic downturn.  The Ecuadorian ruling class is desperate to impose social austerity and attack wages and job security to attract investments as its public debt has grown from 17 percent of its GDP in 2011 to 69 percent last year. The economy has effectively stagnated for almost a decade.  Only about a third of workers in Ecuador have an “adequate job” (40 hours and a wage of at least $450 per month), but this falls to about 12.3 percent for indigenous people. Meanwhile, almost four out of every 10 Ecuadorians suffer multidimensional poverty, and this rate is more than twice as high for the indigenous rural communities. The indigenous leadership, now firmly integrated into the local and national governments, has demonstrated its inability to pursue an independent orientation.  Across Latin America, whether it’s under openly right-wing forces like Lasso and Boluarte in Peru or governments associated with a second wave of the so-called “pink tide” like Lula in Brazil, Boric in Chile and Petro in Colombia, the same attacks against the working class and poor are rapidly discrediting the entire political establishment and preparing massive social eruptions.  Correa and his party UNES are no exception and have long reassured foreign capital and US imperialism that they will do their bidding. In an interview with the Spanish website CTXT in 2021, for example, Correa insisted that, “Under no circumstances do we believe that there could be attempts to destabilize or undermine democracy” by the Biden administration.  While indicating that mechanisms “such as the National Endowment for Democracy” have been used to pressure governments, he said, “we hope that these mechanisms are now used for strengthening democracy.” Given the NED’s long history of use by the US State Department to sponsor coups all around the world, Correa statement amounted to an offer to sell his movement to the CIA.  These experiences in Ecuador have a strategic importance for workers and the oppressed everywhere. Only the independent political mobilization of workers under a socialist and internationalist program, opposed to all pro-capitalist and nationalist parties and organizations, offers a way forward.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvd3NkcC1tMTkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Scientists said on Wednesday the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes - similar to Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system. In our solar system, Earth and Venus are volcanically active, as are some of Jupiter's moons.  An exoplanet called LP 791-18 d, an Earth-size world about 90 light-years away, is seen in an undated artist's rendering. A more massive planet in the system, shown as a small blue dot on the right, exerts a gravitational tug that may result in internal heating and volcanic eruptions, like on Jupiter's moon Io. PICTURE: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Chris Smith (KRBwyle)/Handout via Reuters.  The planet's volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star. The gravitational tug from the larger planet may squeeze and flex the newly identified one, heating up its interior and causing surface volcanic activity, similar to Io, the researchers said.  Planets beyond our solar system are called exoplanets.  ""There is not yet any direct observational evidence of exoplanet volcanism, but this planet is a particularly likely candidate,"" said University of Kansas astronomy professor Ian Crossfield, one of the authors of the research published in the journal Nature.  It is a planet that does not rotate - with one side perpetually in daylight and the other in darkness.  ""On the dayside, it is too hot for liquid water, so it is likely very dry and hot - likely a desert. On the night side, there is possibly a large icy glacier,"" said study co-author Björn Benneke, head of the astronomy group at the University of Montreal.  ""The most interesting region is near the terminator region where the day and nightside meet. Here, water from the nightside glacier can melt and possibly form liquid surface water. In addition, there is likely volcanism all around the planet, even under the ice on the nightside and possibly under the water near the terminator,"" Benneke said.  The planet is located in the Milky Way about 86 light-years away from our solar system in the direction of the constellation Crater. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion kilometres.  It is slightly larger than Earth and orbits very close to a red dwarf star - a type much smaller than our sun, with relatively low mass and temperature - completing its elliptical journey around it in only 2.8 days.  We rely on our readers to fund Sight's work - become a financial supporter today!  Its surface temperature appears to be slightly warmer than Earth. It is situated on the inner edge of what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around the star - not too hot and not too cold, perhaps able to maintain liquid water on the surface and harbor life.  ""I imagine a rugged, young surface for the planet after many millions of years of constant volcanic activity. Since the gravitational effects don't care about day and night side, I also suspect the volcanic activity to be evenly spread over the planetary surface,"" said University of California, Riverside planetary astrophysicist and study co-author Stephen Kane.  ""Since the planet is so volcanically active, it is still contributing gases to the atmosphere from the interior. As such, the planet probably still has an atmosphere. The planet is unlikely to be habitable, however, since the total amount of energy makes for a quite hostile environment. Who knows? Life may find a way,"" Kane added.  Its orbit is sandwiched between the two other planets - the innermost one about 20 per cent bigger than Earth and the outermost one about 250 per cent the size of our planet.  The researchers spotted the planet using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as some ground-based observatories.  ""There are still many unknowns regarding volcanism and how long a planet can maintain outgassing processes,"" Kane said, referring to the release of trapped gas that occurs with eruptions. ""We only recently confirmed that Venus, Earth's twin planet, is volcanically active.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZ2h0bWFnYXppbmUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvMzAzMDItZWFydGgtc2l6ZWQtYWxpZW4tcGxhbmV0LWdyaXBwZWQtYnktd2lkZXNwcmVhZC12b2xjYW5pc23SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An enormous volcano measuring 5,426m (17,797ft) has come back to life, endangering the lives of 22million residents of nearby settlements.  Popocatepetl, 45mi (72km) southeast of Mexico City, has had a series of relatively small eruptions over the last week, causing ash to fall from the sky and prompting 11 nearby villages to temporarily close their schools.  The volcano has been spitting out ash, fumes and lumps of rock on a fairly consistent basis for the last 29 years after it became active again in 1994.  READ MORE: UK town branded ‘filthy, bleak cesspool of humanity’ that should be bulldozed  But now scientists expect it could soon erupt, potentially sending lava flowing down its sides and emitting toxic gas and plumes of ash into the air, reports Associated Press.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  If it were to explode, the volcano – known to locals as 'El Popo' – is close enough to the eastern outskirts of Mexico City's metropolitan area to potentially endanger lives, with a severe eruption threatening to cut off air traffic or cover the city in clouds of ash.  Ash also fell in the cities of Puebla and Atlixco, and experts estimate up to 22million people could be at risk if the volcano were to erupt.  Popocatepetl has six cameras around its summit, as well as a thermal imaging device and 12 seismological monitoring stations, which are used to monitor the volcano around the clock and feed data back to a command centre in Mexico City.  (Image: Hilda Rios/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  A team of 13 scientists work together to staff the command centre in a bid to preempt a potential explosion.  The geology boffins also monitor wind patterns to predict where ash clouds could be blown in the event of an eruption, and the shape of the volcano as the huge amount of force inside it can temporarily deform its summit.  To keep the residents of Mexico City safe, authorities have come up with a volcano ""stoplight"" to indicate the level of danger – green for safety, yellow for alert, and red for danger.  Within the green and red levels there are two ""phases"", and within yellow there are three to mark different risk levels.  Since it was introduced, the spotlight has mostly been stuck on ""yellow"", with the occasional period of quiet from the usually active volcano.  (Image: AFP via Getty Images)  Fortunately, volcanic activity can be easier to predict than other natural disasters like earthquakes, which also threaten residents' way of life in Mexico City.  Because the nation's capital was built on soft soil, even earthquakes hundreds of miles away can have catastrophic effects on the city, meaning scientists have to be vigilant to keep residents safe from potentially dangerous tremors.  The country's alert system for quakes is based at the same command centre and uses seismic monitors on the coast to send messages quicker than the natural shock waves.  Because of this, residents in Mexico City can be given up to half a minute to race to safety in the event of a quake.

"eruption","2023-09-01","15:15:00","{""MexicoCity"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-19T00:46:00","Photo: The Canadian Press The National Center for Disaster Prevention of Mexico, which monitors the Popocatépetl volcano, in Mexico City.  Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano rumbled to life again this week, belching out towering clouds of ash that forced 11 villages to cancel school sessions.  The residents weren't the only ones keeping a close eye on the towering peak. Every time there is a sigh, tic or heave in Popocatepetl, there are dozens of scientists, a network of sensors and cameras, and a roomful of powerful equipment watching its every move.  The 17,797-foot (5,426-meter) volcano, known affectionately as “El Popo,” has been spewing toxic fumes, ash and lumps of incandescent rock persistently for almost 30 years, since it awakened from a long slumber in 1994.  The volcano is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, but looms much closer to the eastern fringes of the metropolitan area of 22 million people. The city also faces threats from earthquakes and sinking soil, but the volcano is the most visible potential danger — and the most closely watched. A severe eruption could cut off air traffic, or smother the city in clouds of choking ash.  Ringed around its summit are six cameras, a thermal imaging device and 12 seismological monitoring stations that operate 24 hours a day, all reporting back to an equipment-filled command center in Mexico City.  A total of 13 scientists from a multidisciplinary team take turns staffing the command center around the clock. Being able to warn of an impending ash cloud is key, because people can take precautions. Unlike earthquakes, warning times can be longer for the volcano and in general the peak is more predictable.  On a recent day, researcher Paulino Alonso made the rounds, checking the readings at the command center run by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center, known by its initials as Cenapred. It is a complex task that involves seismographs that measure the volcano's internal trembling, which could indicate hot rock and gas moving up the vents in the peak.  Monitoring gases in nearby springs and at the peak — and wind patterns that help determine where the ash could be blown — also play a role.  The forces inside are so great that they can temporarily deform the peak, so cameras and sensors must monitor the very shape of the volcano.  How do you explain all of this to 25 million non-experts living within a 62-mile (100-kilometer) radius who have grown so used to living near the volcano?  Authorities came up with the simple idea of a volcano “stoplight” with three colors: green for safety, yellow for alert and red for danger.  For most of the years since the stoplight was introduced, it has been stuck at some stage of “yellow.” The mountain sometimes quiets down, but not for long. It seldom shoots up molten lava: instead it's more the “explosive” type, showering out hot rocks that tumble down its flanks and emitting bursts of gas and ash.  The center also has monitors in other states; Mexico is a country all too familiar with natural disasters.  For example, Mexico’s earthquake early alert system is also based at the command center. Because the city’s soil is so soft — it was built on a former lake bed — a quake hundreds of miles away on the Pacific coast can cause huge destruction in the capital, as happened in 1985 and 2017.  A system of seismic monitors along the coast sends messages that race faster than the quake’s shock waves. Once the sirens start blaring, it can give Mexico City residents up to half a minute to get to safety, usually on the streets outside.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc3RhbmV0Lm5ldC9lZGl0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnktNDI3NTk4LTUtLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo Credit: Eric Pilgrim) VIEW ORIGINAL  FORT KNOX, Ky. — Two long lines of bright orange and black pint-sized fans snaked from the parking lot of Caruso Youth Sports Complex past the concession stand to the football field May 19.  The children cheered as they watched a large touring bus roll down Wilson Road and turn toward them.  “BENGALS! BENGALS! BENGALS!”  When the door to the bus opened and two dozen NFL football players from the Cincinnati Bengals filed out, the rowdy crowd erupted.  Although the last of a three-stop tour at the installation, few would argue it was the most magical for the young athletes who anticipated rubbing elbows with giants.  The day started quite a bit quieter for the players when they arrived at the Training Support Center. The plan was for them to split into two teams: one to experience an Army mobile recruiting trailer, the other to witness military working dogs in action.  Called the Army STEM Asset Exhibit trailer, players learned how the Army pursues many avenues that help humanity.  During the working dog demonstration, Staff Sgt. Bret Ashabranner, senior enlisted leader of the kennels, had one of his Soldiers don a Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes jersey and run from a working dog as if he was a fleeing suspect. The players laughed.  “They are going to witness a little of our day-to-day work: how we do our training, how we do our patrols,” said Ashabranner. “Maybe we’ll get them to experience a little bit of it as well.”  Bengals running back Chris Evans agreed to experience it, volunteering to be attacked by K9 working dog Akaba during the demonstration. His teammates videotaped the experience and laughed as he was quickly tackled by the dog.  “I really liked this; I felt like it’s the closest you’ll get to a live game,” said Evans. “I enjoy that rush I get when somebody is trying to attack me.”  The players traveled to Pells Range next to try their hand at qualifying with an M4 carbine rifle. The qualification also afforded them a little bit of inhouse competition.  Before the qualification, the Bengals met with members of 373rd Quartermaster Battalion – a petroleum Reserve unit – who happened to be training at the range at the time. The unit is from Jeffersonville, Indiana.  During the first firing order, rookie halfback Jacob Saylors knocked down the most targets, hitting them at different distances including at the furthest distance of 300 meters. He admitted afterward that he knew “a little bit” of how to handle a rifle.  “I have quite a bit of experience,” said Saylors. “I’m from Tennessee and every holiday my family shoots guns. Everybody in the family has rifles and pistols.”  Halfback Calvin Tyler Jr., who ended up having the highest score of the day, also admitted he had fired rifles before.  “This is nothing new to me,” Tyler said. “I’ve never been on a range like this before, so I messed up. I was trying to hit the farthest targets; I wasn’t focused on the ones up close.”  From Beaumont, Texas, Tyler said he grew up hunting in the woods with his grandfather from the age of 10.  “We’d go hog hunting, deer hunting,” said Tyler. “Whatever it was, we hunted it.”  Cincinnati Bengals Halfback Calvin Tyler Jr., fires an M4 Carbine rifle at Fort Knox's Pells Range on May 19, 2023. Tyler scored a 19 on marksmanship qualification - the highest score on the team.

After coming off the firing line, he said he was shocked at how difficult it was to shoot accurately.  “I’ve never done anything like this. It’s crazy to see how these guys do this every day. It takes way more skill than people think,” said Maxwell. “People watching football think, ‘I could do that.’ Playing shooter video games, I’ve said the same thing: ‘That doesn’t look too hard.’  “When you come out here, it takes a lot of skill to keep the gun focused, and the aim right, keeping the small laser on it – the laser looks way bigger in real life.”  Not one to let either player get too cocky, range officer Sgt. Maj. Brian McDearmond laughed and told them neither had actually qualified. Out of a total possible score of 40, Maxwell shot 17, Saylors shot an 18, and Tyler shot a 19.  “This is a great opportunity for our Soldiers to represent the Army and give these guys a little taste of it. There’s nothing more fun than shooting rifles,” said McDearmond. “We have some people from the Cincinnati area, so there are a lot of fans among us.  “And considering that these players didn’t get the chance to zero the rifles, some of them did quite well; I even told one guy he could be a sniper.”  One hundred Fort Knox military children welcome Bengals players to the Skills and Drills Clinic portion of the visit on May 19, 2023.

(Photo by Jeff Antenore, Contributing Photographer)  Pacifica erupted for seven runs in the fifth inning and added four in the sixth to stun top-seeded Norco 15-9 in front of an overflow crowd at Deanna Manning Stadium.  The Mariners (23-8) sealed their Orange County-record eighth section title, and ended the highest scoring section final in history, with a strikeout by Brynne Nally. The junior jumped into the arms of catcher Catherine Benitez in an emotional celebration.  Pacifica finished second in the Empire League but peaked in the postseason. The Mariners rallied to edge La Mirada in the first round and upset of No. 2 seed Los Alamitos in the quarterfinals.  “It was a roller coaster of a season,” junior left fielder Delaina Ma’ae said. “But we showed that we can persevere through any hardships that come our way. We can go through anything and still bounce back, no matter what.  “I’m just very proud of our girls because of how much we sacrifice to get here and it all paid off.”  “Because of that adversity,” Pacifica coach Tony Arduino said, “that’s exactly why we’re CIF champions.”  Pacifica, ranked 10th in the final Division 1 poll, overcame a 5-2 deficit against Norco (28-4) by scoring seven runs in the fifth to take a 9-5. The rally brought the Pacifica crowd to its feet for most of the inning.  The Mariners received contributions up and down the lineup as they sent 11 batters to plate and loaded the bases six times with one out.  Ma’ae tied the score at 5-5 with a two-run, bases-loaded single. Kayli Counts, a junior center fielder, followed two batters later with the go-ahead single to right with the bases load.  It was the third straight playoff game that Counts delivered the go-ahead hit.  The Mariners added to their lead in the fifth with a RBI fielder’s choice by Benitez, a run-scoring single by right fielder Michaela Meza and a sacrifice fly by senior third baseman Liz Sigala.  Meza, a sophomore right fielder, had two hits in the fifth inning and finished 2 for 4.  “What we try to do on offense is string the at-bats together,” Arduino said, “and that’s exactly what they did in that fifth inning.”  Junior first baseman Annika Sogsti highlighted the four-run sixth inning with a bases-loaded triple to right to extend the lead to 12-7. Counts followed with a run-scoring single to make it 13-7.  Sogsti and Ma’ae each had three hits and combined to drive in seven runs. The Mariners finished with 14 hits against three pitchers for Norco.  Shortstop Kaniya Bragg settled the Pacifica defense in the sixth by recording all three outs, including a slick grab of a line drive. The junior also went 1 for 2 with two walks and scored three times.  “She’s the heart and soul of our defense,” Arduino said of Bragg.  Nally allowed nine runs — seven earned — on nine hits but kept the Mariners in the game. She also had a RBI double in the seventh.  And in the end, the team that some doubted in the Empire League overcame its final hurdle and joined the legacy of champions at Pacifica.  The team’s sendoff from school Friday included a video, produced by parents, that featured messages from several former standouts at Pacifica.  “There were tears in that room,” Arduino said. “That was the moment we said, ‘We’re not just doing this for us. We’re doing it for all the alumni. We’re doing it for the name Pacifica softball’ … and they carried it out today.”  “When I saw that movie, I teared up a little bit but it also helped me lock in for the game,” Ma’ae said. “I’m doing this not only for myself but I’m doing it for everybody who ever went to Pacifica, and it’s so nice to bring another title home.”  The Mariners have elected not to play the CIF SoCal Regional.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvcGFjaWZpY2Etc29mdGJhbGwtb3ZlcnBvd2Vycy1ub3Jjby10by13aW4taGlnaC1zY29yaW5nLWNpZi1zcy1kaXZpc2lvbi0xLWZpbmFs0gF5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9wYWNpZmljYS1zb2Z0YmFsbC1vdmVycG93ZXJzLW5vcmNvLXRvLXdpbi1oaWdoLXNjb3JpbmctY2lmLXNzLWRpdmlzaW9uLTEtZmluYWwvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-08-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T13:00:00","Greece has been producing wine for longer even than Italy, though you’d hardly think so, considering its continued absence from most of our supermarket shelves. Mind you, that could soon be about to change due in no small part to the growing popularity of what has become Greece’s signature white grape, assyrtiko. It first took off on the island of Santorini, but the grape is now being planted all over the country, in areas such as the Atalanti Valley in Central Greece and in Macedonia. Happily, it’s a brilliant pairing with all things Greek, including the ubiquitous Greek salad, and goes equally well with seafood from anywhere.  That’s the good news. The bad news is that assyrtiko has got progressively more expensive in recent years, especially examples from Santorini itself, where the growing conditions are exceptionally challenging, from the volcanic soil (the island was ripped apart by a devastating eruption back in 1600BC) to the lack of rain: Santorini gets a fraction of the mainland’s rainfall and instead relies on the moisture from the heavy mist that falls nightly over the island. It’s also subject to violent winds, which accounts for the unique way the vines are trained, coiled around like a woven basket. While the stems are cut back from time to time, the root systems can date back hundreds of years: “When we say old vines here, we don’t mean 40 years old,” explains Yiannis Paraskevopoulous of Gaia Wines. “We mean 400.”  The island’s vines are also widely spaced out due to the lack of nutrients in the soil, which contributes to exceptionally low yields and to the level of concentration and intensity that makes its wines so unique. As if that were not enough, the land available has been progressively swallowed up for development, to satisfy the demands of a booming tourist industry. No wonder grape prices now fetch €5 a kilo, compared with 85 cents back in 2010.  Most Santorini assyrtikos you’ll come across are unoaked, which generally best expresses their character, but some, such as Gaia’s Wild Ferment in today’s pick, have a proportion that is aged in oak and clay spheres. The grape is also used to make a relatively low-alcohol but intensely sweet dessert wine called vinsanto.  All of which raises a question: shouldn’t you just buy cheaper versions from elsewhere in Greece, then? Well, they’re good, but they really aren’t as good as assyrtiko from Santorini. The best parallel I can think of, from both a quality and price point of view, is chablis – which, yes, is chardonnay, but it’s just not like chardonnay from anywhere else. And, just like chablis, the best assyrtikos are very serious wines indeed, and have a real capacity to age. If you can hang on to them for that long, that is.  Five assyrtikos that are worth a try  Aldi Athlon Assyrtiko 2022 £7.99, 12%. Fresh, zesty, lemony and (mercifully) affordable: a good first-timer’s assyrtiko.  Kir-Yianni Assyrtiko The North 2021 £15.99 (or £11.99 if you buy any 12), Laithwaites, Averys, 13.5%. A richer, more rounded, tropical-fruited style that you’ll like if you’re into Kiwi sauvignon blanc.  The Society’s Exhibition Santorini Assyrtiko 2021 £17.50 The Wine Society, 13%. Pure, saline and thrilling, with a long, intense aftertaste. Drink with anything fishy– especially grilled squid.  Gaia Wild Ferment Assyrtiko 2022 £36.28 Great Wines Direct, £36.50 Fortnum & Mason, 13.5%. A gorgeous, sexy, creamy, slightly smoky white that will easily age for four or five years. A real splurge, but 100% worth it.  Domaine Hatzimichalis Assyrtiko Sauvignon Blanc 2021 £20 Oxford Wine Co, 13.5%. Intriguing Atalanti Valley blend that layers citrus on citrus, almost like preserved lemon.

"eruption","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T18:04:52","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The executive committee of Minnesota’s Democratic Farmer Labor Party gave initial approval on Thursday to bylaws that would permanently ban anyone who engages in or incites acts of violence from participating in party activities, after a weekend endorsing convention for a Minneapolis City Council seat erupted in chaos.  The executive committee also agreed Thursday that if those bylaws receive final approval from the DFL State Central Committee, the candidate whose supporters are accused of instigating the Saturday melee will be permanently disqualified from seeking and receiving the party’s endorsement.  Ken Martin, chair of the state Democratic Party organization, called the melee that erupted Saturday night “unacceptable.” The DFL is an affiliate of the state Democratic Party.  Video circulating on social media shows that the disturbance began after supporters of incumbent Aisha Chughtai took the stage to seek delegates’ backing for the Ward 10 City Council seat. That sparked an uproar among backers of her challenger, Nasri Warsame. Some jumped on stage, shouting, banging on tables and waving signs. At least two people were injured and the convention broke up with no endorsement.  Martin said on Twitter that it was “clear that the conflict was instigated” by Warsame supporters. He continued to place the blame on some of Warsame’s supporters on Thursday.  Martin said some mistakes were made, but “none of those mistakes, big or small. justify a few bad actors from the Warsame campaign taking things into their own hands and inciting, encouraging and participating in violence against other DFL participants.”  With unanimous votes, the executive committee approved two bylaws that would essentially ban individuals who have “engaged in, incited or consciously condoned physical assault, threats of violence, or violent acts” from party activities.  The first would immediately and permanently disqualify an individual from seeking the party’s endorsement if they or their campaign supporters engage in such acts. The second would permanently ban an individual who carried out such acts from any elected or appointed position within the party, including serving as a delegate or alternate to a convention.  Pending final approval of those bylaws, the executive committee said Warsame would be permanently disqualified from seeking and receiving DFL endorsement or letters of support for any future office. Martin clarified that this does not mean Warsame can’t run for office. But if he does, he won’t get backing from the DLF Party.  “Disagreements over how a convention was run is not an excuse for violence. Not understanding the convention process is not an excuse for violence,” Martin said. He later added, “The reality is, if we don’t act, this will just embolden people in the future to use this as a tactic to essentially force conventions to adjourn.”  Warsame did not immediately reply Thursday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.  Warsame and Chughtai are Democrats in an overwhelmingly Democratic city when campaigns for party backing are often heated. Warsame, a political newcomer, is a Somali immigrant.  Chughtai is a longtime activist who managed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s 2018 campaign. She is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants and has support from some prominent Somali American politicians, including Omar and state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, and other Muslims, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.  Chughtai has endorsements from a long list of progressive and labor groups, including the Democratic Socialists of America. Warsame has campaigned on a law-and-order message.  Warsame said at a news conference Wednesday: “I do not condone violence. I do not condone intimidation or harassment of any sort.” Before Thursday’s closed-door session, Warsame’s campaign manager, Abshir Omar, told the executive committee that he supports Martin’s message condemning the violence, but that he was disheartened by statements that blamed Warsame supporters, saying party officials never contacted the campaign to get their side of the story.  Samuel Doten, who chaired Saturday’s convention, told the committee that the chaos unfolded due to the actions of about five to 10 people, and that it was not representative of all of Warsame’s supporters. He urged the committee to avoid disenfranchising the Somali community from participating in the process.  Chughtai released a statement on Wednesday saying the video does not match the Warsame campaign’s version of events.  “Campaigns that are winning and have the support of the people don’t violently disrupt the process,” she said. “As a campaign and as a movement, we’re on the path to a safer, more just Minneapolis and we look forward to continuing to share that vision with the people of Ward 10.”  ___  Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Download the app.  Einer Rubio (Movistar) won a three-way climbing duel Friday when he outsprinted Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) and Jefferson Cepeda (EF Education EasyPost) on the Crans-Montana summit finish of the Giro d’Italia.  Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) retained his pink jersey with no losses to his closest rivals after the GC group hit a deadlock on a stage that was shortened to just 75km when riders invoked the extreme weather protocol.  Ineos Grenadiers controlled the bunch all day and riders like Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) and João Almeida (UAE Emirates) didn’t even try to move in a summit finish that pointed direct into a headwind.  “The way the wind was at the end it made it hard for attacks,” Thomas said at the finish.  “I was waiting for some big attacks but I think Primož was probably happy to leave me in the jersey for a few more days and let us control the race and bide his time for the final week.”  Roglič remains two seconds back, with Almeida at 22 seconds.  “The headwind meant if someone was sitting in the wheel it was a lot easier,” Jumbo-Visma workhorse Rohan Dennis said. “If ‘G’ or Primož or anybody attacked, sitting on, you were saving so much energy. So the GC was sort of nullified.”  The only GC action was with Hugh Carthy (EF Education EasyPost) snatching six seconds in the final of the Crans-Montana summit to move up to 11th.  Pinot’s all-attacking antics weren’t rewarded with victory but did vault him up the classification from 15th to 10th.  From 200km … to 75km  There was drama before the stage even started Friday.  With more foul weather on the forecast and three huge summits on the menu, the peloton took a stand.  Meetings Thursday night and ahead of the stage Friday morning between the CPA riders’ group and race organizers RCS resulted in the three-climb, 200km monster being cut to a spicey two-climb 75km parcours.

Pinot, Cepeda throw haymakers, Rubio picks his moment  Pinot and Cepeda threw haymakers on the Crans-Montana.  The new route meant the race pointed uphill from the moment the flag dropped.  The race exploded all over the 15km, 8.6 percent Croix de Coeur after the peloton emerged out of three-hour long transfer and a hasty warm-up routine.  A heavy hitter break of seven emerged at the front after around 10km and split further up what was touted one of the hardest climbs of the race.  Pinot, Rubio, Cepeda, Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) and Valentin Paret Peintre (Ag2r Citröen) got away over the Croix de Coeur summit and held a decent gap down the gnarled, technical descent into the valley.  Pinot started the stage less than five minutes back on GC and so Ineos Grenadiers kept the escape on a leash.  The fivesome hit the 13km Crans-Montana summit finish with three minutes of a gap, and Pinot soon opened up an attacking onslaught.  The Frenchman attacked more than a half-dozen times in the bottom half of the Crans Montana climb but was unable to shake Cepeda and Rubio out of the frame.  Cepeda responded 5km from the line with his own flurry of acceleration but also couldn’t get room in what was a true climbing prize-fight.  The victory was only decided in the final kilometer.  After keeping a lid on his legs all through the climb, Rubio responded to a huge 400-meter sprint by Cepeda that Pinot couldn’t counter, leaving the Colombian climber to rip to his second win of the season.  “This is the great day I’ve been looking for for so long. I’ve worked so hard preparing for this Giro. The weather was so hard for me to cope with, the rain really affected me yesterday,” he said. “But I knew I had to keep trying, seeking my opportunity, and I had another one today.”  Headwind neutralizes GC action  Ineos controlled, their rivals waited. (Photo: LUCA BETTINI/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)  Further down the mountain, Cepeda’s teammate Hugh Carthy attacked out of the GC group around 5km from the line.  Meanwhile, the Brit’s classification rival Jack Haig (Bahrain-Victorious) went backward and lost more than three minutes after the Aussie was caught up in a crash Thursday.  The only other GC action came when Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Victorious) accelerated in the final kilometer to open a small flurry of attacks that didn’t result in any splits.  Roglič, Almeida, and Thomas all finished in each other’s wheels in a stage that was reduced to a statemate.  Racing resumes with Saturday with a stage that could suit any of the sprinters that can survive the day’s early 2,000m Cat.1 climb before the all-flat final 100+ km.

It's not your average geyser since it's partially human-made. It's called a ""soda pop geyser"" because it erupts the same way a soda would shoot out if you shook a soda bottle and then opened the lid.  Tom Chidsey, a retired oil and gas specialist with the Utah Geological Survey, spoke with FOX 13 News about the field trips he's taken groups on down to the geyser.  He explained how it's much different than geysers like Old Faithful and others that draw visitors to Yellowstone National Park.  ""Old Faithful is a naturally-occurring geyser and it's hot water. This geyser was the result of a well attempting to find oil and gas back in the 1930s, and it's cold water,"" Chidsey said. ""And the other thing is it's loaded with carbon dioxide gas, which is not like, you know, the geysers that you would see in Yellowstone.""  He says the best chance of being able to see the geyser in action would be to camp out next to it. It's about 10 minutes outside of Green River — but it is irregular in timing and size, so you never know what you're going to see, if you see anything.  When it does erupt, it can last anywhere between three minutes to 50 minutes. It can get up to 40-80 feet, but sometimes it's only about three feet. Based on some studies, it can be spaced out between 17 and 27 hours.

Analysis of the remains has identified at least eight chickens, a goose, a turtle dove, a pig, and two clams. Some of the meat would have been eaten by the priests of the Egyptian cult, while the rest would have been placed on the floor as an offering to the goddess, who was sometimes portrayed with bird wings. Birds are thought to have been central to the Isis cult and bird sacrifice a part of its rituals. “The ritual…was likely performed by three priests of Isis in a single day, possibly to atone for renovations that had made the temple slightly smaller,” said Chiara Corbino of Italy’s Institute of Heritage Science. The renovations appear to have occurred after an earthquake damaged the temple in A.D. 62, so the banquet was likely held sometime between A.D. 62 and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of the city in A.D. 79, Corbino concluded.

This week’s contribution is from Wendy Stovall, volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and deputy scientist-in-charge of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.  Biscuit Basin is located 3 kilometers (2 miles) northwest of Old Faithful Village on the western side of the Grand Loop Road. The basin is within the Yellowstone Caldera and hosts numerous hot pools and geysers. One of the most famous features is a gradationally deepening, blue-colored hot spring named Sapphire Pool. The pool is an alkaline-chloride hot spring with water that’s constantly about 200 degrees (93 Celsius), which is near the boiling point for the pool’s elevation (7,200 feet, 2,195 meters).  Before 1959, Sapphire Pool erupted several times per hour, but never more than a few feet (about one meter) high. The pool was a destination for visitors, not just for its crystal-clear blue water and spouting eruptions, but because it was surrounded by hundreds of unusual knobby features dubbed “biscuits.” These features formed as hot silica-rich water washed outward from the pool during geysering events. As the waters cooled and evaporated, silica deposited into layers that eventually built up the silicious geyserite mounds. These biscuit-shaped features at Sapphire Pool became the namesake for Biscuit Basin. Today, the biscuit batches are few and far between, with only a few scone-shaped mounds on the southern rim of Sapphire Pool. So, where did they go?  The 1959 magnitude 7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake epicenter was about 25 miles from Yellowstone National Park’s large geyser basins on the Firehole River. The energy released was so intense that it jarred the volcano’s hydrothermal systems, causing hundreds of geyser eruptions in the following days. Many thermal features in Yellowstone changed behavior entirely — new thermal areas cropped up, springs that never erupted suddenly began erupting, and some thermal features shut down entirely.  Sapphire Pool was one of the thermal features that changed dramatically. Major eruptions grew in intensity and became more spaced out in time. About four days after the earthquake, Sapphire Pool began erupting water jets that reached 150 feet (45 meters) high and 500 feet (150 meters) wide. Episodes of major geysering were followed by steady boiling in the pool. The power of the eruptions tore away layers of sinter that surrounded the rim and destroyed the biscuit-like formations. The force of water erupting and flowing away from the vent washed the sinter fragments 60 to 100 feet (18 to 30 meters) away and eventually into the Firehole River. The water became murky and lost its sapphire-colored hue. These large eruptions continued through 1961, and the pool’s diameter nearly doubled as major eruptions broke the rim. During this three-year phase of massive geysering, a ring of broken geyserite shards about 3 feet (1 meter) high formed around Sapphire Pool. It has since eroded away.  Geyser eruptions at Sapphire Pool continued with decreasing intensity and frequency for many years. In 1968, true geyser activity ceased, and by 1971 the murky water cleared, giving way to the deep blue color once again. Sapphire Pool last erupted in 1991, though the crystal-clear water still boils and surges; however, it does not have minor geyser activity like it did before 1959. The earthquake clearly had a marked impact to the plumbing system beneath Sapphire Pool.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2JpbGxpbmdzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vb3V0ZG9vcnMvd2h5LXllbGxvd3N0b25lcy1mYW1vdXMtYmlzY3VpdHMtZGlzYXBwZWFyZWQvYXJ0aWNsZV81NjNmNTBjNC1mNjUxLTExZWQtOGRhMC1hM2E5ZTBjMDRjZjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Monday, I joined the Sheriff and several deputies in Washington, D.C. for the 42nd Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol. This event honored 443 law enforcement officers who had lost their lives in service to their communities. Pierce County Deputies Dom Calata and Daryl Shuey were among those being memorialized.  Our deputies were representing the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department as well as the larger Pierce County law enforcement family. I was there bearing witness on behalf of the rest of our County colleagues and all the residents of our County. We remembered Dom and Daryl and stood by and supported their families. It was powerful and important – and I hope Pierce County never has cause to be there again.  At the same time 70 miles to the north, another group of County co-workers and community members were in Emmitsburg, Maryland at the FEMA National Emergency Management Institute. Their assignment? To simulate a major volcano eruption and lahar from Mount Rainier – and plan our response.  While I hope this unthinkable disaster never befalls our community, I am thankful our team is preparing. And the work they do together for the exercise will also help us confront a variety of other potential emergencies. As a reminder, yesterday was the 43rd anniversary of the eruption of Mount St. Helens.  On a much, much lighter note, our local weather has been spectacular – perfect for celebrating Bike Month in Pierce County.

They said Tofua volcano is at normal conditions with the magma lava exposed to the earth’s surface from inside the lofia volcanic cone. “This means that the lava has travelled 100km in depth from deep inside the oceanic crust but it will be another 100 years or more before the full magma builds up more gas and generates eruptive conditions.”  “Tofua Island is safe and there are farmers who live there. If there are any abnormal conditions or acitivities from the volcano, they can contact us and if there is any warning of any imminent danger, it will be issued from the Ministry. People also need to be aware that the only information that is true and correct about our volcanoes is that issued by our Ministry,” stated TGS.  Documentary  The statement was made in response to information shown in a documentary called 'Hidden Volcano Abyss: Behind Tonga’s Massive Eruption' that was released on Youtube on 10 May. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2R5IViBclQ  The documentary was produced by the WGBH Educational Foundation and released by PBS | Nova and Lion Television Ltd. It reports on the eruption of Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha'apai in January 2022 and the findings of an expedition by visiting scientists and the Tonga Geological Service to Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai, Fonuafo’ou and Tofua volcanoes in October 2022.  Volcanologist Shane Cronin comments in the documentary that Tofua has a magma chamber close to the surface.  The narrator says that Tofua had big eruptions 1200, 800 and 400 years ago. “The pattern suggests that Tofua should erupt again and soon.”  The scientists reported that the levels of sulphur dioxide had risen and that magma had welled up in the crater. “It looks as though Tofua is entering a new phase of activity,” said Shane.  Resilience  Chief TGS Geologist, Taaniela Kula, accompanied the expedition to the three volcanoes, and made the point that during the HTHH eruption Tongans had done the right thing at the right time and miraculously few lives were lost.  “I think knowledge will increase the resilience of Tonga and the world,” he said.  The documentary compiled some excellent drone video footage from the TGS of the December and January 14 eruptions of HTHH and their difficult expedition to Tofua.  It also documents local experiences on the day of the eruption, including the story of local fisherman Bronco Sugar and his crew who survived the HTHH tsunami, Moana Paea who escaped from Ha'atafu Beach and broadcaster Marian Kupu who surveyed the destruction.  Evidence of immense waves across the Hihifo peninsula during the event of 15 January 2022 is investigated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbWF0YW5naXRvbmdhLnRvLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvYWN0aXZpdHktdG9mdWEtdm9sY2Fuby1ub3JtYWwtc2F5cy10b25nYS1nZW9sb2dpY2FsLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Charity MapAction works alongside the United Nations helping guide the response to some the biggest disasters over the past two decades – but this weekend their focus is on a volcano simulation in Scotland.  The peaceful island was abuzz with action as the Field Studies Council outside of Millport became the base of an emergency operation centre.  READ MORE: Which Scottish island is preparing for a 'major volcanic eruption'?  Chief Executive of MapAction Liz Hughes (Image: Colin Mearns)  Chief executive Liz Hughes said: “We are all going to face worse disasters in the next 15 years and that is the key headwind for all of us.  “It’s not going to get better however much we try. All the preparation we can do, all the training we can do, all the collaboration we can do is really important.”  A volcano eruption on Arran, dubbed the island of Ranar for the exercise, saw a cloud of ash spread across to the neighbouring peninsula – volunteers were told as part of the ‘Gilded Unicorn’ exercise.  Their task, much like it is when they respond to major disasters such as the recent earthquake in Turkey, is to map key information about the eruption and help emergency teams save lives.  MapAction will often be the first reference point for disaster relief organisations looking to help people on the ground.  Ms Hughes said: “I joined the organisation because I have been on the other side where you are trying to run response programmes in other countries and need information to do that.  “I have been in other places where I didn’t know the geography, didn’t know the language or even the alphabet and you have to decide how to provide aid.”  She added: “Maps tell a story; we are telling people what’s occurred.  “MapAction is providing insights, analysis and information that will help responders understand who is worst affected.”  For the sake of the exercise, many regions will revert to their historic names, whether Celtic, Latin or Anglo-Saxon, to help create a ‘country’ which is suitable for the areas where volunteers may be deployed in the future. (Image: Colin Mearns)  More than 70 volunteers, partners and staff members travelled to Cumbrae for the three-day simulation. The volunteers are all highly-skilled professionals trained in an array of tools needed by MapAction including data science and geographic information system (GIS).  Emerson Tan, from Bristol, said the charity has become an “essential” part of global emergency response over the 18-years he has worked with them.  The volunteer said: “There is not a major disaster in the last 20-odd years that the organisation has not been to.  “MapAction has gone from being a novelty into something that is considered essential, it is part of the system furniture.”  READ MORE: 'Suicide driving' on NC500 by 30-strong car tour sparks local anger  Emerson Tan with some of the maps created by volunteers (Image: Colin Mearns)  Without hours of mapping and analysis carried out by volunteers at disasters ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis, huge pockets of unmapped populations could go “unaddressed”, he added.  Another long-term volunteer Andrew Kesterton, originally from Scotland, said: “I think for a lot of us we have been doing this longer than our day job. You change your day job but we stick around for this.”  Ms Hughes attributed the dedication of the volunteers to three factors: a shared interest in the “geekery” of mapping, the “family feel” of the small organisation and importantly that they are all “passionate humanitarians”.  Felicity Cross, who lives in West Lothian, recently returned to deployments, travelling to Turkey in February while still juggling a full-time job and three children.  “I can see the difference that we can make,” she said.  “I have been in the field a few times and I have seen genuinely how we can help and how we have a role to play. I think there is a gap there and we can fill it.”  However, training is equally important as the work MapAction does in the midst of a disaster.  As well as training exercises for their own volunteers, the charity also helps train key bodies in countries across the globe.  Renee Babb, GIS & Remote Sensing Specialist (Image: Colin Mearns)  READ MORE: Islanders to stage protest over 'blight on beauty spot' solar farm  Renée Babb, a GIS specialist for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), travelled to Scotland to watch the training.  “In the past MapAction has been very integral to our emergency response,” she said. “The way they bring the mapping and information management to the table to help us visualise how an impact can be responded to.”  A training session on mapping flooding held in Guyana, meant that a year later country needed “minimal support” to respond to a flooding impacting seven of its ten regions.  Now in turn Ms Babb is helping train MapAction’s volunteers while also planning to take “ideas born out of this simulation exercise and try to implement them in the Caribbean”.  Ms Hughes emphasised that their trainings are an “exchange of ideas and experiences” – equally learning from the countries they travel to.  The Cumbrae simulation, funded by USAID’s Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs, will continue until Sunday helping the volunteers become better equipped for the disasters of tomorrow.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHNjb3RsYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIzNTM1NjI2LmlzbGUtY3VtYnJhZS1iZWNvbWVzLXRyYWluaW5nLWdyb3VuZC1kaXNhc3Rlci1yZXNwb25zZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The UC Classics alumna is studying the ancient city of Petra in Jordan as a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow.  Wenner said what we learn about ancient civilizations can have surprising relevance for modern life. It’s said that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.  “History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes,” Wenner said.  “Not everything we’re experiencing is exactly the same, but there are threads that come through. Figuring out what they are and naming them is a really important part of academia as a whole and for archaeology, in particular.”  Wenner in the past worked with UC Classics Professor Steven Ellis at the Italian city of Pompeii, which was entombed in ash by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.  “It is a very interesting site because of how it was destroyed,” Wenner said. “Pompeii has a history centuries long. It’s endured so many changes and different configurations. We’re only now starting to grapple with it.”  Ellis and his students use tools such as photogrammetry to piece together three-dimensional computer models from photos or drawings, allowing researchers to interpret the scale and beauty of ancient structures and artifacts in new ways.  “We’re getting a comprehensive understanding of the city beyond that last moment,” Wenner said. “Pompeii was more than just a site of destruction and terror. It was a city where people lived. We’re trying to understand how they negotiated social and economic relationships and how those relations changed over time.”  Ellis said UC has a robust Classics program steeped in history, languages and cultures.  “One of the great joys of studying a degree like Classics is learning different skills and pulling together data from an ancient world where we only have minute traces of evidence,” Ellis said. “How do we pull all of that together and weave it into a cohesive story?”  The department has a storied history dating back to Carl Blegen’s groundbreaking work at Troy and ancient Greece in the 1930s and ’40s. More recently, UC Classics Professor Jack Davis and senior research associate Sharon Stocker made startling discoveries of Bronze Age tombs in Greece, including that of the Griffin Warrior, that were named Top 10 discoveries of the decade by Archaeology magazine.  “Classics is really treated comprehensively here at UC,” Wenner said. “You learn about the ancient languages and get deep research in history as well as archaeology. There is a lot of breadth in what you can do here.”  Wenner also conducted fieldwork with Ellis at Tharros, an ancient Roman city on the coast of Sardinia. The city was built with access to twin harbors that allowed for landings protected from the wind on two sides of the island.  At Tharros, UC students are using state-of-the-art computer technology to envision ancient life in Sardinia.  “Archaeology is a destructive field. We destroy our data as we collect it,” Wenner said.  But with digital modeling, researchers can recreate ancient worlds in vivid detail.  “It takes the information we gather and produces reconstructions of the buildings we’re excavating or the temples or the flora — there are so many things we can do to conceptualize the ancient world,” she said.  Now Wenner is working in southern Jordan at the ancient city of Petra, which was featured in the finale of “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”  “There’s this cavernous path with the walls of the mountains on either side that leads to an opening with this grand tomb complex built at the end of the first century,” she said. “It’s a monumental building. It was meant to impress.”  She is studying the Nabataean civilization that lived here between the second and fourth centuries. The UNESCO world heritage site is known as the Nabataean City of the Dead.  Some archaeologists believe bodies were left exposed atop ceremonial altars at Petra for their bones to be stripped by vultures and bleached by the sun in practices that continue today in other parts of the world.  “The Nabataeans had an interesting relationship with the dead. The tombs were left open so more interments could happen over time,” she said. “And people interacted with their dead, which is why people thought of it as a city of the dead. But it was really an active city.”  Researchers say families would share meals in the company of their dead ancestors and leave tokens of affection.  “It’s interesting how those conventions came about and how they were understood,” she said.  While Indiana Jones makes archaeology seem romantic, Wenner said it’s mostly hard work.  “I spend half of my time in a basement,” she said.  Wenner said she has many career options ahead of her. She could teach or work in museums or the humanities.  “Classical archaeology is where my home is. It’s where I feel I’m most comfortable,” she said.  Wenner earned a bachelor’s degree in anthropology and worked as a market analyst before getting her master’s degree and coming to UC to pursue a doctorate.  “I had a bit of a circuitous route. But honestly the experimentation you get to do in college gives you a chance to figure out what you like and take as many classes as you can,” she said.  “So my advice to other students is don’t be too tied to your major. Whatever is stamped on your diploma is not the end-all and be-all of what you can become.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTg5OTQz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As he strolled into the summit venue in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday afternoon, a beaming al-Assad extended his arms to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who grabbed them both and kissed Assad once on each cheek.  Al-Assad has been welcomed back into the Arab League after more than a decade of isolation. Friday was the first time he was invite to the summit since his country’s suspension from the blog following the eruption of war in Syria in 2011.  As leaders walked into the main hall, al-Assad exchanged greetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, among others.  During his speech, al-Assad said the summit was a “historic opportunity” to address crises across the region.  “I hope that it marks the beginning of a new phase of Arab action for solidarity among us, for peace in our region, development and prosperity instead of war and destruction,” al-Assad told summit attendees.  Analysts said Syria’s readmission to the 22-member Arab League is a strong signal that al-Assad’s isolation is ending, reflecting an important shift in how regional actors view the reality of his government’s survival, in ways that are at odds with the West.  Syria’s Arab League membership was revoked after al-Assad ordered a crackdown on protesters in March 2011 that spiralled the country into a war, which has since killed nearly half a million people and displaced another 23 million.  In Syria’s Azaz, demonstrators chanted “the people want the fall of the regime” as hundreds came out on the streets in protest.  “Syria cannot be represented by Assad the criminal,” read a banner at the protest in the town, which is under the control of pro-Turkish groups. Anti-Assad protests took part in other rebel-held areas, including in the northern city of Afrin where a crowd held up a large flag opposition flag.  “We call on the Arab peoples to put pressure on their governments to go back on the decision [to re-admit Syria] and for Bashar al-Assad to leave,” said Issam Khatib, a lawyer originally from the northern city of Aleppo.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZ2FsbGVyeS8yMDIzLzUvMTkvaW4tcGhvdG9zLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWxlYWRlcnMtZ3JlZXQtc3lyaWFzLWFsLWFzc2FkLWF0LWFyYWItbGVhZ3Vl0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZ2FsbGVyeS8yMDIzLzUvMTkvaW4tcGhvdG9zLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWxlYWRlcnMtZ3JlZXQtc3lyaWFzLWFsLWFzc2FkLWF0LWFyYWItbGVhZ3Vl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The team, led by corresponding author Jae-Hyun Ryou, associate professor of mechanical engineering, was looking for ways to build sensors which could survive where standard electronics would fail — high-pressure petrochemical pipelines from geothermal wells where the temperature reaches over 1,100°F and mafic volcanic lava eruptions which get as hot as 1,650°F. ""Highly sensitive, reliable and durable sensors that can tolerate such extreme environments are necessary for the efficiency, maintenance, and integrity of these applications,"" Ryou explains.  Researchers, including Nam-In Kim (left) and Jae-Hyun Ryou, have developed a pressure sensor that works when others would liquefy. (📷: University of Houston)  The team's work builds on earlier efforts to turn single-crystal gallium nitride films into piezoelectric pressure sensors — the results of which outperformed rival devices but began to lose sensitivity when heated above 660°F. Deciding the design needed a wider bandgap — the minimum energy needed to excite an electron and thus conduct electricity — the team switched to aluminum nitride films instead, and discovered a major improvement in maximum operating temperature.  ""Our plan is to use the sensor in several harsh scenarios,"" Ryou says of the group's real-world testing plans, following lab experiments which included running the sensor inside a high-temperature furnace. ""For example, in nuclear plants for neutron exposure and hydrogen storage to test under high pressure. AlN sensors can operate in neutron-exposed atmospheres and at very high-pressure ranges thanks to its stable material properties.""  The sensor flexes under pressure, using piezoelectrics to report its findings in even extreme scenarios.

Credit: Sergey Shumko of BBSO.  National Science Foundation (NSF) awards five-year grant support for Big Bear Solar Observatory research through the maximum of Solar Cycle 25, when the Sun’s explosive activity is expected to peak.  An New Jersey Institute of Technology research team led by physics professor Wenda Cao at the university’s Center for Solar Terrestrial Research (CSTR) has been awarded a $4.64 million National Science Foundation grant to continue leading explorations of the Sun’s explosive activity at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO).  The grant marks the largest project that the Solar-Terrestrial Research Program under NSF’s Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) supports, extending five more years of baseline funding for all science, instrumentation and education activities at BBSO, located at California’s Big Bear Lake.  The funding supports BBSO research through a key phase of increased activity in the 11-year solar cycle, known as the solar maximum. As more sunspots bubble from the Sun’s surface, sudden releases of energy from the star’s magnetic fields — manifesting as solar flares and coronal mass ejections — are expected to intensify as Solar Cycle 25 reaches its maximum by the summer of 2025.  “Big Bear Solar Observatory and its Goode Solar Telescope are a unique asset to the solar physics community, allowing for uninterrupted solar flare studies important for understanding our Sun and space weather effects,” said Lisa Winter, NSF-AGS program director for Solar-Terrestrial Research and SHINE. “Support for this observatory is especially important as our Sun enters solar maximum.”  BBSO, operated by NJIT-CSTR, has long been at the forefront of solar research as home to the 1.6-meter clear aperture, off-axis Goode Solar Telescope (GST). GST is the world’s second highest-resolution solar telescope and pathfinder to NSF’s 4-meter Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) stationed in Maui, Hawaii, which became the world’s largest solar telescope after breaking first light in 2020.  “This grant is essential to maintain the telescope in operation, continue advanced research at BBSO/CSTR, support the current talented engineering team, and educate next generation of scientists and engineers.” said Wenda Cao, BBSO director and member of NSF’s Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee. “GST was the first facility-class solar telescope built in the U.S. in a generation. Under this grant support, GST will continue to be a major player in high-resolution ground-based observations in the U.S. and worldwide. BBSO will continue playing a crucial and irreplaceable role in science, technology, engineering and education.”  The new grant will enable NJIT-CSTR researchers to continue using GST’s unique imaging capabilities and unapparelled “astronomical seeing” conditions at Big Bear Lake to investigate solar phenomenon as activity on the Sun ramps up. It also promises new GST-DKIST collaborations that could yield unprecedented coverage of solar eruptions as they evolve moment-by-moment.  “The project period covering the maximum of Solar Cycle 25 is an important window to study solar activity, especially solar flares and evolution of solar active regions leading to eruptions,” said Cao, whose team collects a flurry of solar data 24/7 at BBSO that includes measurements of the Sun’s magnetic field, flare energetics in lower solar atmosphere and more, which could potentially offer early warning detection for solar storms back on Earth.  “A notable feature of BBSO is the excellent and stable seeing conditions lasting for hours, which is uniquely required to observe such solar eruptions — key sources of space weather that impact the daily life of humans through effects on communication, transportation, power systems, national defense and space travel.”  Since breaking first light 2009, GST’s observations of the Sun’s surface (photosphere) and lower atmosphere (chromosphere) in visible to near-infrared wavelengths have led to transformative insights into the physics driving solar activity and the nature of the solar atmosphere.  The new grant extends NSF’s previous five-year cycle of funding for BBSO, in which NJIT-CSTR researchers enhanced GST observations with spatial resolution better than 0"".1 to answer fundamental questions over the fine-scale energy release in active solar events, including how energy from the Sun is transferred to the star's outermost atmosphere.  BBSO’s GST and other world-class instruments have played a vital role to the international space science community, including providing observational support to NASA missions such as the Parker Solar Probe among others. In 2021, BBSO further bolstered its resources by adding NSF’s Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) — the most advanced solar telescope for long-term monitoring the “Sun as a whole globe” over the complete solar cycle.  Researchers from 63 universities, observatories and institutes across 21 countries now have access to GST observing time and data, the insights from which have yielded more than 100 peer-reviewed papers since 2018 (including one in Science and six in Nature journals), detailing new discoveries about Earth’s nearest star.  To honor BBSO-driven achievements from the international solar research community, NJIT-CSTR has established the “Goode Solar Telescope Prize.” The inaugural prize will be presented to noted solar researcher Young-Deuk Park at the sixth biannual GST Workshop, hosted at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) in Daejeon from May 23-26.  The new prize has been created “in recognition of the significant contribution of the BBSO partners and outside communities to the facility.” The GST Prize includes a token cash prize of $1000, which will be awarded to “a scientist from around the world for outstanding contributions to BBSO operation, GST science and instrumentation development.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5uaml0LmVkdS9uaml0LXJlc2VhcmNoZXJzLWF3YXJkZWQtNDZtLXVubG9jay1teXN0ZXJpZXMtc29sYXItZXJ1cHRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The event followed a recent warming trend and significant snowmelt.  The slide washed out an 85-foot bridge, damaged the roadway, and severed power to Johnston Ridge Observatory. No one was injured because of the incident and twelve members of the public who were stranded overnight at Johnston Ridge Observatory were safely flown out the following morning.  In coordination with federal agencies, the Washington State Department of Transportation closed the highway to all travelers. Travel along SR 504 remains open with multiple scenic viewpoints up to milepost 43 near the Science and Learning Center at Coldwater.  There is currently no access to Coldwater Lake, the Hummocks Trail, and the Johnston Ridge Observatory. For safety, WSDOT and federal agencies strongly encourage people not to venture beyond the highway closure location due to the severity of the unstable hillside.  The USDA Forest Service is in the process of exploring alternative options for visitors who would like to visit the north side of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument this summer and develop a plan to manage the influx of visitors in a safe manner. Several other visitor centers located along SR 504 remain open to the public, including scenic viewpoints where visitors can see Mount St. Helens and learn about the history, eruption, and recovery of the volcano. As the snow melts and forest service roads open for the season, additional sites on the Monument and surrounding communities will begin to open for visitors to explore.  WSDOT and federal agencies are working together to assess the slide area and develop next steps. Due to continued landslide instability, data collection is being conducted from the air.  WSDOT is scheduled to conduct a fixed wing aircraft LIDAR (Laser Imaging, Detection and Ranging) flight over the area on Friday, May 19 to gather preliminary data, weather permitting. This is an important step in collecting data to help inform when on-site access, cleanup and work can begin.

Hoping to quell a restive society with these executions, the ruling theocracy found itself once again engulfed by protests.  After several months of physical and psychological torture, the clerical regime hanged Saleh Mirhashmi, Majid Kazemi, and Saeed Yaqoubi. They were arrested during the nationwide uprising, which erupted in September following the state murder of Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran.  The three victims were charged with Moharebeh, or “Waging war on God,” based on confessions obtained under torture. While the regime made much fanfare and, in sham trials, accused the trio of murdering several security forces, they were not charged with any degree of murder.  Their death sentences were met with both a domestic and international outcry. The Iranian regime, mainly the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, had planned to execute these protesters almost two weeks ago, in line with the killing spree he has started in the past two months, sending nearly 120 prisoners to the gallows since April 21.  In the past few days, people in several cities across the country, mainly in Isfahan, held protests demanding the release of Majid, Saleh, and Saeed. International organizations and several Western governments condemned the death sentence of the arrested protesters and urged the regime to halt their execution.  Absent a meaningful international reaction, the religious fascism, desperate to quell the restive society through executions and intimidation, hanged Majid, Saleh, and Saeed on May 19 at dawn. A few hours later, protests erupted in a dozen cities.  In Tehran, people expressed their outrage and held protests or chanted slogans from their houses. In several districts of Tehran, including Ekbatan, Tehransar, Shahrziba, Negin Gharb, Tehranpars, Saadat Abad, and Apadana, citizens chanted slogans denouncing Khamenei. They chanted slogans such as: “Death to Khamenei, the killer,” “Death to the republic of execution,” and “Death to Khamenei, damned be Khomeini.”  May 19 – Tehran, #Iran  Locals in the capital's Tehranpars district are protesting this morning's execution in Isfahan's Dastgerd Prison and chanting:  ""Our compatriots haven't died for us to appease [Khamenei]!""#StopExecutionsInIran #قیام_جواب_اعدام pic.twitter.com/HZWcaBmgi9 — People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) (@Mojahedineng) May 19, 2023  In Karaj, west of Tehran, locals marched and chanted anti-regime slogans. In Isfahan, where the uprising arrestees were executed, citizens held nightly protests, chanting slogans against Khamenei.  These reactions, with people holding Khamenei mainly responsible for the killings, indicate the regime’s failure to control the wave of dissent across Iran.

When different tactics, such as promoting pseudo alternatives or bolding false solutions of “civil disobedience,” failed, the recent executions were Khamenei’s last-ditch effort.  The recent executions epitomize Khamenei’s frantic endeavors to stave off the impending collapse of his regime as the protests have metamorphosed into an unyielding democratic revolution. However, society’s resolute response has thwarted his nefarious scheme.  Despite the resounding global condemnation, the recent executions persist unabated under Khamenei’s brutal regime. Words of support, eloquent resolutions, or verbal denouncements are insufficient to halt his relentless slaughter. Tyrants of his ilk comprehend only the language of coercion.  Urging the regime to stop executions is like asking an arsonist to put out the fire. The moment has arrived for Western democracies to tangibly bolster the Iranian people’s revolution by severing all ties with Tehran, closing its embassies, expelling its operatives, and acknowledging the inherent right of the Iranian populace to self-defense. These measures undeniably undermine Khamenei’s oppressive machinery, rendering it feeble in the face of resistance.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5jci1pcmFuLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzL2lyYW4tcHJvdGVzdHMvcHJvdGVzdHMtZXJ1cHQtYWZ0ZXItaXJhbnMtcmVnaW1lLWV4ZWN1dGVzLWFycmVzdGVkLXByb3Rlc3RlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Roman city became a treasure trove for researchers, and even today it continues to reveal its secrets.  But when Italian archaeologists recently uncovered the bodies of two men, they realized that they were killed not by the volcano but by the disaster that immediately preceded it.  “In recent years, we have realized there were violent, powerful seismic events that were happening at the time of the eruption,” says Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of Pompeii Archaeological Park, according to the Associated Press.  Per a statement from Pompeii Archaeological Park, the victims probably died when a building collapsed around them. They were both at least 55.  The relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes is complex. As Wired’s Erik Klemetti wrote in 2015, magma movements can cause several different kinds of earthquakes—but they tend to be small, often passing unnoticed.  The Pompeii earthquake, however, caused devastating damage. The newly discovered skeletons showed signs of bone fracturing, indicating that “the men probably died as a result of multiple injuries sustained as the building they sought refuge in caved,” as the Guardian’s Angela Giuffrida and Jude Dunhill write. Researchers think that one of the men raised an arm to protect himself from the falling stone.  The earthquake likely hit before the eruption began in earnest. Once started, the destruction went on for two days.  Until the recent discovery, human remains hadn’t been found at the site since 2020, when a team uncovered the skeletons of a wealthy man and an enslaved individual at a villa in the city’s outskirts. Researchers think that the two were trying to escape the destruction and managed to evade the initial layer of ash, but were killed by a blast the next day.  Beyond human remains, many other recent discoveries have been made at the site, including several ancient homes. Earlier this year, Vesuvius became the center of a contest offering $1 million to anyone who can invent new ways to use artificial intelligence to decipher scrolls buried in the eruption. Some smaller prizes were issued in April, and the contest will continue through the rest of the year.  Much of Pompeii has not yet been excavated. As technology improves, researchers are able to gain even more insights into the ancient city. For many of them, the scale of the disaster strikes a chord.  “The discovery is very grounding as they are effectively digging up human beings, which is sad,” says Zuchtriegel, per the Guardian. “Human mortality is so fragile.”  Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9zbWFydC1uZXdzL3BvbXBlaWktdmljdGltcy1lYXJ0aHF1YWtlLXZvbGNhbm8tdmVzdXZpdXMtMTgwOTgyMjA1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-09-01","07:15:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:50:14","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s Popocatepetl volcano rumbled to life again this week, belching out towering clouds of ash that forced 11 villages to cancel school sessions.  The residents weren’t the only ones keeping a close eye on the towering peak. Every time there is a sigh, tic or heave in Popocatepetl, there are dozens of scientists, a network of sensors and cameras, and a roomful of powerful equipment watching its every move.  READ MORE: Hawaii volcano eruption isn’t dangerous but offers a spectacular sight  The 17,797-foot (5,426-meter) volcano, known affectionately as “El Popo,” has been spewing toxic fumes, ash and lumps of incandescent rock persistently for almost 30 years, since it awakened from a long slumber in 1994.  The volcano is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, but looms much closer to the eastern fringes of the metropolitan area of 22 million people. The city also faces threats from earthquakes and sinking soil, but the volcano is the most visible potential danger — and the most closely watched. A severe eruption could cut off air traffic, or smother the city in clouds of choking ash.  Ringed around its summit are six cameras, a thermal imaging device and 12 seismological monitoring stations that operate 24 hours a day, all reporting back to an equipment-filled command center in Mexico City.  A total of 13 scientists from a multidisciplinary team take turns staffing the command center around the clock. Being able to warn of an impending ash cloud is key, because people can take precautions. Unlike earthquakes, warning times can be longer for the volcano and in general the peak is more predictable.  On a recent day, researcher Paulino Alonso made the rounds, checking the readings at the command center run by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center, known by its initials as Cenapred. It is a complex task that involves seismographs that measure the volcano’s internal trembling, which could indicate hot rock and gas moving up the vents in the peak.  Monitoring gases in nearby springs and at the peak — and wind patterns that help determine where the ash could be blown — also play a role.  The forces inside are so great that they can temporarily deform the peak, so cameras and sensors must monitor the very shape of the volcano.  How do you explain all of this to 25 million non-experts living within a 62-mile (100-kilometer) radius who have grown so used to living near the volcano?  Authorities came up with the simple idea of a volcano “stoplight” with three colors: green for safety, yellow for alert and red for danger.  For most of the years since the stoplight was introduced, it has been stuck at some stage of “yellow.” The mountain sometimes quiets down, but not for long. It seldom shoots up molten lava: instead it’s more the “explosive” type, showering out hot rocks that tumble down its flanks and emitting bursts of gas and ash.  The center also has monitors in other states; Mexico is a country all too familiar with natural disasters.  For example, Mexico’s earthquake early alert system is also based at the command center. Because the city’s soil is so soft — it was built on a former lake bed — a quake hundreds of miles away on the Pacific coast can cause huge destruction in the capital, as happened in 1985 and 2017.  A system of seismic monitors along the coast sends messages that race faster than the quake’s shock waves. Once the sirens start blaring, it can give Mexico City residents up to half a minute to get to safety, usually on the streets outside.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvd29ybGQvbWV4aWNvcy1wb3BvY2F0ZXBldGwtdm9sY2Fuby10aHJlYXRlbnMtMjItbWlsbGlvbi1wZW9wbGUtYXMtaXQtcnVtYmxlcy1hd2FrZdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvYW1wL3dvcmxkL21leGljb3MtcG9wb2NhdGVwZXRsLXZvbGNhbm8tdGhyZWF0ZW5zLTIyLW1pbGxpb24tcGVvcGxlLWFzLWl0LXJ1bWJsZXMtYXdha2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T09:45:00","The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report, published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Previous research has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon. However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.  Copyright 2023 LiveScience, a Future company.

"eruption","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:00:04","Kenley Jansen got up from his locker in the home clubhouse at Fenway Park on Monday afternoon and announced a request.  “Guys, I need a new hat. This hat stinks. I gave up six runs in it,” the pitcher called out to clubhouse attendants across the room, before punctuating it with a four-letter expletive.  Laughter erupted. Jansen was relaxed, even fresh off blown saves on consecutive days over the weekend. Those two appearances, both against the St. Louis Cardinals, were by far his worst of the season. He was untouchable until last Friday, giving up just one run with 17 strikeouts to three walks in his first 12 games. He had reached another peak at age 35.  “It was the best I’ve ever felt,” Jansen said.  Just two days before the first stumble, he had experienced one of the highlights of his career, becoming just the seventh player in major league history to compile 400 career saves in a 5-2 win over the Atlanta Braves.  Advertisement  After the game, Red Sox designated hitter Justin Turner gathered the team to present a video to the closer.  Former Dodgers teammates Clayton Kershaw, Austin Barnes, Russell Martin, A.J. Ellis, and Eric Gagne appeared to congratulate him, as did former Dodgers manager Joe Torre and pitching coach Rick Honeycutt. So did Turner and Kiké Hernández, Jansen’s teammates in Boston after years together in Los Angeles.  Turner then gave Jansen the lineup card. Hernández presented him with a guitar. The team raised a toast.  “It meant a lot, man,” Jansen said. “Those are the guys that went through that pain, those sad moments and the happiest moment of winning the championship with me” in 2020.  Turner did the math. He’s been on the field for almost 300 of Jansen’s saves. He was there for No. 100, 200 and 300 when they wore Dodger blue. Being his teammate for 400 in their ninth season together offered a chance to reflect.  “To have been on the field for those milestones,” Turner said, “was pretty cool.”  A moment Kenley will never forget. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/BpnD8jZHhr — Red Sox (@RedSox) May 11, 2023  Jansen accumulated his first 350 saves over 12 years with the Dodgers. He evolved from a converted catcher to the best closer in the majors, a fan favorite with his vicious cutter and signature walk-out song. He became synonymous with the franchise’s historic stretch of success since 2013. He hoped he would never leave.  But the business of baseball has a way of snuffing out its romanticism and Jansen instead signed a one-year deal with the Braves. Jansen publicly beamed about the opportunity to play for Atlanta, the team he grew up watching on television in Curacao. Fred McGriff was his favorite player. Andruw Jones, Curacao’s first All-Star, was a hero. And yet the breakup stung. He acknowledged wondering whether a reunion with the Dodgers was possible when he reached free agency again after the season.  “It was hard,” Jansen said. “It was hard for me to be like, ‘Will you be there? Will you be back?’ ”  A return made sense on paper. But the Dodgers didn’t feel the need to have a designated closer. Jansen, meanwhile, was ready to shut the door for good. This time he entered free agency, as he put it, “neutral.” He had moved on, hunting for the best opportunity wherever it was. The Red Sox and their two-year, $32-million offer emerged in early December.  Jansen said Los Angeles always will be his home outside of Curacao. He spent most of the offseason there. His family still lives there year round. But he is content closing that chapter of his professional life.  “It’s a beautiful history that I had there,” Jansen said. “I’ll forever cherish those moments. But I’m OK if I don’t go back again.”  Advertisement  Dodgers Kenley Jansen explains why he signed with the Braves instead of the Dodgers Kenley Jansen grew up rooting for the Atlanta Braves. When they made him an offer and the Dodgers asked him to wait, he decided to go with his boyhood favorite.  Hernández was Jansen’s teammate for six seasons with the Dodgers. He was around to witness Jansen’s best two years — 2016 and 2017 — when his cutter overwhelmed hitters over and over and over again. But he never saw what he saw from Jansen the night the closer reached 400 saves.  Jansen entered in the ninth inning to protect a three-run lead and immediately began pumping 97-mph cutters. Later, with two outs and a runner at second base, he fired another 97-mph cutter to begin a clash with Atlanta’s Travis d’Arnaud. Then a 98-mph cutter. Then another one. Then a 99-mph cutter. Then another one.  Hernández was playing shortstop. Turner was at second base. Neither could believe it.  “I get J.T.’s attention and I’m like, ‘Look at the gun,’ ” Hernández recalled. “And the shock on his face was hysterical. He’s no pup. He’s no kid. And I’ve never seen him throw 99. Then he ended it with a nasty slider. It was cool to see.”  Kenley Jansen smiles as he does a radio interview after earning his 400th save in the Boston Red Sox’s victory over the Atlanta Braves on May 10 in Atlanta. (John Bazemore / Associated Press)  Jansen attributed the velocity spike to an adrenaline rush knowing a milestone was within reach. The boost was noticeably absent two nights later against the Cardinals when he came out throwing 93 and issued a four-pitch walk to begin his appearance. He was pulled after surrendering three hits, a walk and three runs without recording an out. The next day, two pitch clock violations led to a costly walk and he unraveled.  Advertisement  “I was flat, man,” Jansen said. “Not gonna lie. In the first one, I came back to earth. The second one, I just let [the violations] get to me. Learn from mistakes, yeah, and move on.”  The Dodgers became familiar with occasional lapses from Jansen, sometimes for multiple appearances, over his final four years with the team. He remained, on the whole, effective but not able to meet the unsustainable expectations he previously set.  His cutter’s average velocity plummeted 3.3 mph between 2016 and 2020. The Dodgers became more careful with his usage. Both he and the team often cited mechanical trouble. He remained the closer, but it wasn’t him on the mound for the final out of the World Series in 2020. It was Julio Urías.  The humbling twist prompted Jansen to throw more sliders and two-seam fastballs in 2021 with free agency around the corner after being reluctant to change. The adjustment continues paying dividends two years later.  “He’s someone that has a special talent that probably got to the big leagues before he really even knew how to pitch and learned as he went,” Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom said. “And that’s why he’s had staying power. That’s why he continues to do this at an elite level.”  Jansen quickly surfaced as a clubhouse leader for the Red Sox, assuming the role alongside his fellow former Dodgers. Bloom noted Jansen’s willingness to open up about his experiences. About needing to adapt. About what is required physically and mentally to continue excelling. Bloom called the revelation “eye-opening.”  “I’m proud of who Kenley has become because he had not always been the most vocal guy,” Hernández said. “He’s a guy that with what he’s done on the field, every time he talks, people listen.”  Jansen said he needed to leave the Dodgers to dive into that role. In Los Angeles, he said, he was always “Kenley the kid.” He offered advice to younger pitchers, especially Latinos, toward the end, but it wasn’t a focus. The Braves received him differently, as a veteran who’s been through it all to learn from. He became more confident.  Advertisement  “Routines, the mental side of it, has been huge,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “He believes in all that and he’s been open about it. It’s needed to be a big leaguer. It’s not only your physical ability, it’s the other part of it, right? I think him connecting with guys, it has actually helped our mental skills coach, as far as he has more customers now than probably in the past.”  For Jansen, it’s a thrill to play in Boston and at historic Fenway Park, the way it was to play in Los Angeles for Jackie Robinson’s franchise. The vibes are different, but he’s comfortable. He loves playing for Cora. He’s enjoyed reuniting with Turner, Hernández, and Alex Verdugo. He’s at ease, smoothly fitting into his surroundings with one notable exception: It’ll always be Lakers over Celtics.  “L.A. will forever be my home,” Jansen said. “That’s where I’m raising my kids. But I love being in Boston right now. This is the place I want to be and play every day.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdGltZXMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA1LTE4L2RvZGdlcnMtYm9zdG9uLXJlZC1zb3gta2VubGV5LWphbnNlbi00MDAtc2F2ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 03:13:43","By RNZ  Explainer - With more heavy rain forecast for the upper North Island this weekend, some are wondering why it has been raining so much and when it is likely to stop.  MetService currently has orange rain warnings in place for Gisborne north of Tolaga Bay and Tasman west of Motueka, and heavy rain watches have been issued for the Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty and Mt Taranaki.  Any forecast rain is coming on top of the havoc wreaked by Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary Day flood, which Niwa described as a one-in-200-year event.  How much rain has there been this year?  There was a very wet start to the year with Niwa reporting in January that there was 400-800 per cent more rainfall than usual for that month in parts of Northland, Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula, western Bay of Plenty and parts of Hawke’s Bay. The highest one-day rainfall was recorded in Māngere, Auckland on January 27 when 265mm of rain fell. Meteorologists say January was Auckland’s wettest month since records began and central Auckland experienced more than 45 per cent of its yearly rainfall in just one month.  MetService currently has orange rain warnings in place for Gisborne north of Tolaga Bay and Tasman west of Motueka. Photo / Alex Cairns  Cyclone Gabrielle hit in February and parts of southern Northland, Auckland, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, coastal Wairarapa and parts of Canterbury all received at least 400 per cent of their normal February rainfall. The highest one-day of rainfall was recorded at Tūtira in Hawke’s Bay on February 13 when 316mm of rain fell. On February 27-28, Gisborne received 51mm and Wairoa 105mm of rain or 77 per cent and 119 per cent of their monthly normal respectively, Niwa said.  In March, the situation switched with Northland, Auckland, northern Waikato, coastal Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, northern Wairarapa and Nelson receiving less than 50 per cent of their normal rainfall for the month. By contrast, eastern and inland parts of the South Island received more than 200 per cent of their usual rainfall and rainfall was also above normal in Wellington, southern Wairarapa, Whanganui and Taranaki. The highest one-day of rainfall was recorded at Mt Cook village on March 20.  Niwa figures indicate April was quite a dry month for large parts of the country, but that was not the case for Kāpiti Coast and Northland. Paraparaumu on Kāpiti Coast had its wettest April since records began in 1945 with a total rainfall of 202mm of rainfall. Kaikohe in Northland had 371mm of rain, its second-highest April rainfall on record. Sunday, April 30 was particularly wet in Kaikohe with 169mm of rain falling - the highest level of one-day rainfall in April since records began in 1956.  Why has it been so wet?  Until March, New Zealand was in a La Niña weather pattern which is associated with northeasterly winds which bring moist, rainy conditions to northeastern areas of the North Island.  La Niña is an atmospheric phenomenon that usually happens every few years when winds blow warm surface water from the eastern Pacific Ocean towards Indonesia.  Niwa signalled the La Niña pattern was moving away in March 2023 and its principal scientist Chris Brandolino said that would mean less rain for the North Island and it would perhaps be a bit drier in the South Island.  “Because we’re transitioning out of La Niña, we still may have these La Niña-like features, so we’ve got to watch out for the odd downpour,” Brandolino said. “But the odds or the chances for getting these successive big rainfall events are certainly going to be declining over the next few months. Still there, but declining.”  Atmospheric rivers are massive plumes of moisture that move from the tropics to the mid-latitudes.  Niwa meteorologist Ben Noll said an atmospheric river was one of the factors that contributed to Auckland’s deluge on January 27.  “A slew of environmental factors contributed to this extreme event - a formidable La Niña and marine heatwave led to more moisture being available, which was harnessed by an atmospheric river,” Noll said.  “High pressure to the south then blocked it, keeping it in place. The storm was also supported by a unique phenomenon called a low-level jet, as well as converging winds that extended lengthwise across the most populated part of the country.  “All of these factors leveraged the atmosphere’s tremendous moisture content to drop an entire summer’s rain in less than a day. And if it sounds complex, that’s because it is - extreme events occur under extreme circumstances.”  “Training” rain or thunderstorms have been another cause of the extremely heavy rainfall experienced in some parts of the country.  Niwa meteorologist Seth Carrier told Stuff that “training” just meant that heavy rain was moving over the same place repeatedly.  Severe thunderstorm warnings have accompanied several of the recent severe weather events, with the MetService warning system indicating that heavy rainfall of more than 25mm can result from severe thunderstorms.  A new international study will examine whether the eruption of the underwater Tongan volcano Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai can be linked to the severe weather events experienced in New Zealand, Stuff reports.  Niwa principal atmosphere and climate scientist Olaf Morgenstern said there was no established link between the events, but it was believed the eruption increased the Earth’s temperature.  The underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano sent about 58,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools of seawater into the Earth’s stratosphere when it erupted in January 2022.  “That water acts like a shield and enhances the greenhouse emissions and enhances the warming,” Morgenstern said.  The fact New Zealand had been deluged with rain this summer was entirely consistent with what could be expected based on global warming, he said.  When is the rain forecast to ease?  Niwa’s Seasonal Climate Outlook analysis that was issued on May 1 indicates that El Niño has a 70-80 per cent chance of developing during winter and continuing through spring.  Niwa meteorologist Ben Noll said if an El Niño weather pattern developed, it would bring southerly winds which were cooler, less moist and brought less rain than northerlies.  Niwa forecasts there could be periods of heavy rainfall in May due to atmospheric rivers, but that conditions were expected to be drier overall in June and July due to a reduction in the amount of tropical and subtropical moisture.  Noll said there could, however, be a tailend La Niña effect in May.  “We are moving from La Niña to possibly toward an El Niño, one side of the spectrum to the other, and during that transition period the weather tends to be quite variable,” he said.  - RNZ    ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L256L3doeS1pcy1pdC1yYWluaW5nLXNvLW11Y2gtYW5kLXdoZW4td2lsbC1pdC1zdG9wL0hNSVM3SjdESFZBREpIU1JCRktTMkM3U1FNL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""He was larger than life and had this booming laugh,"" said Bob Bauder, a longtime friend and fellow journalist who worked with Brown at various newspapers. ""I mean, we would be sitting there at the Elks, when he laughed you could hear it, man. He erupted.""  A passionate advocate for local journalism and community-based reporting, Brown's career and life are being celebrated by friends, family and former coworkers after the newsman passed away on May 10. At age 66, the longtime editor and writer was a major influence in local newsrooms, as well as serving as a great friend to many in the region.  “Greg was a journalist through and through. It was his life’s work and his passion,” said Patricia Brown, his wife. “He believed wholeheartedly in the idea that a strong free press was necessary for a civil society, and held himself to the highest standards for that.”  With a degree in journalism from Penn State University, Brown started his career as a reporter at Waynesburg's Democrat Messenger. While on the staff at the paper, he would eventually move into an editorial position at the newsroom before moving into the city editor position at The Beaver County Times. After the Times, he also served in editor roles at the Tribune-Review and the Pittsburgh Catholic.  Brown's style of reporting focused on informing the community using a hyperlocal style of story, which led to the editor becoming a strong voice and leader within the Times newsroom's content. By showing local reporters the importance of presenting these sometimes dry subjects to readers, he created a focus on content that is still present in many stories today.  ""Under his guidance, those folks were covering and reporting on stories that were important to people who might not otherwise have known about whether it was a school board meeting or a municipal government meeting,"" said Tom Bickert, who served as an editor alongside Brown at the Times. ""He was very good at showing reporters why that was important to readers, and helping them produce stories that had impact in their communities so that readers knew that there might be a tax hike, or there was going to be layoffs or things like that. But he was just very good at guiding the local news direction.""  ""Greg was an old-time newsman,"" Bauder said. ""He knew a news story when he saw one and he would go after it. He knew the news business and he was a hell of a journalist. He was also just a good dude.""  Industry professionals also took note of the important work Brown was doing at the paper, with many professional organizations celebrating the work that came out of the newsroom during his time as editor. The stories being told helped keep readers informed on topics and interested in stories, regardless of some of the drier subject matters that are typical of local news.  ""We were, in my opinion, the best newspaper of our size in the whole state during his time there,"" Bauder said. ""it was one that consistently won awards and we were recognized across the state as a damn good sheet. People don't realize what we had here, it was a privilege to work with the very talented people there.""  Often serving as the first line of defense for his writers, Brown's leadership helped a generation of young journalists hone the skills needed for local journalism and gain the ability to serve communities around Beaver County.  ""For many years, Greg Brown was a mentor for young journalists at The Times and throughout the region,"" said Patrick O'Shea, who currently serves as the editor of the Times. ""He was always there to give you the real story on local figures, sometimes in language not suitable for a family newspaper. And he also always knew how to lighten the mood when things got tense.""  Even for writers working outside of Brown's immediate circle, he left a lasting impression. Another long-time Times reporter who recently retired, Mike Bires, remembers the respect that Brown gained from his colleagues through his work.  “As a sports reporter, I didn’t necessarily have a lot of interaction with Greg in the newsroom, but it was very obvious he did his job well and that he had a keen nose for the news,"" Bires said. ""Everybody respected him as a journalist. He was simply a great newspaperman.""  While the editor was a tough news reporter, he was also passionate about music and was always ready to start friendly conversations with colleagues. During one Saturday morning job interview in 1993, Times entertainment reporter Scott Tady remembers the approachable personality of Brown and the fun atmosphere of a usually intimidating scenario of a job interview.  ""He showed up in a 'Ren & Stimpy Show' T-shirt and we casually sat in the newsroom library and had an expansive conversation,"" Tady said. ""I immediately admired his passion for journalism and pop culture, and would draw from his enthusiasm, vast knowledge and calm, encouraging leadership for years to come when he was our city editor.""  Bickert shared similar stories about the openness of his fellow editor, noting the newsman's ability to shake the demanding editor persona at times to make people feel welcome at the newsroom.  ""He was just a fun guy to be around,"" Bickert said. ""There was one summer where one of the guys put together a softball team and we played some games. Greg's idea of fun was always hilarious, because he's a pretty good ballplayer. He would say 'let's go out and shag some flies, hit some balls and go drink beer.' He's just one of those people that you really like being around.""  Other former Times colleagues, such as Karen Ferrick-Roman, also remember the charm of the editor and his various passions ranging from outdoors to music to beer. Always moving faster than people expected and ever curious, his impact was lasting on a wide variety of reporters and community members.  ""The most curious thing about Greg was how he was so laid back and so passionate at the same time,"" Ferrick-Roman said. ""He somehow found time for everything that mattered the most. While the rest of us were running around like chickens, he was the proverbial duck: calm on the surface and paddling like crazy under the water.""  ""He taught me an immeasurable number of things,"" Tady said. ""As a reporter, you always knew he had your back. And his lightning-quick humor ― always impeccably timed ― made the newsroom a fun place to work. Everyone in the newsroom cherished and respected him.""  Outside of the newsroom, Brown was an active member of the community and served as leadership for several organizations within the region. Throughout his time in Beaver County, he had served as a group organizer and volunteer for Beaver County's Habitat for Humanity and was a large force in the fundraising efforts at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Hopewell Township.  ""There was a time in the early 2000s when there were only eight students in the eighth-grade class, so Greg and a committed core of parents rallied other school parents and concerned parishioners to save the school through large and ongoing fundraising efforts,"" Pat Brown said.  At the Aliquippa Elks Club, Greg Brown was a common visitor with his favorite whiskey order being two shots of Jim Beam and a glass of Bushmills. In addition to his hearty laugh echoing around the halls with his friends, the natural leader had also recently been elected the lodge's exalted leader for the second time.  ""He just became exalted ruler this year,"" Bauder said. ""He was looking to do a lot of positive change down there. And, you know, he's a big loss for the lodge.""  Brown was deeply passionate about his hobbies, including chess, photography, music, kayaking, bird-watching and maintaining the Penn State Master Gardner certified pollinator-friendly garden at his home. He would share tips about his hobbies with others, as well as keep up with friends about what was next.  ""Spying on backyard birds, he’d share tips like: brown and crush eggshells for your feeders to help nesting momma cardinals keep up their calcium,"" Ferrick-Roman said. ""He loved the great outdoors, music and beer of all kinds. I had to ask if he was growing his beard because he was a mountain man or Santa. Well, he was heading to Santa School this fall.""  As family members and friends continue to remember the local journalism legend, it will be hard to forget the impact Brown had on so many lives around the county.  ""Greg loved his community and strived to make Beaver County better in any way he could,"" O'Shea said. ""In his later years, Greg was a regular contributor to the Times' opinion page, offering his insight on what leaders were doing right and wrong locally and beyond. His voice and his humor will be sorely missed in the county.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2JlYXZlci1jb3VudHktdGltZXMtc3RhZmYtY2VsZWJyYXRlLW1lbW9yeS1vZi1ncmVnLWJyb3duLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QvNzAyMjc3NjMwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This testimonial book was written by 24 Nicaraguans exiled in Costa Rica, the United States and Ireland, after the protests of April 2018  By EFE / Confidencial  HAVANA TIMES – The testimonies and stories of a group of Nicaraguan students who five years ago rebelled against the government presided over by Daniel Ortega are presented in the book “April Flame of Freedom,” authored by the young protagonists.  This testimonial book was written by 24 Nicaraguans exiled in Costa Rica, the United States and Ireland, after the anti-government demonstrations that erupted in April 2018, Alan Guerrero, one of the authors and deputy coordinator of the Alliance of Nicaraguan Youth and Students (AJEN), told EFE.  The book, which was presented at the Cultural Center of Spain in Costa Rica, assembles, in addition to the testimonies, contributions such as poems, stories, songs, designs and opinion articles, Guerrero said.  The book is available, free of charge, in print and digital versions. AJEN and the Student Youth Unit detail on their social networks where to request the text and the link for a free download.  He explained that a group of members of AJEN decided to work together with the Student Youth Alliance in order to document their testimonies, as a contribution to “youth memory in a historical process, such as the issue of justice and truth.”  “The content of this book gives great emphasis to the value of freedom, which was the most outstanding characteristic of April 2018,” he said.  “Young people got tired of authoritarian practices and wanted to break out from the shackles of Daniel Ortega’s dictatorship. That was how the flame of freedom ignited, and continues to demand justice, democracy and freedom,” said Guerrero.  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said that five years ago they defeated an attempted “coup d’état,” which is how he classifies the demonstrations that erupted against his government in April 2018, when thousands of Nicaraguans took to the streets to protest controversial social security reforms. Ortega’s brutal response to the protest ultimately led to a demand for his resignation.  The protests left at least 355 dead, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). However, Nicaraguan organizations say the figure is 684. Ortega admits that there were “more than 300” but maintains that it was an attempted coup d’état and that it was his Police and supporters who were the victims. Nonetheless, he preferred to not investigate any of the documented killings.  Nicaragua has been experiencing a political and social crisis since April 2018. It intensified after the bogus general elections of November 7, 2021, in which Ortega re-elected himself for a fifth term (fourth consecutive) and the second with his wife Rosario Murillo as vice president, with his leading contenders in prison.

But it was always the wind-blasted, volcanic-scarred centre of New Zealand where the actual punches started flying.  To quell backseat uprisings, Dad would regale us with a story of another fight — the epic battle between the powerful mountains Tongariro, Tauhara and Taranaki, over a woman, Pihanga.  The contest ended with a triumphant yet badly wounded Tongariro, who secured the eternal presence of tree-clad Pihanga by his side, but at the price of a shattered mountain peak. A grieving Tauhara limped to the other side of Lake Taupo, forever looking back at his lost love. And jealous Taranaki stormed west to the coast, leaving a deep scar in the land, which formed the Whanganui River and where he broods to this day.  Different tribes have different versions. Some include Mt Ngauruhoe (better known these days as Mt Doom) as a second wife of Tongariro, Pūtauaki as a fourth suitor who disappeared into the Bay of Plenty, and Whakaari (White island), Paepae-o-aotea (Volkner Rocks) and Moutohorā (Whale Island) who fled into the sea.  Mount Ngauruhoe, the second wife of Mount Tongariro in some versions of the Battle of the Mountains. Credit: Steve Clancy Photography / Getty Images  The Battle of the Mountains is a Maori myth, but one that highlights the ways in which tribes in that part of the North Island observed the local geology and natural landforms, and recorded those observations, says geologist and Massey University Professor of Natural Hazards, Jon Procter.  “They were making the links that [there are similar] rocks in the central North Island as in Taranaki and the same andesite rocks are also down the Whanganui River, so the mountain must have travelled down the river,” he tells Cosmos Weekly.  It’s only in the last two decades that myths like the Battle of the Mountains have been treated as anything but apocryphal stories.  It’s only in the last two decades that myths like the Battle of the Mountains have been treated as anything but apocryphal stories.  Researchers are adding another layer to a global shift in thinking about ancient legends, to add Indigenous myths to geologic toolboxes. In New Zealand, this means applying matauranga Maori, the Maori system of knowledge that covers everything from mythmaking to cultural practices and observed data, to the country’s rambunctious geology.  “It is relatively new. We’ve only started on this as a line of inquiry about 15 years ago,” Procter says.  “If you combine volcanology and matauranga Maori there’s information and knowledge, observations, witness’ accounts of past volcanic events, retained in the memory of those cultures that don’t exist in the European cultures of New Zealand. There’s almost a database of information and observations that we could learn from.”  “Not to be taken seriously”  By approaching geology from a Maori perspective, Procter and his colleagues are taking a new angle to a field of inquiry that only gained a name in the late ’60s.  Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano coined the term “geomythology” in a 1968 paper, putting a label on the long history of archaeologists’ parallels between myths and volcanic eruptions.  But the initial reception to the idea of geomythology was mixed. Vitaliano’s 1974 book was called “delightful and scholarly” by one reviewer, while another slated geomythology as a field that “need not be taken seriously as a new scientific or humanistic discipline”.  “There’s almost a database of information and observations that we could learn from.” Professor Jon Procter  The concept was effectively ignored until the 2000s, when geomythology took off around the world.  Where Vitaliano published her first paper in a folklore journal, it took a University of the Sunshine Coast geologist to bring the idea back into the geological school, according to an article in Neon. Patrick Nunn had spent two decades in and out of Fiji by the time he joined the dots, in 2000, between local legends and the small islands scattered throughout the country.

Get a daily dose of science Get a weekly Cosmos Catch-up  Since then, researchers have been applying what is known about geological events to ancient societies’ myths from India to Greece and Australia, and confirming that yes, those legends were a record of ancient volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and even meteor strikes.  Duelling wizards and tsunamis  In New Zealand, some researchers are taking a new angle: they are starting with the view that the myth is an accurate record, and searching for the geological evidence to support it.  The Maori tribes Ngati Koata and Ngati Kuia tell a story about duelling wizards who caused huge waves to smash into tiny D’Urville Island in the Marlborough Sounds, after a dispute over a fishing catch.  Working backwards from this legend, in 2018 and 2019 a team of researchers and members from the two tribes took soil core samples from Swamp Bay on the island, to find evidence proving not that the tale has roots in truth, but what caused the waves: was it a tsunami or a storm surge?  “We wanted the science to tell us things the tradition couldn’t,” says Dr Daniel Hikuroa, earth systems scientist at the University of Auckland and one of the authors of the final paper.  “We wanted the science to tell us things the tradition couldn’t.” Dr Daniel Hikuroa  “We wanted to know the exact time of the wave, the direction it came from, and whether it was one wave or successive events over years.”  An unusual layer of pebbles, plant roots and gravel-sized pieces of mud in the rock layers, that couldn’t be explained by storm surges, led them to pinpoint the duelling wizards tale to a tsunami in 1855, when an earthquake rippled out from the Wairarapa Fault.

In 1886, Mt Tarawera (“burnt peak”) spectacularly exploded. Lava fountained from a burning 17km rift, killing 120 people and destroying the famous Pink and White Terraces.  The eruption was preceded by omens such as the inexplicable rise and fall of the waters of Lakes Tarawera and Rotokakahi, steam above the mountain, and, finally, alleged sightings of a phantom war canoe ferrying souls to the mountain of the dead.  Lake Tarawera, and the mountain of the same name. Credit: Mark Meredith / Getty Images  But it was the volcano-related names of Tarawera’s original three peaks, and the story of the cannibal-chief Tamaohoi imprisoned in the mountain and the associated tapu (a ban on people visiting, sometimes for sacred reasons and sometimes for safety), which suggested to researchers Dr Darren King and Professor James Goff, that Maori living in the area might have seen an explosion before.  Europeans have only been a sizable presence in New Zealand for a little more than 180 years.  Procter believes understanding stories from Maori traditions, which go back almost 800 years, will help mitigate the effects of future geologic and volcanic events.  The science, or mystery, of predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions has eluded researchers since these fields entered popular scholarship. And yet what indigenous knowledges such as matauranga Maori may be able to reveal through legend, historical observation and cultural practices could be some new puzzle pieces for preventing future natural catastrophes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29zbW9zbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VhcnRoL2VhcnRoLXNjaWVuY2VzL21hb3JpLW15dGhvbG9neS1uYXR1cmFsLWRpc2FzdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Genome data sheds light on how Homo sapiens arose in Africa  Our species arose in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, with the oldest-known Homo sapiens fossils discovered at a site in Morocco called Jebel Irhoud, located between Marrakech and the Atlantic coast. But the scarcity of Homo sapiens fossils from early in our evolutionary history and the geographical spread of those remains in Africa in places like Ethiopia and South Africa have made it difficult to piece together how our species emerged and dispersed across the continent before trekking worldwide. A new study tapping into genome data from modern-day African populations is offering insight into how this may have unfolded.  Earth-sized alien planet gripped by widespread volcanism  An Earth-sized planet orbiting a dim star in our galactic neighborhood is offering some of the best evidence to date of volcanism beyond our solar system, with observations suggesting a rugged and rocky world tormented by constant eruptions. Scientists said on Wednesday the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes - similar to Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system. In our solar system, Earth and Venus are volcanically active, as are some of Jupiter's moons.  New dinosaur found in Spain illuminates history of meat-eating group  During the Cretaceous Period in a lush coastal region in eastern Spain, an impressive dinosaur with an elongated and vaguely crocodile-like skull was on the prowl for a meal, its curved and serrated teeth able to rip the flesh of its prey. Scientists on Thursday said they had unearthed a partial skeleton of a previously unknown dinosaur species in the town of Cinctorres in the Spanish province of Castellon that helps provide a deeper understanding of a highly successful group of meat-eaters that hunted on land and in the water.  Spain's PLD Space plans first rocket launch before the end of May  Spanish company PLD Space plans to launch its first private suborbital reusable rocket before the end of this month, it said on Thursday, with a view to eventually entering the market for putting small satellites in space.

Police said 20-year-old Lakevis Sloan and a 17-year-old were taken into custody Tuesday evening as they exited a Greyhound bus in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. They are awaiting extradition, charged with second-degree murder in the May 3 shooting death of 6-year-old Sir’Antonio Brown. Charging documents show that Sloan also is charged with aggravated child endangerment.  “These arrests doesn’t take the pain away, but they bring a little comfort,” his godmother, Shyneisha Hill, said.  Police, meanwhile, used the arrest to ask for help locating a third, not-yet-identified suspect.  “Don’t wait any longer, because we will arrest anybody and everybody who is housing or covering for this child killer,” Det. Mark Bundy said.  Police said previously that the suspects came to the Kansas City neighborhood with the intention of targeting someone, although they provided no additional details. The Wyandotte County prosecutor’s office spokesman said he didn’t know if they have attorneys.  Hill believes they were after the child’s uncle, whom she described as “in a lot of mess.” He was sleeping in his truck, she said, parking it in front of another relative’s home at night.  “Nobody really knows what the beef is,” she said. “We just are really trying to figure out, like, how it was that serious? Whatever it was, was it that serious to disregard the lives of children?”  The gunfire erupted as her own son, Qwamayne Frazier, was in the backyard playing with Sir’Antonio, who was called Sir by his family, she said. The children’s homes are across the street from one another and they attended the same school. After they got off the bus, they would change clothes and rush outside to play.  They were “just doing what they do normally, just out there playing, riding the bike, jumping on the trampoline, running around in the yard,” Hill said.  Sir’Antonio’s mom was at work but Hill was home when a car came to a stop, she said.  “This wasn’t just a random drive by shooting,” she said. “The suspects actually got out on foot, out of their car, seeing our kids out there.”  She said the suspects fired down the street, hitting Sir’Antonio but no one else. The shooting left her son unable to sleep alone, clingy, unwilling to go outside, simply repeating: “I know what happened to Sir. I can tell what happened to Sir,” she said.  When the crime scene tape disappeared, she said, he asked her: “How are we going to be protected?” She vowed to safeguard him with her life, she said, but the promise felt hollow initially, with the suspects still on the lose.  “We don’t know if they’re going to come back,” she said at the time. “We just don’t know.”  She said the children were best friends, describing themselves as brothers. “That’s just how we raised them,” Hill said.  Hill recalled Sir’Antonio as “the best kid ever,” happy, outspoken and athletic. Every Sunday, he was in church, emptying his pockets at offering time.  “He was such a gentleman,” she said. “He always made himself present, and he was just always there for everybody.”  Follow @ktar923","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8va3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvNTQ5NzUzMy8yLWFycmVzdGVkLWluLWRlYXRoLW9mLWthbnNhcy02LXllYXItb2xkLWd1bm5lZC1kb3duLXdoaWxlLXBsYXlpbmctb3V0c2lkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Shortly after 1 p.m. on Thursday, authorities hauled away the aircraft and reopened South Park Road, spanning from Hollywood Boulevard to Johnson Street.  While lingering questions surround the cause of the tragic crash, 7News learned that the pilot had recently been recruited by Aerial Banners, Inc.  Authorities and the victim’s roommate identified him as 28-year-old Mitchell Knaus.  “[He had] approximately 325 total hours of flight experience were logged by him. He had joined the company a fortnight ago and possessed an estimated 13-15 hours of experience with this particular make and model of aircraft,” revealed Brian Rayner with the National Transportation Safety Board.  According to Aerial Banners, Knaus he had just taken off from North Perry Airport before then plane went down.  The plane, identified as a yellow Piper PA-25 Pawnee, was flying east toward the beach when it inexplicably crashed on a road adjacent to Memorial Regional Hospital, erupting into flames.  7SkyForce was mid-flight Wednesday when the plane began experiencing problems.  In a distress call to air traffic control, Knaus reported encountering difficulties shortly after takeoff and expressed the urgency to release the towed banner.  “Yeah, I’m gonna have to drop this banner. I’m not climbing,” he said.  Moments later, the pilot made the decision to release the banner.  “I’m at 400 [feet], I’ve got to drop this over a lake,” he stated.  However, the Knaus was unable to regain control of the aircraft and descended rapidly.  Video footage captured by 7Skyforce showed the plane veering suddenly through the sky before ultimately crashing.  “At first, maybe we thought maybe [it was], like, a car crash, and as we were all going outside, we saw the flames,” said witness Alexa Piazza, who works nearby.  The calls to 911 were immediate.  “[The address is] 3325 Hollywood Boulevard, a plane just crashed,” said a caller.  “So you don’t know if anybody is still in the plane?” a dispatcher said.  “I don’t. It landed, I heard a loud boom, and it immediately engulfed in flames,” said the caller.  Knaus was the only person on board. He had been flying since January.  According to his social media profiles, he was also a photographer and a U.S. Army veteran who grew up in California.  The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board will continue their investigation to determine the sequence of events and contributing factors in this incident.  “We essentially analyze it in three parts: the man, the machine, and the environment,” explained Rayner.  Investigators said it could take up to a year for them to understand how the crash happened.  “I’ve learned that if I just work the process, the answers have a way of revealing themselves,” said Rayner.

Dawen Dilshad, 27, burst into the brawl with the cleaning implement while his friends were armed with swords, bats and knives.  The scrap took place on Bishop Street, in Middlesbrough, in the early hours of July 1, 2022, when Dilshad's friend Diar Mohammed challenged the rival group to meet for a fight via Snapchat, a court heard.  It was said at Teesside Crown Court that no one turned up at the location but that members of the opposing gang arrived at Mohammed's door the following day, reports TeessideLive.  Timothy Jacobs, prosecuting, told the court that only Mohammed was injured during the brawl, with a cut on his arm, and a wound to his side. Police identified other members of the group from CCTV footage covering parts of the street.  Mr Jacobs said that Dilshad ""aligned"" himself with the behaviour of his friends, who had machetes and bats. Dilshad's barrister, Tabitha Buck, said that he wasn't violent to anybody and that he had had ""an issue"" with drugs at the time of the fight. She said: ""He acted out of stupidity and out of fear; he armed himself with a hoover pipe when going into a crowd armed with machetes. It shows naivety and stupidity.""  (Image: Teesside Live)  Ms Buck added that her client has since completed a telecom engineering qualifications and has applied for jobs in that field in London. She told Teesside Crown Court: ""He lives with his mum and dad but he pays rent. He has contact with his four-year-old daughter every other day.""  Judge Howard Crowson told Dilshad that he was impressed by the fact that he has since completed qualifications and has the prospect of work. He said: ""You were in a house visited by a group who were intent on fighting. You emerged with a piece of hoover pipe, but you didn't hit anyone with it.""  Dilshad admitted affray and was handed a 12-month community order, with a 30-rehabilitation day requirement.

"eruption","2018-11-30","Not Discerned","{""Anchorage"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:03:28","Sensors that detect changes in atmospheric pressure due to ground shaking can also obtain data about large earthquakes and explosions that exceed the upper limit of many seismometers, according to new research.  The sensors, which detect inaudible infrasounds carried through the air, could improve tsunami warnings and other emergency responses while also lowering costs.  Research by University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute scientists shows that infrasound sensors can improve magnitude determinations. An initial tsunami warning is based solely on estimated magnitude and location.  Infrasound sensors cost less than seismometers, are reliable and exist in large numbers in Alaska for other uses.  “What we’ve done is use infrasound for a purpose it wasn’t really intended for,” said Ken Macpherson at the Geophysical Institute’s Wilson Alaska Technical Center.“We’ve found that it works well for providing complete data about strong earthquakes.”  These pressure-sensing infrasound instruments are generally used for non-seismic purposes such as the detection of mining explosions or nuclear detonations. They also record landslides, erupting volcanoes or meteors entering Earth’s atmosphere.  Macpherson details the use of infrasound sensors for seismology in a research paper published April 21 in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.  Macpherson is a seismo-acoustic research and operations scientist. Others from the Wilson Alaska Technical Center involved in the research include Director David Fee, data specialist Juliann Coffey and machine-learning specialist Alex Witsil, now working in the private sector.  Infrasound sensors record changes in air pressure caused by infrasound waves, which are at a frequency below what humans can hear.  Infrasound sensors can register the full range of an earthquake’s ground motion by detecting air pressure changes caused by the ground’s up and down movement during an earthquake.  Upward movement of the ground compresses the air, increasing air pressure much like a piston does. Downward movement reduces the pressure.  Pressure changes from even the largest earthquakes are far below infrasound sensors’ upper limit.  In contrast, seismometers, which record the actual movement of the ground, have an upper limit, meaning top-end data can be absent for large earthquakes. They can also miss data of smaller earthquakes if those occur too close to a seismometer.  Seismologists call that data loss “clipping.”  “If you crank up your stereo too high, you get a horrible sound,” Macpherson said. “That means you’ve exceeded the dynamic range of the speaker. That can happen to a seismometer.”  Seismologists can overcome clipping by deploying strong-motion detectors, which are different from infrasound sensors. These motion sensors won’t go off scale during intense shaking but are costly and aren’t accurate for smaller quakes. About 130 are located around Alaska, mostly in urban areas and near known faults.  As one example, Macpherson and his colleagues compared infrasound data of the magnitude 7.1 Anchorage earthquake of Nov. 30, 2018, to data from a seismometer. Both instruments were in the same location 18.6 miles from the epicenter.  “The seismometer recording of that earthquake went right to the dynamic range of the instrument and stopped,” Macpherson said. “So there’s a loss of amplitude information.”  The seismometer was one of several in the Southcentral Alaska region missing top-end data from that earthquake. Data from the infrasound sensor was not clipped.  To check the accuracy of the infrasound monitor’s top-end data, Macpherson matched it against the data from a strong-motion seismometer at the same location. They matched.  Infrasound sensors can also provide data just as timely as seismometers. That’s especially important if a tsunami is possible. The National Tsunami Warning Center has just four minutes to issue a warning from the time of a quake’s occurrence.  “If all of the close seismometers clip, and the Tsunami Warning Center is trying to get an accurate magnitude for warning of a tsunami, they could quickly compute magnitudes from a nearby infrasound station that’s colocated with a seismometer,” Coffey said.  Alaska has about 150 infrasound sensors alongside seismic monitors throughout the state.  Some of these were part of the EarthScope Transportable Array, a project funded by the National Science Foundation to map Earth’s crust and upper mantle. The temporary array moved gradually across the nation, reaching Alaska in 2014. Ninety-six of these stations are now part of the Alaska Earthquake Center’s permanent monitoring network.  “We have this unique resource in Alaska, and we’re pushing the science to get the most out of it that we can,” Macpherson said. “We’re looking to utilize it in novel ways.”  CONTACTS:  • Ken Macpherson, University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, 907-474-5963, kamacpherson@alaska.edu  • Rod Boyce, University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, 907-474-7185, rcboyce@alaska.edu","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTg5ODA30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He was born at Cable Memorial Hospital in Ipswich, MA June 16, 1931 to John F. and Abbie E. (Savage) Grundstrom, both lifelong residents of Rowley. He attended the Rowley Grammar Schools, Newburyport High School and Ipswich High School where he graduated with the class of 1949. This is where he met the love of his life Helen (Hill), who predeceased him in 2019 after 67 years of marriage. The joy of his entire life was his family. Wife Helen and children, Deborah Grundstrom, John (Gump) Grundstrom and his wife Karen, Jan Saunders and her husband Joseph. Grandchildren Kristina Hardy and her husband, Mike, Alyssa Grundstrom, Patrick Saunders and his wife Kelsey, Kelsi Rocha- Grundstrom and her husband Denys and Sean Saunders; great-grandchildren, Andres Rocha- Grundstrom, Fischer and Marin Saunders. He has especially enjoyed his family trips to Disney World and fishing in Key West. He joined the US Navy in 1950 where he volunteered for special services in Naval Aviation and was assigned to VF 71, a jet fighter squadron assigned to Quonset Point RI. From there he served a tour of duty in Korea aboard the carrier USS Bon Homme Richard CVA 41. Among the service metals he earned his most cherished was from the South Korean people as a token of their thanks. Following his Korean duty, he enjoyed a stay in Cuba where he had the opportunity to visit Port Au Prince, Haiti and other scenic areas. Next, Jack cruised the Mediterranean aboard the carrier USS Bennington where he visited many exotic ports including Istanbul Turkey, Athens Greece, Genoa Italy, Cannes France, Madrid Spain, Lisbon Portugal, and Gibraltar. After his four years of Naval service, he worked many local jobs including boat building for Hilmer Boat Co. in Ipswich, an electrician for the Boston and Maine Railroad, carpentry for John Carey, snow removal for the Town of Rowley, quartz crystal development for Western Electric Co. in North Andover and as always, a side job digging clams. During this time Jack attended night classes at Northern Essex CC, Lowell Technological Institute and then graduated from Wentworth University as a Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning Engineer. After operating his own clam shucking business, he took a job with Cargocaire Engineering Corp. moving up to Field Service Engineer and Service Manager. These positions took him all over the US and the world training maintenance crews in the operation of dehumidification equipment. This included many trips to Canada, Mexico, Alaska and Puerto Rico. Jack also enjoyed business trips to England, Sweden, Hawaii, Germany, Japan and the Philippine Islands where he witnessed the beginning of the 1968 eruption of the volcanic mountain Mayon in Legaspa City, Luzon. His most interesting assignments were the start-up and prototype testing of fifty-four Titan II missile sites in Kansas, Arkansas and Arizona, also the start-up and testing in Davao City, Philippines of a system installed in copra tankers to prevent spontaneous combustion and sinking at sea. This trip entailed a forty two day trans Pacific tanker trip back to Long Beach CA. He worked on the first nuclear powered cargo ship Savannah while it was anchored in NY Harbor next to the Statue of Liberty and on the launch platform of a space shuttle at Kennedy Space Center in FL. He supervised dry down and testing of the oil storage tanks at the Valdez end of the Alaska pipeline and the start-up and testing of the dehumidification system on the shakedown cruise of the first LNG tanker launched out of Pascagoula, MS. Others interesting assignments were Wilson Greatbatch in Buffalo NY in the early development of lithium batteries, working on the top floor of the Time Life Building in New York City in the preservation of historic films and photos and working in the storage caves along the Hudson River some of which were up to seven hundred feet below the surface. After his retirement from Cargocaire Jack went to work for Charles Hazzard, owner of State Street Associates of Newburyport as the property manager of his real estate company. He had earned his Real Estate Sales and Brokers licenses in MA, NH and FL. After several years Jack purchased the property management division and founded State Street Properties of Newburyport Inc. He continued, along with his children, to manage the existing properties and contracted with the US Marshall Service to manage properties that had been seized for drug trafficking until his retirement in 1998. Jack did not stop working at retirement. He had been on the Rowley River since childhood not only digging clams but with his own herring boat. He found the attention to the clam flats to be lacking so he volunteered to fill the position of Shellfish Constable for the Town of Rowley. He successfully completed the Shellfish Constable course at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy and became a certified Shellfish Constable. He then went on to become a student of Dr. David Belding, who wrote the bible on Massachusetts shellfish. He learned all that was known on raising soft shell clams, oysters and quahogs for this area. He then experimented with, promoted, and engaged very successfully in programs enhancing the shellfisheries in Rowley and on the North Shore.  ""Some time at eve when the tide is low, I shall slip my moorings and sail away, With no response to the friendly hail Of kindred craft in the busy bay.

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said while every activity in Manipur has been affected and internet banned, Union Home Minister Amit Shah or any other cabinet minister is yet to visit the violence-hit northeastern state.  ''15 days since the horrific violence erupted in Manipur and internet was banned. Yesterday, the ban was extended for another 5 days.  ''Banking, e-commerce, payments of e-bills, e-tickets, businesses, work from home, education, and many other essential services have come to a grinding halt,'' he said on Twitter.  ''Meanwhile, Not a single word issued by Prime Minister appealing for peace. Not a single visit by the Union Home Minister or any other Cabinet Minister to the state,'' Ramesh said.  Clashes broke out in Manipur after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' in all its 10 districts on May 3 to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.  The violence was preceded by tension over the eviction of Kuki villagers from reserve forest land, which had led to a series of smaller agitations.  Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals -- Nagas and Kukis -- constitute another 40 per cent of the population and reside in the hill districts.

The failure of the government to deliver basic services seems to have sustained renewed social unrest from time to time in the country.  The first judgment call of a president is the ability to choose the most qualified as cabinet ministers who will help him carry out his vision. For the incoming administration of President-elect Bola Ahmed Tinubu, I’ll urge Tinubu to select men and women neck-deep in a veritable eruption of corruption scandals. They must carry a barrage of scandals – unmistakable assurance that corruption will be a thing of the past in the new administration.  Here’s my pick for Tinubu’s cabinet:  1. Kayode Fayemi: Former Governor of Ekiti State. He also served as federal minister of steel. He allegedly stole a whopping $40 million from the country’s treasury and stashed some of the loot in Ghana.  2. Rauf Aregbesola: Current Minister of Interior. Before that, he was Governor of Osun State. He allegedly milked Osun State to the tune of over $60 million.  3. Rabiu Kwankwaso: Governor Kano State from 1999-2003. He allegedly stole over $100 million as a Governor of Kano State.  4. Sule Lamido: Served as foreign affairs minister of Nigeria from 1999-2003. He was elected Governor of Jigawa State in April 2007. He allegedly stole over $110 million between 2007 and 2015. Out of that amount, $50 million was traced to his son’s bank accounts.  5. Amina Mohammed: Founder of Afri-Project Consortium that was in charge of all PTF projects during Abacha’s regime. She allegedly stole about $125 million from PTF accounts from 1994-1998.  6. James Ibori: Governor of Delta State from 29th May 1999-29th May 2007. He stole over $150 million from 1999-2007 as Governor of Delta State.  7. Atiku Abubakar: An astute businessman. Through corrupt deals, he allegedly stole over $500 million from 1999-2007.  8. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi: Former Governor of Rivers State from 2007-2015. Speaker of Rivers State House of Assembly from 1999-2007. From 2007 to 2015, he allegedly stole over $700 million and $150 million from the Nigerian treasury and used that money to sponsor Buhari and APC.  9.

(Original Caption) 6/11/1943-Watts, California- Armed with clubs, pipes and bottles, this self-appointed posse of uniformed men was all set to settle the Zoot Suit War when the Navy Shore Patrol stepped in and broke it up. the angry servicemen were out to get all wearers of oversize clothing to avenge buddies who were attacked. Bettmann  The board unanimously OK'd a motion by Supervisor Hilda Solis to denounce ""the devastation of the Zoot Suit Riots, recognize this as a dark chapter in Los Angeles County's history and recommit to fighting against racial discrimination.""  Solis said the uprising began in the early 1940s, when ""mobs of U.S. servicemen, law enforcement officers and civilians ambushed young Mexican Americans, African American and Filipino American men"" across the county.  The attacks became focused on people wearing ""zoot suits,"" which had become popular among young men of color and made them targets of racism and discrimination, Solis said.  ""This was especially true among Latino youths in California who were known as `pachucos' for wearing zoot soots,"" she said. ""The white majority at the time often viewed them as gang members and delinquents.""  Solis said the zoot suiters were spuriously blamed for the 1942 death of Jose Gallardo Diaz near a swimming hole known as the ""Sleepy Lagoon,"" and nine young Latinos were convicted of second-degree murder in Diaz' slaying.  ""These arrests and convictions were seen as shams by the Mexican- American community, with the police exclusively targeting young Brown men as suspects,"" according to Solis' motion.  ""On May 31, 1943, a group of servicemen and a group of Mexican American youth wearing zoot suits scuffled in downtown Los Angeles. Three days later, on June 3, 1943, another confrontation ensued, only this time servicemen were joined by police on orders to `clean up' downtown Los Angeles. The next day, a group of over 200 Marines and sailors took a caravan of taxis into East Los Angeles and began to beat any young man wearing a zoot suit, burning their belongings in the process.""  The riots died down later that year when U.S. servicemen were banned from the area, and the City Council backed a resolution -- that was never codified as a law -- that barred zoot suits in the city.  The Zoot Suit Riots became a dark chapter in the history of the Chicano community, and were commemorated by a Broadway play in the 1970s that became a film starring Edward James Olmos in 1981.  Supervisor Holly Mitchell said the riots were indicative of a pattern of groups of people being targeted for their ""clothes, culture and identity.""  ""We've seen that repeated over and over in our history, where groups who attempt to express our cultural pride and identity through clothes, music, style, hair ... whatever the case may be, how it's frowned upon and quite frankly feared,"" she said. ""And the effort to erase and eliminate never seems to be successful.""  Mitchell noted that recognizing the Zoot Suit Riots is ""particularly important now,"" saying there are some politicians who are ""attempting to rewrite American history.""  Supervisor Janice Hahn added, ""Until we understand and come to grips with our past, even our shameful past, we are in jeopardy of repeating it.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy9sYS1jb3VudHktc3VwZXJ2aXNvcnMtZGVub3VuY2UtZGV2YXN0YXRpb24tb2YtdGhlLXpvb3Qtc3VpdC1yaW90cy1vbi04MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbG9zYW5nZWxlcy9uZXdzL2xhLWNvdW50eS1zdXBlcnZpc29ycy1kZW5vdW5jZS1kZXZhc3RhdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtem9vdC1zdWl0LXJpb3RzLW9uLTgwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2021-11-01","Not Discerned","{""Sunset"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:06:53","Gene Simmons and Van Halen are uniquely tied together in rock history. Simmons famously saw Van Halen perform during the band’s early days. He later signed the band to his production company, which flew VH to New York to record a demo at the famed Electric Lady Studios.  Things obviously fell threw business-wise, but Simmons still kept in touch with Eddie Van Halen. In a new interview with Classic Rock, Simmons looked back on Van Halen’s impact on rock and the last time he saw EVH.  Simmons said he and Eddie ran into each other on Sunset Boulevard. The KISS bassist didn’t give an approximate date of this interaction, but he noted Eddie “was already deeply affected by cancer.”  “I had read that he blamed his condition on using a metal guitar pick, putting it in his mouth. In my view that wasn’t the case. Ed smoked all the time,” said Simmons. “All the same, when I heard that familiar voice calling my name on the street – ‘Hey, Gene!’ – I wasn’t sure what to say. His condition was well known at that point.”  Simmons continued, “He brought it up at the start of the conversation: ‘Hey, man, how you doing? I’ve got cancer’. I was embarrassed and wanted to reach out and hug him, but standing there on the street with a cigarette in his hand he opened his mouth and smiled: ‘Check this out’, inviting me to look at the space where his upper palette should have been. He just shrugged: ‘I’ve got this disease, watcha gonna do? I’ll see you around’. It was typical Ed; happy-go-lucky.”  Simmons made a point to mention how EVH was such a unique character in rock. While he indulged in excess, he was always “all about the music.”  The Demon has never forgotten about the potential signing of Van Halen long-term. On the KISS Kruise X in November 2021, a fan asked a question about KISS merchandise during a Q&A. The question led to Simmons saying, “We made one big mistake — one. There was a band called Van Halen. They were signed to Man Of A Thousand Faces Inc. There was a 24-track demo. They were owned lock, stock and barrel and signed and happy and wanted to sign with us, and we said no.”  Stanley chimed in saying, in part, ” … I was with Gene when he first saw Van Halen at the Starwood. But the idea of managing or producing bands when we really were still at the beginning of our career was something that was… The move is called self-preservation.”  Simmons then quipped, “It was a mistake, but he doesn’t remember,” which the crowd responded to with laughter.  Van Halen: Their 30 Best Songs, Ranked  Eddie Van Halen was the most influential guitarist of our generation. Of course, flashy, fleet-fingered guitarists were a dime a dozen in the late ‘70s and ‘80s. Eddie was better than all of them, but he was more than that. A songwriter, a keyboardist, a studio wizard, ¼ of Van Halen’s four-part harmony team and a band leader that was able to guide VH through losing the most distinctive frontman of the ‘80s and led them to four chart-topping albums with Sammy Hagar.

The deceased worker was identified as Demonte Smith. His father confirmed his death.  A second worker remains missing. The fire captain told CBS News that on Thursday night, structural engineers deemed it unsafe for heavy machinery to operate overnight, so search and rescue efforts were paused until morning. Efforts resumed in the morning as machinery was used to search under debris.  There are concerns that the entire structure is unstable and could collapse, the captain said.  More than 90 firefighters were called to the scene and had not yet extinguished the fast-moving flames, said Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson at a news conference held hours after flames initially erupted around 9 a.m. ET. Exposed wood at the construction site allowed the fire to move quickly, reaching scorching temperatures well over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the chief.  Firefighters respond to a massive fire that broke out at construction site near the SouthPark area in Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 18, 2023. Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Crews rescued 15 workers from the blaze, Johnson said. Fire officials previously told CBS News that a tower crane operator, who was working at the construction site when the fire broke out, was rescued and safely on the ground. The operator was transported to a hospital with injuries that are not life-threatening.  Johnson said two workers remained unaccounted for at the time of the news conference, citing confirmation from the construction site foreman.  Videos and images shared on social media show bright orange flames engulfing part of a large building complex in the North Carolina city's South Park neighborhood, an area known for its large namesake shopping center. Additional footage taken by CBS affiliate WBTV captured a thick plume of black smoke rising up from the burning structure.  Huge flames are seen billowing out from the roof of the structure in a separate video, recorded by the Twitter user @mr_veal from inside a building across the street.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police announced multiple road closures in the SouthPark area in a tweet after the fire broke out. At least one road has since been reopened. A spokesperson for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools told WBTV on Thursday morning that schools had not been impacted by the blaze.  Fire crews will likely remain on scene for ""a period of time,"" according to the chief, who said at the afternoon conference that responders had already called mayday — which happens when crews are trapped or otherwise have issues escaping — twice since arriving. Investigators will determine what caused the fire, he said. At this point, investigators believe it was accidental.

Teachers organized students against walls of the lobby, so they could enter the theater and get to their seats in orderly fashion to watch the Commonwealth Shakespeare Company Stage2's production of “Romeo & Juliet.”  When CSC associate artistic director Bryn Boice walked onto the stage for a pre-show director’s note, the house of middle and high school students erupted into boisterous applause. She encouraged the students to provide feedback for the actors in the form of cheering, laughing and clapping during this performance, and the audience followed her direction. There were audible “oohs” and gasps of anticipation as Romeo and Juliet shared their first kiss. All-out shouts for nearly half a minute during Romeo’s fight with Tybalt.  For students, the performance provided a new perspective on a text they had studied in class. After the show, they participated in a short Q&A with the cast and director Boice.  Students attending a performance of ""Romeo & Juliet"" were able to ask actors and the director questions in a talkback after the show. (Courtesy Commonwealth Shakespeare Company)  That’s the kind of engagement Boice hopes to foster through these student matinees.  “Being able to see a clear and concise telling of this famous play, it makes it less daunting in the classroom when they go back to read it or when they read it next year,"" she said. “When they get to see the Scottish play or they get to read ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’ in their next year, they’re not afraid, and they get into it. That’s my grand hope for the audiences of the Stage2 performances. That they leave their fear of Shakespeare behind.”  The matinee series is also an education for the actors onstage, many of whom are early in their careers. “They train with us,"" Boice says. “All of these actors are going to be in the show on the Common with us in ‘Macbeth’ this summer. And they get a sense of what it’s like to have a really wild and raucous audience when they perform in these shows. … And they are so excited by the cyclical energy that happens between the audience and the actor in a Shakespeare piece.”  Dylan C. Wack, who plays Friar Laurence in “Romeo & Juliet,” agrees with Boice. “Performing for these matinees and performing for these students is, I feel like, as close to being in the Globe with the groundlings,” he said. “They will let you know how they’re feeling. The energy is so palpable.”  The Commonwealth Shakespeare Company has been producing these student matinees for over a decade. For many in the audience at this matinee, it was their first time seeing Shakespeare performed live onstage. By the end of the show’s run on Friday, May 19, around 5,300 students will have seen this production.

A brawl involving several people outside Dodger Stadium left one person unconscious, and authorities say none of the parties involved are cooperating with police.  The fight erupted outside the center field entrance Tuesday after the Dodgers lost to the Minnesota Twins. A cellphone video captured several people exchanging punches shortly after 10 p.m. as fans exited the stadium.  Multiple people appeared to be involved in the brawl, which was first reported by KTLA-TV Channel 5. Video shows a crowd formed around those exchanging blows.

Another man can then be seen running to his aid and checking his head.  In the video, Dodger Stadium staff members can be seen circling the scene while keeping their distance.  Johnathon Lopez, 18, witnessed the fight and said it appeared the person on the ground was unconscious. Within a few minutes, an LAPD officer arrived and detained one man, Lopez said. The man on the ground was carried away on a stretcher.  “It definitely appeared that some of the people were buzzed or really intoxicated,” Lopez said, who attended the game with about 60 members of his family to celebrate a cousin’s visit home from the U.S. Air Force.  Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. German Hurtado confirmed that one man was detained and another received medical treatment.  “They didn’t want to press charges on each other,” he said.  None of the parties involved in the fight were willing to cooperate with police, according to the LAPD. The Dodgers declined to comment on the incident.  Lopez said the fight appeared to start when two men bumped into each other as they walked out of the stadium.  “It’s just really embarrassing, because they are adults who are not acting right,” Lopez said. “The stadium should probably put into place some rules for not letting people drink so close to when it’s time to go home, so they can at least sober up.”  This isn’t the first time a fight has broken out among fans following a game at Dodger Stadium.  A San Francisco Giants fan was shot to death in the Dodger Stadium parking lot in September 2003.

But the NFL did the defending Super Bowl champions no favors when creating their schedule for next season. In fact, the league made Kansas City’s schedule one of the NFL’s toughest based on one metric.  According to Warren Sharp of Sharp Football Analysis, the Chiefs have a net rest edge (how many days of rest a team has extra compared to their opponent) of minus-13 next season, which is the third-worst in the NFL. That mainly comes from the Week 12 to Week 17 stretch in which Kansas City has less rest than their opponents for six straight weeks.  Sharp also pointed out that the Chiefs were plus-nine in net rest edge (fifth best) in 2021 and plus-seven (sixth best) in 2022. So, Kansas City’s rest advantage was bound to take a turn at some point.  That metric displays some of the adversity the defending Super Bowl champions will have to overcome next season in an effort to win back-to-back championships.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnMvZmFucy1jbGFzaC1jaGllZnMtYmVuZ2Fscy1zY2hlZHVsZS1taXN0YWtlL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnMvZmFucy1jbGFzaC1jaGllZnMtYmVuZ2Fscy1zY2hlZHVsZS1taXN0YWtlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-03-26","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:06:01","Anand Patel, MD, CPI  Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a consistent pain condition experienced by patients after an acute herpes zoster vesicular eruption has healed. The pain associated with the condition can severely affect a patient's quality of life, quality of sleep, and ability to participate in activities of daily living.1 Some of the treatments that are available do not provide effective pain relief and are associated with adverse events such as somnolence and peripheral edema. LX9211 (Lexicon), a small molecule inhibitor of adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), is currently being investigated as a nonopioid target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.2  Results from a recent multicenter, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of LX9211 showed that the treatment had a consistent reduction in Average Daily Pain Score compared with placebo throughout a 6-week dosing period. These findings were presented as an abstract poster by lead investigator Anand Patel, MD, CPI, at the 2023 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, April 22-27, in Boston, Massachusetts.  Patel, chief medical officer at Conquest Research, sat down with NeurologyLive® after the meeting to discuss how LX9211 performed in the phase 2 study, as well as the different factors that may have influenced the study's results and the interpretation of the data. In addition, Patel talked about the implications of the findings for future research and the development of LX9211 as a neuropathic pain treatment.  NeurologyLive®: Could you provide an overview of the abstract that was presented at AAN 2023?  Anand Patel, MD, CPI: LX9211, an oral once daily, small molecule medication is being positioned as a potential treatment option for neuropathic pain. Recently, Lexicon published the results of a phase 2 study for diabetic painful neuropathy and the results were quite positive for that study. That study also had a sister study, a phase 2 study known as RELIEF-PHN1, that focused on the efficacy and safety of LX9211 in the treatment of post herpetic neuralgia pain. It was a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled study that we were participating in.  What was your objective for conducting this study and the methods?  As I mentioned, it was a phase 2 study, the goal was to test the efficacy and safety of LX9211 in the treatment of patients who suffer from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The drug itself works by inhibiting an enzyme called AAK1, which is intimately involved in a mechanism called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Through a pretty robust preclinical science program, Lexicon has identified LX9211 as a very potent oral medication that inhibits the activity of AAK1 and clinically that translates to potentially reducing neuropathic pain. Patients that were potentially eligible for the study were put through a 2-week screening period. In that screening period, once consent was obtained, patients had various inclusion and exclusion criteria vetted. They had to be male or female and above the age of 18, had to have a diagnosis of PHN at screening, and had to have symptoms present for at least 3 months.  They were not allowed to be on opioids in the 2 months prior to screening, and could not utilize [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] NSAIDs, specifically for their PHN pain 2 weeks prior to screening. But it's important to note that they were allowed to take 1 concomitant neuropathic pain medication while being in the study. Patients who were deemed eligible through screening were then enrolled in a 2-week period called a single blind placebo run-in. The goal here was to collect some important information. They were asked to keep a diary where they documented their average daily pain score, and also documented interference with sleep.  I should note they were allowed to use acetaminophen 3gs for rescue medication if deemed appropriate by the principal investigator. The goal of the diary was not only to identify patients that had adequate pain to qualify for the study—they had to have an average daily pain score of greater than 5 to be eligible—but it was also designed to ensure diary and medication compliance, and to also minimize the enrollment of placebo responders enough so that it would be appropriate for this particular study.  What did you observe in the findings and the implications of those results for this patient population?  The primary endpoint for the study was to determine if the treatment arm had a clinically significant reduction in their average daily pain score after 6 weeks. For this particular study, the primary endpoint was not met. The treatment group had a pain reduction score of 2.42 while the placebo arm had a pain reduction of 1.62. While it did not meet its primary endpoint, there's a couple of important things to identify as potential reasons why.  There was a fairly high dropout rate in the treatment arm which likely skewed the results. That's probably one part of it. The other interesting thing is that in the placebo arm, especially during the week 6 period, which was a very critical time to measure their average daily pain score, there was a very high amount of variability in pain scoring. It appears that the placebo response was higher than expected in the placebo arm and that likely the skewed the data.  I think when you look at the data post hoc analysis, when you graph out how the 2 groups scored over the 6-week period, it was pretty evident that there was a drug signal that occurred fairly quickly. We believe that's because there was a loading dose that's utilized in the treatment arm of 200 mg, which was designed to create a fairly quick therapeutic effect. But that may have actually led to some increased patient withdrawal because of adverse events. The other thing is, when you look at the head-to-head comparisons of the 2 groups on average daily pain score, at week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the separation of the 2 groups was statistically significant. When you look at the average pain scoring across those 6 weeks, and not just the 6-week number alone, that typical significant difference between the 2 groups is also evident. Something about that week 6 data point, the variability in the placebo responders and the diminished volume of patients that remained in the treatment group may have skewed the results away from being significant.  What else do you think should be further investigated in future research with this treatment?  I think Lexicon is certainly rethinking the loading dose. It may not be necessary to implement a loading dose at the beginning, as I think the goal was to achieve a fairly rapid drug signal. While that may have occurred, it may have also potentially led to the onset of adverse events. The optimal way of dosing in further studies is something that’s been revisted. But also, when you take these results, which certainly are open to interpretation, and you couple that with meeting the primary endpoint in the sister study for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, there's certainly compelling evidence that the drug does have potential benefit in treating neuropathic pain. I think for the next study that they design, the goal will be to find out the optimal dosing, and to try to make the best efforts possible to avoid enrollment of placebo responders.  What do you think should be talked about more in the field?  The treatment options that are available for neuropathic pain now have been around for a while. They certainly are recognized as having shortcomings in terms of therapeutic efficacy and the balance of efficacy versus adverse event profile. The space is lacking sorely in terms of having effective treatment options. It's certainly welcome to have a novel molecule enter the space and I think it's very exciting. Specific to this drug, I think it shows tremendous potential. In the previous sister study for diabetic painful neuropathy, not only was the drug tolerated well, but there were no withdrawal effects when the drug was stopped.  When patients entered the single blind placebo washout period, the drug’s signal predictably diminished, indicating that the drug clearly had a benefit. There were no reported adverse events that occurred when the drug was stopped. You're looking at a drug that has potential efficacy. I think if they work out the proper way to dose the drug and find that harmony between efficacy and tolerability that this adverse event profile that was noted in this study, you're talking about a medication that could be positioned as either a first line agent, or potentially as a common medication with other drugs in the space, and really provide value add in terms of treatment options.  The takeaway message is that this is a drug with certainly a lot of potential, although there are kinks [that need to be] worked out. It certainly supports the idea of inhibition of AAK1 as a viable new mechanism of action for treating not just these 2 neuropathic pain conditions, but also other medical conditions that are neuropathic in origin. Thinking chemotherapy induced pain, post-op spasticity related pain after a stroke. There's lots of potential runway for the drug, and most certainly supports further exploration of LX 9211. Personally, I'm very excited about the next tier of studies that are coming out that Lexicon has in plans to further vet the drug for positioning as a viable option.  Transcript edited for clarity.

The fourth quarter was again his domain, as a 23-point eruption propelled his team to a Game 2 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals.  Murray’s fearless showing was not only necessary to avoid a critical home loss, but it also strengthened his grip on a truly remarkable record. He has scored 20 points or more four times in the fourth quarter this postseason, two above Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson for most in the last 25 years. Murray credited all of that visualization as a child for preparing him for crunch time.  “When I was little, I used to count down the seconds off the shot clock and make the shot, and talk like Marv Albert,” he said postgame, per NBA on Twitter. “You see your fam in the crowd, you see your little brother, you see Mike Breen there, all these little reminders.

That peak has been referred to as “Bubble Murray,” but the Canadian native has attributed this reintroduction to just being healthy.

"eruption","2019-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:03:00","On Friday, May 12, curators, art collectors, and politicians gathered at sunset at Pompeii’s Archaeological Park’s small amphitheater, the Piccolo Teatro Odeion, for the premiere of the first work of contemporary art to have been created in situ and presented on location: Wael Shawky’s new film I Am Hymns of the New Temples.  The event launched the historic site near Naples as a magnificent new spot for contemporary art. The ancient city of Pompeii, buried under volcanic ash in 79 AD in the violent eruption of Mount Vesuvius and rediscovered in 1748, is known as a popular tourist magnet of an archeological site. Now, it’s also the latest addition to Italy’s growing landscape of cultural heritage institutions commissioning and exhibiting contemporary art.  Launched in late 2020, Pompeii Commitment is a one-of-a-kind program established by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and the Italian Ministry of Culture that commits, as its name suggests, to presenting new ways of contextualizing the ruins of Pompeii, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with 2.5 million visitors annually. The program acknowledges the site as a rich source of inspiration and material for contemporary artistic endeavors that has remained largely untapped.  The initiator and co-curator of Pompeii Commitment is the visionary Andrea Viliani, who is also in charge of steering Rome’s newly reopened Museum of Civilizations away from its problematic colonial legacy and towards a radical and progressive engagement with its collection. Viliani previously headed Naples’ Madre museum, the contemporary art museum of the southern Italian region of Campania, where Pompeii is located, and had already started laying the foundations for the Pompeii initiative during his tenure there.  Active since its inception in 2020, the contemporary art program Pompeii Commitment has so far introduced several digital contributions by artists including Anri Sala, Alison Katz, Rose Salane, and Miao Ling, with upcoming digital fellowships and productions by Legacy Russell, Formafantasma, and Sissel Tolaas in the pipeline.  “You’re about to see a masterpiece,” gallerist Lia Rumma told me earlier that afternoon during a small gathering at her art-filled Naples residence with views of the islands of Capri and Ischia. The veteran dealer has been working with the Egyptian artist Wael Shawky since 2018, and supported the production in Pompeii.  Sébastien Delot, the director and curator of the LaM museum in Lille, France, also chimed in to tell me that he wasn’t going to pass on the opportunity to be involved with Shawky’s new production: “As soon as I heard is was happening, I raised additional funds.” The approximately one-hour long film I Am Hymns of the New Temples will be on view at Lille’s contemporary art museum later this year. Carlolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the director of Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea and Fondazione Francesco Federico Cerruti in Turin, arrived at the luncheon with a literal bang, as a gust of wind suddenly rose from the Tyrrhenian Sea and blew the front door shut, shattering its milk glass panels just as she walked in.  Christov-Bakargiev is largely to be credited as the curator who brought Shawky’s ambitious practice to a wider audience when she included the first of his three-part epic Cabaret Crusades in Documenta 13, which she curated in 2012 in Kassel and Kabul. There, and in the ensuing two chapters, Shawky presented events and traditions connected to Egypt and the Middle East while questioning unresolvable contrasts of narratives—for example, in looking at the Crusades from an Arab historiographic perspective and using marionettes to portray historical characters.  The new work I am Hymns of the New Temples continues his research into Greek and Roman mythology and how it corresponds to and overlaps with ancient Egyptian cults and traditions. After all, not only temples dedicated to Greek and Roman gods were excavated in Pompeii; the Temple of Isis, dedicated to the Egyptian goddess, with all its stuccoes, states, and frescoes, was discovered there in the 17th century.  As the sun slowly set behind the ruins, and guests including collector Nicoletta Fiorucci, artist Adrian Paci and his wife Melissa, and politicians such as Massimo Osanna, director-general of all public museums run by Italy’s ministry of culture, took their seats in the ancient stone theater, Viliani and Christov-Bakargiev invited Shawky to talk about the film until the night grew dark enough to start the screening.  “I wanted to take out the acting,” Shawky said when asked about his use of puppets in earlier works and elaborate masks in this new production. Here, Shawky uses real-life actors, but all wear ceramic masks designed by the artist and made by the ceramist Pierre Architta and the workshops at the San Carlo Theatre and the Fine Arts Academy in Naples. To complete the characters’ lavish, fantastical appearance, Shawky thought up costumes made of ancient San Leucio silks and other fabrics made by historical Italian textiles manufacturers.  The film, which turns into a musical at times, is narrated entirely in Arabic, and takes the viewers through an abbreviated whirl-wind fable about gods, titans, giant cyclopes, demigods, and men. The colorful, almost psychedelic scenes filled with magical figures and animals were shot on-site in the small Odeon, the Praedia of Giulia Felice, the House of the Orchard, the Necropolis of Nocera Gate and the Basilica, the Temple of the Genius Augusti, and the Temple of Isis. There’s a hippopotamus and a crocodile as well, in reference to the murals of the Nile found in Pompeii that feature the semiaquatic animals. It’s a creation story that ends, much like the site that inspired it, with a natural catastrophe.  “I question history, myths, and stories as a human creation,” Shawky told me after the screening. “My films always try to put everything on top of each other and deal with it, not in a cynical way, but in a very serious, precise degree. Not to the effect that you will really believe the stories, but you will believe and question them at the same time.”  One of the many myths he attempts to unpack with this work is the common understanding of Pompeii in the Arab world as a type of Sodom and Gamora that was destroyed as punishment, and rediscovered as a warning to us all. “For most of the Muslim or the Arab world, they consider Pompeii as the example of the city of sins,” he added. “This is not part of the Islamic mentality, but it’s part of the Quran that there were many other cultures which fell into sin and corruption and were destroyed by God.

But before it can terrorize Earth, we have to face another solar storm threat. Right now, a cloud of coronal mass ejection (CME) is moving towards the Earth, which is expected to deliver glancing blows. It was released after a magnetic filament in the Sun's southern hemisphere erupted. The CME is expected to reach by Sunday, May 21. Check out the details around this incoming solar storm.  According to a report by SpaceWeather.com, “NOAA forecasters say that a CME might deliver a glancing blow to Earth's magnetic field on May 21st. It left the sun yesterday, propelled by an erupting filament of magnetism in the sun's southern hemisphere. The impact could produce minor G1-class geomagnetic storms”.  Solar storm to strike the Earth on Sunday  Compared to some of the stronger solar storm events that we have seen in the month of May, this particular one is not expected to be too strong. However, even minor storms can cause some serious damage. It can disrupt wireless communications and GPS services, causing trouble for airlines, mariners, ham radio controllers, and drone operators. The solar storm can delay flights, cause ships to change course, and disrupt any important information that is shared through these low-frequency channels.  And even after this storm passes, the threat of the large sunspot still looms over the Earth. The sunspot has already exploded once, causing an X-class solar flare eruption. If a flare similar in intensity goes off again, it can produce a really intense solar storm.  NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory's role in predicting solar storms  The NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) carries a full suite of instruments to observe the Sun and has been doing so since 2010. It uses three very crucial instruments to collect data from various solar activities. They include the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) which takes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible solar disk, Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) which measures the Sun's extreme ultraviolet irradiance and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) which provides continuous full-disk observations of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9kYW5nZXJvdXMtc29sYXItc3Rvcm0tdG8tc3RyaWtlLWVhcnRoLW9uLXN1bmRheS1yZXZlYWxzLW5vYWEtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLTcxNjg0NDY1NjExODk3Lmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaC9uZXdzL2Rhbmdlcm91cy1zb2xhci1zdG9ybS10by1zdHJpa2UtZWFydGgtb24tc3VuZGF5LXJldmVhbHMtbm9hYS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtNzE2ODQ0NjU2MTE4OTcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:54:56","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The executive committee of Minnesota’s Democratic Farmer Labor Party gave initial approval on Thursday to bylaws that would permanently ban anyone who engages in or incites acts of violence from participating in party activities, after a weekend endorsing convention for a Minneapolis City Council seat erupted in chaos.  The executive committee also agreed Thursday that if those bylaws receive final approval from the DFL State Central Committee, the candidate whose supporters are accused of instigating the Saturday melee will be permanently disqualified from seeking and receiving the party’s endorsement.  Ken Martin, chair of the state Democratic Party organization, called the melee that erupted Saturday night “unacceptable.” The DFL is an affiliate of the state Democratic Party.  Video circulating on social media shows that the disturbance began after supporters of incumbent Aisha Chughtai took the stage to seek delegates’ backing for the Ward 10 City Council seat. That sparked an uproar among backers of her challenger, Nasri Warsame. Some jumped on stage, shouting, banging on tables and waving signs. At least two people were injured and the convention broke up with no endorsement.  Martin said on Twitter that it was “clear that the conflict was instigated” by Warsame supporters. He continued to place the blame on some of Warsame’s supporters on Thursday.  Martin said some mistakes were made, but “none of those mistakes, big or small. justify a few bad actors from the Warsame campaign taking things into their own hands and inciting, encouraging and participating in violence against other DFL participants.”  With unanimous votes, the executive committee approved two bylaws that would essentially ban individuals who have “engaged in, incited or consciously condoned physical assault, threats of violence, or violent acts” from party activities.  The first would immediately and permanently disqualify an individual from seeking the party’s endorsement if they or their campaign supporters engage in such acts. The second would permanently ban an individual who carried out such acts from any elected or appointed position within the party, including serving as a delegate or alternate to a convention.  Pending final approval of those bylaws, the executive committee said Warsame would be permanently disqualified from seeking and receiving DFL endorsement or letters of support for any future office. Martin clarified that this does not mean Warsame can’t run for office. But if he does, he won’t get backing from the DLF Party.  “Disagreements over how a convention was run is not an excuse for violence. Not understanding the convention process is not an excuse for violence,” Martin said. He later added, “The reality is, if we don’t act, this will just embolden people in the future to use this as a tactic to essentially force conventions to adjourn.”  Warsame did not immediately reply Thursday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.  Warsame and Chughtai are Democrats in an overwhelmingly Democratic city when campaigns for party backing are often heated. Warsame, a political newcomer, is a Somali immigrant.  Chughtai is a longtime activist who managed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s 2018 campaign. She is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants and has support from some prominent Somali American politicians, including Omar and state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, and other Muslims, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.  Chughtai has endorsements from a long list of progressive and labor groups, including the Democratic Socialists of America. Warsame has campaigned on a law-and-order message.  Warsame said at a news conference Wednesday: “I do not condone violence. I do not condone intimidation or harassment of any sort.” Before Thursday’s closed-door session, Warsame’s campaign manager, Abshir Omar, told the executive committee that he supports Martin’s message condemning the violence, but that he was disheartened by statements that blamed Warsame supporters, saying party officials never contacted the campaign to get their side of the story.  Samuel Doten, who chaired Saturday’s convention, told the committee that the chaos unfolded due to the actions of about five to 10 people, and that it was not representative of all of Warsame’s supporters. He urged the committee to avoid disenfranchising the Somali community from participating in the process.  Chughtai released a statement on Wednesday saying the video does not match the Warsame campaign’s version of events.  “Campaigns that are winning and have the support of the people don’t violently disrupt the process,” she said. “As a campaign and as a movement, we’re on the path to a safer, more just Minneapolis and we look forward to continuing to share that vision with the people of Ward 10.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50d2luY2l0aWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2FmdGVyLWNvbnZlbnRpb24tY2hhb3MtbWlubmVzb3RhLWRmbC1jb21taXR0ZWUtZ2l2ZXMtaW5pdGlhbC1ub2QtdG8tYmFuLXRob3NlLWVuZ2FnZWQtaW4tdmlvbGVuY2Uv0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYWZ0ZXItY29udmVudGlvbi1jaGFvcy1taW5uZXNvdGEtZGZsLWNvbW1pdHRlZS1naXZlcy1pbml0aWFsLW5vZC10by1iYW4tdGhvc2UtZW5nYWdlZC1pbi12aW9sZW5jZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Today’s print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews, report that the Nerazzurri will arrive in Istanbul on June 8, two days prior to the final at the Ataturk Istanbul Stadium.  Everything is all confirmed – Inter and Manchester City will face each other for European club football’s biggest prize.  The final will be at the Ataturk Stadium on the tenth of next month, a Saturday.  Now, a little more than three weeks away from the match, Inter’s schedule for the week before that match has been made clear.  Inter Milan To Train In Italy Then Fly To Istanbul Two Days Before Man City Clash  According to Tuttosport, Inter’s plan is to train in Milan for most of the week prior to their match against City.  The Nerazzurri’s final Serie A match of the season will be just under a week before the Champions League final. Inter will be in Turin to face Torino on June 4, a Sunday.  After that, Inter will have six days in which to prepare for the final against City.  According to Tuttosport, the Nerazzurri will spend the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh working at their official training centre in Milan.  Then, on the eighth, the squad will travel to Istanbul. There, they will get settled in, get a sense of the Ataturk Stadium, and continue training for the final.  Additionally, the Nerazzurri coach and players will do their media duties whilst in the Turkish capital.  Jose Mourinho Had Inter Travel Even Earlier During 2010 Treble Season  As Tuttosport, Jose Mourinho’s Inter had travelled to the final even earlier when they won the Treble.  In the 2009-10 season, the Nerazzurri coach decided to arrive in Madrid on the Wednesday before the final rather than the Thursday. This was because of a volcanic eruption in Iceland which had made air travel unreliable.  Barcelona had famously had to travel to Milan by coach during the first leg of that season’s semifinals. Mourinho wanted to make sure Inter were in Madrid with plenty of time to spare so they could settle in.  However, no such concerns are affecting the Nerazzurri this time around.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS9zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmV2ZWFsZWRfaW50ZXJfbWlsYW5fc2NoZWR1bGVfZm9yX3dlZWtfYmVmb3JlX2NoYW1waW9uc19sZWFndWVfZmluYWxfdnNfbWFuX2NpdHkvczFfMTcxMzBfMzg4MjgxMTbSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWFyZGJhcmtlci5jb20vc29jY2VyL2FydGljbGVzL2FtcC9yZXZlYWxlZF9pbnRlcl9taWxhbl9zY2hlZHVsZV9mb3Jfd2Vla19iZWZvcmVfY2hhbXBpb25zX2xlYWd1ZV9maW5hbF92c19tYW5fY2l0eS9zMV8xNzEzMF8zODgyODExNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","1980-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 14:02:12","For generations, song-makers have borrowed from life to craft tunes, taking even the most difficult of disasters and setting them to song. Maybe as a way of coping, maybe as a form of chronicling, these songs become memories that outlive any headline. The events they’re based on, however sad and desperate, become forever trapped in the amber of a melody. Here are 6 songs that were written about real-life disasters.  Videos by American Songwriter  [RELATED: The Top 10 Deep Cut Rocks Songs from the 1990s]  1. “When the Levee Breaks” – Led Zeppelin  If it keeps on raining, the levee’s going to break / When the levee breaks, we’ll have no place to stay, plays the Led Zeppelin classic, “When the Levee Breaks,” set to an ominous beat and crying harmonica.  The song was originally written and recorded by blues duo Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie. The pair wrote the tune in 1929 not long after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 had claimed hundreds of lives and affected thousands more who were forced to evacuate the Mississippi Delta area.  2. “Cities in Dust” – Siouxsie and the Banshees  Water was running, children were running / You were running out of time / Under the mountain, a golden fountain / Were you praying at the Lares’ shrine? / But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend, plays the dance-pop hit, “Cities in Dust,” from Siouxsie and the Banshees.  The cryptic lyrics describe what happened to the city of Pompeii, the ancient site of a volcanic eruption that buried the city and several hundreds of its inhabitants in molten rock and ash.  3. “Springhill Mining Disaster” – The Dubliners  In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia / Down in the dark of the Cumberland Mine / There’s blood on the coal / And the miners lie / In roads that never saw sun or sky, opens the solemn Dubliners’ tune, “Springhill Mining Disaster.”  Chillingly chronicling any one of the three mining disasters that plagued Nova Scotia’s Springhill coalfield in 1891, 1956, and 1958, the Dubliners’ song is haunting as the Irish folk band bellows Bone and blood is the price of coal.  With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more / Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty / That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed / When the gales of November came early, warns Gordon Lightfoot in his legendary song story, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.”  The song was written and released less than a year after the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in 1975. It details the carrier ship’s final voyage and the loss of its entire crew.  5. “The Titanic (When That Great Ship Went Down)” – Pete Seeger  It was sad when that great ship went down / It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down / Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives / It was sad when that great ship went down, Pete Seeger sings to a chipper strum.  That great ship he sang of was the passenger liner Titanic, which struck an iceberg while traveling across the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912. It sunk and took an estimated 1,500 lives with it.  6. “We Didn’t Start The Fire” – Billy Joel  We didn’t start the fire / It was always burning / Since the world’s been turning / We didn’t start the fire / No, we didn’t light it But we tried to fight it, sings Billy Joel in “We Didn’t Start The Fire.”  The song isn’t about one disaster, but decades worth of them rolled into one song. Written as a way to chronicle what had occurred in Joel’s lifetime up until the age of 40, “We Didn’t Start The Fire” is rife with images of war, nuclear weaponry, division, and destruction. Marilyn Monroe and triumphant baseball teams also make an appearance in the song, but overall it is a whiplash-inducing list of tragedies that shaped the world in the latter half of the 20th century.

Rolph, who is nearing completion of an undergraduate degree in Earth sciences in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology ( SOEST ), has completed a certificate in women, gender, and sexuality studies focused on queer studies, and will soon begin Khmer language classes.  “Ever since I spent a summer on the Big Island remodeling a house with my family, I planned on returning to Hawaiʻi,” said Rolph. “The extensive research opportunities at UH , as well as the beautiful beaches and mountains all drew me here, but it’s the people who I have found community with here that make me want to stay.”  In SOEST , Rolph has been working as a lab assistant with Earth sciences professor Bruce Houghton. They analyze the density of various rock types, such as scoria and reticulite, from Kīlauea volcano and assist with Caroline Tisdale’s research by doing imaging work on ultra HD video footage of a Kīlauea vent eruption to determine how the velocities of rock fragments changed over time.  “I’ve enjoyed being in the Earth sciences department,” said Rolph. “With such a small department, it was easier to develop relationships with faculty members as well as my peers. I am thankful to my advisor Sloan Coats for being very supportive of my interests and patiently helping me troubleshoot registration every semester.”  Passion for languages  Another passion of Rolph’s is learning new languages, a pathway for delving into new cultures. Growing up in California, Rolph attended a dual immersion elementary school from kindergarten to sixth grade where many classmates and teachers spoke Spanish, often as their first language. Through much travel and living in Spain for three months, Rolph’s curiosity grew and they continued with Spanish language courses in high school and during community college.  “Because of UH ’s unique placement between Asia and America, I became very interested in utilizing the multitude of eastern language classes offered here,” Rolph said. “I took two introductory Korean language courses in 2022 and just registered to take Khmer 101 in the fall. My interest in learning Khmer stems from my family, as I am half Cambodian and much of my family speaks Khmer as a first language. I am really excited to be able to talk to my family in Khmer!”  Understanding identity, relationships, the world  In a new program offered at UH Mānoa, Rolph completed a queer studies certificate that requires students to take courses that apply critical thinking skills to explore topics of sex, sexuality, gender, feminism and queer theory.  “As a mixed race, nonbinary, bisexual human, exploring these topics is very important to my understanding of my identity, my relationships and the world around me,” Rolph shared. “These courses as well as my individual scholarship of queer theory has provided me with the tools I need to remain critical of systems of oppression, yet be able to imagine a future for myself and my community where our needs are met and our intimate relationships with each other and the Earth are healthy and generative.”  In fall 2023, Rolph will be graduating and hopes to find employment as a hydrogeologist or volcanologist at the Oʻahu Board of Water Supply or the Hawaiʻi Volcano Observatory.  “I would also be very happy with a job as an environmental consultant or working in conservation doing the important work of preserving our precious natural resources,” they added. “After a couple years working in the field, I hope to get into graduate school and pursue a master’s degree.”  –By Marcie Grabowksi","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2RpdmVyc2UtaW50ZXJlc3RzLWtheWxleS1yb2xwaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

SEE Exclusive Video Interview: Murray Bartlett (‘Welcome to Chippendales’)  “Welcome to Chippendales” was created by Robert Siegel (“Pam & Tommy”), inspired by the book “Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders” by K. Scot Macdonald and Patrick MontesDeOca. It stars Oscar and Emmy nominee Kumail Nanjiani as Steve Banerjee, who founded the famed Chippendales stripper troupe. The limited series charts his rise from an ambitious immigrant gas station attendant to entrepreneur and his fall from grace as he masterminds the murder of his business partner and ultimate rival, Emmy-winning choreographer Nick De Noia, portrayed by Emmy winner Bartlett (“The White Lotus”). The glitzy and tawdry semi-autobiographical drama also co-stars Oscar and Emmy nominee Juliette Lewis (“Cape Fear,” “Hysterical Blindness”), Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford (“You Can’t Take it With You”), Tony nominees Andrew Rannells (“The Book of Mormon,” “Falsettos”) and Robin de Jesús (“In the Heights,” “La Cage aux Folles,” “The Boys in the Band”), as well as breakthrough performer Quentin Plair (“Tiny Beautiful Things”).  On a series like “Welcome to Chippendales,” so much rides on the look and feel of the iconic titular club. Bloom was well aware that the pressure was on to deliver something aesthetically exciting, historically appropriate and with enough practical utility to give the cast and crew room to breathe and create something memorable. “With a with a true-life story, there’s obviously so many real photos you can reference,” he explains. “We knew that we this season was going to take place over 10 years, so we needed to build a set that not only would feel real, but also we could morph and have it changed throughout the 10 years. I did a ton of research. I wanted it to feel like something that actually you would have seen in real life had you been in the eighties and in one of the clubs here in Culver City. But I knew that it also would need to be a little bit more dynamic,” he says.  “There was going to be a lot of scenes up in his office and basically, this story with Steve is he’s a man about money and he is driven by money and greed and power, whereas Nick’s arc is he’s driven by his artistic license and his artistic vision. So, knowing that Steve was all about money where that safe is, and where that office was, we knew that was going to have to have a connection to the real club. That’s when early on I knew I wanted to do a two-story club, and I knew that once you get inside of an office a lot of times it can feel so cramped, so I wanted to keep that that magical element to this bizarre story,” Bloom explains. “The concept was to have to have the lights of the club, which started out as a disco, always outside of that window of that office. So, in one direction you might see him against wood paneling and a desk. But then the other direction, you would see the hopes and dreams, and the beautiful reflections.”  PREDICT the 2023 Emmy nominees through July 12  Make your predictions at Gold Derby now.

"eruption","2023-07-13","Not Discerned","{""SaintLouis"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:50:18","ST. LOUIS – Don’t think the only pests that you have to worry about during the summer months are insects. Rodents can destroy a yard or even take up residence inside your home if not detected early.  Homeowners spend thousands of dollars annually maintaining their lawns, but mammals living underground can quickly trash it. Now is the time you’ll start to notice them.  “A lot of moles. It’s breeding season. It starts late December and runs through mid-to-late spring; at that point, you’re seeing a lot of movement,” said Joshua Paske, Paske Pest Control and Wildlife. “So, they stay with mom up to 12 weeks while they nurse, then they scatter.”  Paske says you must manage your property year-round.  “You’ve got a population density that you want to manage, and they’ll come out of the wood line, they’ll move about your yard,” he said. “They’ll come under the street from your neighbor’s house. So, you’re just passing them back and forth.”  When you see what’s known as a mole run, eradicate it before it becomes a bigger problem.  “There is a whole science behind it. There are mole runs that are like their highways. There are little tester routes that they go in and test to see if the food is the right answer for them in that area, so you’ll see what looks like a dead end run if you will,” Paske said.  Managing these moles is usually best left to the professionals, so ask for help before it gets out of hand.  “Getting a professional who knows the different species who can look at the markings the trails the eruptions, the size of the eruptions. Can also help speed up recovery or the idea of how much damage you’re going to get to your yard,” he said.  Not only can rodents living underground destroy your yard but ones above ground can take up space around and even inside your home squirrels and even raccoons are common culprits.  “They’ll chew in what we call the arm pits or elbows of a house where rooflines meet each other. They’ll sit up in there, get away from the sun,” Paske said. “They chew through aluminum. Your home is generally not protected against squirrels under any circumstances. They will chew right in.”  What’s extra problematic about wildlife is that they’ll come back to your home year after year.  “If the mama had a baby or a nest of babies there and you don’t get them out of there before they scatter, they’re going to come back there next year and build again,” he said.  In the end, the location of your property might be the greatest factor in which kind of unwelcomed visitors attempt to invade.  “It’s more about where your home backs to or what your surroundings are,” Paske said. “A lot of it has to do with how entrenched or how seasoned or how senior is the property, or the area that we’re working in.”  But regardless of where you live, pay attention to all the wildlife this summer, both up in the trees and underground. And, inevitably, evict those pesky critters for the season.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy93ZWF0aGVyL2hvdy10by1rZWVwLW1vbGVzLWF3YXktZnJvbS15b3VyLXlhcmQtdGhpcy1zdW1tZXIv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3gybm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlYXRoZXIvaG93LXRvLWtlZXAtbW9sZXMtYXdheS1mcm9tLXlvdXIteWFyZC10aGlzLXN1bW1lci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Thu 18 May 2023 08:25:54","With the Gaza crisis in the rearview mirror, a new crisis is only a matter of time. And for an Israeli government whose lone achievement is to keep Israelis on their toes, awaiting the next eruption of political fireworks, the annual budget is an opportunity to demonstrate its unique character. What’s wrong with the budget, you may ask? The better question would be: what’s good about it? It is based on unrealistic assumptions, has little to offer when it comes to resolving long term challenges, and is especially, distinctively bold in handing what Americans tend to call “pork,” only in Israel’s case pork might not be the proper term, as the allocations in question are generously handed out to serve ultra-Orthodox interests.  The Finance Ministry warned this week that what the government intends to do is likely to weaken Israel’s economy. “Increasing the support for Yeshivah institutions and the distribution of food stamps … will increase the incentive for non-participation in employment…” the professional team explained in a letter. It is not the usual habit of professional government officials to pen a letter in which the policy of the government is interpreted in such a negative light. But the men and women of the Finance Ministry seemed to think that they have no choice. Informing the public that what the government is doing has the potential to harm Israel’s well-being is the bare minimum for an honest public servant.  What is the government doing? It is allocating many billions, some say 10, some say 12, to achieve the following things: more allocations to tens of thousands of Yeshiva students who study Torah all day rather than go to work. Distributing food stamps to communities who are eligible for local tax discount – mostly ultra-Orthodox. Eliminating the demand that schools must teach basic skills to get equal funds, thus adding billions to Haredi schools.  The government still says that it strives to increase the share of Haredi men in the workforce, but everything it does seems to counter such stated intention.  The government still says that it strives to increase the share of Haredi men in the workforce (it is currently slightly higher than 50%, compared to more than 80% in other communities), but everything the government does seems to counter such stated intention. “The increase in the employment rate of ultra-Orthodox men is the main potential for growth … from a labor-market viewpoint,” the professionals wrote. That is to say: What the government is doing is the opposite of pushing for growth. Giving more to Haredi schools “without supervision” and in which “basic skills” are not taught “will lead to a widening of the skill gap and an impairment of [Haredi] participation in the work force.”  The more one thinks about this policy the more enraged or desperate one becomes. A commentator in Haaretz, known for her no-nonsense approach to economic affairs, wrote that “the funds approved by Netanyahu are a death sentence for Israel.” And of course, it might be a little premature to wrap up and declare that the end is around the corner, and yet, the sentiment is based on evidence. If the government is actively encouraging the empowerment of the least productive sector in Israel, whose rate of demographic growth is staggeringly high, the future indeed seems bleak. A poorer Israel is going to be a weaker Israel, and a weaker Israel cannot survive in a tough neighborhood.  And we didn’t even touch the other repercussions of such a budget. The moral travesty of letting the ultra-Orthodox evade the military draft; the emotional stress of secular Israelis who might feel they have no future in their own country; the devastation of the national education system whose requirements are no longer more than a recommendation; the growing suspicion of center-left Israelis that Jewishness is something they must reject.  For a week of fighting in Gaza, it was easy to forget about all the other urgent challenges that Israel faces. What an irony – an eruption of violence gave us some room to breathe, a temporary respite from the bickering and the contentious debate that characterizes 2023 Israel.  But now it is all back: The failure – thus far – to reach a compromise concerning legal reforms; the wasteful, anti-growth budget; the bad mouthing of political rivals; the dismissive tone directed at concerned citizens; the daily reminders that Israel is headed in a direction that would make it a place that many of its citizens might consider inhabitable.  Something I wrote in Hebrew  There is nothing less useful than saying that we need to “think outside the box” about Gaza. In general, thinking outside the box is overrated … what one finds outside the box, are mainly delusional, dangerous, kooky ideas … In Gaza the players are known, the interests are fixed, the arenas do not change. One can offer many ideas about Gaza, and few practical ideas about Gaza. Applicability is a necessary ingredient. And there is another necessary element: a reasonable level of risk. That is, there is no point in proposing a creative idea that could lead to devastation.  A week’s numbers  The operation in Gaza was good – politically speaking – for the coalition and boosted Netanyahu’s numbers. But it was short, and in two weeks, could be forgotten.  A reader’s response:  Erez Katz asked: “Why is Israel only bombing Islamic Jihad and not Hamas, who rules Gaza?”  Answer: It is a good question. Many experts feel that Israel is too soft with Hamas, because of its reluctance to destabilize the situation within Gaza (someone needs to be in control).  Shmuel Rosner is senior political editor.

One teacher in Warrington said that there were tears from some students in the exam hall due to the difficulty of the reading paper.  As per TES, this year's reading paper consisted of three texts, amounting to 2,106 words, to be read and have questions answered on in one hour.  TES magazine said: ""This means reading the booklet alone would take 23 minutes and 30 seconds, leaving just 36 minutes and 30 seconds to answer the test questions.""  When asked for opinions on this year's SATs reading paper, Warrington Guardian readers had mixed opinions.  One parent, Vicki Thomas, said: ""My daughter did them, she said they weren't too bad compared to her mock sats, her only comments were the reading paper was not an interesting story and the second maths reasoning was harder than the first.  ""I guess only time will tell when we get the results and can compare the two.  ""As long as she tried her best that's all I can ask.""  This echoes similar sentiments expressed by the Department for Education at the time the row erupted, when it said that SATs were 'meant to be challenging,' despite criticism from teachers.  Another reader, Callum Waughy, explained that the educational gaps due to Covid-19 should not be overlooked: ""I think the difficulty of the SATs is reasonable considering the ability and potential of children.  ""The issue is that they've not taken into consideration that almost two years of school was missed.  ""That's essentially year 6s at a year 4 level.  ""Two years of prep for these SATs down the drain.""  Suzanne Green echoed this, saying: ""They were shocking considering they lost almost two years of school due to Covid-19.""  Today was not acceptable. I cannot believe what we put our 10 and 11 year old children through for the government. SATS must go. Today I have written to my MP and urge you to do the same. @NAHTnews @NAHTCheshire @simonkidwell @edwardtimpson pic.twitter.com/xmWbzjxfAT — Kerry Forrester (@ForresterKerry) May 10, 2023  Eleanor Haines added: ""I've always felt that SATS are for the school and not for the children.""  Responding to Eleanor, Sarah Kirkham-Slack said: ""They're not even for the schools really, they're so the Government can rank everyone and see who's 'failing'.""  On the flip side, Dawn Wilkinson said: ""My son did his last week, he has an Educational Healthcare Plan and attends an SEMH [Social, Emotional and Mental Health] school.  ""I was really proud of him and he said his were fine.""  Meanwhile, schools minister Nick Gibb has acknowledged the difficulty of the SATs exams, and has pledged to review the controversial reading paper.  Mr Gibb said: ""I will certainly look at this, because I know that there has been concern expressed by some schools.  “They do have to test a range of ability to make sure we can show what proportion of children are exceeding the standards and so on. But we don’t want these tests to be too hard for children. That’s not the purpose.  “The purpose is to test the range of ability and the Standards and Testing Agency is charged with making sure that these tests are appropriate for this age group.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcnJpbmd0b25ndWFyZGlhbi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIzNTI5MDM1LndhcnJpbmd0b24tcGFyZW50cy1lcnVwdC1zaG9ja2luZy1zYXRzLWV4YW0tcGFwZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For some time now he has come to the conclusion that his geographical education was not complete with a mere knowledge of the map of the United States, with a glance, now and then, at the general maps of North and South America. Of course, the United States is a big proposition. We in the United States think this country is the biggest proposition on the face of the Earth. And it is pretty hard to successfully dispute that idea at that! But there are some other big propositions in this world — especially in the Old World. And Uncle Sam, who — before the World War — principally concerned himself with gazing in admiration on the map of the United States and reading and rereading the Monroe Doctrine, had rather got into the frame of mind that looking at any other map and reading any other kind of literature was a sheer waste of time — if it were not positive treason. But the war woke him up.”  ***  ON THIS DAY IN 1937, the Eagle reported, “LOS ANGELES (AP) — Plans to picket ‘every theater in the Chicago area this week’ were made by striking film craftsmen today in their campaign for a nation-wide boycott. Effectiveness of the picketing was shown, officials said, by pleas they received from southern California theater owners that the marchers be withdrawn. The leaders declared they had no intention of withdrawing the pickets and were pressing their campaign in the larger cities. Violence followed the return to work yesterday of 300 men from the machinists and culinary crafts.

The story of the prehistoric culture which has lain unknown since its last inhabitants left centuries ago was told by Berwil C. Putnam, Arizona’s ‘peregrinating postman,’ who returned recently after spending 29 days in the Superstitions.

Changing concepts of mental illness and its treatment have resulted in an increased emphasis on preventive and community psychiatry. A number of psychiatric disciplines, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, are staffing these community-oriented programs. However, the role of the psychiatric nurse has been traditionally limited to inpatient psychiatric facilities.

"eruption","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 09:54:10","In 2015, in Paris, the nations of the world committed themselves to trying their best to prevent the planet warming by more than 1.5°C from its pre-industrial state. Even at the time, the goal looked ambitious. In recent years, it has come to seem almost impossible.  On May 17th the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), an arm of the United Nations, added to the gloom. It said there was a 66% chance that the world would exceed the 1.5°C threshold in at least one of the next five years. That is a big jump from its estimates of even a year ago, when the WMO assessed the likelihood at 48%. Even if the 1.5°C target is not breached, the WMO thinks it is virtually certain that one of the coming five years will be the hottest in human history. (That record is now held by 2016, which was 1.28°C warmer than the pre-industrial average.)  Optimists point out even if the 1.5°C threshold is exceeded, it will only be temporary, and the Paris agreement will not technically be breached—yet. (That would require exceeding the target for several years.) The rise will be temporary because for the next few years the rising level of human-driven warming will be amplified further by natural, but transient, changes.  The biggest of those variations is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a natural cycle of warming and cooling in the waters of the eastern Pacific ocean that has widespread effects on the climate. The world has just seen three consecutive “La Niña"" years, the name given to the cooler phase of the cycle, helping hold global temperatures down. It now seems almost certain that a warmer “El Niño"" phase will begin sometime later this year, setting up 2024 to be a scorcher. (One reason for the 2016 record is that the year coincided with an especially strong El Niño.)  But the ENSO is not the only factor. An additional temporary nudge could come from the eruption last year of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, near Tonga. It was one of the biggest eruptions since that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in the 1990s, and injected an estimated 146m tonnes of water vapour into the stratosphere. Water vapour, like carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas. Unlike carbon dioxide, it will gradually fall out of the stratosphere over the next few years. But Stuart Jenkins, a climatologist at Oxford University, reckons that while it persists it could increase the odds of passing 1.5°C by a few percentage points.  Some tentatively encouraging signs gleam amid the gloom. Global emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels seem to have gone sideways for several years, leading some researchers to speak cautiously of a possible peak. RystadEnergy, a Norwegian think-tank, predicted earlier this year that global emissions of carbon dioxide from industry could peak in 2025 and then begin a slow decline.  But so far, despite the warm words, the world’s actions still fall far short of its promises. Even the upper end of the goals agreed in Paris—of limiting warming to “well below 2°C""—will be achievable only with drastic action. For Europe and America to meet their commitments, for instance, would require them to switch off all their fossil-fired power plants within the next three decades.  And simply stopping emissions will not be enough. Somewhere between 3.5bn and 5.4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide will need to be sucked out of the atmosphere every year, rising to 4.7bn to 9.8bn tonnes within 30 years. All that is a big ask, to put it mildly. But the optimist’s take might be that the psychological impact of breaching the 1.5°C goal, even if only temporarily, could help focus minds.  © 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

"eruption","2004-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 05:04:28","COMMUNITY  By JAMES G KILA  A UNIQUE traditional dance called ‘Tarangau’ was performed last Sunday, May 14 by male dancers from Yassa village originally of Manam island, Bogia disrict of Madang with a special significance.  Yassa village elder, Charles Basse, who now acts as spokesperson for the local chiefs commonly referred to as kukurai on Manam island, explained that the dance was traditionally performed to welcome food such as garden produce or a pig for a feast arriving in their locality.  The Tarangau dance was indeed fitting performed at an occasion at Tabele primary school situated in Postdam care centre which hosts displaced Manam islanders following the volcanic eruption in 2004.  Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa was present on the day to deliver 20 tonnes of rice from Indonesia to the islanders living in care centres on the mainland in Bogia and Sumkar district. It was quite a coincidence that the event also fell on Mothers’ Day and the rations although not sufficient would be shared by the mothers and children who are in dire need for food supplies.  Pariwa thanked the government of Papua province and the people of Papua province and Indonesia for their generous humanitarian aid and actually recognising the plight of his people who are internally displaced.  The young governor stressed that in the last 18 years successive national and provincial governments had miserably failed to put needed resources to fast-track the resettlement exercise of the Manam islanders following the volcanic eruption that had caused them to flee to the mainland.  The governor was emotional stating that if the PNG government could see fit to host foreign refugees such as the asylum seekers and have them housed in comfortable hotels in Port Moresby and roaming the streets, why was it not placing utmost priority on the Manam islanders who are PNG’s very own internally displayed people.  That merely displayed the local government’s negligence and shows irresponsibility on its obligation towards its own citizens.  Pariwa explained that the 20 metric tonnes of rice was part of a humanitarian assistance by the Papua province of Indonesia to maintain the sister-province relations with Madang province, and announced that another 50 tonnes would be arriving later.  He remarked that if a foreign government can recognise the desperate plight of the people, while our own government does not seem to fast-track aid to the Manam islanders living at care centres at Postdam, Asuramba and Mangem is a crying shame.  Consequently the arrangement for rice donation from Papua province was done through the Momase Governor’s Council Secretariat in 2019 following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a sister province relations.  A delegation from the Papua province led by Ibu Sussie Waingal was in Madang last month to deliver the rice and met with the Madang Governor, Mr. Pariwa to seal the deal for the assistance to take place.  It was indeed a thrill for the Madang Governor Pariwa to travel along the north coast road and on to Bogia by road leading a container truck ferrying the 20 tonnes of rice all way to Jogari village where the presentation event took place.  Kenny Boli, the president of Iabu LLG which covers Manam island welcomed the Madang governor and a delegation from the Momase Governors Council Secretariat and a number of Madang provincial assembly members.  Boli said the people were expecting the rice delivery some weeks earlier and anticipated an Indonesian team or the Ambassador for that matter arriving.  However, to have the Madang governor present was an honour and goes to show that the leader has a genuine concern and the heart to help the Manam islanders and hopefully bail them out from their current predicament.  “We Manam islanders are pretenders. We have thousands of issues facing us in the current misery we’re living with but we don’t openly show it. We sustain ourselves on the mini canteens and food vendors to sustain our livelihood since we fled to come live on foreign shores here on the mainland,” Boli said.  However, he highlighted that Manam islanders desperately need to be resettled so they could sustain their lives and that of their future generation and it is upon both provincial and the national government to assist and facilitate.  An assistant director with the Momase Governors’ Council Secretariat, Julie Ariako explained that in 2019 a delegation from Madang travelled to Papua province where a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between both governments to establish a sister-provinces relation.  Ariako further clarified that at that time when they were about to sign the instruments news from home was that the Manam volcano had erupted.  During that time the governor of Papua province announced that they would help with sending a humanitarian aid of 50 tonnes of rice to the Manam islanders.  However, since that MoU signing there were other issues including the Covid-19 pandemic that prolonged the shipment of rice to Madang until this year.  Shipping company Bismark Maritime, out of kindness and generosity, helped in transporting the container with the rice from Indonesia free-of-charge to Madang.  A director from the Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA), Ferdinand Kaungeri said: “Our culture and traditions are gradually fading, sadly though our young people no longer respect our elders like they used to when we were back on the island.”  Governor Pariwa assured the islanders that their current plight and future resettlement were an important agenda for his administration.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS5wZy9wcm92aW5jZS1oZWxwcy1pc2xhbmRlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They also marched from MUST University to Chowk Shaheedan in Mirpur city of AJK on Thursday. The students of Mirpur University of Science and Technology were chanting slogans like “Boycott Boycott G-20 Boycott,” and ” Indian tyrants leave Jammu Kashmir”.  While addressing the rally, Chairman Pasban-e-Hurriyat Uzair Ahmad Ghazali said that holding a meeting of the G-20 in a disputed state recognized by the United Nations is an open violation of the rules of the international organization. He urged that the permanent members of the Security Council must boycott the meetings in the disputed state as the 4.4 million people of the state not only reject the proposed meetings of the Bharatiya Janata Party government hosted by Narendra Modi, but also call it Indian nefarious agenda to divert world’s attention from deteriorating situation towards normalcy. He maintained that India wants to prove its forced sovereignty over the state by conducting this summit.  Dr. Mirza Aslam said the proposed meeting in Srinagar and Leh might lead to the deprivation of civil liberties in Jammu and Kashmir. “G-20 countries should reject Indian military and political motives behind the meetings”, he added.

Pic: Getty/Nine  Rugby league fans have taken to social media in droves after a bizarre incident between the NRL Bunker and the referee in Penrith's 15-4 win over Brisbane on Thursday night. Nathan Cleary became the youngest player to notch 1300 points in the NRL as the Panthers halfback helped his side record a third straight victory.  The win took the two-time defending premiers to the top of the table, with the only sour note being Jarome Luai's contact with touch judge Chris Sutton, which could come under further scrutiny. It was by no means the only incident of note involving the officials at Suncorp Stadium, with referee Adam Gee caught up in a strange moment with Bunker official Ashley Klein in the second half.  'UNNECESSARY': Braith Anasta spills on ugly Bennett saga with Munster  'HE'S DECIDED': Huge Jason Ryles twist in Dragons coaching saga  'FRUSTRATED': Ben Hunt in Dragons 'divorce' twist as coach sacked  Klein cleared contact by Brisbane fullback Reece Walsh on Penrith centre Tyrone Peachey, over what would have been a try to Kotoni Staggs from a towering kick. Replays showed Walsh was looking at Peachey the whole time as he ran towards the Penrith player and only turned to try and catch the footy after jumping into his opponent.  ANOTHER one overturned! 😱    Fatty might lose his marbles tonight if there are any more Bunker interventions! 😆    🖥️ #NRLBroncosPanthers | https://t.co/ksmCzZvODf#9WWOS #NRL pic.twitter.com/GWGT3FWh7G — NRL on Nine (@NRLonNine) May 18, 2023  Gee had initially ruled it a no-try and despite Klein clearing it in the Bunker, the whistleblower could be heard saying, ""It doesn't look right to me Ash,"" as he watched the replays again on the big screen. Klein looked at it again and ruled Walsh had illegally contacted Peachey, meaning the correct call was eventually made, despite the Bunker having to be overruled to get there.  Story continues  Broncos coach Walters admitted he was left a little perplexed by the incident and thought his side was denied a legitimate four-pointer. ""I thought it was a try - you win some and you lose some"" Walters said. ""We are not having a lot of joy with some decisions at the moment.""  Viewers also found the incident baffling, considering it had been sent up to the Bunker for examination. Many fans questioned what the point of the video official is if the on-field referees can just overrule them, while others praised Gee for correcting what many described as being another howler from the Bunker.  The ref just overruled the bunker. Absolutely love it.

Love it — Matt Buxton (@mattbuxton22) May 18, 2023  Brisbane struggle without Adam Reynolds  The Broncos were playing without injured captain Adam Reynolds and the veteran's absence was telling, as Brisbane's kicking game and last-tackle plays suffered accordingly. Jock Madden had a solid match as veteran half's replacement but Cleary's class for the visitors proved a major difference.  Cleary controlled the game and scored a crucial second-half try when he dummied and went himself at Suncorp Stadium in front of 33,343 fans. That try saw him reach the 1300-point milestone at 25 years and 185 days, eclipsing the previous best of Manly legend Graham Eadie, who reached the mark at the age of 25 years and 246 days in 1979.  Nathan Cleary reached a 1300-point NRL milestone in Penrith's win over Brisbane. Pic: Getty  The Panthers are now on 16 points and equal with the Broncos and South Sydney, but with a superior for and against. The Rabbitohs have the chance to take the outright lead when they host Parramatta on Friday night.  The Broncos' scrambling defence was on song in the first half as the Panthers had three tries disallowed. One was the result of a desperate tackle by Broncos second-rower Kurt Capewell on Moses Leota when he jolted the ball free when the Panthers prop was over the line.  A bellringer by Panthers centre Stephen Crichton on Broncos five-eighth Ezra Mam rocked the stadium. It was typical of the relentless Panthers defence that shut the Broncos out.  Since the loss to the Wests Tigers a month ago the Panthers have hit top gear with wins over the Warriors, Roosters and Broncos. ""I thought we responded really well (to the Tigers loss)…and we've beaten some really good teams,"" coach Ivan Cleary said.  Crichton enhanced his chances of being retained by NSW for the State of Origin series while fullback Dylan Edwards edged closer to a Blues debut after another fantastic performance that included a whopping 275 run metres and 12 tackle busts. Panthers prop James Fisher-Harris was put on report for a dangerous tackle on Staggs in the only other blight on an impressive win.  with AAP  Sign up to our newsletter and score the biggest sport stories of the week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXUuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9ucmwtYnVua2VyLXJlZmVyZWUtaW5jaWRlbnQtYnJpc2JhbmUtYnJvbmNvcy1yZWVjZS13YWxzaC1mYW5zLXNsYW0tZmFyY2UtMjIzMjMzNjc2Lmh0bWzSAXtodHRwczovL2F1LnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9ucmwtYnVua2VyLXJlZmVyZWUtaW5jaWRlbnQtYnJpc2JhbmUtYnJvbmNvcy1yZWVjZS13YWxzaC1mYW5zLXNsYW0tZmFyY2UtMjIzMjMzNjc2Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And it’s also the 43rd anniversary of the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington state, USA. Now, what do this special day and this anniversary have in common?  Well, International Museum Day would be a great day to visit the Creation Museum (or make your plans to do so!). Not only is it one of the two leading Christian themed attractions in the world (the other being the Ark Encounter), but—and here’s the connection—our Flood Geology exhibit features a section on Mt. St. Helens.        As a result of the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, scientists observed in real time that it doesn’t take millions of years to form thousands of sedimentary layers or to erode canyons. Creation scientists saw the events at Mt. St. Helens really as a miniature laboratory to help people understand how geological processes could happen quickly, given the right conditions.  I encourage you to learn more about the lessons learned at Mt. St. Helens in this article from the 40-year anniversary of the eruption a few years ago, “Four Lessons from the Mount St. Helens Eruption.”  At the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, we overcome the censorship of information so people won’t be brainwashed by the secularists.  Of course, those who accept evolutionary geology hate to see people be given such information as it undermines their atheistic belief system. At the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, we overcome the censorship of information so people won’t be brainwashed by the secularists.  It’s truly thrilling to see the number of young people visiting the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter to learn the truth about history in geology, biology, astronomy, and anthropology as recorded in Genesis.  This time of year, we have quite a large number of school trips visiting the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter (and all kids 10 and under enjoy free admission in 2023!).          Before your family visits secular museums like the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in D.C., make sure you bring them to the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter so they will not be led astray by the atheistic evolutionary teaching of these secular museums.

Later, it burst into flames and was totaled off Exit 5 on Interstate 15 Thursday afternoon.  Traffic slowed to a crawl shortly before 3 p.m. as dark smoke billowed from the northbound off-ramp at Dixie Drive.  All but the far left lane was closed for 30-40 minutes as firefighters extinguished a blaze that erupted in the engine of a black Dodge Ram, Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Grant Hintze told St. George News.  The Dodge was being serviced at a local dealership, Hintze said. The mechanic completed a repair and was taking the car for a test drive when “something mechanical happened in the engine — we don’t know exactly what, but it did start on fire.”  The man was alerted to the fire, pulled over and escaped the vehicle reportedly uninjured before the engine was engulfed in flames. Hintze said the truck was totaled.  The vehicle’s owner was notified of the incident, which will be worked out between them, the dealership and the insurance companies, Hintze said. No citations were issued as the fire was “just an anomaly that happens from time to time.”  The St. George Fire Department, Washington County Sheriff deputies and the Utah Department of Transportation Incident Management Team also responded to the scene.  Hintze advises drivers who feel like something is “wrong mechanically” or see smoke to pull over and “double check.”  “As soon as flames start, either get away from the vehicle or if you have adequate fire suppression, give that a try,” he added. “But if that doesn’t work, you back away from the vehicle because of the volatile nature of the car.”  Video at top of story by SHELDON DEMKE, St. George News.

SDO/NASA  A powerful solar flare exploded on Tuesday, caused by a sunspot three times the size of the Earth.  The flare sent radiation that interfered with Earth's radio signals.  There have been a series of recent space weather events as the sun enters a period of peak activity.  A powerful solar flare exploded on our sun on Tuesday, releasing radiation that caused a radio blackout on Earth.  The flare, classed as an M9.6 solar flare, was powerful enough to disrupt high frequency radio signals in North America, Central America, and South America, per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  There were no clear reported effects of the blackout, which lasted more than 10 minutes, though an expert previously told Insider such events can interfere with air traffic.  ""Space weather can ground flights,"" Mathew Owens, a professor of space physics at the University of Reading said, adding that the Federal Aviation Administration ""won't allow flights if they don't have both radio and satellite communications.""  An M9 solar flare is a pretty powerful explosion, though it poses no health risk to humans. Solar flares rank from A, followed by B, C, M, and X classes. An M9 solar flare is just a rank below the most powerful class of solar flares.  A video of the sun taken on May 18 shows a powerful solar flare being released. SDO/NASA  The flare was caused by a large sunspot that was just out of view when the flare exploded. The eruption was only 1 percentage point from being an X-flare, and would probably have been classified as such if it had been in full view of Earth's observation satellites.  The sunspot, which has now come into view, appears to be about three times the size of the Earth, per spaceweather.com. Experts will likely keep a close eye on the spot as it comes to face the Earth this weekend.  Sunspots are areas where magnetic fields are particularly strong. They are known to be associated with space weather events.  A video of the sun taken on May 17 — a day after the solar flare — shows the sunspot rotating into view SDO/NASA  This is the latest in a series of recent notable space weather events, including spectacular auroras and rare solar occurrences like plasma waterfalls and tornados.  Story continues  The sun is gearing up towards a peak of activity in its near decadal cycle, which is caused by a sudden flip in its poles. As the sun becomes more active, it is exhibiting more frequent solar events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  An X-class solar flare was spotted in March causing radio blackouts in parts of southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.  Scientists have warned that these peaks of solar activity could potentially be dangerous if powerful solar storms were to short power grids around the globe.

Scientists said on Wednesday the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes – similar to Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system. In our solar system, Earth and Venus are volcanically active, as are some of Jupiter's moons.  The planet's volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star. The gravitational tug from the larger planet may squeeze and flex the newly identified one, heating up its interior and causing surface volcanic activity, similar to Io, the researchers said.  Planets beyond our solar system are called exoplanets.  ""There is not yet any direct observational evidence of exoplanet volcanism, but this planet is a particularly likely candidate,"" said University of Kansas astronomy professor Ian Crossfield, one of the authors of the research published in the journal Nature.  It is a planet that does not rotate – with one side perpetually in daylight and the other in darkness.  ""On the dayside, it is too hot for liquid water, so it is likely very dry and hot – likely a desert. On the night side, there is possibly a large icy glacier,"" said study co-author Björn Benneke, head of the astronomy group at the University of Montreal.  ""The most interesting region is near the terminator region where the day and nightside meet. Here, water from the nightside glacier can melt and possibly form liquid surface water. In addition, there is likely volcanism all around the planet, even under the ice on the nightside and possibly under the water near the terminator,"" Benneke said.  The planet is located in the Milky Way about 86 light-years away from our solar system in the direction of the constellation Crater. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion kilometers (5.9 trillion miles).  It is slightly larger than Earth and orbits very close to a red dwarf star – a type much smaller than our sun, with relatively low mass and temperature – completing its elliptical journey around it in only 2.8 days.  Its surface temperature appears to be slightly warmer than Earth's. It is situated on the inner edge of what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around the star – not too hot and not too cold, perhaps able to maintain liquid water on the surface and harbor life.  ""I imagine a rugged, young surface for the planet after many millions of years of constant volcanic activity. Since the gravitational effects don't care about day and night side, I also suspect the volcanic activity to be evenly spread over the planetary surface,"" said University of California, Riverside planetary astrophysicist and study co-author Stephen Kane.  ""Since the planet is so volcanically active, it is still contributing gases to the atmosphere from the interior. As such, the planet probably still has an atmosphere. The planet is unlikely to be habitable, however, since the total amount of energy makes for a quite hostile environment. Who knows? Life may find a way,"" Kane added.  Its orbit is sandwiched between the two other planets – the innermost one about 20% bigger than Earth and the outermost one about 250% the size of our planet.  The researchers spotted the planet using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as some ground-based observatories.  ""There are still many unknowns regarding volcanism and how long a planet can maintain outgassing processes,"" Kane said, referring to the release of trapped gas that occurs with eruptions. ""We only recently confirmed that Venus, Earth's twin planet, is volcanically active.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2xpZmUvc2NpZW5jZS9tYWdtYS13b3JsZC1lYXJ0aC1zaXplZC1wbGFuZXQtZ3JpcHBlZC1ieS12b2xjYW5pc20tZXJ1cHRpb25z0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlzYWJhaC5jb20vbGlmZS9zY2llbmNlL21hZ21hLXdvcmxkLWVhcnRoLXNpemVkLXBsYW5ldC1ncmlwcGVkLWJ5LXZvbGNhbmlzbS1lcnVwdGlvbnMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In this clip from 2015, the late rock icon takes up his electric guitar to explain how he began to figure it out after watching Jimmy Page play live.  The footage dates back to 2015, specifically to an in-depth interview Van Halen did as part of The Smithsonian’s What It Means To Be American series.  In the clip, host and interviewer Denise Quan comments that Van Halen is known for playing with “both your right hand and your left hand on the fretboard… Can you demonstrate?”  Eddie Van Halen onstage during his 2015 Smithsonian interview (Image credit: Chris Gill / Smithsonian)  Thankfully, the amiable Van Halen is ready and willing, donning his guitar to talk Quan and the audience through the thought process that led him to evolve his playing in the late-’70s. But first, he pauses to clarify an important point.  “You know, [this was] before the internet,” says Van Halen. “Nobody could search things and whatever. Lately everyone’s been going, ‘Oh, Eddie Van Halen didn’t invent tapping!’ Or hammer-ons and pull-offs and things like that. I never claimed that I did.  “But I do know how and when I figured out how to do it and, on top of that, I never really heard anybody do with it what I did, which is actual pieces of music.”  Fortunately, the guitarist resists the urge to descend into a rant on armchair shred critics and instead gets back to his lesson on the personal origins of his tapping.  “I’ll never forget,” recalls Van Halen. “Alex [Van Halen] and I used to go to every concert at The Forum in LA. [One night] Led Zeppelin's playing and Jimmy Page is going like this [playing a one-handed hammer-on/pull-off] and he’s got his hand up in the air.”  Eddie Van Halen putting his two-handed tapping technique to good use onstage, in 1978 (Image credit: Fin Costello / Getty)  Van Halen explains how he then copied the move at home and figured out that he could add his picking hand to the mix to bar across the neck – effectively, he says, “I just moved the nut.”  Soon he started experimenting with swapping hand positions and fingers. “My point being,” explains Van Halen, “that this finger or hand [from my picking hand] is just an extension of this [fretting] hand.”  What then follows is a short descent into virtuoso melodic shred technique, including a demo of one of the “little pieces” he used it on – namely, the game-changing composition that was Eruption.

Image courtesy of Spanish National Center for Geographic Information.  A Milestone Eruption in the Canary Islands  After 50 years of dormancy, the volcano that forms the Cumbre Vieja Ridge on the island of La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands erupted in September 2021, resulting in one of the archipelago’s most destructive volcanic events in 500 years. Lasting 85 days, it is estimated to have caused up to EUR 843 million in damage to the island’s infrastructure. Spewing lava as high as 500 meters and with a flow traversing the island, the volcano destroyed buildings, towns, and approximately 350 hectares of banana plantations. It also destroyed more than 2,500 homes, forcing 7,000 residents to evacuate. While no deaths resulted from the eruption, the challenges at hand include rebuilding the communities and determining how best to protect the thousands of people who live on the slopes of the ridge from future catastrophic events.  Responsible for producing the official cartography of Spain and managing, maintaining, and communicating geographic and spatial data, the National Geographic Institute (CNIG) was tasked with ascertaining the current state of La Palma after the 2021 volcanic eruption. “The project involved obtaining a realistic landscape of the new orography of the island of La Palma following the changes caused by the last eruption of the Cumbre Vieja ridge between September 19 and December 13, 2021,” said Celia Sevilla, head of international projects at CNIG. While the initial project objective was a digital cartography model to help reconstruct the island, another objective was to develop the virtual model as a tool to help define protection and management plans aimed at safeguarding communities and infrastructure, which will help increase the island’s resiliency to natural disasters.  Integrating Multisourced Data and Models  To obtain an accurate digital representation of the new orography of La Palma, CNIG had to merge two models. The first model was obtained from existing aerial photographs of the island with a ground sample distance of 25 centimeters, while the second model was created from 14,000 drone-captured images with a high-resolution ground pixel size of 5 centimeters that focused on the affected area, including craters and lava flow. Integrating the two different types of data with very different geometric resolutions presented challenges, compounded by the surface irregularity and disappearance of identifiable points on the ground due to the lava. “The biggest challenge was integrating very disparate resolutions, as well as searching and locating identifiable points for georeferencing, because the lava flows had caused much of the land in the area to disappear,” said Sevilla.  In addition to the lava-affected topography and data integration issues, CNIG also faced time constraints. They needed to generate an accurate reality model and digital twin in a short period of time. From the digital twin, they also had to create updated digital elevation models to correct the official cartography published by the Spanish National Geographic Institute, accessible both digitally via CNIG’s download center, map viewers, and mobile applications, and as printed versions. To quickly integrate the large survey data and models with varying resolutions into a realistic, multipurpose digital landscape, CNIG required comprehensive and flexible reality modeling technology.  Leveraging ContextCapture for Landscape Modeling  Based on prior experiences with other projects, CNIG selected ContextCapture to integrate the aerial photos covering the entire island pre-eruption with the drone images captured during the period that the volcano remained active. This process would allow them to digitally reconstruct the new island landscape. Using Bentley’s reality modeling application allowed the different resolutions to be integrated into a single landscape. “ContextCapture has perfectly resolved the development of models from a large number of photographs while allowing the integration of different data sources, along with different resolutions,” said Sevilla.  The software’s flexibility, interoperability, and advanced processing capabilities enabled CNIG to quickly merge the 14,000 high-resolution, drone-captured images with the lower resolution photographs into an accurate single-landscape digital twin model to virtually study the area and plan new infrastructure development.  Digital Twin Drives Virtual Planning and Reconstruction  Using ContextCapture provided a quick, simple, and cost-effective solution that met CNIG’s landscape reconstruction objectives, as well as their ongoing cartographic requirements. The creation of a digital twin offers a multipurpose solution, making information easily accessible to agencies and the public for various applications. Easy digital reconstruction of the territory now makes it possible for the government to keep citizens regularly informed.  “The fact that a reality model of the new appearance of the island of La Palma is available is the fastest, closest, and most accurate way of showing it to citizens,” said Sevilla. The Bentley-based digital solution reduces the environmental impact of manual on-site methods while saving time and costs, as well as providing citizens with a glimpse into the current state of their plots and homes in a safe and agile manner.  Digitization of the project enabled virtual access to the study area, which is not physically permitted due to safety and environmental protection issues. The model facilitates virtual reconstruction and planning to rebuild infrastructure and respond to events similar to the Cumbre Vieja eruption. It enables the implementation of proactive protection and management plans to safeguard people and property from future natural disasters. “The speed in obtaining the data, the simplicity of its processing, and its subsequent integration into the existing model make this methodology an option for any future episodes,” said Sevilla.  Project Summary  Organization: The National Geographic Institute (CNIG)  Solution: Survey and Monitoring  Location: La Palma, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain  Project Objectives:  To create a digital twin of the island to help plan reconstruction and infrastructure redevelopment.

"eruption","1980-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:30:00","When Mount St. Helens erupted May 18, 1980, the upper North Fork of the Toutle River was buried in up to 600 feet of volcanic debris.  Forty-three years later, the resurfaced river cuts through a barren sediment plain and spills over a dam holding back millions of cubic yards of silt, before regaining anything close to its pre-eruption look.  The sediment retention dam built to help protect downstream communities from flooding contributes to the ongoing buildup of gravel and sand.  Unlike its counterpart to the south, there’s been limited restoration work on the North Fork, but Mother Nature appears to be taking matters into her own hands.  ‘Nature’s river restorers’  When researcher Colin Thorne visited the Toutle River last summer, he was “amazed” to see parts of the sediment plain turning green. The reason? Beavers moving from tributary streams into the main stem, said Thorne, professor emeritus of physical geography at the University of Nottingham, England.  “I think they’re telling us something. Maybe it is time we can start restoration work on the North Fork Toutle,” he said. “It really brings a lump to your throat. … These are nature’s river restorers.”  Where beavers go, salmon are likely to follow.  Beavers create slow water and deep pools that provide opportunities for juvenile salmon to grow, hide from predators and make their way down to the ocean to complete their life cycle, Thorne said.  The sediment retention structure has hampered efforts to improve salmon runs in the upper reaches of the North Fork. Fish headed upstream cannot get through the structure, which also contributes to the sediment buildup.  In 1989, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a fish collection facility about a mile downstream of the sediment dam, where salmon are collected, then trucked and released into tributaries upriver to spawn.  The beavers have begun moving from tributaries to wall-based channels — river channels running along the base of the valley wall, rather than through the middle of the sediment plain, Thorne said. The channels are shady with cooler, spring-fed water containing food and nutrients for fish from insects, leaves and other debris falling off overhanging trees, he said.  “The wall based channels have a lot of potential for becoming salmon and lamprey habitat,” Thorne said.  While he hasn’t gotten a close look at the channel on the south side, the north side is definitely “greening up” and improving habitat, Thorne said.  These changes may have been aided by grade-building structures, or engineered log jams, installed by the Army Corps 13 years ago to study if they help block sediment from moving downstream.  “We want to find out, are they what made this area good enough for the beaver to make a foray into it?” Thorne said. “Is it just a coincidence or did the engineered log jams set the table for the beaver by encouraging willows and alders to grow? Because that’s what beaver like to eat.”  With or without human intervention, it will be decades before the entire watershed recovers, but evidence of natural progress is an encouraging sign for researchers and conservationists.  For the Lower Columbia Fish Enhancement Group, which has worked to restore the South Fork Toutle area for years, investing in the North Fork is “problematic,” said Shauna Hanisch-Kirkbride, managing director.  The large amount of sediment flowing off the mountain into the North Fork and the bureaucracy surrounding the sediment retention structure creates uncertainty, Hanisch-Kirkbride said.  “We’ve been hesitant to get real involved until the future of it is real clear,” she said. “Plus my organization is plenty busy with the South Fork.”  Creating habitat  The South Fork, which branches off just east of Toutle, bounced back much quicker because it was not hit as hard by the eruption and doesn’t have the sediment retention dam.  Although the 1980 eruption killed a lot of fish in both forks of the Toutle, the longer term impact was habitat destruction, Hanisch-Kirkbride said. The effort to recover some economic value from the damaged trees by salvaging them denuded the watershed, making things worse ecologically, she said.  It’s difficult for plants to grow in the sediment, which is not rich soil, Hanisch-Kirkbride said. The river is warmer and moves faster, in part because of a lack of natural wood in the water, she said.  “Those things combined don’t make good fish habitat,” Hanisch-Kirkbride said.  Restoration includes putting wood in the water to help slow it down and create areas for seedlings to establish, Hanisch-Kirkbride said. The trees provide shade and nutrients, eventually die and fall into the water, perpetuating a cycle that’s currently lacking, she said.  After the Lower Columbia Fish Enhancement Group’s work in Bear, Harrington and Little Cow creeks and Little Cow Springs a few years ago, steelhead and coho salmon now spawn there, said Brice Crayne, project manager.  Fish responded really quickly to the changes, Hanisch-Kirkbride said.  “What’s impressive there is if you build it they will come,” she said.  The group is now taking “little bites at a time” off a long-term project to restore habitat along a 17-mile stretch of the South Fork, after working with a team of experts to complete the design in 2021, Hanisch-Kirkbride said. The project will likely take 20 years to complete, depending on funding, she added.  “It is a big and bold project,” Hanisch-Kirkbride said. “To really create change and affect habitat; thinking big helps.”  Last year, the group received $5 million from the state’s Salmon Recovery Funding Board to implement the project’s first phase over the next four years. This includes restoring habitat by adding wood and excavating channels along 2.82 miles of the South Fork Toutle River.  Some of these methods could eventually be used in the North Fork Toutle but it’s “a very different setting,” Hanisch-Kirkbride said.  Shifting from sediment  The amount of silt trapped by the sediment retention structure varies from year to year but adds up to about 3 million cubic yards annually, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. That would be enough to fill 50 million standard full-size pickup trucks, which each hold 2.5 cubic yards of material.  Since it was built in 1986, the dam has trapped about 125 million cubic yards of sediment out of its estimated capacity of 258 million cubic yards. That capacity is after two planned crest raises totaling 23 feet.  While the Corps’ grade-building structures successfully slowed the river and blocked sediment from moving downstream, sediment will bury the structures after the 10-foot crest raise scheduled for next year, said John Morgan, Corps spokesperson.  While the Corps’ focus has been addressing the sediment, the agency is among more than a dozen participating in the Spirit Lake-Toutle/Cowlitz River System Collaborative, aiming to address the watershed as a whole.  The group formed in 2021 to allow for easier discussions and agreements among federal, state and local stakeholders about the future of the water systems impacted by the 1980 eruption.  Thorne, who has done research at Mount St. Helens on and off since 1984, got involved in the collaborative to help in any way he could, he said.  Until recently, the Toutle and Cowlitz rivers have been managed as a hazard, which they still are, Thorne said. However, there is now opportunity to help make the Toutle River more productive like it used to be, he said.  “That’s where the collaborative can really help,” Thorne said. “By bringing forward partnerships between different players, interest groups with the common aim of restoring the ecology of the river to support the economy of the community.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3Rkbi5jb20vb3V0ZG9vcnMvbm9ydGgtZm9yay10b3V0bGUtcml2ZXItc2hvd3Mtc2lnbnMtb2YtbmF0dXJhbC1yZWNvdmVyeS00My15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1lcnVwdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzM5NzM2OWQ0LWYzNmUtMTFlZC05OWU4LTc3NGRiM2I3ODRmNi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Do you remember what you were doing?  Getty Images Getty Images loading...  Remembering on the Anniversary of Mount St. Helens Eruption  There are a lot of things I do not remember about being a kid in Washington State, but I will never forget May 18, 1980. I was living in Spokane, I was almost 5 years old, and my only concern was that I had to go to Sunday church that morning. (That is how I always remember that St. Helens exploded on a Sunday.) We were actually driving back from church when my father spotted the dark clouds coming from the southwest. At the time we thought it would be a large thunderstorm, but we were obviously wrong.  Canva-Getty Canva-Getty loading...  My Family Opens Windows and Watches Thunderstorms  Growing up in the Spokane Valley, thunderstorms and lighting were normal, especially in the springtime. Every storm we saw, my family would open up the windows to the house and we would watch the light show. That morning on May 18, we rushed home and opened all the windows hoping to see an amazing thunder and lightning show. I remember sitting at the window watching the sky as white stuff suddenly started falling.  Canva-Getty Canva-Getty loading...  Ash Started Falling Like Heavy Snow  It was the weirdest experience to feel the warm air and see what I think is snow falling from the sky. I remember the clouds having this very dark and scary appearance and the sudden feeling that something was not right, even at 5 years old. I remember my Dad freaking out, yelling at us to get away from the windows, and running around the house shutting all the windows we had just opened.  Canva-Getty Canva-Getty loading...  The Drawing of a Volcano with Scrolling Instructions was on Every TV Channel  After my Dad freaked and closed all the windows, the first thing he did was turn on the TV. Remember that in 1980 there was no internet so the TV or the radio was your only options for information in an emergency. I had always seen EMS alerts before but this was my first time living through an event that used it. All TV channels showed a black-and-white drawing of a traditional cone volcano with smoke coming out of the top. There were instructions scrolling across the bottom although I was too young to understand or read it.  YouTube Smithsonian Channel YouTube Smithsonian Channel loading...  We Had Inches of Ash by the Next Morning  I remember it turning completely dark when the storm hit and the ash started falling from the sky. By the time I woke up the next morning, it looked like a warm winter wonderland. There were inches of ash all over the ground completely making our neighborhood white. I remember getting told not to go outside because breathing in the ash could hurt me. I also remember sneaking outside to play in it whenever I could anyway because it was fun (think Star Wars and Hoth and you see why). It was fun until I got caught and wasn't allowed outside anymore by my parents.  Getty Images Getty Images loading...  My 6th Grade Class Visited Mount St. Helens  My next interaction with Mount St. Helens didn't happen again until 6th grade when my class went to Cispus Camp near Randle, Washington. I thought Cispus Camp was something only my school did every year, but I have found lots of other people that grew up in the northwest that also went to Cispus in 6th grade. We hiked to the top of a mountain near the camp, painted on rocks, and all got on a bus and drove to the closest viewing site for Mount Saint Helens at the time. I was 11, so the trip was only 6 years after the eruption and what we saw was shocking.  Getty Images Getty Images loading...  As we approached the site, there was a sudden dead zone as we got closer. Everything in the dead zone had been flattened including huge trees that were splintered and lay flat like toothpicks. We found out later that the dead zone was where the Forrest Service was letting the area repair naturally without any human help. For the first time, I saw with my own eyes the destruction that I felt as a 5-year-old but never got to see. The mountain keeps changing over the years, but if you get the chance go visit Mount Saint Helens and see what the most active American volcano is really like.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3RhbGs4NzAuYW0vaXhwLzEzNC9wL21vdW50LXN0LWhlbGVucy1tZW1vcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The ancient Roman city was wiped out in AD 79 by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  A ministry statement stated that the skeletons recovered from the building, known as the House of the Painters at Work, were probably of two men who were in their 50s and died in the earthquake that occurred along with the eruption.  The Director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, said that they were not killed by volcanic ash. Instead, their bones were fractured by wall fragments.  The German archaeologist stated that ""modern excavation techniques helps us better understand the inferno which completely destroyed Pompeii city over two days and killed many residents"".  Pompeii was located 23 km (14miles) south of Naples. It was the home of 13,000 people in 79 AD when it was submerged under ash and pumice stones.  According to the Culture Ministry, ""at least 15-20% of population"" were killed. Archaeologists recovered more than 1,300 remains over the last two and a quarter centuries.  Pompeii, which was not discovered until the 16th century, is experiencing a recent burst in archaeological activity, thanks to an EU-funded project that recently ended. The project, funded at €105 million, aimed to stop years of decay and negligence.

Example video title will go here for this video  CASTLE ROCK, Wash. — In this week's Let's Get Out There, it's been 43 years since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. We look back at how the landscape changed back then, and how it continues to move today.  At the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center, Alysa Adams takes you on a journey through time with her ranger talk.  “Has anyone ever been to the 1970s before? Some of you may have been there before, I won't point at you,” she said to a group with a smile.  The group is seated with a clear view of Mount St. Helens. Just 30 miles as the crow flies to one of the most infamous volcanoes on the planet.  “I love interacting with the public,” Adams said. “I love making connections with them, reaching our next generation. Definitely something I enjoy is giving ranger programs and answering people's questions, making sure their visit is exactly what they want it to be.”  Adams is a parks interpretive specialist with Washington State Parks. The visitor center is situated five miles east of Interstate 5 on Silver Lake. Last Sunday’s landslide on SR 504 means tour groups and school field trips are diverting to the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center from planned trips to Johnston Ridge Observatory in the blast zone.  “The landscape is continuously changing, always transforming,” said Adams.  As if we needed any reminders 43 years after the May 1980 eruption. In March of that year, the volcano began showing signs of movement. Two months later, under heavy scientific scrutiny, Mount St. Helens erupted in a lateral blast, shooting rock and debris at speeds of 400 miles per hour and an ash plume more than 12 miles high. It killed 57 people.  “Don't come to Washington. Washington will come to you,” Adams said in her presentation reading off a vintage bumper in her hands.  In a matter of weeks, the plume was carried by the jet stream and circled the globe, dumping ash across the Pacific Northwest.  Over four decades after the largest landslide in recorded history, new life and regrowth is evident everywhere you look. Two new lakes were created along with hundreds of ponds. You may not be able to get all the way to Johnston Ridge because of the road closure, but there are plenty of viewpoints to take in the moving sights of the mountain’s scarred northwest face.  “Once you hit the Hoffstadt Creek Bridge and you cross that, you're in the blast zone of Mount St. Helens,” said Adams.  “This is the most active volcano in the Cascade Range. The 1980 eruption wasn't the first and it won't be the last. It's gonna blow again. It's only a matter of time,” Adams said.  “Nature's got a plan and it's doing what it does best and that's always changing and going with the flow. So we're doing our best to deal with that and the results that has created, and we'll wait and see what happens next.”  —","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZ3cuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbGlmZS9zdHlsZS9sZXRzLWdldC1vdXQtdGhlcmUvbW91bnQtc3QtaGVsZW5zLTQzLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLTE5ODAtZXJ1cHRpb24vMjgzLTIyMTBjOWYyLTk5NTQtNDQzYS1iODBlLWRhNWU2MDQyODMyM9IBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZ3cuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2xpZmUvc3R5bGUvbGV0cy1nZXQtb3V0LXRoZXJlL21vdW50LXN0LWhlbGVucy00My15ZWFycy1hZnRlci0xOTgwLWVydXB0aW9uLzI4My0yMjEwYzlmMi05OTU0LTQ0M2EtYjgwZS1kYTVlNjA0MjgzMjM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2020-11-10","Not Discerned","{""Tehran"", ""Tehran"", ""Iran""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:08:19","Disgruntled Iran poses security threats to Azerbaijan Azerbaijan’s victory in the Second Karabakh War two and a half years ago created a new security situation in the South Caucasus that raised concerns in certain states. This is particularly true in the case of Iran, which continues to pressure Baku through various means.  The Second Karabakh War (September 27th – November 10th, 2020), known also as the 44-day War, changed the geopolitical landscape of the South Caucasus. In this war with Armenia, Azerbaijan succeeded in liberating its territories that had been occupied for up to three decades. The international community, including Iran, recognised Azerbaijan’s right to retake these territories, as a number of international documents and four resolutions from the United Nations Security Council clearly recognised the area as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan.  This war brought new dynamics to Iran’s policies with respect to the South Caucasus, the region that borders the Islamic Republic to the north.  The 44-day War and its outcomes were the first major signal of the erosion of Russian hegemony in the post-Soviet South Caucasus. Russia was previously seen by many as the major guarantor of the pre-war status-quo between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and as the force that averted the eruption of a large war between the two sides.  Azerbaijan’s resurgence in 2020 in the face of Russia’s failure to protect the status quo was at odds with Iran’s traditional vision of its northern neighbourhood.  Tehran had been used to treating the countries of the South Caucasus without any independent agency, as part of Russia’s sphere of influence in accordance with the outcomes of the wars between the Russian Empire and Persia in the early 19th century.  Russia was also seen in Tehran as a bulwark against the incursion of other external actors in the South Caucasus. This situation has also changed with the deployment of Turkey’s monitoring mission in Karabakh and Azerbaijan’s growing defence ties with Israel in the aftermath of the 2020 war.  The change in the regional balance of power caused a number of new concerns and exacerbated older ones in the Iranian capital.  The 2020 war, which turned out to be a big step towards the settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, alarmed Iranian leaders. They feared that Azerbaijan was on the path to overcoming the geopolitical redlines of Russia. An assertive Azerbaijan that is in an alliance with Turkey and Israel is unacceptable to Iran.  The Iranian media and many high-ranking officials openly describe Azerbaijan as a vassal state of Israel. One such article appeared in a media outlet close to the government of Iran, calling Azerbaijan “Yahudistan” (a Jewish state) and voicing a list of threats and warnings against Baku.  Along with geopolitical risks, Tehran is also concerned about the implications of Azerbaijan’s more assertive position on Iran’s domestic politics. There are up to over 20 million ethnic Azerbaijanis living in its territories, with most concentrated in the northern part of Iran. This was the area that came under Iranian control after the aforementioned wars with Russia in the early 1800s. It is still viewed as “South Azerbaijan” by Azerbaijanis. The occasional calls from some western countries and Israel for greater support for the independence aspirations of the Azerbaijani provinces of Iran further agitates the country.  In order to counter these developments, the Islamic Republic has taken a list of measures.  These measures include practicing for a military confrontation with Azerbaijan, building an alliance with Armenia, and countering Azerbaijan’s efforts to optimise the country’s connectivity projects.  In this context, Iranian leaders question Azerbaijan’s independence and its ethnic identity, claiming that Azerbaijan was a historical part of Iran and should return to Iranian control. One of the latest claims was made by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Ali Fadavi, who reiterated these historical claims against Azerbaijan. He said that this country was separated from Iran due to the incompetence of the Qajar kings.  Attempting to take advantage of the many Shiite believers in Azerbaijan, he openly called for a change of government in Baku. He stated that “The people of Azerbaijan are Shiite believers who did not lose their original Shiite beliefs under the 70 years of communist pressure. As a rule, there should be a government that pays special attention to this Shiite majority of Azerbaijan.”  These verbal attacks against Azerbaijan are disseminated by Iranian experts in both national and international media. For instance, Fardin Eftekhari, an Iranian researcher, mirroring the vision of the Iranian government, claims that Azerbaijan is no longer focused on only restoring its territorial integrity but rather envisions changes in regional interstate borders. He ultimately claims that Baku is preparing for the invasion of Armenia.  Thus, Iran views Armenia as an ally and seeks to combine forces with this country against Azerbaijan and its allies Turkey and Israel.  In late 2022, Azerbaijani media reported that 14 people from Iran entered the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan through the Lachin road “to conduct sabotage and terrorist exercises for armed Armenian gangs who are still present in the Azerbaijani territories temporarily monitored by the Russian peacekeepers”. There are also reports about Iran’s free of charge military supplies to Armenia, as well as its transfer of combat drones to Yerevan.  It is reported that Iran has been amassing its troops near the border with Azerbaijan, and high-ranking officials, including the commanders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Ground Forces and Border Troops visited the area. It is worth noting that Iran has conducted at least two military exercises along its interstate border with Azerbaijan since the 2020 Karabakh War, while it had never held similar exercises in this region before this conflict.  Tehran masks its concerns with false-flag allegations.  One major issue that Tehran refers to in this context is related to a possible change in interstate borders due to connectivity projects like the Zangezur corridor. This corridor, proposed in the Armenia-Azerbaijan-Russia deal following the 44-day War, is supposed to serve as a land passage for connecting mainland Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave via southern Armenia. Iran has warned against this project, claiming that it may cut off its geographical connection with Armenia.  Iran continues these accusations despite assurances from the Russian and Azerbaijani governments. For example, the Russian side has declared repeatedly that no extraterritoriality will be applied to the transportation routes that are planned to be opened between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Thus, both countries are expected to retain their sovereignty over the routes that pass through their respective territory. In another assurance, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev stated on October 14th that his country “had no intention of occupying the territory of Armenia, as some may assume.”  Nevertheless, Iran is exacerbating tensions in the region by asserting false-flag allegations against Azerbaijan. These tensions were reflected over the past few months in the lethal attack against the Azerbaijani embassy in Tehran (January 2023), a non-stop flight by an Iranian military aircraft along the Azerbaijan-Iran state border (March 2023), an assassination attempt against an Azerbaijani parliamentarian critical of Iran (March 2023), and the crackdown in Azerbaijan on Iran’s spy network.  These developments raise concerns in the region that there may be a military confrontation between the two sides, which would cause catastrophic outcomes for regional peace and stability.

Advertising Read more  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy's status, with some protesters calling for the king's power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday's election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  - Tough laws -  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges -- at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  ""We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,"" he said.  ""We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.""  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate -- monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut's junta -- are threatening to block Pita's bid for the job.  ""I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said.  ""I will not accept Pita as a PM because he... has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can't accept.""  Cycle of unrest  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  ""I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,"" Napon told AFP.  ""This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.""  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  ""This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics -- the status quo has been demolished,"" Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTgtdGhhaWxhbmQtcy1tb3ZlLWZvcndhcmQtcGFydHktdGFrZXMtb24tYmlnZ2VzdC1wb2xpdGljYWwtdGFib2_SAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC5mcmFuY2UyNC5jb20vZW4vbGl2ZS1uZXdzLzIwMjMwNTE4LXRoYWlsYW5kLXMtbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJkLXBhcnR5LXRha2VzLW9uLWJpZ2dlc3QtcG9saXRpY2FsLXRhYm9v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The deteriorating situation in Sudan is also having dramatic implications on neighbouring countries, many of which are grappling with their own protracted crises.  Out of USD 209 million, IOM is urgently calling for USD 105 million needed for the response in Sudan and USD 104 million for the response across Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia.  This appeal also covers the USD 37 million IOM needs to immediately assist third-country nationals stranded in Sudan and in neighbouring countries.  “The current humanitarian situation in Sudan is by far the worst the country has ever seen,"" said IOM Director General António Vitorino.  “Millions are in pressing need of basic assistance such as water, food and shelter. If we do not act NOW, the people of Sudan will face an inevitable humanitarian catastrophe. We appeal to the international community to urgently support relief efforts and mobilize financial resources to meet the mounting needs.""  The conflict is having devastating consequences for millions of civilians. Around 25.7 million people are now estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance inside Sudan and across its borders. Over 843,130 people are internally displaced inside the country according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix, with 1.8 million more expected to be internally displaced should the fighting continue. Prior to the conflict, there were already 3.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 1.1 million refugees in Sudan.  Nearly 259,000 people have already fled Sudan into neighbouring countries, arriving in extremely vulnerable situations into often remote and underserved areas. If fighting continues, it is estimated that over a million refugees and migrants affected by the crisis in Sudan may cross to neighbouring countries.  Millions remain inside the country with soaring food and transportation prices, lack of cash and access to health care, supplies and critical services. The deteriorating situation has been marked by increasing civilian deaths, destruction of health, water and communication facilities, shortage of supplies and poor conditions at overwhelmed border points as people flee the fighting.  IOM is working with partners on an interagency and coordinated response plan and appeal, to enable the scale-up needed to respond to the rising needs of Sudanese and third-country nationals and returnees. IOM’s Crisis Response Plans for Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic remain severely underfunded.

Meanwhile, 10 Manipur MLAs of the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi-Hmar communities have repeated their demand for a separate administration.  The latter fear that they could fall in the hands of militant groups like the PLA.  The Express report noted that “more than 1,000 weapons and 10,000 rounds were looted from Manipur Police Training College, two police stations, and an IRB battalion camp in Imphal by Meities during the first few days of the violence in Manipur.”  Kukis attacked and looted police stations in Churachandpur, sources told the paper.  These weapons, if not recovered soon, have the capacity to foment trouble.  Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a valley-based umbrella body of civil society groups, has notified police of anonymous calls it has been getting to get it to pressure the government to stop recovering weapons, the report said.  Former CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh, who is advising the Manipur government in the aftermath of the violence said 456 arms and 6,670 pieces of ammunition have so far been recovered. He added that recovered arms include those looted by Meitei and Kuki groups.  Yesterday, May 17, at the Supreme Court, Senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves, who was representing the Manipur Tribal Forum Delhi, told the bench that the Kuki community apprehended further violence against it. The Supreme Court urged the Manipur government to take appropriate action on such apprehensions.  MLAs repeat demand for separation  The Telegraph has reported that 10 Manipur MLAs, belonging to the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi-Hmar communities, in a memorandum to Union home minister Amit Shah have claimed their people have “lost faith” in the BJP-led state government and can “no longer” think about “resettling in the Valley” following the violence that erupted on May 3.  The MLAs have reiterated their demand for a separate administration in the hills, noting that they cannot “live together any more.” This is not the first time that such a request has been put forth. The MLAs, seven of whom are from the ruling BJP, including two ministers, had earlier released a statement with this demand.  They also noted that no Union minister has visited the state since the violence erupted.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L21hbmlwdXItMTAtbWxhcy1yZXBlYXQtc2VwYXJhdGUtYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24tZGVtYW5kLWxvb3RlZC13ZWFwb25zLXBvc2UtY29uY2VybtIBfWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2FydGljbGUvZ292ZXJubWVudC9tYW5pcHVyLTEwLW1sYXMtcmVwZWF0LXNlcGFyYXRlLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLWRlbWFuZC1sb290ZWQtd2VhcG9ucy1wb3NlLWNvbmNlcm4vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-07-08","18:00:00","{""Panevezys"", ""Panevezhio"", ""Lithuania""}","Thu 18 May 2023 06:11:00","By Sabine Siebold  BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO will step back to the future at its Vilnius summit in July, with leaders set to approve thousands of pages of secret military plans that will detail for the first time since the Cold War how the alliance would respond to a Russian attack.  The move signifies a fundamental shift - NATO had seen no need to draw up large-scale defence plans for decades, as it fought smaller wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and felt certain post-Soviet Russia no longer posed an existential threat.  But with Europe's bloodiest war since 1945 raging just beyond its borders in Ukraine, the alliance is now warning that it must have all planning in place well before a conflict with a peer adversary such as Moscow might erupt.  ""The fundamental difference between crisis management and collective defence is this: It is not we but our adversary who determines the timeline,"" said Admiral Rob Bauer, one of NATO's top military officials. ""We have to prepare for the fact that conflict can present itself at any time.""  By outlining what it calls its regional plans, NATO will also give nations guidance on how to upgrade their forces and logistics.  ""Allies will know exactly what forces and capabilities are needed, including where, what and how to deploy,"" said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg about the highly classified documents that will, as in the Cold War, assign certain troops to the defence of certain regions.  This formalises a process triggered by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which prompted Western allies for the first time to deploy combat troops to the east, with Britain, Canada and Germany each taking the lead in one of the Baltic states.  NOT A COLD WAR RE-RUN  But while many features resemble NATO's military line-up before 1990, some crucial factors have changed for an alliance that has since then expanded some 1,000 km (600 miles) to the east and grown from around a dozen to 31 members.  Story continues  Finland's accession last month has alone doubled NATO's border with Russia to some 2,500 km, forcing a more flexible approach to deployments than in the past, when Germany was seen as the main battlezone.  Also, the alliance is no longer preparing to fight a large-scale nuclear war against Moscow and its allies - most of whom are now NATO members - said Ian Hope, historian at NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE).  ""We don't envision the type of war that the Cold War was, where allied forces ... would be hit simultaneous with large-scale Warsaw Pact attacks,"" he said, pointing rather to regionalised conflicts that needed to be contained by quick force deployments.  At the same time, the internet, drones, hypersonic weapons and a rapid flow of information present new challenges.  ""The good news is that we talk about the transparency of the battlefield. With all the satellites, with all the intel we're able to see a maturing crisis,"" said Lieutenant General Hubert Cottereau, SHAPE's Vice Chief of Staff. ""For Ukraine, we had all the indicators quite in advance.""  This transparency is one of the reasons why NATO, contrary to the Baltic states' demands, does not see any immediate need to ramp up troop numbers in the east.  ""The more troops you are massing up on the border, it's like having a hammer. At some point, you want to find a nail,"" warned Cottereau. ""If the Russians are massing troops on the border that will make us nervous, if we are massing troops on the border that will make them nervous.""  CHALLENGES  Still, it will be a huge task to drastically improve readiness. NATO agreed in 2022 to put 300,000 troops on high alert, up from 40,000 in the past.  Shortcomings in the alliance's capacity to produce sufficient weapons and ammunition have been highlighted by the struggle to keep pace with Ukraine's demands, and NATO must also upgrade the long-neglected logistics needed to quickly deploy troops via rail or road.  The need to finance the implementation of the regional plans is one of the reasons why Stoltenberg has called upon leaders to raise the alliance's military spending target, another topic that will be discussed in Vilnius.  NATO officials estimate it will take a few years for the plans to be fully implemented, though they stress that the alliance can head into battle immediately if required.  ""We are ready to fight tonight. You know, you are never sufficiently ready. Never,"" said Cottereau. ""We have to be able to fight tonight if necessary, with what we have.""

In that sense, the hearing didn’t disappoint. Though, by the hearing’s end, Republicans found themselves upstaged by a superior performer with better material.  Conservative lawmakers have been portraying the District of Columbia as a crime-riddled hellscape in need of federal intervention. That thinking was the impetus behind a Republican-backed bill that President Joe Biden signed in March that overturned revisions to the district’s criminal code. The move marked the first time in more than 30 years that federal lawmakers had overturned district legislation, and it reflected conservatives’ insatiable appetite for illiberal power grabs targeting nonwhite voters and officials.  Tuesday’s hearing came during yet another power grab. Last month, House Republicans passed legislation rescinding police reforms backed by the district’s largely Black city council in 2020, as protests erupted nationwide over police brutality. The Republicans in the Senate — with the help of some conservative-leaning independents and Democrats — passed the measure Tuesday, though Biden has said he will veto it.  House Republicans seemed dead set on using the hearing to launch rhetorical grenades. And Democrats at the hearing sent them back with the velocity of a tennis serve.  A freshman Republican lawmaker, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, probably got the worst of it. In the clip below, watch how Luna alludes to the scariness of D.C. by claiming it has seen a spike in sexual assaults, but then doesn’t let the witness respond.  Another freshman, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, used some of her time to offer a rebuttal, noting she was excited to hear Luna’s comments “considering that the [Republican] front-runner right now for, like, [the] presidency has kind of just been found liable of sexual abuse.”  Crockett was clearly referring to last week’s finding by a civil jury in New York that former President Donald Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.  I can’t imagine Luna knew, in delivering her remarks, that she was lobbing an alley-oop for Crockett to dunk on her head. But that’s precisely what happened.  And Crockett continued to run up the score. In another viral clip, she again highlighted Republicans’ hypocrisy on crime.  “My Republican colleagues want to talk about keeping D.C. streets crime-free. They can’t even keep the halls of Congress crime-free,” Crockett said, adding that “my freshman colleague has just been indicted on 13 counts — 13 felony counts, right?”  Here, Crockett was clearly talking about Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was arrested last week and charged with wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making materially false statements to the House of Representatives. Santos denies all the allegations against him, but legislation has been proposed to expel him from Congress.  Crockett had a simple explainer for her rhetorical approach here. Sharing one of the above clips on Twitter, she added: “I just call them as I see them.”  This should be required viewing for Democrats pondering ways to punch back at Republicans who use conspiratorial hearings to misinform and manipulate the public — especially when it comes to crime.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zbmJjLmNvbS90aGUtcmVpZG91dC9yZWlkb3V0LWJsb2cvamFzbWluZS1jcm9ja2V0dC13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWRjLWNyaW1lLWhvdXNlLXJlcHVibGljYW5zLXJjbmE4NDkwMNIBPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zbmJjLmNvbS9tc25iYy9hbXAvc2hvd3MvcmVpZG91dC9ibG9nL3JjbmE4NDkwMA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After Mark Vientos and Francisco Alvarez each provided their own game-tying home run to force extra innings, Alonso launched a no-doubt three-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning to lift the Mets to their first walk-off win of the season, 8-7, over the Rays on Wednesday night at Citi Field.  The downtrodden Citi Field crowd, resigned to the Mets’ sixth series loss in their last seven, finally received their chance to erupt. The biggest win of the season for the Mets (21-23) erased some frustration and gave them an opportunity to grab a momentum-shifting series win over the best team in baseball on Thursday.  ""I'm really fortunate because without them coming through in those big spots, I'm not given that opportunity,"" said Alonso, who provided the heroics and his league-leading 15th home run in the midst of a sinus infection. ""Our young guys are pros. They put together great at-bats consistently, and I'm really thankful for them coming up clutch because I wouldn't have that opportunity to help the team in extras there.""  It was Brett Baty's long ball that snapped a 56-inning homerless streak on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, a trio of home runs, including two by the youngest members of the team, proved just how quickly a few swings of the bat can flip the mood.  ""Everybody's making their path easier. We'll see. They have that background to be able to do that,"" Buck Showalter said. ""We'll see if they can do it at this level.  ""On the other side of that, I don't want them to put this to some apex level that's unattainable. They can do it. They just have to be consistent.""  Tiebreakers: Mark Vientos and Francisco Alvarez  With the Mets offense seemingly stuck in the mud through a scoreless first six innings, Vientos first lifted the Mets up with a two-run shot that crawled over the center-field wall.  The big blast, which he said he pleaded with to clear the wall, off Ryan Thompson came on the same day he was called back up to the major leagues.  ""It feels really good to get the first one out of the way. First hit, first home run,"" Vientos said. ""Now just go out there and play and have fun.""  But the energy provided by Vientos was short-lived. In the very next inning, Brandon Lowe put the Rays back ahead a two-run home run off Adam Ottavino. And Randy Arozarena tacked on another off Stephen Nogosek on an RBI single.  It would be up to the kids one more time in the bottom of the ninth inning after Daniel Vogelbach drew a leadoff walk and Starling Marte was hit by a pitch. Brett Baty came on as a pinch-hitter and struck out and Vientos flied out to center field.  With the Mets down to their final out and trailing by three runs, Alvarez clobbered a sweeper off the front of the second deck in left field to tie the game. In the process, he hoisted his bat in the air for the most lively bat flip of the season.  ""It made me remember a lot of the moments where I didn't have success, like the at-bat against (Josh) Hader, which was a terrible at-bat,"" Alvarez said. "" I said, 'If he's going to throw me slider, slider or not, if it's a strike, I'm going to swing at it. If it's not a good pitch, I won't swing at it. It made me remember all of those moments I had in previous at-bats.""  Alvarez, Baty and Vientos have combined for less than a major league season's worth of experience, but the Mets' rookies have made an instant impact, much to the delight of their teammates and coaches. It set the stage for Alonso to do what he does best in the bottom of the ninth.  Kodai Senga rises to the moment  Kodai Senga said the ending felt like something out of a movie.  But it would not have happened without the sublime effort of the Japanese rookie, who was pitching in front of his parents, sister and her fiancé for the first time in the United States. He joked that he was glad he didn't get booed.  Instead, he received a standing ovation as he came through with a career-high 12 strikeouts over six innings with one earned run allowed on three hits and three walks.  ""I knew that they were a really good team going into it, given their record obviously,"" Senga said. ""And I know we've been on a bit of a cold streak recently and I didn't pitch great last time, so I did whatever I needed to do to prepare for this game. I think it worked out well.""  After giving up a season-high five earned runs in his previous start, Senga looked as sharp as he has all season. He dialed his fastball up to 98 mph and produced seven swings and misses, including four strikeouts, with his ghost forkball. He threw a season-high 104 pitches, including an identical number of cutters and forkballs.  With his third quality start in eight outings, Senga lowered his ERA to 3.77.  ""I think soon it's going to be like a cat-and-mouse game where are they going to look for the fastball or are they going to look for the splitter?"" Senga said. ""I need to make sure to make the right decision with what they're looking for and throwing what they're not looking for.""  .","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY29yZG9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL21sYi9tZXRzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvcGV0ZS1hbG9uc28td2Fsay1vZmYtaHItbnktbWV0cy1yYXlzLWFsdmFyZXotdmllbnRvcy83MDIzMDMzODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:37:00","CINCINNATI — The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a Sycamore Township case that could rewrite the rules for libel lawsuits.  Township Trustee Tom Weidman asked the court to modify the statute of limitations so he can pursue a defamation claim against real estate developer Chris Hildebrant.  The case involves a fake email that Hildebrant admitted creating in 2011 but Weidman says he didn’t know about until 2020. When Weidman sued for defamation in 2021, a trial judge ruled the one-year statute of limitations started in 2011 and dismissed the case.  In a 35-minute hearing, justices seemed open to Weidman’s proposed “discovery rule” to allow for later lawsuits when the alleged defamation is “secretive, concealed, or otherwise unknowable” to the person defamed.  “How can a plaintiff bring an action about something that they don’t know about?” Justice Michael Donnelly asked.  Justice Jennifer Brunner added: “What would stop someone from publishing something that was just patently false in a very closed setting among a small group of people, waiting for a year and then releasing it widely on the internet, they would be insulated from any liability, correct?”  Justices Pat DeWine and Joe Deters recused themselves from the case. They were replaced on the panel by two appellate court judges. Weidman is a longtime GOP fundraiser in Hamilton County, where Deters served as prosecutor and DeWine, as county commissioner.  The case flowed from a controversy that erupted in 2021, when Hildebrant accused Weidman of soliciting bribes for proposed Kenwood land deals from 2009 to 2011. Hildebrant offered an email as evidence of the alleged bribes, but later admitted he wrote the email to himself before showing it to a colleague in December 2011. When Hildebrant showed it to Sycamore Township officials in early 2020, they requested a state investigation. Weidman learned about the fake email from state investigators.  A Warren County judge dismissed Weidman’s defamation claim, saying it should have been filed within one year of the email’s first use in 2011. The 12th District Court of Appeals disagreed.  “Given the secretive manner in which Hildebrant went about publishing the defamatory remarks, Weidman could not have known about the libelous conduct and the injury resulting therefrom until November 18, 2020 – the date he met with investigators from the Auditor's Office,” said the May 2022 ruling.  The Ohio Supreme Court agreed to review the case in July 2022. During Tuesday’s hearing, Weidman sat behind the podium where attorney Todd McMurtry argued on his behalf. McMurtry said 10 state supreme courts have modified libel rules to account for changes in technology and other factors.  “Secretive publications are probably more problematic today, with the ability to create a fake email account, disguise yourself as somebody else, send that email,” McMurtry said. “I think the court, in a very limited way, is just having to adjust to the modern realities of publications that are secretive, concealed or otherwise unknowable.”  Hildebrant’s attorney, Chad Ziepfel, argued Weidman’s proposed solution is unworkable and unnecessary in Ohio.  “The General Assembly has obviously known for 130 years that the discovery rule doesn’t apply to defamation in Ohio,” Ziepfel said. “And if it were a real problem, we would expect the General Assembly to remedy that. That’s a policy issue that should be left to the legislature.”  Justice Melody Stewart took issue with Ziepfel’s argument that Weidman’s proposed standard is unworkable.  “If the plaintiff never discovers it, the claim never exists,” Stewart said. “If he gets wind of it, gets notice, it’s discovered, you have a year to bring a claim. If you don’t you lose it.”  Justice Pat Fischer questioned whether attorneys could find ways to exploit the language suggested by McMurtry.  “I’m OK with the words secret and concealed. I’m talking about the phrase ‘otherwise unknowable.’ It just seems like a nebulous term to me,” Fischer said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjcG8uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pLXRlYW0vc3ljYW1vcmUtZGVmYW1hdGlvbi1jYXNlLWNvdWxkLXJlLXdyaXRlLXRoZS1ydWxlcy1mb3ItbGliZWwtbGF3c3VpdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Biren Singh had made “provocative and targeted” statements in the past.  “Please advise your constitutional authorities that statements should be made with a great sense of responsibility,” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Manipur.  Advocate Nizam Pasha, representing the Zomi Students’ Federation in an interim application, referred to a recent judgment in which the court had asked “public functionaries and other persons of influence and celebrities” to be aware of the impact their public statements may have on people.  Priority to restore calm  “Some exercise of restraint should be there,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed. Mr. Mehta agreed with the court and said that the State’s first priority was to “restore calm”.  However, he backed an apprehension voiced by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, for the High Court Bar Association of Manipur, about illegal migrants entering the State from Myanmar through a “porous border”. Mr. Mehta added, “This is a concern for the State also.”  The Solicitor General, as soon as the hearing began, said that the situation in the State had “improved a lot”. He said that the State was “peaceful and quiet”.  Seeking Army deployment  Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the Manipur Tribal Forum Delhi, said that he was “surprised” by the statement. He noted that the status report submitted by the State did not have “a word about the killings that happened after the last hearing” in the Supreme Court on May 8.  “That is because our intentions are different. My intention is to restore calm and peace, and not to aggravate… Politics can wait. Let peace and tranquility be our priority,” Mr. Mehta countered.  The court asked authorities to examine an interim application filed by Mr. Gonsalves for a direction to the Centre to “immediately” deploy the Army in villages where attacks were “likely to happen imminently”. The Bench ordered that the Manipur Chief Secretary and Security Advisor each be provided with a copy of the application.  In Focus podcast | What is behind the eruption of communal violence in Manipur?  Mr. Mehta, referring to a status report, said that 318 relief camps had been opened and 47,914 people provided relief through them. He said that security measures were put in place to protect life, property and religious places, adding that 46,298 stranded people have been helped.  Deferred implementation  Moreover, Mr. Mehta said that the State had successfully moved the High Court to defer by a year the implementation of its March 27 order. The High Court’s single judge Bench of Acting Chief Justice M.V. Muralidharan had, on March 27, directed the State government to “consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list, expeditiously, preferably within a period four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order”.  “We gave time for Justice Muralidharan to correct himself and he has not done so. Now we have to stay the March 27 order,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed initially.  However, Mr. Mehta said that staying the March 27 order at this point of time may affect the situation on the ground.  ‘Did not seek stay’  “The State had made a conscious call to only seek extension of time and not seek a stay… We had an option to challenge the order and seek a stay. But considering the position on the ground — this is about one tribe which according to the High Court should be conferred with the ST status — we chose not to seek a stay and only ask for extension for one year so that the situation calms down,” the Solicitor General submitted.  The State further pointed out that an appeal against the March 27 order was coming up for hearing in early June.  Refusing to be made into a “political forum”, the court directed the Manipur government to file a fresh status report. “We do not want to get into areas of politics and policy. We are not stalling the Manipur High Court. But as a constitutional court, we like to be periodically apprised of what is going on,” the Bench said.","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Khan shared a video on Twitter showing scenes from outside his house while he was addressing the nation. This development comes after Khan’s recent arrest by the anti-graft agency in a corruption case, which was followed by a court granting him bail. However, his arrest had led to widespread violent protests throughout the country, resulting in the unfortunate loss of at least eight lives.  Imminent Arrest of Imran Khan Sparks Tension and Protests  In a dramatic turn of events, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan revealed that his house was surrounded by police, raising concerns about his imminent arrest. Khan, who had recently been taken into custody by the anti-graft agency in connection with a corruption case, was subsequently released on bail by a court. However, the situation took a tumultuous turn as the news of his potential arrest spread.  Violent Protests Erupt Across the Nation  The news of Imran Khan’s impending arrest triggered widespread protests across the country, with demonstrators expressing their anger and frustration. Unfortunately, these protests turned violent in some areas, leading to tragic consequences. At least eight individuals lost their lives amidst the chaos and clashes between protesters and law enforcement authorities. The scenes outside Khan’s house, captured in the video he shared on Twitter, portrayed the tense atmosphere prevailing in the nation.  The Need for Stability and Dialogue  The escalating tensions and violence in the aftermath of Imran Khan’s arrest highlight the urgent need for stability and dialogue in Pakistan. It is crucial for all parties involved to find peaceful and constructive ways to address their grievances and concerns. The country’s leaders must prioritize the well-being and safety of its citizens, ensuring that differences are resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with the rule of law.  Calls for Restraint and Respect for Democratic Values  During such challenging times, it is essential for all stakeholders to exercise restraint and uphold the principles of democracy. Respect for the rule of law, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to a functioning democratic society. It is incumbent upon the government and its institutions to ensure the protection of these values and safeguard the rights of all individuals, regardless of their political affiliations.  Seeking a Peaceful Resolution  To prevent further escalation of tensions and violence, it is imperative that a peaceful resolution be sought. Engaging in meaningful dialogue, fostering understanding, and addressing legitimate concerns can pave the way for reconciliation and progress. Both the government and the opposition should prioritize the interests of the nation and its people, working together to find common ground and build a brighter future.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdm9tbmV3cy5pbi9pbXJhbi1raGFuLWNsYWltcy1pbW1pbmVudC1hcnJlc3QtYXMtdGVuc2lvbnMtcmlzZS1wcm90ZXN0cy1lcnVwdC1hY3Jvc3MtcGFraXN0YW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Truman seized control of the nation's railroads, delaying -- but not preventing -- a threatened strike by engineers and trainmen.  In 1973, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate began its televised hearings into the Watergate scandal.  In 1980, rioting that claimed 18 lives erupted in Miami's Liberty City after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four former Miami police officers of fatally beating Black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.  In 1987, 37 American sailors were killed when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. (Iraq apologized for the attack, calling it a mistake, and paid more than $27 million in compensation.)

In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages.  In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that young people serving life prison terms should have ""a meaningful opportunity to obtain release"" provided they didn't kill their victims.  In 2015, a shootout erupted between bikers and police outside a restaurant in Waco, Texas, leaving nine of the bikers dead and 20 people injured.

"eruption","2023-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Rockland"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:39:00","ALBANY — Republican state legislators say Democratic colleagues need to amp up efforts to address the growing migrant crisis while continuing to press President Biden to deliver aid to New York.  “New York is now a border state,” state Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt (R-Lockport) told reporters at a Wednesday press conference at the Capitol.  “This is a crisis of our own doing and this is the result of a failure of Democratic policies.  “There’s no other way you can look at this.  “So let’s start with the failure of a coherent border security policy at the federal level, which has been going on for years now.”  GOP state lawmakers are demanding that Gov. Kathy Hochul develop a comprehensive plan to handle the growing number of migrants and they want Democratic colleagues to take action on newly-introduced bills Republicans say would address the crisis.  More than 60,000 migrants — many escaping violence, persecution, and poverty in Central America and South America — have arrived in the Big Apple since last summer, with 40,000 currently under the care of New York City.  State Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt blasted Democrats on Wednesday Zach Williams/NY Post  “There’s just no plan. There’s no planning there. They really don’t have a handle on what’s going on,” ” Assemblyman Ed Ra (R-Garden City) said at a Capitol press conference.  “And that makes it very difficult.  “[The] coordination is not there, where it needs to be from the federal government and at the state level.”  Some of the bills plugged by Republicans on Wednesday were introduced in response to controversies that erupted after Mayor Eric Adams unveiled plans to send a few hundred migrants to Rockland and Orange counties — a move blasted by local pols.  Two other Assembly bills would beef up oversight of $1 billion in migrant funding to the city approved in the state budget as well as require the state to screen and monitor migrants as they apply for political asylum.  Gov. Kathy Hochul traveled to Washington, DC on Wednesday to press federal officials to take more actions to alleviate the crisis. AP  “Now with Homeland Security Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas releasing migrants on their honor, with no court date or process in place, New York must take the necessary actions to register and track those who have crossed the border illegally to ensure our communities are protected and they do not fall through the cracks of our broken system,” Assemblyman Matt Slater (R-Yorktown) said of the bill he is sponsoring to require migrants register with the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.  The GOP-backed bills appear unlikely to pass the state Senate and Assembly dominated by Democratic supermajorities ahead of the June 8 end of the 2023 legislative session.  New York City is pushing to send more migrants outside as space fills up in the five boroughs. Robert Miller  Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) have said the federal government is ultimately responsible for resolving the crisis.  “Obviously, there has to be more intervention. There has to be more interaction. There has to be more cooperation and more collaboration at the federal level,” Stewart-Cousins said Wednesday.  “All of us have to be able to work together to deal with this crisis, which again, is a crisis in many ways, and certainly, humanity is at the core of it.”  Many of the migrants are pursuing asylum after escaping poverty, persecution and violence in their native countries. Robert Miller  Hochul has called on the Biden administration to take emergency actions to help the state while pushing to loosen work rules for migrants, who have to wait at least 180 days.  “You can complain all you want about what happened at the border and how that ended up there. I’ve got to deal in the reality of managing the crisis,” Hochul told NY1 on Wednesday.  “So does Mayor Adams. So give us the resources. Give us the work authorization, help us out.  “And even in Republican counties in upstate New York and Long Island, they will embrace the opportunity to take these individuals who are here legally seeking asylum if they can work.”  She spent the day in Washington, DC to meet with Democratic members of the state congressional delegation as well as Mayorkas.  The Assembly GOP minority is pushing for four bills aimed at mitigating the growing migrant crisis. Zach Williams/NY Post  A Hochul spokesman did not provide comment on GOP criticism back at the state Capitol that Hochul lacks a comprehensive strategy to accommodate the migrants as fights erupt between New York City and counties outsides its boundaries.  “More of us are going to be dealing with hearing that people are being relocated into our parts of the state and our counties,” Ra, who sponsored the legislation to increase funding oversight, said.  “I think the governor definitely needs to be more involved and make sure that we have some of the things we’re talking about — that we have actual protocols and policies about how we’re going to handle this.”  Hochul has begged Biden to increase federal aid to New York as the number of migrants continues to grow. Gabriella Bass  Hochul told NY1 on Wednesday that New York City will likely need more than the roughly $1 billion included in the state budget approved weeks past an April 1 deadline.  She issued an executive order last week to loosen procurement rules and increase the involvement of the National Guard in helping New York City handle the migrants before begging Biden to step up the federal response in a Friday letter to him.  Ortt, the GOP Senate minority leader, knocked Hochul on Wednesday for not demanding Biden keep Title 42 in place – a pandemic rule that allowed quick deportations of people entering the US illegally — before it expired last week.  Migrants at the vacant Hungerford School arrived by an NYC transit bus on May 17, 2023. Steve White for New York Post  “For her to not make any plea about Title 42, to not ask the federal government publicly, or have a meeting in the White House [is bad,” he said.  “And if she did, if the president ignored her, that’s even worse in a lot of ways.”  But he said it would be fine by him if Albany Democrats decide they want to return later in the year to address the crisis, especially if the supermajorities do not address the GOP migrant bills before the last scheduled day of the 2023 session next month.  “We’ve been called back before. And if this really is a crisis, and we don’t get it done, then we should get called back.

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Chris Smith (KRBwyle)/Handout via REUTERS  Listen to this article Your browser does not support the audio element.  An Earth-sized planet orbiting a dim star in our galactic neighborhood is offering some of the best evidence to date of volcanism beyond our solar system, with observations suggesting a rugged and rocky world tormented by constant eruptions.  Subscribe now to get unlimited access to The Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.  Scientists said on Wednesday the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes – similar to Jupiter’s moon Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system. In our solar system, Earth and Venus are volcanically active, as are some of Jupiter’s moons.  The planet’s volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star. The gravitational tug from the larger planet may squeeze and flex the newly identified one, heating up its interior and causing surface volcanic activity, similar to Io, the researchers said.  Planets beyond our solar system are called exoplanets.  “There is not yet any direct observational evidence of exoplanet volcanism, but this planet is a particularly likely candidate,” said University of Kansas astronomy professor Ian Crossfield, one of the authors of the research published in the journal Nature.  It is a planet that does not rotate – with one side perpetually in daylight and the other in darkness.  “On the dayside, it is too hot for liquid water, so it is likely very dry and hot – likely a desert. On the night side, there is possibly a large icy glacier,” said study co-author Björn Benneke, head of the astronomy group at the University of Montreal.  Also read | Isro to launch navigational satellite for its constellation in May end  “The most interesting region is near the terminator region where the day and nightside meet. Here, water from the nightside glacier can melt and possibly form liquid surface water. In addition, there is likely volcanism all around the planet, even under the ice on the nightside and possibly under the water near the terminator,” Benneke said.  Advertisement  The planet is located in the Milky Way about 86 light-years away from our solar system in the direction of the constellation Crater. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).  It is slightly larger than Earth and orbits very close to a red dwarf star – a type much smaller than our sun, with relatively low mass and temperature – completing its elliptical journey around it in only 2.8 days.  Its surface temperature appears to be slightly warmer than Earth. It is situated on the inner edge of what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around the star – not too hot and not too cold, perhaps able to maintain liquid water on the surface and harbor life.  Advertisement  “I imagine a rugged, young surface for the planet after many millions of years of constant volcanic activity. Since the gravitational effects don’t care about day and night side, I also suspect the volcanic activity to be evenly spread over the planetary surface,” said University of California, Riverside planetary astrophysicist and study co-author Stephen Kane.  “Since the planet is so volcanically active, it is still contributing gases to the atmosphere from the interior. As such, the planet probably still has an atmosphere. The planet is unlikely to be habitable, however, since the total amount of energy makes for a quite hostile environment. Who knows? Life may find a way,” Kane added.

The researchers spotted the planet using NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as some ground-based observatories.  “There are still many unknowns regarding volcanism and how long a planet can maintain outgassing processes,” Kane said, referring to the release of trapped gas that occurs with eruptions. “We only recently confirmed that Venus, Earth’s twin planet, is volcanically active.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NjaWVuY2UvZWFydGgtc2l6ZWQtYWxpZW4tcGxhbmV0LXZvbGNhbmlzbS04NjE1OTYwL2xpdGUv0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvc2NpZW5jZS9lYXJ0aC1zaXplZC1hbGllbi1wbGFuZXQtdm9sY2FuaXNtLTg2MTU5NjAvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A newly released report from ﻿the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the United Nations' weather and climate body, says there is a 98 per cent chance that Earth will set a new record for the hottest year in recorded history by 2027.  The report goes on to state that, in the same period, there is a 66 per cent chance that global surface temperatures will temporarily exceed 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels for at least one year.  Earth is expected to set a new hottest year on record in the next half-decade. (Getty)  That 1.5-degree increase is a long-feared mark that was listed as a target that global warming must be limited to under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.  While a temporary breach of the mark doesn't mean the world will have failed to meet the target, the WMO said it is sounding the alarm that it will be breached more and more frequently.  The release of greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, and the increasing likelihood of an El Niño developing this year, are the driving factors behind the temperature increases.  ""A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,"" WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas said.  ""This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment.  ""We need to be prepared.""  READ MORE: Family has renewed hope after cold case reward increase ﻿  A repeat of the devastating 2019-20 bushfires could be caused by the impending record temperatures. (AP)  Dr Hamish Clarke, a research fellow in future fire risk at the University of Melbourne, said the report painted a bleak picture of future Australian bushfire seasons and droughts.  ""When it comes to bushfire risk, the news that there is a 98 per cent chance of setting a new global temperature record in the next five years is extremely worrying,"" he said.  ""High temperatures are one of the key ingredients for dangerous fire weather, along with dry and windy conditions.  ""As temperatures continue to rise, there is more chance of them coinciding with extended dry spells and droughts.""  Experts have said droughts are likely to occur as a result of increasing temperatures. (Louise Kennerly )  Other experts speaking about the report also expressed their concern about the likelihood of drought, while Monash University's Dr Kimberley Reid said it flagged particularly dire news for one of Australia's most iconic natural wonders.  ""In order for one of the next five years to not be record-breaking, we would either need no El Niño events in the next five years, or a massive volcanic eruption in the tropics, à la Krakatoa in 1883,"" Reid said.  ""Both are extremely unlikely scenarios.  ""My biggest fear is that we become desensitised to the ever-falling records and forget what these numbers actually mean.  ""1.5 degrees warming means the Great Barrier Reef probably won't survive this century. That's tragic.""  The Great Barrier Reef is in serious danger thanks to climate change. (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority)  Clarke, meanwhile, said the report highlighted the need for more urgent action to reduce emissions and limit the extent of climate change.﻿  ""If we continue on our current path there is a real possibility of a repeat – or worse – of the conditions that led to the devastating Black Summer fires of 2019-20,"" he said.

The comments by Hamas added to the already heightened tensions ahead of Thursday’s march and threatened to reignite fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, just days after a cease-fire took hold. Two years ago, an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas erupted during the annual march.  While Hamas stayed out of the latest round of fighting, officials with the ruling Islamic militant group urged Palestinians to oppose Thursday’s parade.  “We ask the people of Jerusalem to mobilize the masses to confront the march of the flags in Jerusalem tomorrow,” said Mushir al-Masri, a Hamas official in Gaza.  Hamas also urged Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and inside Israel to “clash with the occupation"" and said it would hold a demonstration with Palestinian flags along Gaza’s heavily fortified frontier with Israel.  The parade is meant to mark “Jerusalem Day,” Israel's annual celebration of its capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites, in the 1967 Mideast war.  Israel considers the entire city to be its eternal capital. But the international community does not recognize Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, and the Palestinians claim the area as the capital of a future state.  In a speech marking Jerusalem Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has broken “new horizons” since capturing east Jerusalem.  “We are committed to safeguarding the security of Jerusalem, to ensuring its prosperity and to continuing its momentum,” he said. “We are also doing this against all of the threats around us.”  Each year, thousands of Israeli nationalists participate in the march, waving blue and white Israeli flags and singing songs as they walk through the Muslim Quarter and toward the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray.  Israelis describe the parade as a festive event. But in past years, it has been marred by anti-Arab racist chants and violence toward local Palestinians by some of the marchers.  Adding to the combustible atmosphere, large numbers of Jews are expected to visit Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site early Thursday before the parade.  The hilltop compound is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to the biblical Jewish Temples, and is the holiest site in Judaism. Palestinians call it the Noble Sanctuary, and today it is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.  Under longstanding agreements, Jews are permitted to visit the compound but not pray there. But an increase in such visits in recent years, along with scenes of some Jews quietly praying, have raised concerns among Palestinians that Israel is trying to alter the status quo — a charge Israel denies.  The competing claims to the site lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and often spill over into violence.  Chief Supt Yoram Segal, a senior police official in Jerusalem, said police would deploy some 2,500 officers on Thursday to ensure the day passes without violence.  “We are going to deal harshly with anyone who tries to disturb the peace,” he told reporters.  The march comes less than a week after Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group in Gaza reached a cease-fire that ended five days of heavy fighting.  Hamas, the de facto government in Gaza responsible for the plight of the territory’s 2.3 million people, stayed out of the fighting, while Israel avoided attacking the militant group.  Reham Owda, an independent Gaza-based analyst, said that neither side appears interested in resuming cross-border violence.  “No one is interested in fierce escalation,” she said, but she said the parade could trigger “limited, symbolic” firing of rockets that could in turn spark Israeli airstrikes in retaliation.  If violence erupts in Jerusalem, Hamas could jump into the fray, as it did two years ago.  “The resistance is ready to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque and prevent the Judaization of Jerusalem,” al-Masri said.  ___  Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvaGFtYXMtY2FsbHMtcGFsZXN0aW5pYW5zLWNvbmZyb250LWlzcmFlbGktdmljdG9yeS1wYXJhZGUtamVydXNhbGVtLTk5MzkxOTQx0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvaGFtYXMtY2FsbHMtcGFsZXN0aW5pYW5zLWNvbmZyb250LWlzcmFlbGktdmljdG9yeS1wYXJhZGUtamVydXNhbGVtLTk5MzkxOTQx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite the loss, the Cruisers had reason to hold their heads high after a season that saw them go further than any Eatonville High School soccer team in the past 21 years.  The Cruisers' spirits were high going into the decisive playoff game, buoyed by a resounding 2-0 victory over the Raymond Seagulls earlier in the week. Playing in front of a raucous home crowd, the Cruisers delivered a performance that ignited the stands and had fans on their feet throughout the match.  The first goal of the game came from Victor Peña, who found the back of the net with an assist from Riley Rockey. The crowd erupted in deafening cheers as the Cruisers took an early lead, setting the stage for an intense battle.  As the second half got underway, Kevin Tomyn seized an opportunity and scored on a blocked penalty kick, putting the Cruisers ahead 2-0.  Despite their valiant efforts in their next game, the Cruisers were ultimately outmatched by a dominant Columbia-White Salmon side. The opposing team overpowered the Cruisers' defense and netted five goals throughout the match.  Reflecting on the season, head coach Clinton Tomyn expressed immense pride in his team's accomplishment.  ""As the coach, I could not be more proud of these boys,"" he said. ""This was the farthest the EHS soccer team has gone for 21 years, and it is a testament to their hard work, dedication and the unwavering support of our community.""  Tomyn also extended his gratitude to the town of Eatonville for the overwhelming fan support.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGlzcGF0Y2huZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE3L2VhdG9udmlsbGUtc29jY2Vycy1zZWFzb24tZW5kcy1hdC1kaXN0cmljdC1wbGF5b2Zmcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The opening of U.S. Embassy Nuku’alofa comes as the countries work together on issues ranging from economic development and maritime security to the climate crisis.  “This opening symbolizes the renewal of our relationship and underlines the strength of our commitment to our bilateral relations, to the people of Tonga, and to our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region,” U.S. Department of State Spokesperson Matthew Miller said.  Shared values  The new embassy paves the way for greater engagement with Tonga, Miller added, including a larger U.S. diplomatic presence there.  “We look forward to being able to engage more fully with our friends in Tonga and the broader region!” Marie C. Damour, the U.S. ambassador to Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu, said in a tweet.  During a May 10 opening ceremony, Antone Greubel, deputy chief of mission at U.S. Embassy Suva, Fiji, described the United States’ partnership as “rooted in shared values and close cooperation.”  Today we are pleased to announce the opening of our newest embassy, in Nuku’alofa, Tonga. We value our shared history with Tonga, a relationship that dates back to 1886. The new embassy is a symbol of our commitment to a shared future and to the people of Tonga. #USWithTonga pic.twitter.com/WklK1pFdev — Department of State (@StateDept) May 10, 2023  The embassy opened less than a year after Vice President Harris announced in July 2022 that the United States and Tonga had begun talks on U.S. interest in opening an embassy. In August, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with Tupou VI, King of Tonga, in Nuku’alofa to celebrate 50 years of bilateral relations.  In September 2022, the Biden administration launched the first U.S. Pacific Partnership Strategy (PDF, 279KB), outlining steps for greater U.S. engagement in the Pacific region. Since then, the U.S. has opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands, moved the U.S. Embassy in Papua New Guinea to a new facility in Port Moresby, and announced an intent to open an embassy in Vanuatu, subject to congressional notification.  The United States is also continuing discussions with Kiribati about opening a new embassy in Tarawa.  Long-standing ties  Cultural and historic ties between the U.S. and Tonga date back to the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation signed October 2, 1886. Tonga has welcomed over 1,700 U.S. Peace Corps volunteers since 1967.  More than 50,000 Tongan Americans live in the United States. They are part of a diverse Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community that brings vibrant contributions to U.S. culture.  Recent U.S.-Tonga collaboration has included the response to the January 2022 volcanic eruption off the coast of Tonga that triggered tsunami waves and destroyed homes and infrastructure. The U.S. provided $2.6 million in humanitarian assistance and deployed satellite communications and early warning equipment.  In September 2022, President Biden announced $810 million in expanded programs for Pacific Islands, including $130 million to address the consequences of climate change and to bolster early warning systems for extreme weather events.  “The United States is a proud Pacific nation and has an enduring commitment to the Pacific Islands,” Harris told the Pacific Island Forum in Washington in July 2022.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2hhcmUuYW1lcmljYS5nb3YvbmV3LXVzLWVtYmFzc3ktaW4tdG9uZ2Etc2hvd3MtZW5kdXJpbmctdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-15","10:00:00","{""Ottawa"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:55:12","A bidding war has erupted over the NHL’s Ottawa Senators, and fans are as starstruck by the names involved as they are sticker-shocked by the price.  Four groups submitted final bids on May 15 and at least one reached US$1 billion. Two remaining groups boast major stars.  Hip hop icon Snoop Dogg is part of Hollywood producer Neko Sparks’s bid. Toronto superstar The Weeknd was folded in by Harlo Capital’s Jeffrey and Michael Kimel. Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds was in the mix until he and his partners, real estate moguls the Remington Group, pulled out at the last minute.  Most observers are mildly surprised that a small-market Canadian hockey club has captured global headlines but absolutely astonished that it could fetch a billion dollars.  We shouldn’t be surprised. Pro sports franchises are some of the hottest commodities on the market, with billionaires from tech and finance pouncing on almost every premier franchise that’s become available.  These are high-profile, scarce assets with escalating valuations that offer entry into a hyper-exclusive club. They also carry deep emotional and historical ties to local communities and fan bases distributed around the globe.  Benefits of ownership  But status, scarcity and emotion aren’t the only reasons sports ownership is suddenly so appealing. Over the last 25 years, franchises have transformed from live entertainment holdings serving local populations to global, financialized assets.  They provide avenues for forms of investment and financial engineering not traditionally the purview of pro sports. They are leveraged for real estate and land development and provide “creative” tax scenarios. They garner good will with local citizens and governments to the benefit of the owners’ other business interests. They provide robust transmedia brands and intellectual property that can be monetized elsewhere.  These speculative forms of valuing franchises have been historically overlooked, but they are at the centre of the Senators sale. The purchaser will acquire the team, its current arena and 70 acres of land in Kanata on which the Canadian Tire Centre rests.  They will also acquire the opportunity to negotiate exclusive development rights at LeBreton Flats, 7.5 acres of prime real estate on the edge of Ottawa’s downtown. The Sens were selected last year by the National Capital Commission as its preferred development bid for this parcel of Crown land, which has tantalized developers for two decades.  Hence the many real estate magnates figuring prominently in the Senators sale. Reports suggest Reynolds and Remington, when still involved, planned to build a downtown arena district while redeveloping the Kanata land.  Most other bids appear keen to follow a similar path.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld  Potential rewards are massive  These projects are inherently speculative. Despite no binding agreements with the city or the National Capital Commission, the bet is they will lead to revenue, land and franchise value increases that will justify a billion-dollar investment.  Such projections are based on examples like Edmonton’s ICE District, which has rewarded Oilers owner Daryl Katz handsomely for his 2008 purchase of the team. Katz is co-developer of the district, where blocks of restaurants, bars, condos and transit infrastructure were built around Rogers Place arena.  It typifies a new norm of stadium development that sees developers and policymakers mobilize public speculation to garner support. They assert that these projects will catalyze further development and economic activity in areas that are deemed in need of “regeneration” — although whether they actually do is endlessly debated.  These lucrative development plays contribute to rising franchise values, but real estate is only part of the story. A second and relatively novel form of speculation is increasingly important: leveraging sports teams as “IP,” the buzzword now used to describe intellectual property.  After purchasing the Welsh football club Wrexham AFC in 2021, Reynolds and his partner Rob McElhenney produced a docu-series, Welcome to Wrexham, that has been a streaming smash. Reynolds integrated the club with his other business interests through ad campaigns and other brand “synergies” to lucrative results.  The actors have used their star power to push the Wrexham AFC into areas not usually available to lower-tier soccer clubs, such as EA Sports’ FIFA video game franchise and a high-profile partnership with TikTok. Given their success, it was not surprising to see Reynolds trying to break into a major North American sports league.  (Patrick McElhenney/FX via AP)  Betting on future outcomes  Sports and business pundits have been slow to consider these speculative modes of valuing franchises, but financial markets and fans have not. It’s no coincidence that the influx of investors from finance and tech has overlapped with the rise of sports gambling.  Betting apps like FanDuel and DraftKings break sporting events down into ever smaller units — derivatives — that fan-users can bet on at every moment of an event.  Wagering on outcomes in this way is inherently speculative, mirroring activities that structure most financial markets in 2023. Arbitrage and futures trading, derivative markets and speculative real estate plays are about leveraging and monetizing uncertainty. They are less about reacting to past events than gaming scenarios and betting on probabilities. They seek to project and engineer future outcomes.  We should therefore understand the Senators sale not just in terms of recent transformations in sports business, but as symptomatic of these broader trends in which every aspect of culture and economy bends toward financialization and speculation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS90aGUtb3R0YXdhLXNlbmF0b3JzLXNhbGUtaXMtYWJvdXQtYS1sb3QtbW9yZS10aGFuLXRpY2tldC1zYWxlcy1hbmQtc3Rhci1wb3dlci0yMDU3OTnSAXRodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vYW1wL3RoZS1vdHRhd2Etc2VuYXRvcnMtc2FsZS1pcy1hYm91dC1hLWxvdC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tdGlja2V0LXNhbGVzLWFuZC1zdGFyLXBvd2VyLTIwNTc5OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Minutes later, the text was deleted from his phone. He has not been heard from since.  Osman, 60, had been returning home after delivering some medication to his father in another part of Khartoum. It was only through contact with an RSF source that his family were able to confirm find out that their father was being interrogated. Two weeks on, they have heard nothing more.  Kamal Ali Osman, who has not been heard from since he told his family he was being stopped by the RSF in Khartoum two weeks ago.  “We were shocked and scared. Why did he delete the message? We think he was forced to delete it,” said Osman’s daughter, Israa Ali Osman, 22, who was away in Egypt with other family when the fighting erupted in Sudan on 15 April between the RSF and the national army.  The family are among many who have been posting pictures and contact information on social media over the past month, desperately searching for loved ones who have gone missing in the weeks since the conflict began. Many people disappeared after venturing out of their homes for food or medication.  Osman’s daughter said there was no reason for him to be held – her father has no military involvement.  A relative who went to search for Osman found his car parked in an area where the RSF keep their vehicles. His daughter says he recently had a heart operation and needs daily medicines.  “We are constantly worried about him and his health,” she said. “My younger brothers always ask about him and my mother is worried as she suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. We haven’t eaten or slept well for two weeks.”  At least 190 people have gone missing since 15 April, according to the Missing Initiative, a volunteer organisation founded after the RSF attacked a peaceful sit-in demanding civilian rule in 2019, killing at least 120 people, with more going missing. Its work has never stopped, as people have continued to disappear, particularly after a military coup in 2021.  “It has never stopped because violence has never stopped. The city was never safe and the country as a whole was surrounded by forces everywhere, whether RSF or army. On every corner, every day, there is someone to disappear after each and every protest,” said Fadia Khalaf, co-founder of the initiative.  Some are detained or disappeared, and others reportedly killed with their families unable to recover their bodies.  The process starts with a report from families, then the group’s members use their contacts to investigate. It is a long process that can weigh heavily on those involved.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does make you depressed and eventually you just burn out and feel like you can’t do anything any more. It becomes very heavy – on your heart, on your brain,” Khalaf said.  “It feels heavier than before because it wasn’t on the same scale. This is a war. There is no country, there’s no government, there’s no police. They’re bombing everywhere – hospitals, factories, houses, mosques. You feel lost. I’m not talking only about the missing, the whole situation is really overwhelming.”  A doctor points to damage outside the East Nile hospital in Khartoum, where airstrikes and street battles have forced thousands to flee in recent weeks. Photograph: RSF/Reuters  Despite the daunting task, the team has continued to work around the clock and are having success – managing to return 25 people to their families so far. “It feels amazing and we’re actually finding people every day as well. It feels really good in the middle of this chaos,” Khalaf said.  Like Osman, Siddig Ismail Mohamed Tahir went missing after being arrested by the RSF in late April. He had left the family home and was answering calls before his phone was turned off.  “My dad would never do that, and that’s when we knew,” said his daughter Sarah Siddig, who lives in Manchester with her sister. “It was the most horrible feeling. I could never explain the confusion, pain and fear we felt. There were a thousand things going through our heads because we knew anything could have happened.”  After five hours of trying to get through on the phone to Khartoum, she posted on social media calling for help. Eventually, information came through about where he was being held. As British citizens, the family contacted the UK Foreign Office.  “I honestly feel like they didn’t understand the urgency of the situation,” she said. But after they contacted the British ambassador to Sudan, Giles Lever, their father was released.  “I met my father in Birmingham airport, that’s where the evacuation plane arrived. We were all standing around the airport waiting for him. Once we saw him, we hugged him so tight while crying our eyes out. My dad was just laughing and telling us that he’s OK – he always does this because he never wants us to be worried about him.  Smoke over the capital, Khartoum, as fighting continued on 6 May. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images  “He had a scar on his leg after being grazed by a bullet during his detention. I remember crying so hard thinking that the bullet could have hit anywhere, but overall I’ve never felt so much relief.”  Since then, Siddig has been trying to help others find missing people, offering support and advice. “The Sudanese community is unmatched. The amount of help we got was overwhelming. People we don’t even know were risking their lives for my dad,” she said.  “It’s the hardest thing anyone can ever go through. I hope I can help as many people as I can. It’s a scary experience and I was lucky enough to have my sister’s help, many people are going through this alone.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8xOC9vbi1ldmVyeS1jb3JuZXItc29tZW9uZS1kaXNhcHBlYXJzLXRoZS1mcmFudGljLXNlYXJjaC1mb3Itc3VkYW5zLW1pc3NpbmfSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTgvb24tZXZlcnktY29ybmVyLXNvbWVvbmUtZGlzYXBwZWFycy10aGUtZnJhbnRpYy1zZWFyY2gtZm9yLXN1ZGFucy1taXNzaW5n?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interview with CNBC, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that every time there is a new technology in the market, it is bound to displace a few jobs.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on AI taking away jobs  Nadella told CNBC that every time a new technology emerges, there is “real dispacement” that can take place in the job market. However, he added that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can also create new jobs.  As per his statement, “I mean, there can be a billion developers. In fact, the world needs a billion developers. So, the idea that this is actually a democratizing tool to make access to new technology and access to new knowledge easier, so that the ramp-up on the learning curve is easier.”  In a recent interview with CBS Mornings, Nadella said that the new technology still requires human beings to read, edit and approve content. He believes that AI will bring “satisfaction to current jobs and net new jobs”. He added that salaries of employees can also go up as a result of the company’s plans.  Thousands of tech luminaries including Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and more sent out an open letter demanding an immediate 6-month pause on training of AI systems that are more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4. They believe that AI can pose “profound risks to society and humanity”. Microsoft has made a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and has integrated its tech in its search engine Bing.  Talking about the fast development of AI, Nadella said, “If anything, I feel, yes, it’s moving fast, but moving fast in the right direction. Humans are in the loop versus being out of the loop. It’s a design choice, which, at least, we have made.”  Bill Gates also emphasised that AI can prove to be an asset for education. Nadella believes the same. In the interview, he stated that eventually students will get access to ‘AI tutors’ who will break down and eliminate their “fear of learning”. He further added that critical thinking will be “very much what humans do” but there is an opportunity where we can take advantage of new tools.

LAPD Capt. Kelly Muniz said the detective was in a vehicle traveling on the 110 near Gage Avenue in South Los Angeles when gunfire erupted about 10:45 a.m.  The shooting was not related to the person being tracked, and the detective — who was dressed to blend in with civilians and had no outward indications he was a police officer — was not injured, Muniz said. The unmarked vehicle, however, was struck by gunfire, she said.  Advertisement  Although Muniz declined to identify the detective’s unit, two law enforcement sources not authorized to discuss the shooting said he is part of the Special Investigation Section of the Robbery-Homicide Division, which tracks potential suspects in violent, often serial, crimes.  Muniz said two suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the shooting, although no one has been booked yet.  A motive has yet to be determined, authorities said.  California Since photos’ release, LAPD has been quietly scrubbing police rosters from portal As the hand-wringing at Los Angeles police headquarters continues over the release of police officers’ pictures, the city has apparently been quietly scrubbing the names and ranks of cops from its public records website.  Despite no immediate evidence to support it, speculation spread quickly among LAPD personnel as to whether the detective’s cover may have been revealed by the recent online publication of a database of LAPD photos that includes those working in the Special Investigation Section, or SIS.  Attorneys for the city filed a lawsuit in April against Knock LA journalist Ben Camacho and the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, saying the release of the officers’ names, photos and serial numbers in response to a public records request and related litigation was “inadvertent.”  They argued that publication of the images of officers who serve in undercover assignments posed a safety risk. After receiving the photos, Camacho provided them to the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, which published them online in an accessible database.  In one of several declarations filed by the city, LAPD Capt. Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Robbery-Homicide Division, wrote that the publication had exposed the photos of undercover officers, including those in the SIS unit. Tippet said the images “permanently endangered the lives of the officers” and “jeopardize the investigation of significant criminal cases.”  Lawyers for the Camacho have called it a “thinly veiled attempt to silence” him and other journalists who report on law enforcement and “shield the Los Angeles Police Department from any measure of accountability and transparency.”  A judge last month rejected an initial effort by the city of Los Angeles to force the return of more than 9,000 photos and names of LAPD officers by rejecting a request for a temporary restraining order that would have prevented Camacho and the watchdog group from doing anything with the data.  The judge said that the case was essentially about prior restraint and that the city would need to address it and wider 1st Amendment issues before any decisions would be made.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdGltZXMuY29tL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvc3RvcnkvMjAyMy0wNS0xNy91bmRlcmNvdmVyLWxhcGQtZGV0ZWN0aXZlLXNob3QtYXQtb24tMTEwLWZyZWV3YXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

To be eligible for the Academy Awards’ best picture category, a film must have a minimum 40-minute runtime. Almodóvar’s movie runs 31 minutes. With those extra nine minutes, we could also highlight the worthiness of actors Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal and the project’s artisan categories. But for his second English language endeavor, coming three years after “The Human Voice” with Tilda Swinton, the Spanish auteur’s sensibilities are never lacking. His new Spanish Western stands proudly next to some of his most audacious movies such as “Talk to Her” and “Volver.”  More from Variety  A rainy Wednesday in the south of France didn’t keep crowds of ticket rushers and fans from trying to get a glimpse of Almodóvar’s short film starring Pascal and Hawke. Almodóvar and Hawke participated in a post-screening Q&A to discuss the project, sitting next to translators. Pascal was not in attendance, reportedly due to going into production this week for an unnamed role in Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator 2.”  The film tells the story of Silva (Pascal), who rides a horse across the desert to visit his friend Jake (Hawke), who is a sheriff. What follows is a story of vengeance, intrigue and forbidden love.  Almodóvar referenced Westerns such Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog” as a source of inspiration. “The lead character’s sexuality is kind of ambivalent,” Almodóvar said about Campion’s film. “But they didn’t fuck.” The line drew an eruption of laughter from the audience.  Story continues  Hawke talked about how the act of pointing a camera at someone is in itself an act of love. “You are saying these people are important enough to care about. It’s always about love, in some capacity. I just like to be wanted. And if happens to be an extremely attractive man…I just like it.”  Discussing his character Jake, a sheriff who is torn by 25 years of forbidden love and the justice he aims to serve, he found the realism in his depiction. “There’s a way that we are, and a way we want to be.

I found him to be a fascinating character.”  Almodóvar and Hawke shared their admirations of the genre with both declaring at some point during their conversation, “The Western is very much alive.”  In a world where auteurs are becoming increasingly entitled to overly long runtimes, “Strange Way of Life” begs for more and could have easily been a full-length feature.

"eruption","2019-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Sudan"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:47:00","In the weeks since fighting erupted in Sudan, ever larger groups of women and children have been fleeing across the border into Chad, seeking food and safety.  Chadians and international relief organizations already on-site to address Chad’s own food shortfalls have been doing what they can to feed and shelter the refugees – even if that means only a watery bowl of porridge and a bedsheet tied to tree branches.  And as the war rages on, the scene in Chad is being repeated in many of Sudan’s other neighbors, as refugees pour into Horn of Africa nations already facing rising hunger as a result of conflict, drought, and economic turmoil.  The lengthening lines of refugees illustrate how Sudan’s war – a surprise to most of the world when the armed forces and a powerful paramilitary organization began fighting in the capital Khartoum a month ago – is adding to the rising numbers of acutely hungry people around the world.  “What we are facing is really a wildfire of spreading food insecurity,” says Martin Frick, director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) Berlin office.  Wars and protracted conflicts – from Yemen and Syria to Afghanistan – were already contributing heavily to the world’s food security crisis. Now this war, in a global hunger hot spot, is exacerbating a crisis that even before this year had wiped out previous steady progress in reducing acute hunger.  For one thing, the Sudan war has erupted at a time when global food prices are particularly high, sent skyward by the war in Ukraine – one of the world’s critical breadbaskets – and by lingering pandemic supply chain disruptions.  Hunger’s four C’s  That has added a new “C” – cost – to what food experts previously called the “3 C’s” of the food insecurity crisis: conflict, COVID-19, and climate change.  With 345 million people facing acute food insecurity, according to the WFP – more than double the 135 million in the same straits in 2019 – the international community is battling to cope with new conflicts, multiplying weather disasters, and signs that major donors will not be contributing as much as usual.  Story continues  The U.N. organization says the 345 million are now in 79 countries – “many, many more [countries] than in 2019,” Mr. Frick adds.  Increasingly intense and destructive weather is one factor, he says – last year’s epochal flooding in Pakistan and extended drought in Africa are just two examples.  But with armed conflict considered the biggest single driver of food insecurity, Mr. Frick notes that the number of “live wars” is double what it was a decade ago.  “The number of protracted wars ... is not going down, and then we have the new wars in Ukraine and now Sudan that add to the already high numbers” of people facing food insecurity, he says.  Shaky grain deal  Russia’s war in Ukraine has been particularly damaging, Mr. Frick adds, since before the invasion more than 400 million people – many in countries with vulnerable populations – depended on Ukraine’s grain.  Last year the U.N. and Turkey brokered a deal with Ukraine and Russia to provide safe passage for shipments of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports. The deal has been a success, U.N. and other experts say, allowing Ukraine to safely export about 30 million metric tons of grains and other foods.  Indeed, the WFP has been one of the major beneficiaries of the deal, with the organization procuring about 600,000 metric tons of grains for its operations in a number of countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Somalia.  But now the agreement appears to be on shaky ground; Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Wednesday that the deal had been extended for two months, but its future remains uncertain: Russia is threatening to pull out if it doesn’t reap more benefits for its own food and fertilizer producers.  “Russia must stop holding global food security hostage to its cynical power plays and profit-taking,” Robert Wood, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said before a Security Council session that discussed the grain deal on Monday.  Russia counters that the grain deal as implemented is helping wealthy Western countries bring down food prices more than it is benefitting the world’s hungry.  Domestic pressures  Signs that “donor fatigue” could be setting in among some traditional food aid providers are also spurring concerns. Falling or internally redirected humanitarian budgets in some countries suggest that domestic pressures to focus on post-pandemic recovery at home may be undermining enthusiasm about addressing the global crisis.  When a series of food price shocks struck developing countries in 2007-08, “we saw an impressive number of countries in the international community come together to address that,” says Catherine Maldonado, senior director for food security with Mercy Corps.  “But now food prices are up around the globe,” she adds, “and that has made it hard for some to join in a global response when some of these same issues they would be addressing with humanitarian funding are being felt at home.”  Against that backdrop, the G-7 group of developed nations is set to take up the food security issue when leaders meet in Hiroshima, Japan, this weekend.  Mr. Frick of the WFP says Western countries have responded the most generously to the burgeoning food assistance needs, with the United States, Germany, and the European Union leading the way. The result? A record $14 billion in the agency’s food assistance coffers.  Still, he echoes Ms. Maldonado in noting that “domestic problems” in a number of hitherto reliable donor countries are raising concerns that the world simply can’t continue to boost humanitarian giving as needs rise.  “Countries have been generous, but we also recognize these issues that lead to fears we won’t be able to sustain the same levels of funding this year,” he says.  Reaction vs. prevention  Yet what worries some experts at least as much as humanitarian funding is how global attention tends to focus on the crisis of the moment, such as Sudan. That can distract attention from areas already in difficulty that need more help to avert widespread extreme hunger or even famine.  “Our focus on these big crises means we aren’t talking enough about what we could be doing now to prevent the places that are already in a tight spot from reaching the tipping point,” worries Ms. Maldonado, who is based in Guatemala.  Indeed, the U.N. and other organizations estimate that the number of people facing some level of hunger or unreliable food supplies – though not yet suffering from acute food insecurity – is nearing 830 million, up from some 660 million in 2019.  The “big crises” have not deterred the WFP from pursuing its development mandate, which includes projects aimed at boosting sustainable small-scale food production in some of the world’s food-insecure hot spots.  Mr. Frick points to one project to develop “resilience villages” in parts of Niger where food production had practically ceased. But with the introduction of water reclamation measures, lands could once again support crops and livestock.  Then when Niger’s worst food security crisis in decades hit in 2022, 80% of the “resilience villages” were able to weather the crisis without humanitarian assistance.  “These projects give people hope to pursue their future where before it seemed there might not be one,” Mr. Frick says, “but they also demonstrate how there are solutions to the global food security crisis.”  Ms. Maldonado of Mercy Corps cites solar-driven irrigation projects she visited in drought-stricken Ethiopia and Somalia in February as the kinds of initiatives that will pay long-term dividends in the battle against food insecurity.  “These projects are helping people stay in place, hold on to the assets like livestock they still have, and are allowing women farmers the stability they need” to form income-producing cooperatives, she says.  “We can’t afford to lose sight of these efforts that are helping communities on the brink,” Ms. Maldonado says. “More of this is what is needed now,” she adds, “so that we don’t see in the coming years the kind of increase in people crossing that tipping point to acute hunger that we’ve seen this year.”  Related stories  Read this story at csmonitor.com  Become a part of the Monitor community","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vd29ybGQtbWFuYWdlLWh1bmdlci1jcmlzaXMtYWRkLTExNDcwMDc5NS5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL3dvcmxkLW1hbmFnZS1odW5nZXItY3Jpc2lzLWFkZC0xMTQ3MDA3OTUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-07-17","Not Discerned","{""Haifa"", ""Haifa"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:43:00","Although stress is a natural part of life, when it becomes chronic or prolonged, it can have a negative effect on our physical and mental health.  Stress can cause the body to release hormones such as cortisol, which can affect the immune system and increase inflammation in the body. This inflammation can trigger or worsen skin conditions such as psoriasis and seborrhea.  Besides these conditions, stress can also contribute to acne as a result of increased lipid production, and may cause vitiligo, known for a long time as a disease that breaks out in many patients following a traumatic event such as a car accident, injury to a relative or mental stress experienced for a long period.  Urticaria (hives) is also one of the physical ailments that can erupt from stress, and in Israel, hundreds of thousands of patients develop hives, but for varying reasons it's less known and not always correctly diagnosed.  Hives are when red and itchy lesions on the skin's surface appear and disappear unexpectedly in different areas of the body. The itching is extremely severe and the lesions come and go on their own and affect the patient's quality of life, from concentration in daily activities, even to waking up.  A woman is frustrated while working from her computer with notebooks all around her (Illustrative) (credit: PXHERE)  The trigger is hard to identify  There's often a confusion of terms between hives, allergies and other skin problems, so public awareness is very important. If someone has an itchy rash that doesn't go away after several days, they must see a dermatologist or allergist for an exam, especially if one is in a risk group, i.e. people with a family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic eye inflammation, atopic dermatitis (asthma of the skin), etc.  There are two types of urticaria: acute and chronic. Acute urticaria is more common, in which lesions appear suddenly and disappear within a few days, but there's a possibility of repeated flare-ups for months or years, which are usually short. Chronic urticaria lasts six weeks or more without respite.  Other factors, besides stress and anxiety, that may cause outbreaks are infectious diseases, certain medications, contact with various substances, contact with plants and animals, internal diseases hidden from view, and more.  In most cases, however, it's very difficult to identify the trigger, so it's important to do blood tests to rule out any internal medical problems, and if nothing unusual is found, drug treatment should be started.  Warning signs  Urticaria isn't considered a life-threatening phenomenon when it appears in places such as the arms, legs, chest and abdomen, but in some people urticaria can be accompanied by swelling of the soft tissues under the skin.  This swelling called angioedema may appear on the face, eyelids, lips, ears, mouth, hands, legs or genitals, and is sometimes accompanied by pain.  When urticaria manifests itself in the respiratory tract or the tongue, it can be life-threatening, as it can block the respiratory tract, and this warning sign requires one to see a doctor urgently at a health fund, an urgent care center, or the emergency room.  Treatment Methods  The first step of drug treatment is using antihistamines that reduce the activity of the mediator of inflammation (histamine), a molecule found inside the body, which causes blood vessels to dilate and smooth muscle tissues to contract.  The first generation of antihistamines have a sedative effect, so taking them should be calculated and activities such as driving must be avoided. The second generation of antihistamines are non-sedating, so they can be given in higher doses (up to 4 pills a day) if one pill doesn't help.  In recent years, following a change in the requirements of the health basket that makes it much easier for patients, steroids which have harsh side effects are being used less.  Instead, there's now an advanced biological drug that opposes the activity of the IGE antibodies which are secreted from the mast cells and releases histamine. This is a very effective medicine that is taken once every four weeks, works very well and really improves the quality of life for patients.  So if you've been diagnosed with urticaria and despite treatment, there is no relief, see a dermatologist who knows how to prescribe advanced medications that will prevent much suffering.  In any case, if it's really a skin disease that broke out as a result of mental stress, first it's important to identify the source and find healthy ways to deal with it mentally as well.

"eruption","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""Imphal"", ""Manipur"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:29:13","The festering age-old ethnic divide amongst the tribes in Manipur has led to the ongoing crisis. All key stakeholders need to be active to ensure this comes to an end.  The violent incidents that recently erupted in Manipur, forcing the state government to impose a curfew in eight districts, suspend internet services, and the Central government to deploy the paramilitary forces and the army to restore law and order, were not wholly unexpected. In terms of de-escalation of decades-long violence by the militant groups, the hard-earned peace looks to be under threat with the unfolding of the recent episodes of violence in Manipur. Based on the deep-rooted ethnic divide (read especially between the majority valley-based Meiteis and the hill-based Kuki minorities), the eruption of violent clashes throws vital signs of an inevitable civil war-like situation unless the everyday politics of fear, anxiety, insecurity, and the mutual distrust among the ethnic groups are identified and addressed with immediate effect.  Going by the statement of the Chief Minister of Manipur, Biren Singh, the episodes of violence have claimed more than 60 lives, injured 200 people, displaced 35,000 people, and burnt down 1,700 houses so far. While the reports reflect upon the triggering points (miscreants vandalising the venue of the Chief Minister’s programme at Churachandpur on 28 April, followed by the burning down of the Anglo-Kuki War centenary Gate on 3 May, and the ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ led by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) on the same day) that led to the outbreak of the violent episodes, there is a need to analyse the larger spectrum of ethnic conflict in Manipur. This article reflects on the issues around which the deep-rooted ethnic conflicts are perceived, pursued, and sustained in Manipur.  Assertive identities and contesting indigeneity  Arguably, a fundamental factor contributing to most of the conflicts in Manipur is the deep-rooted ethnic divide among the Meiteis, Nagas, and Kukis. Over the years, the assertion of ethnic identities continues to shape the social, political, and economic relationships (read conflictual) among these groups. The source of such conflictual interactions among ethnic groups can be attributed to the competing and contesting ideas of indigeneity. The divergent imagination of ‘a home land’ often strengthens and sustains the ethnic divide among these groups. Moreover, ethnic assertion coupled with majoritarian demands by the individual groups also contributes to the ethnic faultline.  Over the years, the assertion of ethnic identities continues to shape the social, political, and economic relationships (read conflictual) among these groups.  Accordingly, the idea of ‘Manipur’ varies from one group to the other. Most Meiteis, concentrated mainly in and around Imphal Valley, often see themselves as the custodian and the protector of Manipuri integrity. The indigeneity of the minority tribal communities, especially the Kukis, is often questioned and rejected. While the Meiteis are often alleged to subscribe to majoritarianism, irrespective of the political party in power, the intense demands by the Kukis and the Nagas were also viewed as a threat to the territorial integrity of Manipur by the Meiteis. It is essential to mention that the Nagas’ subscription to Nagalim would take away some portions of Manipur. Similarly, the imagination of a Kuki land-Zale’n-gam also removes some parts of the present Manipur state. In such a scenario of contested indigeneity coupled with divergent and competing narratives of territoriality, the ethnic conflicts among these groups only get consolidated.  The fear of NRC  One of the recent issues that advance the ethnic divide in Manipur is the demand for introducing the National Register for Citizens (NRC) in Manipur. This demand is mainly led by various Meitei organisations supported by the Manipuri Nagas. The demand for the NRC grew with the N Biren Singh government retaining power in the 2022 state assembly election. Massive rallies were organised in March this year by the Meitei and Naga organisations demanding the immediate introduction of NRC. The demand for the NRC can be reasoned against an alleged rise in the population of ‘illegal immigrants’ in Manipur. Talking of the ‘illegal immigrants,’ one can easily make out that the demand for the NRC is mostly on the suspicion that the Kukis are providing the Chins from neighbouring Myanmar safe passage and settlement in the Kuki-inhabited hills of Manipur. Such a narrative alleging the role of the Kukis in the rise of the ‘illegal immigrant’ population allows the Meiteis and the Nagas to share a common ground. Accordingly, the opportunist alliance between the Meiteis and the Nagas hold the Kukis responsible for posing a threat to Manipur by changing the state’s demography. Moreover, the Kukis are also alleged to be involved in illegal poppy cultivation and drug business that seriously threaten the state.  It is essential to mention that the Nagas’ subscription to Nagalim would take away some portions of Manipur.  As the Kukis are seen as foreigners and outsiders, the escalated demands for the NRC add to the apprehensions of the former. However, with the military Junta taking over power in Myanmar in 2021, the influx of the Chin-Zomi-Kuki-Mizo tribes to Manipur cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, whether the influx of Chins from Myanmar has outnumbered the local population in Manipur, as alleged by the Nagas and the Meiteis, needs a thorough investigation. As the demands for NRC are gaining momentum, the responses of the state government add to the fear and anxiety of the Kukis and advance the ethnic strife in Manipur.  Responding to the NRC demand, Biren Singh in March 2023 announced that the Manipur State Population Commission (MSPC) will identify the illegal immigrants based on a house-to-house survey. What added to the mistrust among Kukis was the state government’s aggressive drive against poppy cultivation in the hills of Manipur. Several households belonging to the Kukis have faced eviction as the state government declared the land as protected/reserved forest areas. What accentuated the conflicts was the demolition of the tribal colony and a church belonging to the Kukis in the wee hours on 11 April 2023.  The Kukis are also alleged to be involved in illegal poppy cultivation and drug business that seriously threaten the state.  The state government’s demolition and eviction drives, the process of ‘othering’ by terming the Kukis as outsiders and foreigners, alleging the Kukis were responsible for the poppy cultivation and influx of ‘illegal migrants from Myanmar, and the Meitei community’s demand for the tribal status wrapped with the old wounds of ethnic strife have directly contributed to the revival of violent incidents in restive Manipur.  Conclusion  With active Central intervention, the violent incidents appear to have subsided for now. However, given the fragile nature of relationships among the warring ethnic groups, one has to be very cautious before drawing any conclusion on the situation in Manipur. The reluctance of warring ethnic groups to have constructive dialogues regarding the equitable distribution of resources greatly enhances the risk of violent conflicts in future.  Given the fragile nature of relationships among the warring ethnic groups, one has to be very cautious before drawing any conclusion on the situation in Manipur.  Further, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar will continue to have some spill-over effects on Manipur. Migration from Myanmar poses a serious challenge to maintaining ethnic peace in Manipur. The conflict between the political rigidity of the modern state boundaries and the flexibility of the social and fraternal ties between the tribal communities across the borders also hurts the ethnic relations in Manipur. As the State government’s responses to the demands and grievances of the ethnic communities seem to be governed by majoritarian sentiments, the restoration of peace among conflicting groups is going to be a major challenge. A much-suggested dialogue among the ethnic groups would serve very little unless the current dispensation in Manipur shows fairness and neutrality in dealing with ethnic groups and diverse communities. Thus, an enduring peace in Manipur requires a lot of hard work from all the key stakeholders.

"eruption","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:19:00","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Days after chaos erupted at a Democratic nominating convention for a Minneapolis City Council seat, one of the candidates said he does not condone violence.  Nasri Warsame, a political newcomer and Somali immigrant who is running for the seat currently held by Aisha Chughtai, said Wednesday: “I do not condone violence. I do not condone intimidation or harassment of any sort.”  Saturday's convention was held to endorse a candidate for the Minneapolis City Council race. Video circulating on social media shows a disturbance happened after supporters of Chughtai took the stage to seek the delegates’ backing for the seat. That sparked an uproar among Warsame's supporters.  Some jumped on stage, shouting, banging on tables and waving signs. At least two people were injured, and the convention broke up with no endorsement.  Warsame's campaign manager, Abshir Omar, said Wednesday that Warsame’s supporters were victims — not perpetrators. Omar said Warsame’s supporters — who are primarily Black, Muslim and immigrants — have been the target of racism.  Political Cartoons View All 990 Images  Chughtai released a statement saying: “The Warsame campaign is asking you to believe their version of events, which are clearly not what we all saw on the videos. This convention used the same open and transparent process that the DFL has always used, and was agreed to by both campaigns.""  Chughtai's spokesperson, Akhi Menawat, said previously that he didn’t think the dispute had anything to do with ethnicity or race.  Minnesota Democratic leaders are holding an emergency meeting Thursday to determine if rules need to change as a result of the disturbance. Ken Martin, chair of the state Democratic Party organization, has said he would use the meeting to propose a change that would “ban individuals engaged in violent assaults” from the party and “take immediate action to remove the folks involved.""  Both Warsame and Chughtai are Democratic candidates in an overwhelmingly Democratic city where campaigns for party backing are often heated.  Warsame is a political newcomer who is campaigning on a law-and-order message. Chughtai is a longtime activist who managed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s 2018 campaign.

Stream: “I Won’t Turn You Away” – Rachel Croft        Were there an entirely different song soundtracking it, watching Rachel Croft walk through a picturesque sun-dappled landscape could have been a moment of bliss; a brief escape into bucolic, pastoral delights far removed from our otherwise busy, bustling lives. The sun might have felt warm as its rays streaked across the ground, hitting the camera in such a way that produced vivid starbursts and colorful lens flares on the film. The image of a lone woman walking through the forest might have felt quaint – even poetic.  Watching it all through the perspective of “I Won’t Turn You Away,” it just hurts. A visceral eruption from intimate, raw depths, Rachel Croft’s new song is a a cinematic reckoning with grief and loss that aches with intense pain, love, and longing. It’s a smoldering reminder of loss’ irreconcilable and enduring permanence; of death’s all-consuming nature; and of the sheer unavoidable weight of a loved one’s absence.  There’s rain in your hair  It’s stained all your shoes  The kind that falls lightly  The kind that can soak you right through  Step through the door  Bags in your hand  And words on your face  Words that you had all planned but  Atwood Magazine is proud to be premiering “I Won’t Turn You Away,” Rachel Croft’s first single of 2023 (independently out May 19, 2023). Active throughout the past six years, Croft has made a name for herself throughout London and beyond as an emotive and uncompromising alternative artist. Her 2021 EP Reap What You Sow remains a stirring example of the brute power and pure passion she puts not only into her voice, but also into every other aspect of her work.        Following on the heels of last year’s standalone singles “Hurricane” and “Weaver Bird,” “I Won’t Turn You Away” finds Croft unapologetic and at the top of her game, channeling a deep inner pain into cathartic musical beauty.  “‘I Won’t Turn You Away’ is a colossal, slow-burning ballad about grief, and the struggle to let go,” she tells Atwood Magazine. “When you begin writing and your eyes fill with tears, that’s when you know you’re really digging into something that’s real.”  The first time Croft sings the refrain, “I won’t turn you away,” her voice is a soft and brooding hush. That subdued energy doesn’t last long; her spirit rises as she sings the second verse over lilting piano chords, ultimately coming to a fever pitch. It’s as if through spilling her guts through song, she can rid herself of these overwhelming emotions eating away inside her.  Where will you go  Is it somewhere I’d know  I hope that it’s peaceful there  Cliché of blue skies, fresh air  I won’t turn you away  No I won’t turn you away  No I won’t ask you to stay  But I can’t leave us this way        “Grief is so complex, and at the time of writing this song, I was seemingly surrounded by different types of it all at once,” Croft explains. “When you write to that person who’s lost someone, what the hell do you even say? I don’t blame people at all for not wanting to let go, to live with the memories and keep them alive. This song was written from their point of view.”  “We shaped the song like the outburst of real emotion. It builds, then erupts, then sputters, ebbs and quietens. I love the journey in songs and I try to really bring imagery out in the words. I want the film scene to play in your head, immerse you in the story. Cinema and drama has always been something that massively inspires all of my songwriting.”  “‘I Won’t Turn You Away’ was the easiest song I ever recorded. I told Isaac (McInnis, of Crooked Room Studio) I wanted a wall of sound. He just got it. Within a matter of hours we had this massive sounding demo which I couldn’t stop listening to all night. It made me cry happy tears because he totally fucking nailed it. I never knew it could be so effortless. The result was just so raw and powerful, so unrestricted. This song didn’t really have the easiest start, even though I was really proud of it, somewhere along the way it was forgotten. I’m so glad it came up for discussion on our demo day, and I didn’t give up on it. I knew this one could be so powerful.”        When you’re really in it, grief feels unavoidable and all-consuming, and “I Won’t Turn You Away” captures that experience with stunning finesse.  Even as we watch Croft walk through the woods in her Andy Little-directed visualizer, we can’t help but feel a cool chill run down the spine. Only when she breaks out and really lets loose do our bones start to warm up – and even then, we’re still unsettled. Loss means that even euphoria – even catharsis – has a shadow; a darkness that no amount of light can get rid of.  Still, that outpouring does feel good; it’s the musical and emotional climax Croft needed to make for herself, and the one that all but ensures we keep returning to this song for months and years to come.

"eruption","2019-01-21","Not Discerned","{""Matamoros"", ""Tamaulipas"", ""Mexico""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:56:54","Last Saturday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador visited the international bridge in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, which sits across the border from Brownsville, Texas. He was there to personally oversee the implementation of his agreement with the Biden administration, which includes maintaining over 20,000 Mexican soldiers deployed along the border and receiving tens of thousands of migrants expelled from the US, who are then being detained and deported or sent to southern Mexico.  López Obrador with military commanders inspecting $570 million worth of new security infrastructure built along the border between Tamaulipas and Texas [Photo: @lopezobrador_]  Surrounded by military helicopters and trucks with marines, soldiers, and police, López Obrador, also known as AMLO, gladly stopped near the customs station for a publicity stunt organized by the SNITIS “independent union.”  Expressing their vile nationalist indifference to the plight of migrants, the SNITIS officials held two massive saint-like pictures of AMLO under the phrase “The poor come first” and declared on social media: “The message he sends to workers is that he will always protect us.”  The officials handed the Mexican president a T-shirt bearing the image of SNITIS founder and lawyer Susana Prieto and a slogan calling for a constitutional amendment reducing the workweek from 48 hours to 40 hours. Prieto, who became a national legislator for López Obrador’s Morena party, has raised this demand among Morena legislators, who have reportedly frozen the initiative. Meanwhile, the government already lets companies freely violate the 48-hour limit and numerous other rights.  On January 21, 2019, shortly after AMLO took power, tens of thousands of auto-parts, electronics and other manufacturing workers marched to the same international bridge to call on US workers to join their struggle against the transnational corporations.  As reported by the World Socialist Web Site at the time, workers shouted: “Gringos, wake up!” and held signs proclaiming it a historic day for the labor movement.  Days earlier, wildcat strikes had erupted across dozens of maquiladora factories in Matamoros, organized by rank-and-file strike committees and mass assemblies outside the plants and in the town’s central park. They demanded a 100 percent wage increase and the removal of the unions affiliated to the gangster-ridden Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM).  Soon after, lawyers and officials of so-called “independent unions” associated with Morena and the US AFL-CIO union bureaucracy parachuted into town to contain the movement. Prieto, who had a long history of collaborating with the AFL-CIO and Morena, played the central role in promoting illusions in AMLO and initially allowing the CTM gangsters to regain control and sell out the strikes. Then, she founded the “independent union” SNITIS to win over numerous contracts and dues without significantly changing conditions at the plants.  With Prieto repeatedly attacking the World Socialist Web Site, this intervention was particularly driven by concerns about the growing influence of the socialist and internationalist perspective advanced by the WSWS during the strike movement.  Seeing its fears confirmed of a wider rank-and-file rebellion against the CTM in Mexico that could spread internationally, the US government under Donald Trump demanded in trade negotiations that Mexico implement legal provisions to channel anger at the CTM behind new “independent unions.”  Morena then fast-tracked a federal labor reform that came into effect on May 1, 2019, establishing that all labor contracts in the country would expire on May 1, 2023, unless unions renewed them through votes at each workplace.  According to official data, only 17,011 contracts were renewed in time and only about 250 were voted down, out of 139,000 contracts nationwide—until recently, officials had estimated that there were 500,000 formal contracts.  The conditions stipulated in the expired contracts will remain valid, but employers must stop paying automatic dues to the phantom unions that were once used to implement the contracts, in most cases without the knowledge of the workers.  In the last couple of years, a handful of cases were picked up by the corporate media and politicians to proclaim a dawn of “union democracy” in Mexico, where contracts were won by “independent unions” trained and financed by the AFL-CIO’s Solidarity Center. This organization is almost entirely funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was formed to carry out overtly the kind of political influence operations that the CIA previously oversaw covertly.  While AMLO today denounces Washington’s support for NGOs trying to destabilize his government, his own government has helped cultivate a faction of the Mexican union bureaucracy that is more closely controlled by US imperialism. He welcomed the pledge by US Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021 to spend $130 million to fund so-called “democratic unions” in Mexico.  The tiny fraction of contracts rejected—and even fewer replaced by new unions—demonstrates that this was a state-run operation mainly targeting ongoing or looming rebellions against the established unions.  Despite massive funding and support from the US government, Morena and its numerous pseudo-left satellites, the failure of these “independent” unions to gain any significant following nationally demonstrates that they are the product not of any revolt from below, but rather of a state and US-backed intervention from above.  The most publicized case took place at the General Motors Silao Complex in central Mexico, where the Solidarity Center used cash payments and lawyers to destroy a rank-and-file group that had organized itself to drive out the CTM union. The US government handpicked a few workers to register and impose an “independent union,” SINTTIA. As soon as it was voted in with a contract including miserable wages, SINTTIA immediately betrayed its promises of defending workers from victimization and numerous abuses by management.  López Obrador holds T-shirt with Susana Prieto's image, Matamoros, Tamapulipas, May 13 [Photo: SNITIS]  The stunt this weekend by Susana Prieto’s SNITIS union in Matamoros to glorify AMLO as he implements Biden’s orders to attack migrant workers stands alongside the open meetings between the SINTTIA leadership in Silao and US Ambassador Ken Salazar as naked expressions of the nationalist and reactionary character of the “independent” union scheme.  In 2022, unions were compelled to make 516 strike authorization announcements, mostly as part of the contract renewal processes, but only seven strikes were formally declared and all but one ended quickly.  In the context of rampant inflation, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine and US preparations for war against China, AMLO and his union partners in Mexico are fulfilling a fundamental service to US imperialism and its war drive.  On the eve of his trip to Matamoros, AMLO boasted at a press briefing last Friday that Mexico had consolidated its position as Washington’s top trade partner. “The US could not function without us,” he said according to Jornada, adding: “Within our territory, there are auto-parts plants that supply the war industry of that country.”  In September 1938, exactly one year before the eruption of World War II, Leon Trotsky summarized US role in Latin America as that of “the gendarme of imperialist foreign exploitation.” Writing from exile in Coyoacán, Mexico, where he would be assassinated by an agent of the Stalinist bureaucracy just two years later, Trotsky stated that US policy “necessarily fuels the revolutionary resistance of the Latin American people, whom it must exploit with growing intensity.”  This assessment retains all of its validity as thousands of troops mass on both sides of the sprawling industrial-commercial belt along the US-Mexico border, and the governments in Washington and Mexico City, along with their agents in the union bureaucracies, attempt to suppress the class struggle. These efforts are creating the conditions for a massive eruption which must be prepared through the building of a new revolutionary internationalist leadership fighting to unite the struggles of workers in Mexico and the US against their common enemy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgva2NlcC1tMTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, that turned into a horrific incident as a huge violence erupted between Hindus and Muslims on Saturday that resulted in 1 person killed and over 13 people injured.  Communal violence erupted in Akola city and Shevgaon village in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar district in the previous two days in response to a religious message on social media, posing a challenge to authorities in preventing further flare-ups.  As a result of the situation, authorities have imposed curfews in some areas. So far, around 147 people have been detained.  Members of the two groups flung stones at each other and vandalized the area. Some two-wheelers and four-wheelers were set on fire during the unrest.  Internet services were suspended to maintain peace and to avoid rumors in Akola and Shevgaon.  According to a senior officer, following the event in Akola, District Magistrate Nima Arora issued a curfew, mandating people to stay at home, in four police station areas of the city in order to ensure law and order.  According to the source, the curfew was relaxed on Monday in areas within the authority of City Kotwali and Ramdas Peth police station limits.  The Kerala Story by filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah and directed by Sudipto Sen revolves around 3 Hindu girls who were converted to Islam and then were brainwashed to join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  The movie has crossed Rs. 136 crore box office collection amidst the ‘The Kerala Story’ crew receiving death threats.  The office of Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde issued an appeal for calm and directed the state police to take harsh action against anybody involved in the violence.

With the investigation pending, officials urged that although ""the matter remains under investigation,"" the fire's cause has so far been determined to be ""not suspicious in nature.""  On May 3 at 5:30 a.m., fire departments from the neighboring towns of Estelline, Castlewood, Bryant, Hayti, and Badger responded to a call that smoke was erupting out of the Lake Norden fire department building. Upon arrival at the scene, fire fighters worked nearly six hours to put out the fire. However, the fire had already erupted by the time they got to the scene, and the building and the fire trucks were eventually lost. When all was said and done the building and all the fire equipment inside it had been destroyed, as well as five fire trucks and two ambulances.  “When we were called we were told flames were coming through the roof,” said Estelline fire chief Max Quarter, who was one of the first on the scene. “There were fire trucks completely surrounding it. I couldn’t see anything but white smoke and hoses. The roof [had] collapsed in, it had fallen straight into the building.”  The fire is a massive loss for the volunteer-staffed Lake Norden fire department, who rely on tax dollars for funding. It could be years before the destroyed equipment is able to be fully replaced, said Roy Hauschildt, the Lake Norden fire marshall.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""We are a district entity. We get tax dollars in, but it's a very limited source for any budgetary needs,"" Hauschildt said. ""It could be many years before we get back all the equipment we lost, depending on how everything comes together. They haven't let us back inside the building due to the ongoing investigation so I don't know exactly how much has been destroyed.""  Quarter agreed that recovery will be a long road.  “The loss is huge,” Quarter said. “One fire suit might cost three-thousand dollars, and they might last ten years. Funding is always a challenge for volunteer fire departments”  Efforts to recoup the costs of the losses have been started, with an account at the Lake Norden First Premier Bank that is currently accepting money from those who wish to help donate to the fire department, said Hauschildt.  In the meantime while rebuilding efforts are undergone by Lake Norden, coverage duties for the Lake Norden area will be split among volunteer fire departments in Hayti, Bryant, Badger and Estelline, each located approximately ten minutes north, south, east, and west of Lake Norden.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXRjaGVsbHJlcHVibGljLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xha2Utbm9yZGVuLWZpcmUtaGFsbC1kZXN0cm95ZWQtaW4tZGV2YXN0YXRpbmctYmxhemUtb25nb2luZy1zdGF0ZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXJ1bGVzLW91dC1mb3VsLXBsYXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire at 118 White House School Road was reported at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Chief Don French of the Madison Fire Department.  The family of five, which includes three young children, was dining out at the time, leaving five dogs at home.  None of the pets was hurt because a passerby happened to spot the fire and let the dogs out of the single-story house before calling firefighters, French said.  The house was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, he said. A nearby pickup truck also sustained minor damage.  The blaze drew firefighters from Madison, Anson, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Starks. French said firefighters were at the scene until about 10 p.m.  The Office of State Fire Marshal has conducted an investigation, French said, and believes one of the family’s dogs inadvertently turned on one of the burners. It is not clear if the dog was trying to reach food on the stove.  “The stove wasn’t on when the homeowner left. They checked it,” French said. “We believe that the dog turned one of the valves on the stove, and there was something on top of the stove that probably caught fire. They said macaroni and cheese, or something like that.”  The family was with a relative Wednesday, French said, while the American Red Cross was trying to find a place for the family to stay.

Minnesota scored 29 runs in three games against the Cubs, marking a franchise record for most runs in a three-game series at Target Field, and have followed with 14 runs in two games against the Dodgers.  Nasty? Dangerous? Debatable.  This is the same Twins offense that entering play a week ago...  Had the worst team batting average in all of baseball...  Had the third-worst team on-base percentage...  Had the fewest hits in the majors...  Had the second-lowest contact rate in the majors...  Was hitting .219 with runners in scoring position...  Over the last seven days (seven games) the Twins are hitting .291/.369/.534 as a team with 12 homers and 18 doubles. Their 47 runs in the past seven days is the most in the big leagues, six more than the next most (Cardinals with 41).  Maybe Buxton is on to something and the past seven days is a sign that they're beginning to click. But he seems to be basing the ""nasty"" and dangerous"" claim on a seven day eruption whereas the Twins' meager offense was based on a much larger sample size of 36 games.  If Buxton is right – and the pitching keeps up its pace as one of the top units in the game – then the Twins really will be a nasty opponent for every other team going forward.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL21sYi9hcnRpY2xlcy9ieXJvbl9idXh0b25fc2F5c190d2luc19hcmVfbmFzdHlfYW5kX2Rhbmdlcm91cy9zMV8xNzAxN18zODgyMzM2OdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL21sYi9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbXAvYnlyb25fYnV4dG9uX3NheXNfdHdpbnNfYXJlX25hc3R5X2FuZF9kYW5nZXJvdXMvczFfMTcwMTdfMzg4MjMzNjk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2019-03-12","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:09:34","An increase in raids by the Lebanese Armed Forces has left Syrian refugees in hiding, worried about being forced back.  Beirut, Lebanon – For seven years, Moussa al-Omari has been postponing his military service in Syria. But knowing he was running out of legitimate reasons, he left the country in August last year and entered Lebanon legally through the airport.  Seeing March this year was the final month of his exemption from service, al-Omari – whose name has been changed for security reasons – was hoping he would receive legal residency in Lebanon, but he said his request was rejected by the Lebanese authorities.  “They told me; ‘It’s OK, you can stay illegally. No one will bother you.’ And just three or four weeks ago, they started deporting everyone who doesn’t have a legal stay,” al-Omari told Al Jazeera.  “I’ve just been hiding at home since then.”  Twenty-five-year-old al-Omari, along with more than a million Syrians finding refuge in Lebanon – the majority of whom have been in the country since the eruption of civil war in Syria 11 years ago – are now terrified of the current crackdown on their presence.  According to UNHCR spokesperson Paula Barrachina, there have been at least 73 confirmed raids on Syrian communities across the country in April.  Barrachina also confirmed to Al Jazeera – without providing a number – that Syrians had been detained and deported, including those registered with UNHCR.  “UNHCR takes reports of deportations of Syrian refugees very seriously and is concerned about current developments,” Barrachina told Al Jazeera.  The Lebanese interior ministry has not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.      Avoiding deportation  A senior humanitarian source, who was not authorised to speak publicly, told Al Jazeera that more than 1,100 Syrians have been arrested and 600 deported since the start of 2023.  Some of these deportations have left minors separated from their families.  Waad, 31, and her husband Raad – who asked for their last name to be withheld – fled to Lebanon from Deraa in southern Syria in 2006.  Their stay became legal in 2012 due to Raad gaining sponsorship through his employer, but this lasted only one year as he lost his job.  Now, amid the crackdown and deportations, Raad is struggling to get sponsorship from his new employer at a factory in Beirut.  “They need a photo of the company owner’s ID [to process the residency] but he is refusing to provide it. My husband is trying and trying but the owner isn’t helping,” Waad told Al Jazeera as her three young children noisily released their energy around her.  “Now my husband is afraid to go to his job at night because of anyone asking him for his papers,” she said, worried.  Her children are also in fear of going to school, and Waad explained that there are checkpoints set up down the road from the house in front of the only mosque in the neighbourhood, where security forces check paperwork.  “At the end of Friday prayers, they’re making a checkpoint so no one can escape it,” she explained.  Like al-Omari, Raad has avoided military service in Syria, and Waad says he is wanted. The whole family has also been vocal against the Syrian regime.  “If we were deported, he would be taken by the Syrian forces and I would never be able to see him again,” Waad said, referring to her husband.  Raad suffers from a condition that causes intense stabbing or electric shock-like pain due to a disorder of the nerves – for which he can no longer find medication in Lebanon.  “So, if the Syrian regime catches him, he won’t survive a minute when they torture him,” Waad said.  “Anyone who says there is peace in Syria knows nothing.”      Unprecedented raids  Deportations of Syrians, including registered refugees, have been documented in previous years; between May 2019 and December 2020, the Lebanese Directorate of General Security confirmed that the authorities had deported 6,002 Syrians.  As rights groups have investigated, on their return, Syrian refugees, including children, are subject to unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, rape and sexual violence or enforced disappearance.  However, Human Rights Watch Lebanon researcher Ramzi Kaiss said the number of reported raids and the manner in which the current summary deportations are taking place is unprecedented.  “We have spoken to multiple individuals, all of whom are registered with UNHCR, who were deported [recently] without being afforded the opportunity to challenge their deportation or to contact a lawyer, their families or UNHCR,” Kaiss said.  “We are also seeing a rise in anti-refugee sentiment propagated by public officials and media outlets who have resorted, on multiple occasions, to misinformation and disinformation tactics to incite against refugees.”  If al-Omari is deported to Syria, he is likely to be taken to prison from the border immediately.  “I would get a sentence of at least a year and then I would be sent to the service, which is indefinite; I have no idea when I would be released,” he explained.  For al-Omari, joining the military is not an option – he says his father and brother lost their sanity after serving for 35 and 10 years, respectively.  “My father was an aircraft mechanic … when he said something, [the officers] didn’t like; they imprisoned him and tortured him until he lost his mind,” he said.  “They released him by tossing him on the street, completely insane and they didn’t even pay him the retirement pension from the armed service.”  Al-Omari explains that his brother went through a similar situation, leaving him now unable to find work or interact with people since being released in 2020 with severe psychological damage.  As of May, the interior ministry made proof of registration in Lebanon mandatory for Syrians leasing property, adding to the existing restrictions on movement, work and social gatherings.  Kaiss told Al Jazeera the government is “resorting to incitement against refugees and illegal measures such as the summary deportations”.  “These restrictions are discriminatory [and] appear to be designed as part of a strategy to create a coercive environment for refugees in Lebanon, forcing them to consider returning to Syria, despite the risks they might face,” Kaiss said.  Usually working as a content writer, copywriter and translator, al-Omari has no option of working in Lebanon under the labour restrictions – which mostly limit work for Syrians to labour-intensive fields such as agriculture.  But even if he works online, he cannot receive his salary as he is unable to open a bank account or even money transfer services.  It is precisely due to these restrictions, including the fear of not being able to pay for rent, that al-Omari has decided to smuggle himself back into Syria within the next couple of weeks.  “I will just hide there and figure something out. I fully believe it’s going to be much safer for me than hiding in Lebanon,” he said.  “There I can hide in one of my friend’s apartments, and I know I will be safe because [the regime] are not invading houses any more looking for people like they’re doing here in Lebanon.”  Al-Omari is trying to sell his guitar in order to pay for the smuggler’s fees.  He knows he is taking a risk, but al-Omari says his current situation is untenable, and that his time in Lebanon has turned him into an insecure, introverted person.  “I became very stand-offish, because everywhere I go, I feel so alienated and discriminated by everyone and my movement is limited to its fullest extent,” he said.  He wishes he could tell everyone in Lebanon that he is not their enemy and that he did not even want to leave his country in the first place.  “If you took all of that hard work that you’re putting into hating us, me and my people, into actually solving your own bullshit you would be doing much better than you are right now.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvc3lyaWFuLXJlZnVnZWVzLWluLWZlYXItYXMtbGViYW5vbi1zdGVwcy11cC1kZXBvcnRhdGlvbnPSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy9zeXJpYW4tcmVmdWdlZXMtaW4tZmVhci1hcy1sZWJhbm9uLXN0ZXBzLXVwLWRlcG9ydGF0aW9ucw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2022-07-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:01:00","A study published in Nature’s Scientific Reports shows that catastrophic volcanic mudflows, known as lahars, can be effectively monitored with infrasound remote sensing technology.  Infrasound airwaves are low-frequency sounds below the threshold of human hearing that can propagate long distances. They may be used to detect small mudflows at distances of 5 kilometers or more. The signals can identify approaching mudflows when they are still more than 20 minutes away.  Lahars are the most impactful of volcanic hazards. The 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, for example, killed more than 20,000 people when large lahars reached the flat valleys where the city of Armero was located.  The recent research looked at signals from more than 20 small- to medium-sized lahars that occurred in 2022 at the active Fuego volcano in Guatemala, where regular lahars occur during the country’s rainy season.  The study is a collaborative effort by scientists at Boise State University, the Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología in Guatemala, and Michigan Technological University, and is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.  “This study is exciting because it adds to our arsenal of tools for early warning of volcanic mudflows before they reach and potentially impact downstream communities,” said co-author and Boise State geologist Jeffrey Johnson. “Infrasound signal analysis appears to have special utility to identify the early movement of mudflows high up on a volcano as they begin to flow toward exposed populations. Early warning is key for mitigation of hazards.”  The research team was fortunate, said Johnson, to record several lahars and to observe one medium-sized event firsthand.  “Lahars are one of the most common volcanic hazards but still one of the most poorly understood,” said Eva Zanzerkia, a program director in NSF’s Division of Earth Sciences. “This project demonstrates that developing new infrasound tools can go a long way toward improving our understanding the dynamics of these mudflows and helping us manage the hazards.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcmFnZW5ld3MuY29tL25ldy1zdHVkeS1kZXRlY3RzLWluYXVkaWJsZS1zb3VuZHMtb2Ytdm9sY2FuaWMtMTAwODIwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, Shaw has repaid the faith shown in him by the team management and played a sensible knock of 54(37).

David Warner and Prithvi Shaw did respect the conditions early on in the powerplay as the ball did move a bit off the seam.  However, once they were settled, both openers began to up the ante and smashed the Punjab bowlers to all parts of the ground. When Warner was dismissed, it seemed like Punjab would get back in the game and restrict the Capitals to an under-par score.  But that wasn't to be as Rilee Rossouw played with exactly the tempo that was needed at that point. Phil Salt later came in and played his part too as the Capitals have set a daunting target of 214 for PBKS to chase.  Shikhar Dhawan and Co. will need to believe they can get these runs as dew could prove to be a factor and the outfield is lightning-fast. Moreover, with the high altitude that the stadium is located at, the ball will travel further, keeping their big-hitters in the game.

The discovery was made in the Barents Sea, about 70 miles (113km) south of Norway’s remote Bear Island.  Researchers were exploring the seabed when they spotted a gigantic crater that likely formed at the end of the last Ice Age, some 18,000 years ago.  Within the crater they found a submarine volcano, around 400m (1,310ft) underwater, which is spewing out mud and methane from deep below the Earth’s crust.  Sign up for our free Indy100 weekly newsletter  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane seeps is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz, of UiT The Arctic University of Norway, who co-led the expedition that unearthed the geological phenomenon.  ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such systems,"" Buenz added in a statement translated from the original Norwegian.  The only other known mud volcano that exists in Norwegian waters, named the Håkon Mosby, was discovered in 1995. It lies at a depth of 1,250m (4,100ft) on the seabed south of Svalbard.  These peculiar volcanoes serve as direct windows into the Earth's interior since they erupt sediments and water from depths of several hundred metres to a number of kilometres underground.  They also offer clues about previous environments that have existed on Earth.  Understanding the evolution and composition of the liquids helps us understand their potential impact on the global methane budget and can inform what is happening on other planets, according to Professor Giuliana Panieri, expedition leader and principal researcher for the UiT project.  “Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how alive our planet is,” Panieri added.  The new discovery, which has been named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is most likely the result of a catastrophic, natural blowout that suddenly released massive methane shortly after the last Ice Age.  The crater in which it lies – which measures some 300m (985ft) across and 25m (82ft) – deep hosts a rich seabed life, which thrives on the steep flanks of the carbonate crusts that were formed thousands of years ago, the UiT notes.  This unique habitat includes sea anemones, sponges, carnivorous sponges, starfish, corals, sea spiders and crustaceans, as well as extensive brush land and bacterial mats.  ""During this expedition, we discovered that these blowout craters are unique refuges from human impacts, such as trawling for fragile marine animals such as corals and sponges,"" said participant and REV Ocean Science Director Alex Rogers.  Meanwhile Irena Violan, an Erasmus student at UiT gushed: “As a student who has only seen mud volcanoes on land, it was a fantastic experience to see one on the seabed. You could see the surprise, excitement and joy that spread throughout the team the very moment we saw it on screen.  “My first thought was, ‘I want to get down there and stick my arm in it!’  Have your say in our news democracy.

Garrity said four off-duty law enforcement officers and one of their wives were in the area at the time of the shooting, heard the gunfire, responded to the scene and began providing first aid to those injured and assisting arriving on-duty officers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvMi10ZWVucy1hcnJlc3RlZC15dW1hLWhvdXNlLXBhcnR5LW1hc3Mtc2hvb3Rpbmcvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTkzOTEzMTXSAV9odHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9VUy8yLXRlZW5zLWFycmVzdGVkLXl1bWEtaG91c2UtcGFydHktbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy9zdG9yeT9pZD05OTM5MTMxNQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 04:42:35","On May 9, Sri Lanka cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunawardena told a media briefing in Colombo that the cabinet had “discussed the violence [from] one year ago” and requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe appoint a presidential commission with absolute powers to prevent any future violent unrest. He provided no details of Wickremesinghe’s response.  Bandula Gunawardena, May 16, 2023 [Photo: Bandula Gunawardena Facebook]  Gunawardena was not talking about the vicious physical attack on anti-government protesters at the Galle Face Green on May 9, 2022 by pro-government thugs assembled at former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse’s official residence.  He was referring to the retaliatory violence that erupted across Sri Lanka in protest against the thug attacks on the protesters. This led to the killing of one MP, and the torching of the homes of dozens of parliamentarians and hundreds of government supporters.  Gunawardena told the media that cabinet ministers wanted Wickremesinghe to ensure that there would be no repeat of last year’s retaliatory actions against MPs and government supporters, and to ensure their “human rights” are protected.  If Wickremesinghe establishes such a commission it will certainly recommend that harsh anti-terrorist laws be developed and used against anti-government protesters, workers and youth. Confronted with widespread opposition to its attack on democratic rights, the government was compelled last month to postpone parliamentary discussion on its new Anti-Terrorism Bill. New draconian laws, however, are on its agenda.  The cabinet’s discussions are part of an intensifying political campaign to denigrate and vilify Aragalaya, last year’s nationwide uprising that demanded the resignation of then President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and an end to his government’s intolerable social attacks on the masses.  Confronted with this mass movement, Rajapakse fled the country and then resigned. His regime collapsed and the politically discredited Wickremesinghe was anti-democratically installed as president by the parliament. This political manoeuvre was made possible because the trade unions, backed by the pseudo-left Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and other political formations kept the mass working-class movement tied to the parliamentary framework, blocking any direct challenge to capitalist rule in Sri Lanka.  The Wickremesinghe regime is acutely nervous about the rising opposition of workers and the poor currently underway against its savage International Monetary Fund-dictated austerity program that has already thrown millions into poverty, unemployment and near-starvation.  Last week, the police secured prohibition orders from a Colombo magistrate blocking demonstrations in Galle Face Green or at the president’s official residence and the presidential secretariat, to mark the first anniversary of the May 9 assault on anti-government protesters.    Moreover, for three days, starting on Friday night, the government deployed thousands of fully armed police officers and soldiers in Colombo in a major security operation. Police and military intelligence officials claimed that they received information regarding a planned protest by the FSP-controlled Inter University Student Federation (IUSF).  Now a slanderous campaign is underway to demonize the uprising last year. Members of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are circulating the accusation that a “foreign hand” was behind last year’s mass movement that brought down Rajapakse.  SLPP MP Namal Rajapakse—the son of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse—told the media last week, “[M]ore information on the foreign mission behind ‘Aragalaya’ [mass struggle] would soon be revealed.”  This was a reference to Nine: The Hidden Story, a recent book by National Freedom Front leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa. The “nine” is the period from May 9 to July 9, 2022 that led to Rajapakse’s downfall. Weerawansa was the minister of industries in Rajapakse’s government until he resigned in March last year.  Wimal Weerawansa promoting his book, Nine: The Hidden Story, in late April 2023. [Photo: Wimal Weerawansa Facebook]  A virulent Sinhala chauvinist, Weerawansa was a former leader of the communalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and a rabid supporter of the communalist war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  Bitterly opposed to last year’s anti-government uprising, Weerawansa claims this movement was a product of the political machinations of the US Ambassador in Colombo, Julie Chung.  Weerawansa’s allegations are a political slander against the historically unprecedented island-wide mass movement that brought down the hated Rajapakse regime.    As the Socialist Equality Party has extensively documented, in 2015 the US was directly involved in the behind the scenes moves to oust President Mahinda Rajapakse over his close political and economic relations with China. The regime-change operation, which elevated Maithripala Sirisena into the presidency, was backed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Wickremesinghe and other sections of the ruling elite, and layers of the upper-middle class.  By contrast, the mass movement that exploded last year against President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and his government, united millions of workers and the rural masses across ethnic lines with protests, demonstrations and powerful one-day general strikes on April 28 and May 6.  This terrified all sections of Sri Lanka’s ruling class and their imperialist masters. While the US ambassador at the time certainly engaged in discussions with the Colombo political establishment, neither she nor those that she spoke to controlled this mass movement.  Protesters gather in a street leading to the president’s official residence in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Saturday, July 9, 2022. [AP Photo/Amitha Thennakoon]  Thoroughly discredited government ministers and MPs, fearful of the eruption of another uprising on an even larger scale, are now stepping up their campaign of slanders and lies against last year’s mass protests.  Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga told parliament last Thursday that the demonstrators were “vagabonds.” He ludicrously claimed that “protesters who were inside the tents [last year] did not even know how to [use] birth control and now the delivered infants are being abandoned in the streets and trains.”  SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena alleged, without a shred of evidence, “When someone raids a bank it’s an activist from the protest, when there’s a rape, that’s activist of the protest, when there’s a murder, an activist from the protest is involved.”  Amid this toxic political environment, government-backed goons recently assaulted social media activist Piyath Nikeshala, prominent in last year’s protests. He was hospitalised after the attack. The police were compelled to arrest Chandika Abhayaratne, the SLPP former deputy mayor of Kaduwela, and other thugs implicated in the attack.  Some sections of the ruling elite are nervous that this campaign of vilification and violence will backfire and trigger another eruption of political opposition.  A May 12 editorial in the Island said: “It may be easier to demonise Aragalaya than to tackle the causes thereof, but such action will not help prevent mass uprisings in the future.” The government, it advised, could step down, “allowing the people to elect a new government,” and “to vent their anger.”  The SEP warns the working class that the ruling party’s slanders against last year’s mass movement are preparation to crush the inevitable social explosion against Wickremesinghe’s IMF-dictated social attacks.  Denunciations of the Wickremesinghe regime by all the opposition parties—including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, JVP and Tamil National Alliance—are cynical attempts to politically exploit mass anger. These parties all support IMF intervention and its austerity demands.  Last year the trade union bureaucrats, the pseudo-left parties and various middle-class formations—which now claim to be fighting the Wickremesinghe regime—diverted the working class into the political dead-end of appealing to these capitalist opposition parties.  Compelled to call strikes and demonstrations, the trade unions made sure these were limited and politically controlled. Declaring that “the protest is ‘non-political,’” they attempted to block the SEP and its fight for an independent working-class strategy and socialist perspective.  Behind the façade of “no-politics,” the unions promoted the perspective of the SJB and JVP for an interim capitalist government. In doing so they paved the way for Wickremesinghe to come to power and unleash the state against the protesters.  The SEP intervened in the mass uprising explaining that it was not enough to demand Rajapakse’s removal. He was only the ugly face of a corrupt and reactionary executive presidency and the capitalist system. The SEP fought to free the working class from the straitjacket of the unions and vigorously campaigned for the building of independent action committees.  The political experiences of the past year confirm the urgency of the SEP’s call for a Democratic and Socialist Congress of Workers and Rural Masses based on the representatives from independent action committees. This congress will provide the political and organisational framework for the working class to consolidate its forces, win the active support of the rural masses, and lay the foundations to establish its own rule through a workers’ and peasants’ government committed to restructuring society along socialist lines.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYm91ZS1tMTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 23:54:16","If you’re a nature enthusiast looking for an exciting adventure, this article is just what you need. We’ll take you on a journey to discover the deepest lake in Oregon and all its breathtaking beauty. From exploring the scenic hiking trails surrounding the lake to discovering unique aquatic life, we’ve got everything covered. So come along and join us in uncovering the hidden gems of this natural wonder!  Deepest Lake in Oregon  Crater Lake is the deepest lake in Oregon ©Pung/Shutterstock.com  Oregon is known for its stunning natural beauty, and one of the state’s most remarkable wonders is Crater Lake. Located in south-central Oregon, Crater Lake holds the distinction of being the deepest in the state – and even one of the deepest in North America.  Formed more than 7,700 years ago during a massive volcanic eruption, Crater Lake has since become a popular tourist destination due to its crystal-clear blue waters and breathtaking vistas. The lake measures approximately six miles across at its widest point, with a maximum depth of 1,949 feet.  Despite being located in an area that receives significant snowfall each year (an average of 44 feet!), Crater Lake rarely freezes over completely due to its unique geothermal activity. Visitors can explore the park via hiking trails or scenic drives, taking in views that include Wizard Island (a cinder cone within the lake) and Phantom Ship (a rock formation resembling a ship).  Whether you’re an experienced hiker or simply seeking some awe-inspiring scenery on your vacation to Oregon, be sure to add Crater Lake to your itinerary. It’s truly a wonder worth discovering!  How Was Crater Lake Created?  Crater Lake, located in Oregon, is a unique natural wonder that draws visitors from all over the world. The lake is situated inside a caldera or volcanic basin and was formed as a result of the collapse of Mount Mazama about 7,700 years ago following an enormous eruption. This volcanic event caused the mountain to lose its peak and left behind a massive crater or depression, which would later be filled with water to form Crater Lake.  What makes this lake even more fascinating is that it is one of the clearest lakes in the world, owing to its unique origin story. Unlike most other lakes, which are fed by rivers or streams, Crater Lake gets almost all its water from snowfall. Due to this fact, there are no nutrients flowing into it which could cause algae blooms or murky waters.  The clarity of Crater Lake’s blue waters means that visitors can see up to depths greater than 100 feet below the surface on clear days making for some stunning photo opportunities. It also provides researchers with an unparalleled opportunity to study underwater geology and ecology, as they can easily observe what lies beneath without having their view obscured by sediment.  Overall, whether you’re interested in history or geology or just looking for somewhere beautiful to visit, Crater Lake should definitely be on your bucket list!  Crater Lake National Park  Crater Lake National Park is open year-round. ©Matthew Connolly/Shutterstock.com  Crater Lake National Park is a sprawling natural wonderland, encompassing an impressive 183,224 acres of majestic mountains, verdant peaks, and lush evergreen forests. The park’s diverse topography offers a multitude of habitats for a wide variety of wildlife species, making it the perfect destination for nature enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers alike. Visitors can explore the park year-round and take advantage of its stunning trails that stretch over 90 miles through dense forests with breathtaking views from 30 different overlooks.  Whether you’re an avid camper or fishing enthusiast, Crater Lake National Park has something to offer everyone. With its pristine lakeshore and crystal-clear waters teeming with fish like rainbow trout and kokanee salmon, visitors can enjoy endless hours of fun out on the water. Birdwatchers will delight in observing the plethora of bird species that call this park home, while winter sports enthusiasts can get their adrenaline fix by snowboarding or sledding down snowy slopes.  The beauty of Crater Lake National Park makes it not only an ideal place to connect with nature but also serves as an outstanding outdoor laboratory and classroom where visitors can learn about geology, ecology, and biology, among other sciences in action. With so much to see and do at this remarkable national treasure trove open all year round- don’t miss your chance to discover what makes it one-of-a-kind!  Wildlife Near Crater Lake  The wildlife living in Crater Lake National Park is diverse and abundant. Mammals, birds, insects, fish, amphibians, and reptiles can all be spotted in the area. Fish species are found inhabiting the streams, while amphibians can be seen in wetlands, ponds, and by the lake. Reptiles are located mainly on Wizard Island and in more arid habitats.  Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrel  A golden-mantled ground squirrel is a small, furry rodent that can be found in various parts of North America. These squirrels are known for their distinctive appearance, with golden stripes running down their backs and around their necks. They also have reddish-brown fur on their bodies and tails.  While they may look cute and harmless, these squirrels are actually quite adept at surviving in the wild. They are skilled climbers and spend much of their time scurrying up trees to escape predators or find food. They also hibernate during the winter months to conserve energy.  In Oregon, you can often spot these adorable creatures while visiting Crater Lake National Park – home to one of the deepest lakes in the world! Keep your eyes peeled as you explore this stunning natural wonder; you never know when a golden-mantled ground squirrel might cross your path.  Canada Jay  A Canada jay, also known as a gray jay or whiskey jack, is a bird species that can be found in the forests of North America. These birds are known for their friendly and curious nature, often approaching humans to beg for food. They have fluffy gray feathers with white markings on their forehead and throat, and they typically measure around 10 inches in length.  The Canada jay is an important part of the ecosystem in which it lives. It feeds on insects, small mammals, berries, and seeds, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of its environment. These birds are also known for caching food during fall months to prepare for winter when resources become scarce.  In many indigenous cultures across North America, the Canadia jay holds spiritual significance as a messenger between worlds due to its ability to fly between earth and sky effortlessly. Additionally, these birds have been used by hunters as decoys due to their friendly disposition towards humans.  If you plan on exploring Oregon’s deepest lake – Crater Lake National Park – keep your eyes peeled for these fascinating creatures!  Black Bear  Please drive slowly near Crater Lake to avoid hitting a black bear or elk. ©poppistock/Shutterstock.com  Black bears live in Crater Lake National Park, with 41 known individuals residing within its boundaries. Interestingly, females outnumber males in this population, although the reasons for this remain unclear. Male black bears typically have a larger home range than females, stretching up to 365 square miles beyond park boundaries. In contrast, female black bears tend to stick closer to their denning sites and usually occupy an area of no more than 27 square miles.  In terms of behavior and activity patterns, black bears in Crater Lake National Park tend to be most active between May and November when they are not hibernating. During the winter months from November through May, when food is scarcer and temperatures drop significantly lower at higher elevations where many of these animals reside, black bears retreat into dens or hollow trees until spring arrives again.  While seeing a bear during these five months when they are active is possible but it’s still unlikely as these creatures can be quite elusive even while out foraging for food. Visitors who do encounter a bear should exercise caution by keeping their distance and avoiding any actions that could provoke the animal, such as making loud noises or trying to feed them, which can lead to dangerous situations both for visitors themselves as well as the wildlife around them. Also, please watch your speed on roads to protect the wild animals that frequently crisscross them throughout the park.  American Marten  An American marten is a small, agile mammal that belongs to the weasel family. They are known for their sleek and smooth fur, which varies from dark brown to light tan in color. These animals are native to North America and can be found in various habitats such as forests, mountains, and even tundra regions.  American martens have sharp claws and teeth that help them climb trees with ease. They are skilled hunters who primarily feed on rodents but also consume birds, insects, fruits, and nuts. Although they generally hunt alone at night or during the early morning hours, they have been observed hunting cooperatively in groups.  In recent years, American martens have faced threats due to habitat loss caused by logging activities and wildfires. However, conservation efforts such as reintroduction programs have helped increase their population numbers in some areas.  Visitors of Crater Lake National Park may catch a glimpse of these elusive creatures while hiking through the park’s forests or backcountry trails. Seeing an American marten in its natural habitat is truly a unique experience that should not be missed!  Snowshoe Hare  Snowshoe Hares are experts at changing direction while running at top speed. ©Jukka Jantunen/Shutterstock.com  A snowshoe hare is a species of rabbit that can be found in many parts of North America, including Oregon. These hares are known for their distinctive oversized hind feet, which help them to move easily across deep snow – hence the name “snowshoe.” Their fur color changes depending on the season, with brown during summer and white during winter, allowing them to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators. Snowshoe hares are an important part of the ecosystem as they serve as prey for many carnivorous animals, such as cougars and coyotes. Despite being hunted by these predators, populations of snowshoe hares remain relatively stable due to their ability to reproduce quickly when conditions are favorable.

After taking a nine-point lead into the half, the C's watched Miami quickly cut into the deficit in the third quarter. Before they knew it, the Heat had tallied a whopping 46 points in the frame. It was the only quarter Boston lost, but it was enough to propel Miami to a 123-116 win at TD Garden.  Celtics Talk POSTGAME POD: Catastrophic third quarter costs Celtics in Game 1 loss to Heat | Listen & Subscribe  As great as the Celtics have been all season, they have been prone to lapses like the one they had on Wednesday night. Marcus Smart didn't mince words about the team's inconsistency.  ""We get tired of doing the little things sometimes,"" the C's guard said after the Game 1 loss. ""I think that showed at times in our spacing. We have a lot of great players, but when we're all on top of each other, nobody can be great.  ""You've got a good defensive team like Miami, they'll make you pay for that. So we've got to make sure we do those little things and we can't get bored with those. And we've got to realize what has got us the lead or what was working for us.""  Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla didn't call a timeout during Miami's third-quarter eruption. Given his history of holding onto timeouts, he'll likely face a fair amount of criticism for his inaction. Especially since the Heat squashed the Celtics' 7-0 run to start the fourth quarter after Erik Spoelstra's timeout.  But if you ask Smart, this one was on the players. Not Mazzulla.  ""Joe's real big on not bailing us out when we're playing like (expletive),"" Smart said. ""We've got to look at ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout and then what? We come out and do the same thing? So it's on us.  ""Joe and this coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a gameplan and put us in the right spots to succeed. But they're not out there playing. So we've got to come together and we've got to start helping each other out on both ends.""  Smart was a bright spot in the 123-116 defeat, dishing 10 assists in the first half to tie Rajon Rondo's franchise record for assists in one half of a playoff game. He finished with 13 points, 11 assists, and two steals.  But he and the Celtics will need to play a more complete Game 2 to avoid going down 2-0 in the series.

"eruption","2071-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Imphal"", ""Manipur"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:34:00","The sudden eruption of widespread violence in Manipur has re-emphasized the need for continuing peace efforts which are only possible if peace movements become stronger and have a wider reach. Generally, there has been a tendency to look at peace movements in two roles.  Firstly, there is a firefighting role of trying to bring peace when violence has already erupted. Secondly, there is a role of peace-makers which facilitates the negotiations of the authorities with various rebel or insurgent groups. Of course both roles are important in their own way and at various places and times have made important contributions to peace efforts.  However, to limit the peace movement to just these two roles would amount to a serious underestimation. The peace movement deserves and needs to have a much wider and continuing presence.  Even when things appear to be normal and there is no outbreak of any violence, the peace movement has the important role of resolving simmering tensions, divisions, hostilities and suspicions in society at various levels so that these can be reduced and resolved at an early stage without erupting in violence.  The peace movement also has to look at important development and livelihood issues, land and forest issues, how difficulties, problems, conflicts, misunderstandings and insecurities relating to these can lead to violence involving one group against the other or one or more groups against the state.  Such conflicts and suspicions can only be removed on the basis of a deep and comprehensive understanding of development and resource-based realities, in turn requiring a multi-disciplinary study and longer-term efforts.  All this is possible only with a continuing peace movement, known for its lack of bias as well as for its honesty and sincerity, which is well rooted in communities. Conditions should be created by the authorities and communities that such peace movements are able to function with a certain stability and continuity and in reasonably secure conditions as only then can they make their proper contribution.  This should be seen in the context of a wider need being felt for a stronger and wider peace movement with continuity in a world which is increasingly troubled by violence, wars, civil wars and a destructive arms race.  How can the peace movement become stronger to cope with the enormous challenges it faces? The sad reality is that today far too many people are paid to work full time for weapons and wars than for disarmament and peace – in fact the ratio of the latter to the former may be as low as one to one million. Most of those who can be seen to be working for peace may not be working in an unbiased way and hence can make only limited contributions. Those working with complete commitment to the idea of peace and non-violence are very few; further, those with the opportunity or the ability to link local with global issues are even fewer.  Thus we have the paradox of the most important objectives of peace having the least number of people working for them. Yet at another level the peace movement has the potential to be strong and broad-based. Its enormous potential exists in the basic reality that the overwhelming majority of people want to live in a more peaceful world and would like their children to inherit such a world. Somehow these yearnings of the world’s people have not been translated into reality.  It is a strong and continuing peace movement which can help to fill this gap. The challenge of the peace movement is to guide these worldwide yearnings of people in such ways as to make the world a much more peaceful and safer place, for now and for the future, for us and for our children. People in most parts of the world tend to be more affected by violence close to them, by violence in their daily life.  This may be in the form of domestic violence, gender-based violence, workplace violence, bullying, violence towards self, street violence or village or habitation or neighborhood level violence. Many good and wise people are already involved in trying to reduce this.  However, quite often they may not identify the deeper causes and contexts of this violence, thereby missing out on more effective remedial actions and the wider social response that is needed.  If a movement for peace and nonviolence can result in establishing inter-linkages and providing a wider social response to these various forms of violence, with emphasis on incorporating peace and non-violence as important social values to be integrated into society and education, all these forms of violence and their associated distress can be reduced in more effective and sustained ways.  In such a situation, many people who have experienced the great relief and joy of the reduction or removal of violence from their lives, as victims as well as perpetrators, would be motivated to become peace activists, taking this message of peace ad non-violence to others.  Hence the peace movement could get a very wide base, where commitment to peace is strengthened and the number of peace activists grows. The next logical step would be to link this strong base for reducing personal, inter-personal and local violence with the wider peace movement for non-violent national and international policies, for a future without wars and the arms race, for ridding the world of the huge threats associated with nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction.  With a strong base of millions of people engaged in peace activities on a continuing basis, such a peace movement will be able to become a much more effective voice, particularly among the youth, and will be able to influence policy makers in more effective ways.  Another way of strengthening the peace movement would be to build stronger linkages with the various other movements for creating a better world, including the various movements for justice and equality, women’s movements and movements for environment protection. There are important meeting points for all these movements.  Thus in a situation like that of Manipur, for example, the peace movement would be strengthened greatly if it works in cooperation with movements for promoting sustainable livelihoods and protecting the livelihood base as well.  Again there would be much for the peace movement to gain from cooperation with the women’s movement as well, with its emphasis on checking all addictions and intoxicants.  However, such strengthening of the base for peace as well as for integration of various constructive efforts is not possible in a hurry, and this is why the need for a stronger peace movement working with continuity should be re-emphasized.

The Earth-like planet is the first such world to be discovered outside the solar system that offers some of the best evidence to date of volcanism outside the Solar System.  The planet orbits a small red dwarf star about 90 light-years away in the southern constellation Crater and is just slightly bigger than Earth, and if the planet is as geologically active as the research team suspects, it could maintain an atmosphere.

The planet's volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star.  “LP 791-18 d is tidally locked, which means the same side constantly faces its star. The day side would probably be too hot for liquid water to exist on the surface. But the amount of volcanic activity we suspect occurs all over the planet could sustain an atmosphere, which may allow water to condense on the night side,” Bjorn Benneke, a co-author of the study said.

The two skeletons believed to be men at least 55 years old were found in the Casti Amanti, or House of Chaste Lovers, beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The area was likely undergoing reconstruction work at the time of the eruption in A.D. 79, following an earthquake a few days earlier.  “In recent years, we have realized there were violent, powerful seismic events that were happening at the time of the eruption,'' said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.  New archaeological techniques and methodology ""allow us to understand better the inferno that in two days completely destroyed the city of Pompeii, killing many inhabitants,'' he added, making it possible to determine the dynamic of deaths down to the final seconds.  More than 1,300 victims have been found in the archaeological site south of Naples over the past 250 years.

Not technically a true geyser, this eruption of water is known as a “soda pop geyser,” because the cold-water eruptions look so similar to the popular Yellowstone phenomenon.  A geyser is created when pressure from hot steam shoots a tall column of water into the air, while soda pop geysers are created when a pocket of carbon dioxide mixes with the water until the water becomes oversaturated and then bursts the water out of the opening.  Crystal Geyser (in Grand County) is erupting!💦Our division geologist monitors this site & hasn’t seen an eruption in years, but this year’s wet winter might have caused the water table to rise, resulting in CO2 gas that powers the eruptions to push water through. #KnowYourH2O pic.twitter.com/hWgrORxT2w — Utah Division of Water Resources (@utahwaterres) May 15, 2023  According to the Utah Geological Survey, the Geyser was discovered in 1936 when an exploratory oil well, the Ruby No. 1 was drilled. Workers encountered carbon dioxide gas deep below the surface, approximately 360 feet, which was extremely pressurized.  The well was eventually abandoned, but in its aftermath, a geyser was created.  The November 1936 front page of Moab’s Times-Independent boasted of a new geyser that spouted an 80-foot column of water at regular intervals of about 15 minutes and a 150-foot column at intervals of about 9 hours.  Today, the geyser’s eruptions have slowed down, though it’s uncertain whether that’s a result of geological changes beneath the surface or of rocks that people used to drop down into the geyser.  Because the eruptions are sporadic, sometimes more than 24 hours apart, being able to see the geyser in action can be difficult.  Studies conducted on the geyser over the last 20 years have tracked the frequency and height of eruptions using sensors. The studies found that minor eruptions ranged in height from 2-10 feet, while major eruptions gained heights of 40 -80 feet and occurred on a schedule ranging from 17 to 27 hours apart. The duration of eruptions ranged from 3-49 minutes.  Related:  We want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip?

"eruption","2018-05-14","Not Discerned","{""CastleRock"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:59:13","      On Sunday, shortly after 9 pm, debris from an adjacent hillside fell about 2,000 feet above SR 504 – Spirit Lake Memorial Highway and covered the roadway with rock, mud, ice, and water, causing catastrophic damage to the Spirit Lake Outlet Bridge which connects visitors to the Johnston Ridge Observatory near Mount St. Helens. The landslide trapped 13 people and a dog who were at the observatory site; they were eventually safely evacuated by helicopter to safer ground. People have been visiting the volcano ahead of its 43rd anniversary of its explosive eruption.  According to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Route 504 will remain closed indefinitely due to the size of the slide and the instability of the hillside above the highway. The highway closed shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday, May 14, when debris from an adjacent hillside fell about 2,000 feet and covered the roadway with rock, mud, ice, and water causing catastrophic damage to the Spirit Lake Outlet Bridge. Engineers need to examine the hillside above the roadway and debris below to develop next steps.  “Additional safety analysis is needed, but due to the ongoing geological instability in the area, it’s too soon to tell when we’ll be able to safely do that work,” said Brad Clark, WSDOT Southwest Region Maintenance Manager. “We appreciate everyone’s patience during this emergency.”  Spirit Lake Memorial Highway is closed to all travelers at milepost 43 near the Science and Learning Center at Coldwater. The closure blocks access to Coldwater Lake and the Johnston Ridge Observatory as engineers work to assess the debris flow and ensure for public safety. There is no detour available. WSDOT strongly encourages visitors to not venture beyond the closure location due to the severity of the unstable hillside – the closure is in place for everyone’s safety.        WSDOT is working in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, and Skamania and Cowlitz counties in evaluating slope conditions. This work will help inform what steps are needed to stabilize the slope, cleanup, and rebuild the roadway and bridge.  The cause of the landslide is yet to be determined, though initial assessment is that unseasonably hot temperatures likely drastically melted snowpack which oversaturated soils and overfilled the channels of the slopes causing debris to join high water, which built up and then broke free, rolling downstream washing out the 85-foot bridge span and roadway.  In addition to cutting off visitor traffic to the Mount St. Helens area, USGS says power was cut off to the Johnston Ridge Observatory. “While the loss of power disrupted a major telemetry hub for Mount St. Helens monitoring, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network stations on the volcano are still providing plenty of data. There is no volcanic unrest associated with this debris flow,” USGS wrote in a Tweet describing the incident.        The debris flow involved in this incident is material left over from the 1980 debris avalanche and eruption of Mount St. Helens. The May 18, 1980 eruption remains the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. Fifty-seven people were killed; 200 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles of railways, and 185 miles of highway were destroyed. A massive debris avalanche, triggered by a magnitude 5.1 earthquake, caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain’s summit from 9,677 ft down to 8,363 ft , leaving a 1 mile wide horseshoe-shaped crater.  As an explosive dacite volcano with a complex magmatic system, Mount St. Helens is expected to erupt again in the future. Nearby towns of Castle Rock, Olympia, Vancouver, and Yakima in Washington and Portland in Oregon are at risk from future eruptions. USGS describes the threat potential of Mount St. Helens “very high”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3dlYXRoZXJib3kuY29tL2xhbmRzbGlkZS1kZXN0cm95cy1yb2Fkd2F5LW9uLW1vdW50LXN0LWhlbGVucy1haGVhZC1vZi1lcnVwdGlvbi1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS12aXNpdG9ycy1yZXNjdWVkLWJ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Although the death toll from that catastrophe is unknown, between 16,000 and 20,000 people lived in the area.  This new discovery provides more precise details of the moments the eruption happened, because the inhabitants of Pompeii were not only killed by the lapilli, or small fragments of lava, the ash and the hot gases released by Vesuvius, but also by landslides from a major earthquake connected with the eruption.  Where was the couple found?  “Part of the south wall of the room collapsed, crushing one of the men whose raised arm offers a tragic image of his vain attempt to protect himself from the falling masonry. The conditions of the west wall demonstrate the tremendous force of the earthquakes that occurred at the same time as the eruption: the entire upper part detached and fell into the room, crushing and burying the other individual,” revealed the archaeologists who publicly exhibited the finding.  The couple, who were at least 55 years old, were found during the excavations of the House of Lovers undergoing work to improve the safety of the building, more specifically in a utility room where both had sought refuge and died from multiple traumas when parts of the building collapsed.

As if this were not enough, during the extraction of the cervical vertebrae and the skull of one of the two skeletons, remains of organic material emerged, probably a piece of cloth, in addition to five elements of glass paste identifiable as beads from a necklace and six coins.  The impact of the finding  Undoubtedly, this finding provides evidence increasingly clear that, during the eruption, landslides associated with the accumulation of lapilli or the impact of pyroplastic flows were not the only danger to the lives of the inhabitants of ancient Pompeii.  For the director of the archaeological area, Gabriel Zuchtriegel,“ modern excavation techniques help us better understand the hell that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii in two days, killing many inhabitants: children, women and men. With analysis and methodologies we can get closer to the last moments of his life.”  What happened in Pompeii?  In 79 AD, the ancient Roman city of Pompeii was devastated by a series of powerful earthquakes that preceded the catastrophic eruption of the volcano Vesuvius. This volcanic eruption completely engulfed the city and its population, amazingly preserving it for centuries and allowing contemporary archaeologists and scholars to reconstruct and fully understand life in ancient Rome.  With all this, it should be noted that Pompeii, for researchers, is an immense archaeological laboratory that has regained strength in recent years, “astonishing the world” with the constant discoveries revealed and demonstrating the Italian excellence in this sector.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2xhdGVzdF9uZXdzL3VudXN1YWwtZmluZC1pbi1wb21wZWlpLXNoZWRzLW5ldy1saWdodC1vbi12ZXN1dml1cy1lcnVwdGlvbi1uL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2xhdGVzdF9uZXdzL3VudXN1YWwtZmluZC1pbi1wb21wZWlpLXNoZWRzLW5ldy1saWdodC1vbi12ZXN1dml1cy1lcnVwdGlvbi1uLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 09:44:33","The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report (opens in new tab), published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions (opens in new tab) in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research (opens in new tab) has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland (opens in new tab), scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption (opens in new tab) — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoL3ZvbGNhbm9zL3llbGxvd3N0b25lLXZvbGNhbm8tc3VwZXItZXJ1cHRpb25zLWFwcGVhci10by1pbnZvbHZlLW11bHRpcGxlLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1ldmVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eleven days later, on March 27, following hundreds of small earthquakes, Mount St. Helens had a relatively small eruption — its first since 1857.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 15, 1800, PRESIDENT ADAMS MOVES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM PHILADELPHIA TO DC  In that eruption, ""steam explosions blasted a 60- to 75-m (200- to 250-ft) wide crater through the volcano's summit ice cap and covered the snow-clad southeast sector with dark ash,"" said the USGS.  These eruptions continued through April 22, said the USGS.  After about a two-week stop in volcanic activity, smaller eruptions and earthquakes continued from May 7 through the 17th.  ""By that time, more than 10,000 earthquakes had shaken the volcano and the north flank had grown outward about 140 m (450 ft) to form a prominent bulge,"" said the USGS.  This bulge was ""strong evidence that molten rock (magma) had risen high into the volcano,"" and was growing at a rate of up to five feet per day.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 25, 1916, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CREATED UNDER PRESIDENT WILSON  At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, a 5.1 earthquake ""with no immediate precursors"" struck Mount Saint Helens, triggering ""a rapid series of events,"" said the USGS.  ""At the same time as the earthquake, the volcano's northern bulge and summit slid away as a huge landslide — the largest debris avalanche on Earth in recorded history,"" they said.  ""A small, dark, ash-rich eruption plume rose directly from the base of the debris avalanche scarp, and another from the summit crater rose to about 200 m (650 ft) high,"" they said.  The volume of the avalanche is the equivalent of one million Olympic-sized swimming pools, the USGS added.  Following the landslide, the destruction continued.  The landslide had removed part of the ""cryptodome,"" which was ""a very hot and highly pressurized body of magma,"" said the USGS.  With the cyptodome removed, Mount St. Helens's magmatic system depressurized, triggering ""powerful eruptions that blasted laterally through the sliding debris,"" knocking 1,000 feet off the height of the mountain.  AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL: 50 MUST-SEE LANDMARKS THAT TELL OUR NATIONAL STORY  The cloud of tephra, or rock fragments, reached 15 miles within 15 minutes, noted the USGS.  The aftermath of the initial eruption was devastating.  ""Virtually no trees remained of what was once a dense forest"" in the six-mile radius of the former summit, and other trees were knocked to the ground and seared, said the USGS.  ""The 600 km2 (230 mi2) devastated area was blanketed by a deposit of hot debris carried by the blast,"" the site said.  The eruption then became a ""Plinian eruption,"" defined as ""as one that produces a sustained convecting plume of pyroclasts and gas rising >25km above sea level,"" says the website Science Direct.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 1, 1872, MAJESTIC YELLOWSTONE BECOMES AMERICA'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK  The Plinian eruption lasted for nine hours, sending 520 million tons of ash into the air.  The ash was so thick that the city of Spokane, Washington, located 250 miles from Mount Saint Helens, was plunged into complete darkness, said the USGS.  Over four inches of ash covered Yakima, Washington, reported Getty at the time.  ""Major ash falls occurred as far away as central Montana, and ash fell visibly as far eastward as the Great Plains of the Central United States, more than 1,500 km (930 mi) away,"" said the USGS.  ""The ash cloud spread across the U.S. in three days and circled the Earth in 15 days.""  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 28, 1986, SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER EXPLODES, SHOCKING THE NATION  The blast also triggered something called a ""lahar,"" which is an ""Indonesian term that describes a hot or cold mixture of water and rock fragments that flows down the slopes of a volcano and typically enters a river valley,"" said the USGS.  In Mount Saint Helens' case, the snowy peak melted in the initial eruption.  That rush of water, combined with the rock flow, created a lahar.  In the weeks leading up to May 18, people who lived near Mount St. Helens were evacuated, according to an article in American Scientist.  The area immediately surrounding Mount St. Helens was divided into a ""red zone"" and a ""blue zone.""  Of the 57 people who died in the eruption, only one — Harry Randall Truman — did not have express permission to be near the mountain the day it erupted, and most of the deaths actually occurred outside the boundaries of the blue zone, said American Scientist.

"eruption","1980-04-14","Not Discerned","{""Kelso"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:45:00","MOUNT ST. HELENS, Wash. – It was 43 years ago on May 18, that Mount St. Helens exploded to life, erupting in violent fashion, spewing towering clouds carrying 520 million tons of ash that choked the skies with grit and darkness and claiming the lives of 57 people in what remains the largest volcanic eruption in American history.  While the most devastating acts occurred on that fateful day, scientists began getting an inkling something was up a little more than two months before the eruption.  For this year's anniversary, the U.S. Geological Survey poured back over its historical records leading up to the eruption, providing day-by-day updates on social media mimicking what happened 43 years ago each day before the mountain blew.  8 weeks before Mount St. Helens Eruption: March 20-23, 1980  Mount St. Helens had slept peacefully for 123 years while nestled in its spot in southwestern Washington along the Cascade Mountains; a tall, majestic snow-capped mountain that dotted the horizon in between sisters Mount Rainier, which sits closer to the Seattle area, and Mount Hood near Portland.  MOUNT ST. HELENS ERUPTION: SURVIVORS RECOUNT THE ‘DARKER THAN MIDNIGHT’ FURY IN 1980  The mountain only had 44 documented earthquakes between 1975 and early 1980. However, on the afternoon of March 20, 1980, the ground began to shake. Seismologists measured a 4.2 magnitude quake at a shallow depth.  Over the next three days, seismologists would measure dozens of quakes a day.  Seismologists raced to the mountain to install more seismometers around the volcano as another 4.2 quake rattled the mountain on March 22 and another greater than 4.0 struck on March 23. Scientists determined the quakes were not ""typical"" quakes with aftershocks, but many individual quakes, indicating a potential precursor to volcanic activity.  Frustration soon surfaced when seismologists returned to the mountain only to find their new portable seismic recorders are not working correctly due to bad batteries.  March 24-31, 1980: 'Bedlam' begins  On March 24, 1980, the USGS's David Johnston visited the Pacific Northwest Seismology Network's lab at the University of Washington in Seattle and finds ""bedlam"" as the quake count neared 500 per day while the mountain trembled every few minutes.  The quakes triggered avalanches on the snow-capped summits but otherwise were not causing any damage yet.  The first visible signs of a possible eruption came on March 27, when the first steam and ash explosion opened up a crater 200-250 feet wide and 80-100 feet deep, according to the USGS, That prompted evacuations within a 15-mile radius of the volcano and roadblocks to keep out the curious.  A dozen more bursts of ash continued into the 28th, each lasting minutes to hours.  ""It's like standing next to a dynamite keg with the fuse lit - only we don't know how long that fuse is,"" Johnston said at the time.  More steam and ash explosions continued into the 31st – one bringing ash to the town of Kelso about 35 miles away.  Still, the largest problem that day was keeping gawkers at a safe distance. The National Guard came in to help enforce roadblocks.  LANDSLIDE NEAR MOUNT ST. HELENS STRANDS DIVERS OVERNIGHT AFTER WASHING OUT ROADWAY  April 1-7, 1980: The mystery deepens  Larger quakes and more vigorous explosions marked the start of April, indicating an increased possibility of an eruption. However, USGS scientists at the time suggested it was more likely a series of small eruptions would occur instead of one large cataclysmic event.  The weather cleared enough again April 3, 1980, for scientists to fly over the summit and get a peek at the bulging mountain. Explosions sent plumes upward almost hourly, and winds carried ash east about 50 miles to the town of Glenwood.  Snow storms returned to the mountain on April 5, but scientists were still putting in 14-hour days to collect ash, measure gasses and install new equipment.  April 8-13: The waiting game ensues  By April 8, 1980, volcanologists noted what may be a ""new reality"" of a relatively stable pattern where melting snow ran into the crater and was blasted into steam by the bubbling hot volcanic cauldron.  The mountain occasionally belched some ash – on the 9th, the ash carried into the Puget Sound region, meaning just about every corner of Washington received ash at some point.  The rest of the week, the mountain settled into ""ho-hum"" steam and ash explosions. Attention waned and the media moved on to more pressing stories. With the constant monitoring also a constant drain on the USGS budget, some staff members returned to their regular jobs.  The 11th provided a fateful encounter as scientists went to check on local mountain resident Harry Truman who lived at a lodge along the mountain's Sprit Lake for 54 years. He swore that despite the danger, he would not leave. Truman did not live to see his 55th year at the lake, becoming one of the 57 people who perished in the eruption.  April 14-22: The media pokes the bear  April 14, 1980, marked nearly a month since the volcano had sprung to life, but a local newspaper chided Mount St. Helens for putting on a ""half-hearted"" show. Four days later, another paper panned the mountain for its ""listless performance."" One local TV station was brazen enough to send their helicopter to the summit to get footage of it.  ""The area is closed, but it's hard to enforce,"" the USGS wrote.  The volcano occasionally sent out steam plumes, and seismic activity remained ""moderate.""  April 23-28: New worries emerge  As the weather cleared once again, scientists sent choppers to get fresh aerial photography of the summit. A bulge was found on the north side that had moved some 300 feet up and out from where it was the previous year.  WATCH A VOLCANO MAKE ITS OWN WEATHER  Meanwhile, the quake count for the entire reawakening had reached 1,500.  A sensor placed at Goat Rocks about midway up the mountain's slope was found to have moved 3 yards to the north.  April 29-May 3: Getting ready in case the mountain blows  Concerns rose that there would be a massive avalanche on the bulging northern flank of the mountain, which would dump debris into Spirit Lake and instantly flood the North Fork of the Toutle River.  Toutle Lake School, some 26 miles downstream, started conducting volcano drills and practiced loading 511 students and 85 staff members onto school buses to head to higher ground.  Meanwhile, officials installed new gates to lock down access to the northern side of the mountain as scientists established a new monitoring site closer to the volcano, just 5.5 miles from the summit. The ""Coldwater II"" site was staffed 24/7 to enable constant monitoring.  May 3-6: St. Helens becomes ‘misshaphen, ash-tarnished rebel’  Other than measurements that the bulge near Goat Rocks was moving about 4-5 feet a day, the USGS said the volcano hadn't done anything to convince a non-scientist that a hazard existed. If not for news media reports highlighting how much the bulge was moving, the growing clamor to ease restrictions in the area would've grown louder.  ""Local residents growing weary of life near an active volcano,"" the USGS said. ""Like saint-turned-sinner, the mountain has gone from a calm, dependable friend that radiated beauty, to a misshapen, ash-tarnished rebel. Nobody knows what to expect next.""  May 7-11: Mount St. Helens reawakens  The volcano's two-week break came to an end as bursts of steam and ash reached 13,000 feet on May 7, 1980, while the bulge continued to move and quakes shook.  As the bulge continued to grow and move, scientists believed it was only a matter of time before the bugle failed and a massive mudslide ensued.  Meanwhile, officials kept pleading with Harry Truman to leave his Spirit Lake-front cabin.  May 12-17: The precursors to disaster  On May 12, 1980, a strong 5.0 quake shook loose an 800-foot-wide avalanche of ice and rock on the north side while ominously, the crater's high point stood 500 feet taller than it was two months earlier.  WHAT MAKES ‘PELE’S HAIR' DURING A VOLCANIC ERUPTION?  In the days after, the mountain goes quiet again. In a twist, scientists were baffled when a meeting with officials where it was assumed they would discuss expanding restricted areas instead turns into talks of which areas could reopen for Memorial Day weekend.  Cabin owners inside the restricted ""red zone"", who had been clamoring for access while threatened with $500 fines and 6 months in jail if they enter the restricted area, were finally granted access to visit their cabin on May 17. Cabin owners signed waivers and headed to their homes to pack up items before leaving by the end of the day.  USGS's David Johnston was the lone team member to stay at the Coldwater II monitoring site on the night of the 17th.  May 18: A quiet early morning then ‘Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!’  A 7 a.m. check on the mountain from Johnston found nothing unusual. The 7:30 a.m. morning meeting was also mundane.  Then at 8:32 a.m.: ""Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!"" radioed Johnston from the lookout point as the mountain violently erupted. Vancouver didn't hear the warning, but the message was heard and recorded by a ham radio operator.  A mad scramble ensued. Campers by the Green River reported hearing distant sounds, then blasted by winds as the skies turned pitch black and the ground vibrated. Trees blew over as mud and ice rained down. It was a cold blast at first, but soon everything began to burn and warm ash started to fall. The campers scrambled to walk out.  next Image 1 of 5  prev next Image 2 of 5  prev next Image 3 of 5  prev next Image 4 of 5  prev Image 5 of 5  Geologists from Spokane were on a helicopter ride near the crater moments before the blast and witnessed a mile-long fissure in the volcano as the eruption started. The pilot dove from the skies and managed to safely fly back to Portland.  Broadcasters scrambled to find out what was happening and get on the air. Loggers in the area heard screams about a volcano as trees jiggled and fell as they were knocked down by the wind. Massive mudflows from instantly-melted snow raced down mountains and flooded the nearby terrain under feet of water and mud, wiping out roads and bridges along the way. Day turned to night in communities in Eastern Washington as upper-level winds spread thick clouds of ash across the skies.  In the aftermath, the USGS sadly learned that Johnston did not survive the eruption, becoming one of the 57 people killed that day. An aerial tour of the devastation confirmed the Coldwater II lookout was destroyed. Johnston's legacy lives on both at the USGS and at the volcano.  The Coldwater II site was renamed the Johnston Ridge Observatory in his honor.  As mentioned earlier, Spirit Lake Lodge resident Harry Truman also lost his life when the mountain erupted.  So much more happened on that fateful day. The USGS is running a timed Twitter thread all day Thursday with minute-by-minute accounts of what happened on May 18, 1980, and beyond.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2V4dHJlbWUtd2VhdGhlci9tb3VudC1zdC1oZWxlbnMtdm9sY2FuaWMtZXJ1cHRpb24tbWF5LTE5ODAtNDNyZC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyedIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2V4dHJlbWUtd2VhdGhlci9tb3VudC1zdC1oZWxlbnMtdm9sY2FuaWMtZXJ1cHRpb24tbWF5LTE5ODAtNDNyZC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 02:19:54","Mike Brown  Special to The Alliance Review  JEFFERSON — The Marlington softball team erupted offensively from an early pitchers’ duel with a big five-run fifth inning and held off a determined West Branch rally in the seventh to win 5-3 in a Division II district semifinal Tuesday at Lehotsky Field.  “I thought we had great contributions up and down the lineup,” praised Marlington head coach Joe Tagliarini. “Like I told the girls, hey, it doesn’t matter who is in there, when your number is called, you’ve got to go out there and perform, and I feel we did that as a group today.”  The win vaults the state’s second-ranked Dukes (24-1) into Thursday’s district final against Aurora in Jefferson at 4 p.m. It’s the third straight year Marlington has reached the district final. Third-seeded Aurora advanced Tuesday with a 4-0 triumph over ninth-seeded Youngstown Ursuline.  West Branch bowed out with an 11-11 record and won four of its last five games with a roster featuring just one senior.  “I thought overall we played well,” stated West Branch head coach Jennifer “Sis” Woods, the only softball coach in West Branch history who recently had the school’s softball field named in her honor. “We told them before we started that as long as you can walk off knowing you gave it your all, that’s all anybody can ask, and I really do think we did that.”  The No. 1-seeded Dukes advanced against West Branch by combining the strong pitching of senior Sofia Nase, who raised her record to 18-0 on the year, with a big fifth-inning at the plate. They batted around in the fifth and scored all five of their runs.  Nase, who has pitched 13 shutouts this season, including two no-hitters, was the winning pitcher, striking out 13 and walking five in a complete game.  “Today my screwball wasn’t on, but my rise ball was on,” commented Nase. “I feel like I’ve worked my velocity a lot in the offseason and it’s helped me a lot.”  More on Sofia Nase:Mind games: Marlington pitcher Sofia Nase's makes major strides in mental approach to game  “Sofia has been so good this year, she hasn’t given up more than three runs in any game all year,” said Tagliarini. “So I thought when we got it (the lead) to five it would give us a cushion and clearly that was needed.”  Before the Dukes’ offensive outburst, Nase and West Branch sophomore right-hander Klary McKay locked up in a pitchers’ battle which kept things at a 0-0 stalemate through four innings.  But all that changed for Marlington in the bottom of the fifth. The Dukes had seven hits in the game and five of them occurred in the fifth. The big blow offensively for Marlington occurred when junior Audrey Miller stepped to the plate and sent a pitch by McKay over the left field fence for a three-run home run.  “The first two I hit out there, but the wind kind of killed them and the center fielder made a great catch on the second one, but I just kept doing what I was doing,” said Miller of her three-run blast in her third time at the dish. “It (the home run) felt pretty good off the bat. It was an inside pitch and she (McKay) was attacking me inside all game, so I was kind of expecting it.""  “I thought she (Miller) had great at-bats,” observed Tagliarini. “The wind kind of kept two in or I think she would have had three home runs otherwise. She’s a big-time hitter and that’s what she does. Every game she drives the ball.”  The three-run homer occurred after the Dukes’ Grace Nase opened with a double down the left field line and Delaney Martz reached base on a West Branch throwing error.  Before the inning was over, Marlington tacked on two more runs after Maria Walder singled to center and Ashlyn Maurer had an RBI double to left, making it 4-0. The Dukes finished off their big inning when Faith Savage singled to center, scoring Maurer, upping the advantage to 5-0.  “I think everyone contributed, we batted around in that inning,” praised the Dukes’ head coach.  Nase said having a five-run cushion helped her relax in the circle.  “I was sitting there and I was like we’re OK right now, but having more runs helps me relax,” commented the Dukes’ pitching standout.  The score remained 5-0 until West Branch’s last at-bat in the top of the seventh when the Warriors answered with their own rally.  With one out, West Branch had three straight batters reach base on walks, including Nicole Stoffer, McKay and Mikalyn Fitts. Senior Baylee Waugaman then hit an RBI single to center, making it 5-1. The Warriors followed with RBI singles by Libbie Davis and Mati Hawk, cutting the deficit to 5-3. With the bases still loaded, Nase settled in and recorded a strikeout and got the Warriors’ last batter to line out to second base, securing the win for the Dukes.  “That’s what we talked about in my meeting (at the circle in the seventh inning),"" Tagliarini said. ""My message to the infield was, hey, nothing worthwhile in life is easy, so let’s just go out there and get what we have to get and move on.”  Marlington’s top offensive players in the game in addition to Miller were Maria Walder (double, single), Grace Nase (double), Ashlyn Maurer (RBI double), Faith Savage (RBI single) and Chyanne Knapp (double).  Nase said the Dukes’ long-range goal lies ahead.  “Our goal was to win the EBC, which we did, and now, hopefully, get past what we did my sophomore year in the regionals,” said the Dukes’ pitcher.  “We want to go as far as we can (in the tournament),” added Miller. “Now we’ll just get ready to go for the next one.”  West Branch had four hits Tuesday — Josie Milliken (single), Baylee Waugaman (RBI single), Libbie Davis (RBI single) and Mati Hawk (RBI single).  Woods, who led West Branch to a Division II state runner-up finish in 2018, feels the future is bright for her young team.  “This is something to build on, we won the sectional and played very well against the No. 1 seed (Marlington) which is 24-1 and we’re a .500 team so that shows the growth that they have made,” she said.  McKay went all seven innings in the circle for West Branch while striking out one and walking three.  Tagliarini quickly turned his attention to Thursday’s district final against Aurora.  “We played against them (Aurora) three times this winter and I didn’t pitch Sofia against them in any of those games, knowing that we could meet up,” said Tagliarini. “I’m pretty familiar with them.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYW50b25yZXAuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9zb2Z0YmFsbC8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L29oc2FhLXNvZnRiYWxsLXNjb3JlLW1hcmxpbmd0b24td2VzdC1icmFuY2gtb2hpby1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC10b3VybmFtZW50LXNvZmlhLW5hc2UtYXVkcmV5LW1pbGxlci83MDIyMzU1ODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","1943-05-31","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:42:40","The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday formally condemned one of the “most shameful moments” in history — the racial turmoil that erupted 80 years and became known as The Zoot Suit Riots.  The board unanimously OK’d a motion by Supervisor Hilda Solis to denounce “the devastation of the Zoot Suit Riots, recognize this as a dark chapter in Los Angeles County’s history and recommit to fighting against racial discrimination.”  Solis said the uprising began in the early 1940s, when “mobs of U.S. servicemen, law enforcement officers and civilians ambushed young Mexican Americans, African American and Filipino American men” across the county.  The attacks became focused on people wearing “zoot suits,” which had become popular among young men of color and made them targets of racism and discrimination, Solis said.  “This was especially true among Latino youths in California who were known as `pachucos’ for wearing zoot soots,” she said. “The white majority at the time often viewed them as gang members and delinquents.”  Solis said the zoot suiters were spuriously blamed for the 1942 death of Jose Gallardo Diaz near a swimming hole known as the “Sleepy Lagoon,” and nine young Latinos were convicted of second-degree murder in Diaz’ slaying.  “These arrests and convictions were seen as shams by the Mexican-American community, with the police exclusively targeting young Brown men as suspects,” according to Solis’ motion.  “On May 31, 1943, a group of servicemen and a group of Mexican American youth wearing zoot suits scuffled in downtown Los Angeles. Three days later, on June 3, 1943, another confrontation ensued, only this time servicemen were joined by police on orders to `clean up’ downtown Los Angeles. The next day, a group of over 200 Marines and sailors took a caravan of taxis into East Los Angeles and began to beat any young man wearing a zoot suit, burning their belongings in the process.”  The riots died down later that year when U.S. servicemen were banned from the area, and the City Council backed a resolution — that was never codified as a law — that barred zoot suits in the city.  The Zoot Suit Riots became a dark chapter in the history of the Chicano community, and were commemorated by a Broadway play in the 1970s that became a film starring Edward James Olmos in 1981.  Supervisor Holly Mitchell said the riots were indicative of a pattern of groups of people being targeted for their “clothes, culture and identity.”  “We’ve seen that repeated over and over in our history, where groups who attempt to express our cultural pride and identity through clothes, music, style, hair … whatever the case may be, how it’s frowned upon and quite frankly feared,” she said. “And the effort to erase and eliminate never seems to be successful.”  Mitchell noted that recognizing the Zoot Suit Riots is “particularly important now,” saying there are some politicians who are “attempting to rewrite American history.”  Supervisor Janice Hahn added, “Until we understand and come to grips with our past, even our shameful past, we are in jeopardy of repeating it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbXluZXdzbGEuY29tL2dvdmVybm1lbnQvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9sYS1jb3VudHktbWFya3MtODB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vZi16b290LXN1aXQtcmlvdHMtZGVub3VuY2VzLXJhY2lzbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The UN estimates that 5 million additional people will need emergency assistance inside Sudan, while 860,000 are expected to flee to neighboring states that were already in crisis at a time when rich countries have cut back on aid.    On Thursday, US-Saudi mediated talks between Sudan’s army and the RSF in Jeddah made a slight breakthrough after signing an agreement that commits to protecting Sudanese civilians.    The Jeddah Talks will continue with an aim to achieve a ceasefire for around 10 days to facilitate concrete steps, such as the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and withdrawal of forces from hospitals.    The talks will also discuss arrangements for further discussions to reach a permanent end to hostilities.

Mirwaiz Farooq was shot dead in his house at Nigeen in Srinagar on May 21, 1990.  Special Director General of Police (CID) R.R. Swain told the media in Srinagar that the arrested militants included the one who entered the bedroom of Mirwaiz Farooq and fired at him.  The Nigeen police had filed an FIR, but the case was later transferred to CBI, Swain said. “The CBI arrested one of the accused and filed a chargesheet against him at a TADA court which awarded him a life sentence.”  The officer said the investigations into the case revealed that the plot to kill Mirwaiz was planned by Hizbul Mujahideen commander Abdullah Bangroo.  “Bangroo and his associate were killed in encounters while one accused was serving a life sentence,’’ he said. “Two other accused, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, both residents of Srinagar, were evading arrest and were hiding in Pakistan and Nepal. They have been arrested by the State Investigating Agency (SIA) and handed over to the CBI.”  Swain said Bhat was the one who had shot Mirwaiz in his bedroom .  He, however, didn’t reveal where the duo were arrested from.  The killing of Mirwaiz had sparked widespread anger in Kashmir and accentuated the political and security crisis due to the eruption of militancy. Several people were killed after security forces opened fire on a procession during the funeral of Mirwaiz.  After the killing of Mirwaiz, who was widely revered and respected in Kashmir and outside, the Centre removed then governor Jagmohan Malhotra due to worsening situation in Kashmir.  The Mirwaiz family is the custodian of Jama Masjid, the most important and historic mosque in Kashmir, which has remained mostly shut for congregational prayers after the removal of Article 370.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdlZWsuaW4vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3R3by1taWxpdGFudHMtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnQuaHRtbNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdlZWsuaW4vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3R3by1taWxpdGFudHMtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnQuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dr. Mehul Dixit, a pediatric nephrologist (a children’s kidney and urinary tract specialist), was charged last week with two counts of sexual battery, and his medical license was suspended, according to police and a report issued by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. He was not charged in the alleged Florida incident.  Dixit, who is 59 and went to medical school in India, also appears to have practiced medicine in Arizona and New York City, available records show.  At Friday’s court hearing, a judge set Dixit’s bond at $300,000 and barred him from having contact with his accusers, anyone under age 18 or anyone he worked with at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.  Dixit is not listed as an inmate at the Hinds County Jail. He lives in the Jackson suburb of Madison with his wife, who is also a physician, records show.  Dixit’s lawyer Cynthia Stewart Dixit did not immediately return a call requesting comment She did not comment about the allegations but told local media that Dixit has agreed to stop practicing medicine, WAPT-TV of Jackson reported.  The licensing board has summoned Dixit for a hearing Thursday, saying evidence indicated that allowing him to continue practicing “would constitute an immediate danger to public health and safety.”  The two Mississippi teens Dixit is accused of sexually abusing said he preyed on them during medical examinations at UMMC. One of the accusers told police she was 13 in 2013 when he allegedly abused her, according to the report. The other said she was 17 when Dixit allegedly assaulted her in February.  In its report Friday, the board noted that in 2016 a Florida woman came forward and told its investigators Dixit abused her during an examination a decade earlier for kidney stones. The circumstances under which the Mississippi teens are alleged to have been assaulted were similar to those the Florida woman described, the report says.  The woman, who was 17 at the time of the alleged assault, told a board investigator that Dixit ushered her mother out of the examination room, had her strip naked and then rubbed her breasts and touched her vagina while he was not wearing gloves.  The board report does not say what prompted the Florida woman to come forward. The agency did not return several calls seeking an explanation.  At the time, Dixit was working at UMMC in Jackson. And it appears no steps were taken in 2016 to limit his access to young female patients. The woman did not file a report with police.  “No further action was taken because the events had reportedly occurred in the State of Florida and fell within the primary jurisdiction of that State,” the report states.  The alleged Florida incident resurfaced after “a law enforcement officer contacted Board Investigative Staff” after the most recent allegation and “requested information related to Licensee’s prior interactions with the Board,” the report says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vbmV3cy9taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1kb2N0b3ItY2hhcmdlZC1zZXh1YWxseS1hYnVzaW5nLTAwMTYxNjgyMy5odG1s0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW9sLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL21pc3Npc3NpcHBpLWRvY3Rvci1jaGFyZ2VkLXNleHVhbGx5LWFidXNpbmctMDAxNjE2ODIzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The actor received the movie star treatment on the red carpet as some fans erupted in applause, tears, and shrieks, hoping to get his autograph and pose for photos together. ""We love Johnny"" and ""Congrats Johnny"" signs could be seen from the crowds, standing in stark contrast to the brewing backlash overseas and online amid controversy surrounding Depp after the 6-week trial.  CANNES, FRANCE - MAY 16: Johnny Depp arrives for the ""Jeanne du Barry"" Screening & opening ceremony red carpet at the 76th annual Cannes film festival at Palais des Festivals on May 16, 2023 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)  Andreas Rentz/Getty Johnny Depp at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival  The historical romance from Maïwenn Le Besco, known mononymously as Maïwenn, stars Depp as Louis XV and marks the actor's first leading role following his ongoing legal battles. Last summer, Depp won his defamation lawsuit against Heard after a jury decided that Heard intentionally and maliciously defamed the actor when she penned her 2018 Washington Post op-ed about about her experiences as a domestic abuse survivor.  The verdict came after Depp lost a libel lawsuit against The Sun in 2020, centered on the newspaper's use of the word ""wife beater"" in a piece on Heard's allegations against Depp. A judge ruled the article was ""substantially true"" and that ""the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp have been proved to the civil standard."" Depp has continued to deny the allegations.  Amid the fanfare on the red carpet, Heard's supporters launched a social media campaign with the hashtag #CannesYouNot and slammed the festival for ""celebrating abusers for 76 years."" (French actress Adèle Haenel also accused Cannes and the French film industry of ""complacency toward sexual aggressors,"" citing controversial filmmakers Roman Polanski and Christophe Ruggia, the latter of whom Haenel accused of sexual harassment.)  Story continues  Festival chief Thierry Fremaux dismissed the backlash during a press conference on Monday, calling Haenel's ""radical"" comments ""false"" and defending Depp's inclusion. ""I don't know about the image of Johnny Depp in the U.S.,"" Fremaux said. ""To tell you the truth, in my life, I only have one rule, it's the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.""  He added of the Depp v. Heard trial: ""I'm the last person to be able to discuss all this. If there's one person in this world who didn't find the least interest in this very publicized trial, it's me. I don't know what it's about. I also care about Johnny Depp as an actor."" It signals the country's ongoing support for the star, who recently signed a $20 million+ deal with French luxury house Dior, marking the company's biggest men's fragrance contract.  Jeanne du Barry Johnny Depp  Why Not Productions. Johnny Depp in 'Jeanne du Barry'  During the festival's opening press conference, Cannes juror and #TimesUp advocate Brie Larson also fielded a reporter's question about Depp's inclusion: ""You're asking me that? Um, I'm sorry, I don't understand the correlation of why me specifically,"" Larson said, adding of whether she'll see his movie, ""I'll see it when I see it. I don't know how I feel about it frankly.""  Maïwenn has also courted controversy. The director, who also stars opposite Depp in Jeanne du Barry as the titular mistress, recently admitted to spitting in the face of journalist Edwy Plenel, the founder of outlet Mediapart, which reported about several women who accused Maïwenn's ex-husband, the director Luc Besson, of rape. ""Do I confirm that I assaulted him?"" Maïwenn said during a talk show appearance on Quotidien. ""Yes.""  ""I'll speak about it when I'm ready,"" she added. ""I'm very anxious about the release of my film."" Plenel — who said Maïwenn approached him at a restaurant, tilted his head back, and spit in his face — slammed Maïwenn as ""outspokenly anti-#MeToo"" in an interview with Variety. ""This aggression caused more stupor than anything else,"" Plenel said. ""She didn't attack just me individually, but the symbol that I represent, as the founder and director of a journal, which in France has been at the forefront of all the #MeToo revelations.""  Jeanne du Barry Johnny Depp  Stéphanie Branchu/Why Not Productions. Johnny Depp in 'Jeanne du Barry'  Reception to the French-language film at the opening night screening was a bit removed from the fanfare Depp was welcomed with outside. The actor received far less applause on sight as he arrived inside the theater. After the film's conclusion, someone in the back of the Debussy theater where press was seated yelled out, ""Give him an Oscar!"" which was followed by a few chuckles. The ovation was observed as short by Cannes standards, with Maiwen seeming to earn more of the audience's praise.  Reviews posted afterward echoed the more tepid response observed at the screening. Variety critic Peter Debruge said Depp ""seems strangely uncomfortable in the role — adequate but not especially engaged.""  ""His French is not too shabby, but his regal gravitas is nonexistent, and he only truly looks at home in the role during occasional bouts of clowning, which hardly help sell his casting as an inspired choice,"" wrote The Telegraph critic Robbie Collin, ""It would be a stretch to say this feels like the first spark of a glorious comeback.""

The story centers around Dominic Toretto's mission to protect his crew and family from Dante Reyes, the vengeful son of drug lord Hernan Reyes. Seeking revenge for his father's demise and the loss of his family's fortune during the Rio de Janeiro heist in ""Fast Five"" (2011), Dante proves to be a formidable threat. The film features a series of stunning and explosive action sequences, captivating audiences with its spectacle of excitement. Moreover, the film includes surprises and nostalgic elements, such as archival footage featuring the late Paul Walker, enhancing its appeal. Since its premiere in Beijing and nine other cities on Monday, the film has received an abundance of rave reviews on Chinese social media platforms.  Vin Diesel and Jason Momoa sent recorded videos to greet Chinese audiences ahead of the screening. Diesel expressed his gratitude for the unwavering support of fans, while Momoa shared his excitement about portraying the complex character of Hernan Reyes, noting that it had been a decade since he last played a villain in a film.  The Universal CityWalk Cinema was decked out in ""Fast X"" decor, featuring a prominently displayed gold Lamborghini, reminiscent of the one seen in the film.

"eruption","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 19:38:39","[ Dr PJ Sarma ]  “Dengue is one of the fastest emerging infections and is currently the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne known viral disease” – World Health Organisation (WHO).  Awareness generation regarding this disease is very important. For that, National Dengue Day is observed on 16 May and the month of July is observed as Anti-Dengue Month in India. This dengue prevention campaign aims to sensitise and mobilise community to take immediate action to reduce eruption of dengue cases by highlighting the health consequences of dengue and areas that are at higher risk.  The theme of this 8th National Dengue Day is ‘Harness partnership to defeat dengue’. In 2012, epidemiological studies of India indicated that Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu was the epicentre of the dengue epidemic. Since then, Arunachal Pradesh is experiencing its epicentre in Pasighat township. During Covid-19 period, least cases were recorded, may be due to almost restricted movement of community/infected carrier or sufferer/fever screening of outsiders at entry gate of district/state.  During 2022, imported cases were detected in our state capital that arrived here from Uganda and some other parts of our country like Bangaluru, Mumbai, etc. A small outbreak was also reported in East Kameng in the end part of the year (post monsoon).  Once in a densely populated colony in Pasighat, people were facing shortage of water as the lone hand pump in the colony was drawing poor quality water (that pump was marked red and put under lock and chain). The residents of the locality then began to store water in different small and large pots without proper cover for long periods of time. There was also a tyre shop nearby the same colony, wherein old and used tyres collected rainwater for days. All these led to the spread of dengue in that area.  Dengue is an endemic disease and one of the major public health problems in India. During the last five years, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), now renamed NCVBDC, reported approximately 80,725 cases of dengue per year with a fatality rate of about 0.24 percent in India. According to the WHO, dengue affects approximately 100-400 million people every year. As per a scientific estimation, the global burden of dengue has increased at least fourfold over the last three decades and 2.5 billion people are now at risk of the disease. An estimated 99 million (95 percent credible interval 71-137 million) symptomatic dengue infections and 404 million asymptomatic (95 percent credible interval 304-537 million) infections occur annually in over 100 countries, with 5,00,?000 cases of severe dengue and 20,?000 deaths. There is an estimated 9 billion dollar direct and indirect medical cost of dengue in the world.  Dengue virus strains are of four distinct serotypes – DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Each of them has multiple genotypes. The genotype variation can be subtle either in DNA material or the envelope. For example, DENV-1 comes in as many as five genotypes – Asia, South Pacific, Thailand, Malaysia and AM/AF. Type I causes classic dengue fever, Type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, Dengue III causes fever without shock, and Dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. Mixed serotype may be dangerous.  Dengue is a viral fever which transmits to humans after the bite of an infected female mosquito of the species Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus with a habit of day biting. The incubation period of dengue is usually from 4 to 10 days. Dengue virus (of Flaviviridae family) infections can manifest as a wide clinical spectrum of disease, ranging from ‘dengue fever’ (a self limiting mild febrile illness) to ‘severe dengue’ (dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterised by capillary leakage leading to hypovolaemic shock, organ impairment and bleeding complications). However, most infections remain asymptomatic or cause a relatively mild systemic illness. A few studies suggest that maternal dengue infection (materno-fetal transmission, congenital dengue viral infection) during pregnancy might increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth-weight. Neonates with congenital dengue have had clinical manifestations ranging from fever with thrombocytopenia to pleural effusions, severe haemorrhage and shock.  The clinical management relies on judicious fluid replacement of the severe cases and management of the symptoms through mild pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs. But advice of a qualified doctor is must. Though some dengue vaccines are entering Phase III clinical trials, but none is available commercially at this time to be used by community.  Currently, there is neither any specific cure by any medicine nor any vaccine available for dengue. So, to minimise the risk of its transmission, the prevention and control of dengue is must. The strategy of its prevention and control rotates around the locus of vector control. (While doing this, it also reduces the transmission of Zika and Chikungunya.) Line departments need to work together for it and community should participate.  From public health point of view, higher dengue risk locations are about three to ten times more likely to develop into large dengue clusters, compared to areas with lower mosquito populations of Aedes aegypti.  The National Environment Agency of Singapore, promoting the concept of ‘B-L-O-C-K’ steps for control of Dengue: Break up hardened soil/Lift and empty flowerpot plates/Overturn pails and wipe their rims/Change water in vases/Keep roof gutters clear and place Bti insecticide inside.  Eleven controlling steps  Based on earlier experience, persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, number of dengue cases and active dengue clusters to be detected before traditional peak dengue season (from June to October) comes.  We need intensive and concerted cohesive community effort to search for and remove stagnant water over a 14-day period, starting from pre-monsoon. The effort will cover two mosquito breeding cycles in frequent interval, helping to reduce the mosquito population/risk of dengue. Need to educate community on common mosquito breeding habitats, ground outreach effort to conduct house visits at dengue cluster areas and areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population (with technical input from right authority and lined departments), share dengue prevention skills and thus sustain a high level of awareness and source reduction of mosquito breeding spots to be carried out.  Weekly once compulsory removal of accumulated water from coolers and other small containers (plastic containers, buckets, used automobile tyres, water coolers, AC equipments of home etc, pet watering containers and flower vases). Need to continue checks at construction sites, and other uncovered mosquito breeding habitats like raw rubber latex collection bowl of rubber plantation, uncovered water tank of buildings.  Water storage containers should be covered with lids at all times. Wear full sleeve clothes, covering their skin in the transmission (rainy) season. Use a mosquito net or mosquito repellent while sleeping during the day. Use aerosol during the day to prevent yourself from mosquito bites.  Scientific entomological study  Modern technology of smart mobile phone provides scope through innovative app to set alerts on areas with dengue clusters and high Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Community can easily receive these push notifications if they pre-set the location on such app.  Genetically engineered mosquitoes  Next generation of infected mosquito of dengue can spread dengue as all larvae of such infected mosquito carries germs of dengue. To break this chain, during 2021, with a view to suppressing populations of wild Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (which can carry diseases like zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever) genetically engineered mosquitoes (working on Endosymbiont principle) were released into the environment/air in Florida Keys of the United States. The small-scale field trials of genetically engineered cross-bred carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are already performed in Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia and Vietnam, whereas large-scale field trials (citywide) performed in Yogyakarta city (Indonesia), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Medellín (Colombia). Success was in a range of 70 percednt-95 percent. ICMR-VCRC (Puducherry, India) is also working on it, but it has to go through some procedures like regulatory approval that takes time regarding screening the biosafety of such technology, etc. It may bring success against chikungunya and zika virus also.  For future study, the genome sequence of the virus collected from the samples to be compared against the GenBank library which hosts all known dengue virus samples since 1943 to present time.

While it's a mid-season patch and won't introduce a new raid, it brings plenty of notable changes, including a third evoker specialisation, a new mega-dungeon, and the option to take dragonriding to the rest of Azeroth (opens in new tab).  Other quality-of-life changes are coming too, the biggest of which is that characters will automatically learn the riding skill as they level, meaning you'll no longer have to fork out a load of gold to take to the skies. To find out more about the WoW 10.1.5 update, here's what we know.  (Image credit: Blizzard)  No release date has been confirmed for the 10.1.5 patch beyond the fact that it is expected to land this summer. It arrived on the PTR (public test realm) on May 11, and if historical timings are anything to go by, we should expect to see the patch arrive in July 2023.  I'll update this section the minute a release date is announced.  Augmentation evoker  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Evokers get a third specialisation  The new Augmentation specialisation is a DPS spec with the added benefit of enhancing your group's overall performance. Some skills might improve allies' damage, while others might increase health or armor.  The Augmentation evoker uses the power from both the Black and the Bronze dragonflight. Black dragonflight magic focuses on raw power increases and forceful outbursts of earthen might. Bronze dragonflight magic is all about bending time, changing fate, and shifting timelines to tremendous effect.  Here are some examples of the skills you'd expect to use:  Ebon Might: Increase your four nearest allies’ primary stat by a percentage of your own, and cause your Eruption to deal more damage for 10 seconds. Some of your other spells extend the duration of these effects.  Eruption: Cause a violent eruption beneath an enemy’s feet, dealing Volcanic damage split between them and nearby enemies. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Upheaval: Gather earthen power beneath your enemy’s feet and send them hurtling upwards, dealing Volcanic damage to them and nearby enemies. Empowering expands the area of effect. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Breath of Eons: Fly to the targeted location, exposing Temporal Wounds on enemies in your path for 10 seconds. Temporal Wounds accumulate a portion of damage dealt by your allies, and then critically strike the enemy for that amount at the end of the duration. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Mega-dungeon  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Dawn of the Infinite is the new mythic-only dungeon  Dawn of the Infinite will be the new mythic-only, eight-boss dungeon to arrive in Dragonflight. According to Blizzard, ""This eight-boss Mythic-only mega-dungeon will take players across the timeways to stop the Infinite Dragonflight from succeeding. You’ll face Iridikron, among others, as you work to sustain Azeroth’s timeline and put things to rights once more"".  Mythic-only mega-dungeons have become a staple of mid-expansion patches since Legion, when the revamped Karazhan made an appearance. This was followed by Operation Mechagon in Battle for Azeroth, and Tazavesh, the Veiled Market in Shadowlands.  Warlock changes  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Changes coming to the warlock class  If you play Warlock, you can pick from any of the races (aside from Drackthyr) in the 10.1.5 patch. Currently, warlocks are restricted to a handful of races, but in the Fractures in Time update, warlocks can be any of the following races:  Tauren  Highmountain tauren  Mag'har orcs  Zandalari trolls  Pandaren  Night elves  Draenei  Lightforged draenei  Kul-Tiran  Additionally, you'll be able to customise how your imp pet looks at the barber shop, though you'll need to complete a quest to unlock the option.  Dragonriding  (Image credit: Blizzard)  You can choose how you fly in the rest of Azeroth (and beyond)  Dragonriding is arguably one of the best new systems to come out of World of Warcraft in a long time, and since its introduction at the launch of Dragonflight, many players have been asking for it to be extended to older WoW zones.  That's finally happening in Fractures in Time, and you'll be able to use your dragonriding mounts in any of the zones that currently allow flying. It also seems that some older mounts will also be able to use the dragonriding flying type, and you'll be able to choose the type of flying you'd prefer to use in the wider world.  Riding/flying skill  (Image credit: Blizzard)  You will learn riding and flying skills automatically  Once you reach the appropriate levels, you'll automatically learn the riding skill without seeking out a Riding Trainer or paying gold for the privilege. Right now, you learn four different riding skills while leveling:  Level 10: Apprentice Riding  Apprentice Riding Level 20: Journeyman Riding  Journeyman Riding Level 30: Expert Riding  Expert Riding Level 40: Master Riding  Apprentice Riding and Expert Riding teach you ground mount riding and flying, respectively, while the other two increase the overall speed you can travel at.  Instead of having to stop what you're doing and make the trek to your faction's capital city to buy the riding skill at the levels listed above, these will be automatically applied to your character at no additional cost. Additionally, you can pick up a quest at level 30 which will reward you with a flying mount on completion.  Other changes  (Image credit: Activision Blizzard)  Allied races will unlock automatically  Allied races will automatically unlock at level 40, and you'll no longer need to do any questlines or complete any achievements to access them. There are five allied races for each faction which start at level 10, which, apart from anything else, takes a good chunk of time off leveling if you fancy playing an alt or two.  Old hearthstones will become toys  The Garrison hearthstone from Warlords of Draenor and the Dalaran hearthstone from Legion have been part of your bag space for so long, you probably don't pay that much attention to them. In Fractures in Time, you'll be able to give them even less attention as they will both become toys, freeing up two spaces but still giving you the means to teleport quickly to those old locations.  You probably still won't have enough bag space, but at least it's a couple of extra slots to fill up with junk.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3dvcmxkLW9mLXdhcmNyYWZ0LXdvdy0xMC0xLTUtZnJhY3R1cmVzLWluLXRpbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Equities halted the recent trading lull, with gains in the S&P 500 topping 1% and the Nasdaq 100 hitting the highest since August. Treasuries dropped, with yields on 10-year notes approaching 3.6%. President Joe Biden expressed confidence there will be no default, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said reaching an agreement this week is “doable.”  “We don’t want to get too excited as the two sides reportedly remain far apart,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. “However, we get the sense that there is a real effort to avert a debt ceiling catastrophe as the X-date of June 1 is fast approaching. Stay tuned.”  Read: RBC Sees Misleading Calm in ‘Paddling Duck Market’: Surveillance  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief Jamie Dimon said the US government “probably” will not default on its debts. He joined other top executives of major banks in a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the debt limit.  The Treasury’s cash balance rose to $94.6 billion as of May 16, according to data published Wednesday. That’s up from from $87 billion a day earlier and compares with $140 billion at the end of last week. The Treasury’s bank account has been under downward pressure recently because of measures being taken to avoid breaching the $31.4 trillion debt cap.  “We all know the US Treasury is about to run out of ways to pay its bills, but we have seen this movie too many times before,” said Chun Wang at Leuthold Group. “While, theoretically, there is a threat of default, we certainly don’t recommend planning our lives around it. The script is very predictable: political posturing and grandstanding will go on until the 11th hour, and then a deal will be hastily put together to avoid a default.”  ‘Uncomfortably Similar’  If history is any guide, the debt-ceiling turmoil tends to be short-lived, without much impact on stocks before or after a resolution, Wang added. However, the August 2011 instance caught many investors by surprise, with equities slumping for a week or so before stabilizing. Assuming the date of resolution is June 1, the current pattern is “uncomfortably similar to August 2011,” he noted.  To Amy Wu Silverman at RBC Capital Markets, while markets are betting on a rocky end to the debt-ceiling debate, if they are wrong, investors may miss out on the gains.  “The tale of optimism does not exist,” she told Bloomberg Television. “Is there a possibility of a congressional miracle? If it at all comes in a little bit easier than we expect, that right tail is very cheap.”  Also helping sentiment Wednesday was a rally in regional banks after Western Alliance Bancorp reported growth in deposits, easing worries about the health of the industry.  In late trading, Cisco Systems Inc. dropped after the networking company reported its third-quarter results and gave an outlook.

"eruption","2015-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:11:00","BOSTON — Prosecutors can pursue charges against a police officer and the owner of a bar alleging they misled multiple investigations into an incident where off-duty police officers allegedly assaulted four Black men in 2015, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Tuesday.  State prosecutors appealed an earlier decision by the trial judge to toss the charges against the two defendants: bar owner Joseph Sullivan and Springfield Police Officer Derrick Gentry-Mitchell. In a relatively unusual move, the high court removed the matter from a lower appellate court and decided to tackle the legal issues themselves.  Hampden Superior Court Judge Mark D. Mason reasoned that because the charge of misleading described multiple acts, a grand jury may not have heard the precise evidence prosecutors brought against the two defendants first and glossed over critical details.  But in a 25-page opinion written by Associate Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt, the state’s highest court disagreed and restored indictments against the two minor players in the long-running Nathan Bill’s bar fight prosecution.  “Although each misleading statement could form a separate charge for misleading investigators, the Commonwealth is not precluded ... from proceeding under one indictment, charging the essential crime of willfully misleading investigators to cover up the off-duty (Springfield Police Department) officers’ role in the assault on the victims on April 2015,” Wendlandt wrote.  Prosecutors have said a street fight erupted outside the bar among rookie off-duty police and four Black patrons, and a department cover-up ensued to keep the incident from their superiors and the public eye. Sixteen were indicted over the matter in 2019.  Lawyers for the defendants have argued the fight occurred in a parking lot near the East Forest Park bar after a verbal dispute inside the pub earlier. They contend the civilians were the aggressors and the off-duty police and their allies were merely defending themselves. Five police officers have been tried for assault, with only two convictions for misdemeanor assault while others have been tried for the alleged cover-up with mixed results.  The whole affair has been a protracted black eye for the Springfield Police Department.  Gentry-Mitchell is accused of lying to his superiors, the FBI and the grand jury about whether he saw any of his colleagues there at the scene that night. He has been suspended from the payroll since his indictment four years ago.  Sullivan is accused of lying to the FBI and the grand jury about who he saw in the establishment and about calling a cab to usher the civilians away at the first signs of trouble.  They have denied the charges at their arraignments.  The high court remanded the indictments back down to the lower court to get the case back on track, according to the ruling.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvc2pjLXJlc3RvcmVzLWluZGljdG1lbnRzLW9mLTItd2hvLWFsbGVnZWRseS1taXNsZWQtb3Zlci1uYXRoYW4tYmlsbHMtYnJhd2wuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3NqYy1yZXN0b3Jlcy1pbmRpY3RtZW50cy1vZi0yLXdoby1hbGxlZ2VkbHktbWlzbGVkLW92ZXItbmF0aGFuLWJpbGxzLWJyYXdsLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Roy Cooper (D), while a similar measure heads to a final vote in Nebraska in the coming days. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Senate voted to override the veto in a 30-to-20 vote Tuesday afternoon with the House swiftly following suit in a 72-to-48 vote. Shouts of “shame, shame” erupted on the House floor after the chamber, with its new GOP supermajority, approved the override.  The bills both significantly narrow the window for legal abortions but stop short of more restrictive bans that have taken effect across the South and Midwest since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the result of a push from moderate Republicans who feared political backlash.  On May 16, the North Carolina legislature banned most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) veto. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)  In South Carolina, Republicans are moving a bill through the state legislature that would ban most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around the sixth week of pregnancy. The Republican governor ordered lawmakers back into session to complete unfinished work, including on legislation restricting abortions. A near-total ban in the state recently failed.  Advertisement  The dynamics underscore the resistance GOP lawmakers are facing over restrictions even within their own party, as Republican hard-liners reluctantly move toward legislation many see as a compromise, after failing to muster enough support for stricter measures.  Until recently, North Carolina’s legislature had no hope of passing any kind of abortion ban, subject to Cooper’s veto pen. But the dynamic shifted in April, when Republicans gained the votes necessary to override his veto after Rep. Tricia Cotham left the Democratic Party for the Republican Party.  When the 12-week ban initially passed in early May with Cotham’s support, Cooper launched an aggressive effort to prevent a veto override, targeting a handful of moderate Republicans, including Cotham, who pledged during their campaigns to oppose further restrictions on abortion.  “If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health, we can stop this ban,” Cooper said at a rally before he vetoed the bill on Saturday, surrounded by a crowd of abortion rights supporters.  Republicans in the legislature say they hope the 12-week ban will become a model for the rest of the country, portraying the bill as a “mainstream” alternative to abortion bans that outlaw abortion earlier in pregnancy. It is the first new abortion ban to pass since the fall of Roe v. Wade that does not outlaw all or most abortions, effectively allowing roughly 90 percent of abortions to continue. Major provisions of the bill, such as the 12-week limit on most abortions, will go into effect July 1, with some other restrictions beginning Oct. 1.  Advertisement  The Senate debated the bill for roughly an hour, with Democrats criticizing the proposed restrictions on abortion and Republicans defending the measure. The House debate was also quick, lasting roughly 90 minutes.  “I think this is really in line with what the majority of North Carolinians believe and so I’m not particularly concerned about the backlash,” North Carolina state Sen. Amy Galey (R) said in an interview. “It’s a reasonable bill for this time.”  Republicans have staunchly rejected the characterization of the bill as a “ban,” repeatedly interrupting Democrats on the Senate floor who used the term and asking them to rephrase.  “A ban is when you can’t do something,” Galey said. “‘Ban’ is a really harsh word.”  Democrats insisted the restrictions would have a broader impact on care during pregnancy, arguing patients have been denied lifesaving care in states where abortions have been banned.  Advertisement  “You as lawmakers are betraying your constituents and knowingly putting North Carolinians in danger,” state Sen. Gladys A. Robinson (D) said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “This monster abortion ban will lead to substandard care.”  North Carolina Democrats have argued fiercely that the legislation would halt abortions long before the 12-week mark, expressing particular concern about a provision that would require patients to have an in-person consultation with a doctor at least 72 hours before an abortion, in addition to the visit required for the abortion itself.  The extra in-person visit would make it harder for out-of-state patients to travel to North Carolina, which currently allows abortion until 20 weeks of pregnancy and has become a destination for patients seeking abortions across the South in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. In the first two months after the landmark decision, North Carolina experienced a greater spike in abortions than any other state.  Advertisement  Cooper flatly rejected the depiction of the 12-week ban as “mainstream.”  “This is an abortion ban that dramatically reduces women’s health-care freedom,” Cooper said in an interview. “They’re trying to dress this up as a reasonable 12-week ban. It’s not.”  The new legislation will establish exceptions for rape and incest through 20 weeks, along with an exception for lethal fetal anomalies through 24 weeks and a general exception for the life of the mother. Unlike many other abortion restrictions, the ban is coupled with tens of millions of dollars in funding for child care, foster care and paid family leave — money that GOP lawmakers said was added to address criticisms from abortion rights advocates that conservatives often seek to ban abortions but fail to support mothers and babies.  The passage of the 12-week abortion ban in North Carolina earlier this month was the culmination of months of highly secretive meetings in the Republican caucus where lawmakers struggled to agree on an abortion ban that could win enough votes to override a veto.  Rather than introducing the proposal as a new bill, as is typical, Republicans instead gutted a different piece of legislation and inserted the 46-page abortion bill, allowing them to circumvent the usual committee process, which can take weeks or months — a move Democrats called fitting for an autocracy.  Advertisement  “I just don’t believe this is how democracy should work,” House Minority Leader Robert Reives (D) said in a hearing this month. “This affects the rights of one-half of the population of this state.”  Conversations about a potential abortion ban began in Raleigh, the state capital, soon after the Supreme Court ruling, according to several people familiar with the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. While a plurality of Republicans supported a stricter ban that would outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, the people said, several moderate Republicans stood their ground and refused to go beyond 12 weeks, keenly aware of the political backlash to strict abortion bans that has been mounting since the decision.  In the months since Roe was overturned, voters have repeatedly demonstrated their strong support for abortion rights, striking down antiabortion amendments even in conservative states such as Kentucky and Kansas. The 2022 midterms, in which a number of Democrats won competitive races after making abortion rights a central issue, were widely viewed as a danger sign for Republicans.  Advertisement  Heading into the 2023 legislative session, North Carolina was in a unique position. With a Republican-led legislature and a Democratic governor, the state needed far more votes than others to pass abortion restrictions.  “We were trying to do something there really wasn’t a blueprint for,” said one person involved in the discussions. “We’re an evenly divided state, so we knew we needed a middle way.”  That wasn’t the case for Nebraska, where conservative lawmakers and antiabortion advocates were surprised by the source of the opposition. Late last month, a proposed ban earlier in pregnancy failed to pass the legislature, sparking furious conversations among Republicans and antiabortion advocates on the path forward.  Sen. Merv Riepe, a longtime Republican in the technically nonpartisan legislature, abstained from voting to advance a bill banning most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks — a move one antiabortion advocate called a “shocking betrayal.”  Advertisement  Activists and conservative lawmakers quickly regrouped and began charting a path forward to tighten abortion access. Those discussions culminated in an amendment to a bill that would limit access to gender-affirming care from Sen. Ben Hansen, the chair of the Nebraska legislature’s health committee. The proposed amendment would ban most abortions at 12 weeks, though it includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life and health of the mother, as well as make changes to the underlying bill restricting care for transgender youth.  Riepe ultimately supported the amendment.  “I’m pleased to get 12 weeks, still I would like to have more protections for physicians,” Riepe said. “In this process we’ve managed to make nobody happy. When neither side is perfectly happy, then you have a pretty good bill.” He asked for colleagues to work with him next session to ensure doctors don’t face criminal penalties.  Advertisement  Riepe had previously pushed the legislature to get behind a 12-week ban, but his proposal had barred most abortions 12 weeks after an egg is fertilized, which is a longer window than the 12-week gestational limit under consideration, which is measured by the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.  The one-chamber legislature adopted the amendment Tuesday night, and the earliest a final vote on the legislation could be scheduled is Friday, but no decision has been made, according to the speaker’s office.  Abortion rights advocates have denounced the new proposed restrictions as well as the effort to tie the ban to a measure limiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Meanwhile, antiabortion groups say they’re conflicted: They understand the political reality on the ground and want Nebraska to pass the 12-week limit but are frustrated that most abortions would be allowed to continue.  The 12-week ban is “not what we had anticipated or hoped for, even just a few weeks ago — it’s the situation that we found ourselves in,” said Nate Grasz, the policy director for Nebraska Family Alliance.

In total, 103 homes were completely destroyed and 140 severely damaged in the fighting, the United Nations said Tuesday, citing officials in Gaza.  Belal Nabhan, 35, earns just 10 shekels ($2.70) a day selling parsley in the market, and said he remains in a state of shock.  ""People were screaming and we ran away... now 45 people are staying here, where will they go? They need shelter,"" he said, indicating relatives resting beside the rubble.  Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, which is ruled by Islamist group Hamas, have fought multiple wars in recent years.  The ruins of past conflicts -- such as a three-day escalation in August which killed 49 Gazans -- are dotted across the densely populated Palestinian territory.  With Gaza's poverty rate at 53 percent, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, few people can afford to rebuild their homes.  - 'My dreams are gone' -  In Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, children clambered atop a huge mound of concrete and rebar flattened by Israeli bombardment.  In the tightly-packed neighborhood, Mohammed Zidan's home escaped a direct hit but the blast was so powerful it blew out the walls.  ""Because you want to strike one person, you don't need to destroy a whole apartment complex,"" said the 29-year-old.  ""I'm a young man, living in my house, with my children in my home. I'm focusing on my work. What's my fault, that you make me pay the price?""  As Zidan stepped over the remains of his bedroom on Monday, Palestinians elsewhere were commemorating the Nakba, or catastrophe.  It marks the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, in the war which erupted when Israel was created in 1948.  ""We will stay living the life of the Nakba, continuously,"" said Zidan, who has taken to sleeping on the street behind his home.  The Israeli military did not immediately respond to an enquiry from AFP on why it targeted the neighborhood.  A fragile ceasefire has largely held since late Saturday, ending the repeated rounds of Israeli strikes and volleys of rocket fire launched by Palestinian militants.  The fighting killed 33 people in Gaza, including children as well as militants, and two civilians in Israel.

LOUIS - Rising majestically from the landscape of East St. Louis, Illinois, the Gateway Geyser is a powerful testament to human ingenuity and ambition. This 630-feet tall water fountain, one of the tallest in the world, is an iconic centerpiece of the Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park and a cherished symbol of the city's relationship with its neighboring metropolis, St. Louis, Missouri.  The Gateway Geyser was first unveiled in 1995 as part of an extensive initiative to rejuvenate and beautify the East St. Louis waterfront. Its inauguration marked a new chapter for the city, symbolizing its transformative journey and adding a unique feature to its skyline that rivaled the grandeur of the Gateway Arch located just across the Mississippi River.  This man-made marvel was made possible through intricate engineering and design. Its remarkable height is achieved by three 800-horsepower pumps that can propel 7,500 gallons of water per minute straight up into the sky at a speed of 250 feet per second. When the wind speed is less than 4 mph, the Geyser can reach its maximum height of 630 feet, equal to that of the iconic Gateway Arch.  The Gateway Geyser's operation mimics the cycles of its natural counterparts. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the Geyser erupts daily at noon for 10 minutes, displaying an awe-inspiring show of power and elegance. These exhibitions are subject to favorable wind, weather, and drought conditions. During the colder months, from September through May, the Geyser enters a period of hibernation, its grand display pausing until the arrival of warmer weather.  Article continues after sponsor message  The Geyser's existence and the surrounding park owes much to the vision and dedication of Malcolm W. Martin, a St. Louis native, and veteran of World War II. Martin was a local lawyer, philanthropist, and community leader who played a pivotal role in the creation of the Gateway Geyser. He was instrumental in the formation of the Gateway Center of Metropolitan St. Louis, which worked tirelessly for four decades to protect the land from commercial development.  Martin dreamed of extending the Memorial Park to encompass both sides of the river, honoring the original vision of Eero Saarinen, the architect of the Gateway Arch. This dream was realized in part when, in 2005, the Gateway Center transferred the title of the Gateway Geyser and over 30 acres of land to the Metro East Park and Recreation District (MEPRD).  Today, the Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park is a serene green space housing not only the Gateway Geyser but also the Mississippi River Overlook. This 40-foot tall structure offers unparalleled views of the Gateway Arch, the Mississippi River, and the St. Louis skyline. It's a favorite spot for photographers and visitors seeking to capture the majesty of the city's skyline and the towering Geyser.  The Gateway Geyser stands as a tribute to East St. Louis's resilience, ambition, and unity. With each eruption, it celebrates the enduring bond between East St. Louis and St. Louis, reaching skyward in a display of strength and aspiration. It embodies the city's past, present, and future, symbolizing its transformative journey and serving as a beacon of hope for the future.  The Gateway Geyser is more than a man-made marvel; it's a testament to human creativity, a symbol of regional identity, and a beacon of civic pride. It is a monument to the city's vision for growth, the fulfillment of a shared dream, and a celebration of a community's ability to rise and thrive.

"eruption","2013-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:30:26","Any franchise entering its fifth decade is bound to have had a few ups and downs along the way. Star Trek's midlife crisis landed in the '00s.  Nemesis, the tenth Trek movie, had brought the film series to a stuttering halt, consigning the old odd numbers bad, even numbers good theory to history (check out our Star Trek movies, ranked worst to best article to see what we mean). On the small screen, meanwhile, the premature cancellation of Enterprise had brought 18 continuous years of storytelling on the final frontier to an end. A wilderness period to rival Doctor Who's absence between 1989 and 2005 could easily have been on the cards.  Luckily, it took less than a year for J.J. Abrams (fresh off the success of Lost and Mission: Impossible III) to accept the brief of resurrecting an ailing saga. And, much like Nicholas Meyer did on The Wrath of Khan, he brought the eye of a non-fan to a franchise that had become somewhat set in its ways.  Given his subsequent relocation to a famous galaxy far, far away, it may be appropriate that Abrams' formula for the movie was to Star Wars it up. Star Trek (as it was economically branded) prioritized box-office friendly spectacle over the more cerebral corners of sci-fi. At the same time, it pulled off the seemingly impossible feat of telling an origin story for Kirk, Spock, and Bones, while also keeping their fates a mystery. This unlikely Schrödinger's canon scenario was achieved by creating an entirely new continuity (the so-called Kelvin timeline) via the ingenious combination of a post-Next Generation Spock, a vengeful Romulan commander, and the noble sacrifice of Captain Kirk's Dad, George.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  Star Trek was exciting, emotional, and entertaining, and – as long as you looked past the odd narrative inconsistency – largely faithful to existing canon. It also broadened the franchise's appeal beyond the traditional fanbase, and subsequently became the highest grossing movie in the series by several light years.  Four years later, Star Trek into Darkness arrived on a warp bubble of hype and anticipation, but Wikipedia controversy (opens in new tab) created by the absent colon in the title was just the tip of the iceberg. Abrams' follow-up undid everything its predecessor got right and sent the Kelvinverse spinning wildly off course.  Into Darkness started off promisingly enough: Spock in danger, the Enterprise hidden underwater, and an audacious mission to save a primitive civilization from a volcanic eruption. This spectacular violation of the Prime Directive prompted a brief demotion for Kirk, until a series of terrorist attacks left his mentor, Christopher Pike, dead, and Starfleet on a defensive footing.  From here, the movie never recovered. Darker sequels have become something of a Hollywood cliché, but this was a particularly unnecessary swerve away from the fun adventure vibe of the first movie. With Kirk and the crew forced into an Apocalypse Now-style manhunt to track down fugitive assassin John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), Into Darkness squandered the easy chemistry the cast had established first time out. Chris Pine's Kirk suffered more than most, as the pressure of command robbed him of the rogue-ish charm that made him the MVP of the first film.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  But – with the possible exception of Carol Marcus's gratuitous shuttlecraft striptease – Into Darkness 's biggest crime was its obsession with places Star Trek has boldly gone before. Indeed, after the massive narrative hoops the first film jumped through to make this Kelvin timeline a blank slate, this was something of a wasted opportunity.  Fan service is now so baked into the DNA of Star Trek and Star Wars that you could forgive the presence of Marcus (mother of Kirk's son in the original timeline) and the references to Harry Mudd and Christine Chapel. However, the Enterprise's detour to apprehend Harrison on the Klingon homeworld only made sense as an excuse to reintroduce the franchise's most famous alien bad guys.  And did anyone ever really believe that John Harrison was the aggressor's real name? Despite multiple protests to the contrary from cast and crew, his true identity – he was Khan Noonien Singh all along! – ranked among the worst-kept secrets in sci-fi. The subterfuge wasn't even worth the effort because this new version was Khan in name only.  Crucially, Into Darkness forgot that it was the rage that simmered during 15 years of exile that turned Khan into such a memorable antagonist in The Wrath of Khan. For all his genetically engineered superior intellect, Khan 2.0 was only a big deal because we already knew he was. That's probably why Leonard Nimoy's Spock Prime showed up to tell newbies that Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced – a moment every bit as clunky as Palpatine telling the pre-teen Anakin Skywalker he'll watch his career with great interest.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  But the true nadir of Star Trek into Darkness came in a final act that morphed into a weird cover version of The Wrath of Khan. As dialogue was recycled verbatim and Kirk (rather than Spock) sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise from certain doom, the sequence's biggest achievement was reminding you of the brilliance of the original. The over-played grief of Spock – a man who could barely stand to be in the same room as Kirk just a few hours earlier – couldn't get close to the impact of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy's touching farewell in The Wrath of Khan.  These missteps didn't do the movie any harm at the box office, where it made significantly more money worldwide than Star Trek. In most regards, however, the Kelvin timeline never really recovered.  With Abrams otherwise engaged on The Force Awakens, Fast & Furious regular Justin Lin took the helm for 2016's Star Trek Beyond. They made a noble attempt to explore new territory (albeit while destroying the Enterprise… again), but it was definitely one to file under fun but forgettable.  (Image credit: Paramount Plus)  In the years since, Paramount have repeatedly tried to get the cast back together for a fourth time – most notably for a story that would reunite Kirk with his late dad, George (Thor's Chris Hemsworth) – but for the time being the Kelvin-verse seems stuck in limbo. And with the tragic death of Anton Yelchin (opens in new tab), who played Chekov in the Kelvinverse movies, a full reunion is sadly off the cards for good.  But, does Star Trek even need movie theaters anymore? With four existing shows on the Paramount Plus roster and another – Starfleet Academy – on the way, the TV branch of the franchise is in better health than ever. Plus, with the Michelle Yeoh-starring Section 31 movie also coming to the streaming platform in the near future, it seems that the newly launched Enterprise-A may be stuck in Spacedock forever.  That's a shame, because the rebooted original series crew were denied the opportunity to live up to their massive potential. How different things could have been had Into Darkness captured the imagination like its predecessor…","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9zdGFyLXRyZWstaW50by1kYXJrbmVzcy10aGUtc2VxdWVsLXdoZXJlLXRoZS1rZWx2aW52ZXJzZS13ZW50LXdpbGRseS1vZmYtY291cnNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The global mantle flow models developed by Bodur and Flament reveal that Earth’s deepest mantle and the surface are connected by broad mantle upwellings – pillars of heat that carry material from the base of the mantle to the surface. These upwellings can trigger kimberlites, small but powerful volcanic eruptions that often contains diamonds.  Their models – developed with supercomputers at The National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra – show that the dynamics in the deepest mantle impact the surface and where kimberlites will erupt over time.  The models also show that at the centres of these pillars of heat, Earth’s mantle flows upward much faster so that it can carry dense basal mantle material, creating different chemical compositions between the kimberlite samples.  Dr Bodur said the research showcases how Earth’s mineral resources, in this case diamonds, can be prospected in space and time using global mantle flow models.  “The models we have developed may also be used to predict where other mineral deposits may form. This opens opportunities for the minerals industry mitigating their risk in continental-scale exploration.”  Up to now, Geoscience Australia has been providing mineral potential maps that are based on geological and geophysical data to help industry to decrease their risk associated with minerals exploration. The new models developed by Bodur and Flament provide diamond potential maps supported by a geodynamic model.  This work comes at a time when reliable physical models of Earth’s interior are more important than ever. Investigating minerals that will facilitate the world’s transition to green energy using global mantle flow models has become more urgent.  Associate Professor Flament said that the work shows how “the very long-distance relationship” between Earth’s surface and the deepest mantle works in real space and time.  “This relationship was predicted by geologists who observed overlapping seismic tomographic maps of the deepest mantle and kimberlite sites at the surface, but they were lacking a physical explanation.”  “We have shown that this relationship has existed for hundreds of millions of years, but not in the way it was imagined; broad mantle upwelling is rooted on Earth’s basal mantle and is slowly moving as opposed to its previously assumed fixed location.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20uYXUvbmV3LXJlc2VhcmNoLXRyYWNrcy10aGUtbW92ZW1lbnQtb2YtbWluZXJhbHMtYW5kLWRpYW1vbmRzLXdpdGhpbi10aGUtZWFydGgtcy1tYW50bGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Deegan becomes the first female mayor in Jacksonville history, having defeated a candidate who outspent her significantly. Her opponent had the backing of the Republican Party of Florida and the endorsement of Gov. Ron DeSantis.  “Everybody said it could not be done in Jacksonville,” said Deegan, who said the campaign and its volunteers had worked for a year and a half ahead of the election. Deegan drew 52 percent of the vote.  Davis — a former legislator and CEO of the local Chamber of Commerce — and his allies hit Deegan over her participation in Black Lives Matter protests, and the local sheriff said she would install “radical policies” if elected. Deegan pushed back by calling the attacks smears and billed herself as a candidate who would change a city government that had been dominated by Republicans. Deegan was also able to score some Republican endorsements ahead of Election Day.  Deegan’s victory gives Florida Democrats a psychological boost just months after the November 2022 elections in which DeSantis won his re-election victory by nearly 20 points, and Republicans crushed Democrats across the state. Democrats all over Florida erupted with glee on social media over Deegan’s win.

The violence is said to be triggered by a social media post on the controversial film, The Kerala Story, reported BBC, citing reports.  The authorities had also imposed a curfew and shut down internet services in the violence-hit city to get the situation under control. At least eight people, including a female constable, were injured after the clashes erupted over the weekend.  “Violent clash erupted between two groups over a minor dispute. Some Vehicles have been damaged by the violent mob. The situation is now under control,” Akola Superintendent of Police, Sandeep Ghuge, said on Sunday, as quoted by news agency ANI.  According to the police, the violence first began on Saturday when members of the community gathered outside the town’s police station to protest against a social media post in relation to The Kerala Story.  The post in question was reportedly a conversation between two residents the screenshot of which was shared on Instagram by one of them and “hurt the religious sentiments” of the other person.  “During a chat between two individuals, one person purposely tried to hurt the religious sentiments of another person after which the screenshot of those messages were shared on Instagram,” a police official told The Indian Express.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, on Monday, ordered the police to take strict action against the perpetrators of the riots in Akola and Shevgaon in Ahmednagar while also urging people to maintain peace and social harmony.  However, no further details about the post were given. The police are looking for the account holder whose Instagram handle was XYZZZZZ99988.

For the fifth consecutive year, every single senior has been accepted into a two or four-year college or university.  At a college signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon, each student declared where they would be going after high school.  Alexandra Gonzalez-Amaro and Adrian Ramirez were two seniors who gave speeches at the event.  “I’ve been looking forward to this day for the longest time,” Gonzales-Amaro exclaimed.  “The moment I walked into the school, I felt welcome and I felt like I belonged here. You’re going into a journey but you’re never doing it alone.”  Gonzales-Amaro will be going to Notre Dame to study political science on the pre-law track. Ramirez announced he will be attending Marquette University on a full-ride scholarship to study mechanical engineering.  “Especially as a Hispanic, first-generation student, we want to embrace the change we have to offer. We’re as important as everyone else to go to college and show the world what we can do,” Ramirez said.  The students at Cristo Rey are involved in a work-study program that places them in different companies across the greater Milwaukee area throughout their time in school. President of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School, Andrew Stith, says the students leave with knowledge both inside and outside of the classroom.  “We really look to empower our students to take that next step and contribute to the Milwaukee community,” Stith said.  While several students like Gonzales-Amaro are headed out of state, the majority will attend local colleges, like the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College.  “They’re a lot of great choices right here in Milwaukee. We want them to stay here in Milwaukee because we need good leaders to build the future,” Stith said.  According to their website, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School is the third largest feeder school to Marquette University.  This year, the senior class is receiving over $17 million in scholarships. It’s also the first class to have a division one athlete.  “Although it may be one student crossing the stage, it sets the expectation for a family to do something similar. That can change the community in pretty significant ways,” Stith explained.  The Cristo Rey Jesuit High School graduation ceremony will be held on June 2.  It’s about time to watch on your time.

Simmons spent Mother's Day in mourning.  Deshawn Talley was a young man with big dreams, according to his grieving mother. He displayed determination and a strong work ethic from an early age, having secured his first job at just 15. Throughout his life, it was always just Deshawn and his mother. Simmons says her son was her best friend.  She says Deshawn was spending a Friday evening with his friends in Edgehill when gunfire erupted.  Metro Nashville Police Department officers discovered Deshawn's body on the back porch of a nearby home. Witnesses told police they heard gunshots coming from the vicinity of 14th Avenue South.  Simmons expressed how the devastating news had completely changed her life. She says she can't help but reflect on their last conversation.  ""He was like, 'Even I know, we all get to die.' But he was like, 'Even the other life or wherever we go to die. I always want you to be my mama. I always want you by my side.'""  Even through this death, this mother said she will never leave her son's side and will get him justice. These parents will keep fighting until the people responsible are held accountable.  Homicide detectives are now urging the community to step forward and assist in the investigation. Surveillance footage has revealed a black Nissan Armada as the suspect vehicle in Deshawn's murder.  Any information related to the vehicle or the incident is crucial to progressing the case. If you have seen the SUV or possess any information that may aid the investigation, it is imperative to contact the police immediately.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjaGFubmVsNS5jb20vbmV3cy9zaGUtc3BlbnQtbW90aGVycy1kYXktbW91cm5pbmctbm93LXNoZS13YW50cy1qdXN0aWNlLWZvci1oZXItb25seS1zb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There are 228 days left in the year.  Today's Highlight in History:  On May 17, 1954, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court handed down its Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision which held that racially segregated public schools were inherently unequal, and therefore unconstitutional.  On this date:  In 1536, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared the marriage of England's King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn invalid after she failed to produce a male heir; Boleyn, already condemned for high treason, was executed two days later.  In 1940, the Nazis occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World War II.  In 1946, President Harry S. Truman seized control of the nation's railroads, delaying - but not preventing - a threatened strike by engineers and trainmen.  In 1973, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate began its televised hearings into the Watergate scandal.  In 1980, rioting that claimed 18 lives erupted in Miami's Liberty City after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four former Miami police officers of fatally beating Black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.  In 1987, 37 American sailors were killed when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. (Iraq apologized for the attack, calling it a mistake, and paid more than $27 million in compensation.)  In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a measure requiring neighborhood notification when sex offenders move in. (""Megan's Law,"" as it's known, was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994.)  In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages.  In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that young people serving life prison terms should have ""a meaningful opportunity to obtain release"" provided they didn't kill their victims.  In 2015, a shootout erupted between bikers and police outside a restaurant in Waco, Texas, leaving nine of the bikers dead and 20 people injured.  In 2017, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.  In 2020, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was tested for the coronavirus on live TV as he announced that all people in the state who were experiencing flu-like symptoms were eligible for tests.  Ten years ago: The ousted head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven Miller, faced hours of intense grilling before Congress; both defiant and apologetic, Miller acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status, but insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions. Jorge Rafael Videla (HOHR'-hay rah-fay-EHL' vih-DEH'-lah), 87, the former dictator who took power in Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands during a ""dirty war"" against alleged subversives, died in Buenos Aires while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity.  Five years ago: With six Democrats joining Republicans in voting to confirm her, Gina Haspel won Senate confirmation to become director of the CIA. The Miss America Organization announced that it would now have women in its three top leadership positions, after an email scandal in which male officials were caught making vulgar and insulting comments about past winners.  One year ago: President Joe Biden condemned the poison of white supremacy and said the nation must ""reject the lie"" of the racist ""replacement theory"" espoused by a shooter who killed 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York.

The report singles out the FBI for acting on ""raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,"" and for handling ""important aspects"" of the probe in a ""seriously deficient"" manner rife with ""confirmation bias.""  Though legal experts widely panned the report as a failure, Trump declared it a win on Truth Social.  ""WOW! After extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI never should have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!"" Trump wrote. ""In other words, the American Public was scammed, just as it is being scammed right now by those who don't want to see GREATNESS for AMERICA!""  ""The Durham Report spells out in great detail the Democrat Hoax that was perpetrated upon me and the American people,"" the ex-president said in another post. ""This is 2020 Presidential Election Fraud, ￼just like 'stuffing' the ballot boxes, only more so. This totally illegal act had a huge impact on the Election.

Following the report's release, legal experts have flagged that the report is missing critical components and should be viewed with scrutiny.  Former U.S. Attorney Barb McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor, took to Twitter to underscore some of the report's omissions, which she feels contributed to an incorrect conclusion that the FBI probe into Trump's dealings with the Kremlin was baseless.  The ""FBI was properly concerned about Russia's efforts to influence the presidential election,"" she tweeted.  ""Trump had other concerning ties to Russians: real estate deals, Miss Universe Pageant, loans from Russian lenders, Trump Tower Moscow project,"" McQuade continued. ""Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort had lobbied for pro-Russian oligarchs. Trump campaign members also had ties to Russia. Mike Flynn was paid $45,000 by Russia Today in 2015 for a speech he gave at a banquet where he sat next to Putin. He later lied to FBI about his calls with the Russian ambassador about sanctions during the transition.""  ""Failing to investigate these ties would have been a breach of duty by FBI,"" McQuade asserted. ""The Durham Report provides fuel for the false claim that the Russia probe was a hoax.

"eruption","2023-02-01","Not Discerned","{""Colombo"", ""Colombo"", ""SriLanka""}","Wed 17 May 2023 03:55:41","Last Friday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government suddenly activated a major security operation around Colombo University and in several other areas, including Colombo Fort, Galle Face Green and roads leading to the Capital.  Thousands of armed soldiers and police special task force and riot police personnel equipped with water cannons were deployed to these areas and road barricades established. Hundreds of police were brought into Colombo from outlying areas for the operation. Troops were mobilised in Colombo’s outer suburbs while police checked motorists outside the city.  Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe with airforce commander Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana, background left, and police chief Chandana Wickremeratne, right, watch during the 75th Independence Day ceremony in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2023. [AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena]  The massive mobilisation, according to media reports, was in response to “intelligence” information, but according to Economynext, the information consisted of an “unusually large lunch order” received by a Colombo University canteen.  The news outlet quoted one source who said: “Intelligence units had picked up information that the canteen had received an order for 1,500 lunch packets on Friday… This was (mis)interpreted as a mass gathering to march to government buildings.”  The article reported that about 500 first-year students had been invited to an arts department celebration at the university and that lunch was to be served to them and their parents or siblings attending the event.  According to the same source, the president’s private residence in Colombo was also provided additional security. Wickremesinghe, however, has not lived there since it was set on fire in May last year.  Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nihal Thalduwa told the media that the Friday’s massive security operation followed “intelligence reports” about “an anti-government group planning to create disturbances” and emphasised that “security measures will remain until further notice.”  The Daily Mirror.lk quoted “highly placed security sources” who claimed “IUSF [Inter University Student Federation] students were planning to march into the city in their hundreds over the weekend to take over key government institutions and launch a fresh ‘Aragalaya’ (struggle) against the government.”  Ministry of Defence Director (Media) Col. Nalin Herath told Sunday Morning: “Security in Colombo will be increased for the next few days, due to multiple reasons, including a planned rehearsal for various contingencies, such as natural disasters or terror attacks.”  On Monday, the government ended its special military and police deployment but police spokesperson, SSP Thalduwa, declared that its “normal security program will remain.”  Last weekend’s security operation in Colombo had nothing to do with responding to “natural disasters or terror attacks,” nor was it related to an alleged lunchtime gathering of the ISUF, the pseudo-left Frontline Socialist Party’s student organisation, at Colombo University.  Rather, it was part of Wickremesinghe’s increasing use of the police and military to crush future struggles, including strikes and protests by workers and youth against the government’s International Monetary Fund austerity measures.  Sri Lanka’s ruling elite is acutely sensitive to the rising social opposition to the Wickremesinghe government, fearful that this will develop into the sort of mass uprising that last year ousted President Gotabhaya Rajapakse.  Last Tuesday, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena told an official media briefing that the cabinet discussed how to respond to the possible eruption of mass struggles on the May 9 anniversary of violent demonstrations across Sri Lanka.  Those protests, which included setting fire to Wickremesinghe’s official residence and other government parliamentarian’s homes, however, were a response against a series of brutal attacks by pro-Rajapakse thugs on anti-government protesters on Galle Face Green.  Gunawardena told the media briefing that cabinet ministers discussed the formation of a special presidential commission to investigate how to respond to future mass struggles. He claimed no definite decision had been taken and would not provide any further details.  While the government is nervous about rising anti-government sentiment among workers and the rural poor over its escalating social assault, it retains political power because the unions are working tooth and nail to prevent any independent mobilisation of the working class.  Under conditions where the unions are finding it increasingly difficult to suppress workers’ opposition, the government is more and more preparing to use police and military repression to crush workers’ struggles.  For millions of Sri Lankans life is becoming unbearable. The percentage of Sri Lankans living in poverty doubled from 13 percent in 2021 to 25 percent in 2022.  Commodity prices and inflation continue to increase, sharply eroding the purchasing power of the masses who face severe food insecurity. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in the private sector, including in the garment and construction industries and the small industry sector.  IMF-dictated austerity, including direct taxes on working people, increased electricity and water tariffs, and other inroads, will further intensify the social disaster facing workers and rural toilers.  In addition, the government is moving to axe hundreds of thousands of jobs through the restructuring and privatisation of state enterprises. This involves 430 state-owned enterprises, including 39 corporations, 218 companies and 173 statutory boards being restructured or privatised under a national agency established by the finance ministry.  Last weekend’s security operation in Colombo is an integral part of readying the police, military and other sections of the repressive state apparatus to deal with the inevitable eruption of working class struggles against the government.  In line with these preparations the Wickremesinghe government has imposed essential service regulations on key public sector areas, criminalising strikes and political action taken by workers in these industries. These regulations are being renewed each month via extraordinary government gazette and the security forces kept on standby nationally under the public security act.  The mass deployment of military and police forces last weekend is a warning to the working class that to fight the government’s social assaults it must organise independently of the trade unions and all bourgeois parties. This requires formation of its own action committees and the development of political and industrial struggle for a workers’ and peasants’ government committed to a socialist and internationalist program.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcva2F5Zy1tMTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 11:47:25","Permanent bridges being designed for North Windward-Finance Minister  Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Camillo Gonsalves, has declared that the tough times endured at the river crossings at Overland and Noel are now problems of the past.  Minister Gonsalves was among speakers at the official opening of the two Bailey Bridges on Thursday, May 11.  “When the river comes down, never again will people be stuck on either side of the river,” the minister said.  “Never again! because after this temporary bridge, is a permanent bridge. The same thing in Noel. Never again will somebody be on this side talking to somebody on that side.”  Minister Gonsalves said at the ceremony which was held in Overland.  Recalling the hardships endured by commuters in North Windward prior to the installation of the two Bailey bridges, Minister Gonsalves added, “Never again will people from Kingstown run up here with they phone to film something to put on social media and say ‘look, man trapped here so or man trapped there so’.”  Prior to the installation of the bridges at Noel and Overland, commuters spent hours waiting at these river crossings whenever it rained heavily.  The sight of people and vehicles stuck on either side of the rivers was often a photo opportunity for many social media users.  In his address, the Finance Minister reminded the gathering that when the volcano erupted explosively in April 2021, the people in North Windward felt the adverse effects.  Although they were evacuated out of the red zone, the impact was evident on homes, schools farms and shops in the area.  “In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, what we needed was vision,” the Finance Minister said.  While there were people without vision who had lots of ideas, Minister Gonsalves said it was Deputy Prime Minister Montgomery Daniel, who saw the need for the bridges, and he articulated that need to Cabinet.  “After we got the vision for the bridges, we got the vision to assist the people who had been impacted and displaced by the volcano,” the Minister said.  “Without the vision, not only do the people perish, but nothing gets done.”  The bridges were obtained through funding from the World Bank’s Volcano Eruption Emergency Project (VEEP).  The VEEP project also provided income support to residents and farmers.  “We understood what was needed. That is when the Prime Minister contacted the World Bank.”  While the Bailey bridges could last up to 50 years, Minister Gonsalves assured residents of North Windward that “we not leaving them here for 50 years.”  He said a company in Trinidad is already working on the design for three permanent bridges for North Windward.  Apart from replacing the Bailey bridges at Overland and Noel, a permanent bridge is also to be put in place at London.  Minister Gonsalves promised that when the designs are completed, the Bailey bridges will be replaced.  He said the bridges are “part of a package of initiative of over US$40 million, designed to lift up the people of this community and put St Vincent and the Grenadines back on the path to progress”.  Speaking about the vulnerability of the country and the need for resilience, Minister Gonsalves said the test of resilience lies in how quickly one is able to bounce back and get back on one’s feet.  “When we build back, we build back better than before.”  In thanking the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for the vision, the Finance Minister said “ we will always be in your corner to help you mitigate the vulnerabilities and help make St Vincent and the Grenadines more resilient.”  Project Engineer of VEEP, Nerissa Fergus said the bridge at Noel is 30 meters in length; it was done by K-electric.  That bridge is single lane; while the one at overland is a two lane, 30 meters bridge with a pedestrian walkway.  The bridge at Overland was done by the firm Sea Operators SVG.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXJjaGxpZ2h0LnZjL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9wZXJtYW5lbnQtYnJpZGdlcy1kZXNpZ25lZC1ub3J0aC13aW5kd2FyZC1maW5hbmNlLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2018-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Montreal"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:47:00","On Peacock’s The End is Nye, veteran VFX supervisor Jeff Okun and a group of 12 visual effects vendors went to great extremes to throw host and show EP Bill Nye into harm’s way within the most epic global disasters imaginable – both natural and unnatural, killing him in the process - to demystify these catastrophes using science, while showing how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them.  Think 2012 meets Geostorm. Or a new take on Kill Bill.  The six-episode series, streaming now, pits Nye against a devastating assortment of disasters, including large-scale asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. Okun deftly and seamlessly mixes real footage with visual effects, creating gripping, often scary situations where mankind is at the mercy of the elements, both natural and unnatural. Make sure to bring extra batteries.  Brannon Braga serves as showrunner, director, and EP. The show is produced by Universal Television Alternative Studio, a division of Universal Studio Group, and Fuzzy Door. Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins executive produce for Fuzzy Door. Nye also executive produces. Rachel Hargreaves-Heald is the executive in charge of production for Fuzzy Door.  We recently chatted with Okun, who shared his insights on the project’s immense volume of feature-quality VFX, produced on a tight budget and schedule, without previs, or a sturdy umbrella.  Dan Sarto: How early did you come onto the project? What was the creative mandate as to the tone of what to depict with VFX, how much actual disaster footage would be used, how it would integrate with VFX, and how scary / deadly the disasters would be depicted?  Jeff Okun: I was recruited by the show’s writer/director/producer Brannan Braga long before it was even written. He would run ideas by me, and we would riff a bit. But in the end, he just wrote them and sent them to me for budgeting. I like to think we have a great relationship, and he allows me to get involved very early so we can maximize what can be accomplished in the timeframe and budget frame. He is very collaborative before, during and in post. The mandate was to do large-scale feature film disaster effects. 2012 meets Geostorm kind of stuff. We wanted to set the stage with super cool, terrible disaster scenarios and then make it more real by showing actual footage. Integrate the two together to demonstrate how bad it can get in a visceral manner. The disasters were to feel real and very, very scary because of the integration of actual footage with the visual effects footage.  DS: What type of reference, scientific data, concept designs, and actual imagery, did you have to work from, and how much did you deviate / interpret materials to create the VFX, as opposed to recreating actual disaster visuals for circumstances shown in the series?  JO: Brannon is well connected to the science world and as such was able to provide me with great access to experts in the various fields where we were creating the disasters. That and Bill Nye knows a bit about it too. He is the real deal in that he strongly and personally believes in everything he says. So, the mandate with the scientists was to keep it real. And real in these cases are very big, very scary – every scarier when you realize how real it is. I got the opportunity to scientifically demonstrate many concepts of how these disasters are created – sometimes by mankind, sometimes by the nature of our planet. Most of the disasters have not yet occurred in our technologically enhanced civilization, but a few have. But what I realized by working on this show is how close we have come to some very large-scale, world-killing disasters. It was some kind of joy to be showing the world what would happen and how we can either mitigate it, stop it, or survive it using science and visual effects of course!  DS: How many VFX houses did you work with, and how did the production compare (timeframe, volume of shots, previs, pipeline) to previous work you’ve done as a VFX supervisor on features?  JO: We ended up with 12 vendors on the show spread around the globe. We made the show during the height of the “tail of the pandemic” VFX rush; finding vendors who had the capacity and quality we needed was not easy. My VFX Producer, Gene Kozicki, did a great job sourcing several small companies who could do really great work on the harder side of things, like particle systems, rigid body collisions, for the volcanos, the earthquakes, the tsunamis, the asteroid collisions, satellite-based comet re-direction, level 6 hurricanes, floods, dust storms, city destruction, and on and on.  On average, we had about 500-800 shots an episode. We had a very rushed timeline to edit, temp, get approvals and finish the show. We did not have the time or money for previs, but what I would do is shoot something representative or do temp comps with found footage. For example, we have a shot where a plane is being tossed about in a thundercloud and out of nowhere another jet appears and almost crashes into us. I took a highlighter pen, and using post-it notes, made wings and a tail, and stuck them on it. I got some stormy cloud footage on YouTube and using my iPhone shot the highlighter flying in front of the storm footage monitor. I added sound and showed it to Brannan who approved the shot, and off we went to get it made. It’s that kind of fun creative approaches that got us so much so fast for so little.  DS: What were the biggest, most complicated sequences, or types of VFX, you produced?  JO: Every episode had a tentpole shot or five. The volcano episode with the eruption and pyroclastic cloud chasing and then killing Bill Nye – we had to do eruptions, ash covered towns, pyroclastic volcanic plumes with lightning inside them, and of course the flow chasing Bill. In the comet episode, we had to do Tektite rain that ends up killing Bill. For the five simultaneous Category 6 hurricanes, we had to create the storm around Bill, and then have it kill him by blowing him down the street into a parked car and then having an uprooted tree punch Bill through the car and into a storm surge where he drowns. And on and on it went.  But we also had to create a complete museum of disaster with an escalator through a porthole into the various disasters (kind of like a holodeck) and then destroy it all in the final episode. We had to do all this because that is what the show is about – The End of the World is Nye! I loved killing Bill in every episode, and they were always the most fun and creative things to do. The most complex sequences had to do with adding Seth MacFarlane into shots seamlessly. He played the “Act of Cow” part – meaning the person who inadvertently caused or exaggerated the disaster. He was unavailable to us during shooting, so we added him in post. The hardest shot was we moved down the aisle of a jet airliner, and he is in a seat. This was a Steadicam shot with little data to help set it up. So, we shot him with the camera doing the perspective move on him and then had a company in India track him in. They did a great job; it was a very difficult shot. So, as you can see, every episode, almost every disaster sequence was difficult, challenging and fun to solve.  Sometimes we used old-school techniques. For the flooding of the coffee shop in Episode 1, we used a custom-built water tank and shot the glass out with a pellet gun, then comped that into the coffee shop set (which was supposed to be downstairs on the street). We shot the stunt girl diving out of the way and a separate splash element – comped them all together by our in-house team and there you go!  DS: What were the most challenging aspects of the show?  JO: As it turned out, the most challenging aspect of the show was finding vendors. We were put in a situation where tax incentives were paramount. So, our challenge was to find any vendor who was in an approved tax zone who had the capacity and ability. In the end, we mostly went with smaller vendors, like Cos FX in L.A., Blue Fire in Utah, Incessant Rain in Nepal, and Mathematic in Paris. We did have BUF in Paris as well, but as our schedule pushed, they had a hard out date, so we got all the big stuff done early with them. We were also in Spain, Australia, and of course Montreal and Vancouver.  When it comes to shots or VFX sequences, our challenges were about the Oort Cloud surrounding our solar system and Bill floating around, jostling a rock out of the cloud that turns into a world-ending series of comet fragment strikes. In Montreal, Antarctic… and Tahiti, where our senator (Seth) is hiding out because the projections of where the strikes would occur were gotten incorrectly by his office. So, we kill him there! There was also a sequence where Seth is fracking near Yellowstone Park to relieve the pressure building up in the volcano. Again, we added Seth after the fact, and as he exits the frame, he has to bump Bill. Challenging and fun! I could go on and on because every shot is a challenge, but it all works out in the end.  DS: How did your expertise and VFX production experience – skills, tricks – help you on this production, where it might have tripped up in some aspects a lesser experienced supervisor?  JO: Wow! You really want me to get into trouble here, don’t you? Ha! OK. I have been a student of VFX and VFX photography my entire life. I used to study in-camera tricks, the forced perspective sets with varying sized miniature cars, glass matt paintings, and then photo-chemical compositing and finally CGI. Saul Bass gave me the opportunity to meet and work with John Whitney Sr. and Jr. So, I come pretty well armed with varying options and techniques. Knowing when to use which is the trick.  We opted for as much in-camera effects as we could. Then our secondary goto was simple A over B comps – which meant having a good old-fashioned element shoot day. This allowed us to lower the costs and shorten the time in our budget and schedule. Finally, we had saved up enough money and time to take on the really big stuff – crazy 280 mph wind and rain, tidal waves, ground splitting open, buildings crashing down, pyroclastic flows, tektite rain, eruptions, lava pits opening – you know, the fun stuff – all done with plates, elements, and some serious CG.  DS: Did you make use of any virtual production tools, any game engine tools, or any visualization tools on the show?  JO: No. We investigated them but, in the end, we had two issues: first, we did not have the time to prep for their use as the scripts were being written and re-written through the prep period, and second, the instances that they would be good for ended up costing more to do than traditional greenscreens based on where our location was. They would have been great for the driving shots in the tektite rain, the pyroclastic cloud chase, the Space station, and several angles in the Disaster Institute and outside Bill’s lab window – but again, we just didn’t have the time. The Disaster Institute was not fully designed until well into post, for example.  DS: What’s more fun to create – a tornado, a hurricane, a volcano, or some other specific disaster?  JO: You know what's more fun to create – a compelling disaster that’s part of a good story so that it resonates with the viewer and, hopefully, gets them to investigate change for themselves. Whether that is a hurricane, volcanic eruption, tidal wave, plane crash, humorous deaths (like Bill’s) or the end of the planet. Any VFX shot that stands alone is to me, someone saying, “Look what a cool thing I can think of!” Whereas any VFX in service to story – be it tentpole or invisible (the kind I prefer) – is great VFX!  DS: And on a serious note, did it ever get a bit depressing or upsetting to spend time on disaster reference footage when you know the human cost could very well be quite high?  JO: Not at all because we created these horrible scenes of death and destruction to enlighten, change, and cause us all to think a bit more about the world we live in. In a time when borders are becoming more prominent, we need to know that the weather, an earthquake, or volcano, or asteroid, does not care about them. So, we as people of the earth should really come together to do the right thing for ourselves and our planet. If you need a bit of perspective on all this, I urge you to find the Carl Sagan video/speech called “Pale Blue Dot.”  DS: Lastly, what did you enjoy most on this show and why?  JO: I loved doing this show because of 3 things – Brannan Braga, Bill Nye, and the amount of creative input I had. I designed entire sequences and then got to shoot them. Also, the topic of the show – Six ways the world will end – note the word “will,” not “might” – is very important. In a time when scientific facts are being ignored or denied, it makes this show triply important because it shows the way to stop, lessen, or, in the case of no way to avoid it, to survive the disaster. I think as we have seen by the weather this past winter, things are going to happen, probably get worse before they get better and the sooner we humans start to believe it is all real, the easier it will be to spot most of the bad stuff. They say some stuff cannot be stopped, like an asteroid strike, but that’s just not true – just this past year we changed the course of an asteroid – Yay NASA! I like what Neil deGrasse Tyson says, “In the end, the Earth is going to be just fine. It’s the humans who should be worried.

The satellite, which was worked on by roughly 200 University of Bristol students over the past seven years, is now nearly ready for a potential launch in early 2024 after it successfully underwent extreme testing at the European Space Agency (ESA).  Designed to monitor active volcanoes and make 3D models of their ash clouds, the device could improve our understanding of volcanoes. The information could also save the aviation industry millions of pounds, by helping to keep planes in the air after an eruption.  To do that, the satellite needs to withstand the hostile environment of space, including extreme vibrations during launch, a vacuum, and temperatures ranging from extremely hot on its Sun-facing side to extremely cold on its space-facing side.  Over the past month, eight students have been at the ESA’s CubeSat Support Facility in Transinne, Belgium, which has facilities to simulate the harsh conditions.  The 20x10x10cm payload has an ultra-high definition camera and an infrared camera, which the team said will be capable of tracking and modelling ash clouds in ways that have not been tried before. At the ESA, it was shaken with violent vibrations before being plunged into a thermal vacuum chamber and subjected to extremes of temperature and pressure.  Project manager and aerospace engineering student Tom Snelling said: “I always wanted to be involved in the space industry, but I never dreamt I could be testing at the European Space Agency as a student.  “Being on the project totally changes students. You have undergraduates joining and within a year they are coding satellites and getting real industry experience – it’s really impressive what they can do.”  Testing on the satellite is ongoing before launch.  Professor Lucy Berthoud, professor of space systems engineering at the University of Bristol, said: ""Few UK universities build satellites, this payload is really ambitious. If it’s successful it will revolutionise our understanding of ash clouds.  “To do this, the students have been learning hands-on skills to build and test a satellite, which will equip them well for positions in the space industry when they finish.""

The cash-strapped nation of over 220 million people will have no other option but to ask China for devising a mechanism to bail out the ailing economy, The News reported. “Amid deepening political and economic crisis in the country, the IMF has adopted a wait and see policy but this cannot be pursued for a longer period,” sources said.  “Either the IMF programme will have to be revived through the completion of the ninth review or the programme will be scrapped. We will share no more data with the IMF without completion of the ninth review,” they added.  Several reports suggest that Pakistan has already conveyed to the IMF staff to conclude the review otherwise budgetary framework for 2023-24 would not be shared, The News reported.  The sources recalled that an ambassador of the western capital, during interactions with a minister inquired when the economy of Pakistan was expected to be in meltdown. “This blunt question from the dignitary shocked the minister who told the visiting diplomat that Pakistan would never default,” the sources narrated.  It should be noted that the diplomatic community also has started inquiring about “domestic political affairs”.  Keeping in view all these developments, independent economists are now suggesting the government make last-ditch efforts in order to revive the IMF programme or clearly look towards China to bailout the struggling economy, The News reported.  Former Finance minister and renowned economist Hafiz A Pasha said that if the IMF doesn’t move forward, then Pakistan would have no other option but to request China to devise any mechanism for helping Islamabad to avert blown out of a full fledge crisis.IANS  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFobWVkYWJhZG1pcnJvci5jb20vcGFrLW1heS1zZWVrLWNoaW5hcy1haWQtdG8tYmFpbC1vdXQtaXRzLWVjb25vbXkvODE4NTY1MzQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Davie"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:57:53","Simmons 5 for 5 in Game 1 Published 1:54 pm Tuesday, May 16, 2023  By Brian Pitts  Enterprise Record  After a grueling stretch in which Davie’s baseball team lost 5-4 to Glenn, won 5-4 over East Forsyth and lost 5-4 to West Forsyth, the War Eagles were able to enjoy a relatively stress-free game in the first round of the 4-A playoffs.  Davie crushed the ball all over the place, Parker Simmons and Davin Whitaker had monster games and the War Eagles blew out Ragsdale, 12-1, on the road on May 9.  Davie, the 18th seed in the West Region, won its first playoff game since 2019 and improved to 15-10. The 15th-seeded Tigers closed shop at 18-7 after finishing second in the eight-team Metro Conference.  “We played good defense, we threw strikes and we passed the baton to the next guy,” coach Joey Anderson said. “We weren’t swinging for the fences.”  Offensively, the War Eagles did all the damage they needed in the top of the second inning. After Drew Krause and Ty Miller reached, Coy James mashed a triple. Two pitches later, Simmons singled. Then D. Whitaker made it three straight hits as Davie surged to a 4-0 lead.  They put up a twice-as-big crooked number in the seventh to break Ragsdale’s back. A Simmons single ignited a six-hit, eight-run eruption. Whitaker (double), MJ Jacobs and Jackson Sink kept the merry-go-round going with hits. It really got out of hand when Simmons got his second hit of the inning, a three-run double. As if that wasn’t enough, D. Whitaker capped it off with a triple as Davie’s lead mushroomed to 12-1.  Simmons and D. Whitaker went absolutely bonkers. The former went 5 for 5 with three runs and four RBIs in the two hole. The latter went 4-5 in the three hole.  Simmons distinguished himself by hitting .322 last year as a junior, but he struggled badly at the beginning of 2023. Batting anywhere from seventh to ninth in the first six games, he started 0 for 13. He moved up to the two hole for the March 16 home game against East Forsyth, a 5-1 win, and he made Anderson look like a genius. In the 19 games between March 16 and Ragsdale, Simmons hit .379 (22 for 58). At Ragsdale, his average soared from .257 to .309.  Wait, there’s more. Simmons’ 5-for-5 work in the first rounder was the Davie’s first five-hit performance between 1999-2023, a span of 574 games.  “We’ve been watching him grow year by year,” Anderson said. “He struggled a little bit early. When you see a D-I guy as many times as we do, you’re not going to have a Coy James batting average. He’s worked hard and he’s stepped up.”  “Being my senior year, I was frustrated with getting off to a slow start,” Simmons said. “I wasn’t seeing the ball well and wasn’t finding the barrel. Nothing was really working for me.  “It all kind of changed when coach Joey moved me into the two hole against East Forsyth,” Simmons continued. “I was confused about why he moved me to the two hole, but batting me between Coy and Davin has worked out for us. I’m thankful it’s picked up, especially at this time in the playoffs.”  Interestingly enough, the seventh-inning double was Simmons’ first extra-base hit in two years; his other 40 hits were singles.  “I got fastballs all night, so I was expecting a curveball or something offspeed,” Simmons said. “I sat curveball, I guessed right and I hit a double to left-center.”  D. Whitaker was slow out of the gate as well. After seven games, he was at .166 (3 for 18). What’s he hitting since then? How about .442 over 18 games (23 for 52). For the season, the senior left Ragsdale at .371 with a .900 slugging percentage and a .494 on-base percentage.  “Those (five) seniors have stepped up,” Anderson said.  “Davin’s really hard on himself in practice, but in the games it shows he works a lot because he’s been in a groove,” Simmons said. “I mean there’s nobody that can throw it by him.”  “I was squaring balls up and they were going straight to people (in the first seven games),” D. Whitaker said. “But that’s baseball. I’m making a team swing and not a me swing. Earlier in the year, I was going up there for me. The more you focus on the team, the better the outcome is.”  Meanwhile, Braeden Rodgers showed impressive poise on the mound when the Tigers had a chance to make noise in the fifth. The score was 4-1 and they had runners at the corners with no outs. Rodgers fielded a dribbler back to the mound, faked a throw to second and quickly spun around. He had the runner from third in a pickle. He threw to third baseman Brady Marshall and Marshall threw to catcher Krause for a 1-5-2 out. With runners at first and third and one out, Rodgers snared a liner and doubled up the runner at third to end the threat.  “The turning point in the game was (the bottom of the fifth),” Anderson said. “You saw the air go out of Ragsdale at that point.”  Rodgers threw six strong innings. The only run was unearned as he walked two and struck out eight. He ran his record to 6-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.90.  “That dynamic duo has kept us in games,” Anderson said of Rodgers and Jaydon Holder.  Reliever Connor Berg added the exclamation point in the bottom of the seventh. The junior missed an immaculate inning by a hair, striking out three batters on 10 pitches. The first batter he faced: strike swinging, strike looking, strike swinging. The second batter: strike looking, strike swinging, foul ball, strike swinging. The third batter: strike looking, foul ball, strike swinging. The same result in nine pitches would have qualified for the extremely rare immaculate inning.  “Connor was locked in,” Anderson said. “(Joey) Cress told him to attack and that’s what he did. He’s accepted that (relief) role and there’s a chance that he can pitch every game.”  Notes: James had a routine night by going 2 for 4 with his fifth triple. Here are his glittering numbers for the season: .460 average, .828 slugging percentage, .559 on-base percentage. He has 17 extra-base hits among his 35 total hits, and he has 17 walks/hit by pitches. … Sink went 2 for 4 as Davie outhit Ragsdale 15-6. … In the other first-round games involving the Central Piedmont Conference, No. 8 Hopewell beat No. 25 Glenn 4-3, No. 14 West Forsyth beat No. 19 Charlotte Catholic 5-4, No. 10 Reagan beat No. 23 South Mecklenburg 1-0 and No. 2 East Forsyth beat No. 31 Olympic 8-3.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cmRhdmllLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3NpbW1vbnMtNS1mb3ItNS1pbi1nYW1lLTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The island itself may be small, but there’s no shortage of activities to enjoy.  This island, like its sister islands, was created by a volcanic eruption approximately seven million years ago. The main island is surrounded by several islets that host many of the best resorts.  The locals principally speak Tahitian and French, but some speak English, especially in hospitality. The mantra here is “aita pea pea,” meaning “not to worry.”  Once you arrive at Faa’a International Airport in Tahiti, take a 45-minute flight to Bora Bora, and you’re in paradise. All you have to decide is how much—or how little—you’ll do.  Check Out World Class Beaches  You can’t visit any island without setting aside time for the beach.  Matira Beach, a public stretch of sand, is celebrated for its crystal-clear waters. It’s on the southern shore of Bora Bora, and if you’re coming from the city of Vaitape, you can bike or take a taxi.  One visitor suggests, “If you choose to drive to Matira Beach, you can find parking spaces near the InterContinental Bora Bora Le Moana Resort.”  Aside from swimming, you can snorkel or book a jet ski. Go on your own jet ski adventure (within limits, of course), or take a guided jet ski tour.  When conditions are ideal, you can sign up for kite surfing lessons. Lastly, there are snack bars, restaurants and boutique shops to explore.  The other top beaches are mostly linked to resorts such as Le Meridien Bora Bora and Conrad Bora Bora Nui, among others.  Eat, Eat, Eat!  Whether you just want a snack or a five-star meal, you’ll find it all in Bora Bora.  Visitors recommend trying the fish, as it is the freshest they’ve ever tasted. One former guest wrote, “Go for ocean fish, rather than lagoon fish. Poisson Cru is a favorite Polynesian dish of tuna marinated in lime and coconut. It’s delicious and healthy.”  The resorts have plenty of restaurants, but try to support the local eateries when possible.  Story continues  Surf’s Up  As far as surf spots go, there’s Teavanui Pass, which you’ll have to access by boat. The second is Motu Piti Aau. Whichever you choose, you’ll definitely want to have an experienced guide on hand.  So, when is the best time to surf? The Surf Atlas suggests March, April, May and June—the dry season months. The publication, which offers surf reviews, writes, “This is high time for big SW groundswells in the South Seas, which is precisely what you need to filter through the reefs around Teavanui Pass.”  However, within French Polynesia, some surfers say that Tahiti offers better surfing than Bora Bora. You be the judge.  Hiking and Mountain Climbing  In addition to water, snacks and sunscreen, make sure you have your camera with you during your hike. And a guide—that’s the most important part.  Mount Otemanu is the highest point on the island at approximately 2,400 feet above sea level. Like the Pitons of St. Lucia, it can add drama to your photos.  Please note that you won’t be able to reach the summit. However, Viator notes, “Experienced hikers can explore the base of the mountain in the company of a guide, and you can also explore the lower parts of the mountain in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle or see it from above on a helicopter tour.”  If you want to climb a mountain, try Otemanu’s sibling: Mount Pahia. You’ll not only earn bragging rights once you’ve reached the top, but you’ll enjoy jaw-dropping views. Again, make sure you have that camera!  If proper hikes and mountain climbing sound too strenuous, a long, head-clearing walk on the beach is always an option.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdGhpbmdzLWJvcmEtYm9yYS0wMDA3MDY2NTMuaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC90aGluZ3MtYm9yYS1ib3JhLTAwMDcwNjY1My5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Residents of Khartoum have endured weeks of desperate food shortages, power blackouts, communications outages and runaway inflation. Before the fighting erupted on April 15, the city of five million was considered a place of relative stability, but now shelling and air attacks are witnessed frequently.  Charred aircraft lie on the airport tarmac, foreign embassies are shuttered and hospitals, banks, shops and wheat silos have been ransacked by looters.  Violence also renewed in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, leaving hundreds killed and the health system in “total collapse”, medics said.  Fighting continued on Monday, with loud explosions heard across Khartoum and thick smoke in the sky while warplanes drew anti-aircraft fire, according to witnesses.  “The situation is becoming worse by the day,” said a 37-year-old resident of southern Khartoum who did not wish to be named because of safety concerns.  “People are getting more and more scared because the two sides … are becoming more and more violent.”  Another witness reported “clashes with various types of weapons” in Omdurman, the capital’s twin city.  Nearly a million people have been displaced by the conflict, many of them taking shelter in Port Sudan about 850 kilometres (500 miles) away.  The United Nations says more than 700,000 people have been internally displaced by the fighting, and nearly 200,000 have fled Sudan for neighbouring countries.  There are fears for the stability of the wider region.  “We’re left on the street, in the sun,” complained Hamden Mohammed, who escaped the Khartoum area for Port Sudan. “We want the organisations to evacuate us from Sudan, because the country is totally devastated. There’s no food, no work … nothing.”  About 1,000 people have been killed, mainly in and around Khartoum as well as the ravaged state of West Darfur, according to medics.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZ2FsbGVyeS8yMDIzLzUvMTYvcGhvdG9zLXN1ZGFuZXNlLWNhcGl0YWwtZGV2YXN0YXRlZC1ieS1hLW1vbnRoLW9mLWJydXRhbC1maWdodGluZ9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2dhbGxlcnkvMjAyMy81LzE2L3Bob3Rvcy1zdWRhbmVzZS1jYXBpdGFsLWRldmFzdGF0ZWQtYnktYS1tb250aC1vZi1icnV0YWwtZmlnaHRpbmc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2019-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Home"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:39:12","The shipment of Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, the longest-range weapons yet received by Kiev, confirms the UK’s role as provocateur-in-chief in the NATO war against Russia.  The Ukrainian army is now not only capable of striking Crimea—Russia’s central concern in the war—but deep into the Russian mainland. It takes delivery of these weapons on the eve of a long-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian lines.  In these circumstances, all that has prevented a direct war breaking out between Britain and Russia is the Kremlin’s restraint, fearing the triggering of NATO’s collective defence clause.  At every stage of the war, Britain has led NATO’s escalation. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced last week that the war in Ukraine “didn’t start in 2022. The war started in 2014.” This dates the beginning of NATO’s “biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War” to the Maidan coup sponsored by the US and European powers to instal an anti-Russian regime in Kiev.  The events led to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the eruption of civil war in Ukraine over the breakaway of regions in the East. The situation was formally addressed by the Minsk Agreements which were portrayed as a peace effort. Last December, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that this was only a cover “to give Ukraine time… to become stronger.”  From that point, British imperialism was central in carrying out a joint programme of training and equipping the Ukrainian army while staging repeated anti-Russian provocations—most notably the 2019 allegations that Moscow had poisoned double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with novichok.  The UK’s war preparations  Under Operation Orbital, begun in 2015, Britain had already trained 22,000 Ukrainian troops in the seven years before the Russian invasion. It has since trained a further 14,000. In the lead up to the war, thousands of British soldiers were deployed in Eastern Europe on permanent missions or for large-scale NATO combat exercises.

[AP Photo/Frank Augstein]  The UK played a central role in NATO’s aggressive posturing from the Baltic to the Black Sea. In June 2021, a British warship entered waters claimed by Russia near Crimea, in an incident that nearly resulted in a direct exchange of fire between UK and Russian forces.  The UK’s actions have been accompanied by statements from leading military and political figures making clear Britain’s hostile intentions towards Russia.  In 2016, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Parliament’s Defence Select Committee that the UK would be ready for war with Russia by 2018. That year, Chief of the General Staff Sir Nick Carter declared that this included “project[ing] land capability over distances of up to some 2,000 km… copying what the Germans did very well in 1940”. Carter was referring to the preparation by Nazi Germany for Operation Barbarossa—the 1941 war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, recognised as the most brutal military campaign history has ever seen.  The 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy warned of the acute threat posed by Russia, as well as China, Iran and North Korea, and centred on increasing nuclear warhead capacity by 40 percent. In “Defence in a Competitive Age” the Ministry of Defence described Russia as “the greatest nuclear, conventional military and sub-threshold threat to European security.”  After the Ukraine war broke out in February 2022, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK was taking measures “to bring down the Putin regime.” New army chief General Patrick Sanders declared that the “British Army must be prepared to engage in warfare at its most violent.”  The Integrated Review Refresh 2023 is introduced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak with the declaration, “What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine.”  Integrated Review Refresh 2023 [Photo: Open Government Licence v3.0]  Britain supplied £2.3 billion of military assistance to Ukraine in 2022, with a commitment to match that figure in 2023. Thousands of UK troops have been dispatched to Eastern Europe to participate in NATO exercises involving tens of thousands of soldiers and advanced weaponry. UK special forces troops have been deployed to Ukraine, as confirmed in leaked Pentagon files.  Russia has also accused Britain of covertly sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipeline.  The UK’s main public role since the outbreak of war has been as an outrider for the US and European NATO powers, being the first to supply Ukraine new classes of weaponry. Prior to the provision of long-range missiles, Britain also led the way with the supply of main battle tanks, sending a squadron of Challenger IIs. This was followed by Germany sending Leopard tanks and allowing other countries to send those in their armouries. The US then agreed a shipment of Abrams tanks.  Just days after confirming shipment of the Storm Shadows, now also agreed to by France, the UK used a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to declare a “jets coalition” aimed at securing modern F-16 fighter jets for Ukraine.  The crisis of British imperialism  Britain’s leading role in the war, outstripping to this point France and Germany, is paradoxically driven by its economic and geopolitical weakness, which it has sought to offset through a “special relationship” with the United States.  In its 2022 Congress resolution, “Mobilise the working class against imperialist war”, the Socialist Equality Party (UK) answered the lie that the war in Ukraine was the result of a supposedly unprovoked invasion by Russia, explaining, “The war against Russia is the continuation and intensification of the drive for US global hegemony that was initiated with the first invasion of Iraq in 1990-91 and intensified following the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991,” including wars and interventions against Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq again, Libya and Syria.  It continued:  “British imperialism participated as a chief partner in every one of these bloodbaths. The UK has long acted as Washington’s foremost ally in Europe. But since Brexit this alliance has assumed an ever more essential imperative in British imperialism’s efforts to project its global interests. Opposed by Washington, Brexit lost the UK its place within the European Union as the foremost advocate of US interests in the continent, especially in opposing German and French efforts to build a European military capability independent of NATO. This has necessitated a redoubling of London’s efforts to prove its usefulness to the White House and the Pentagon. British imperialism, amid an unprecedented collapse in its world standing, is cleaving as close to the US as possible in the hope of a share of the spoils.”  Anglo-Russian enmity and anti-communism  There are deeper historical interests and old scores involved. Relations between Russia and Britain have been hostile for centuries, despite significant periodic alliances championing European reaction, including during the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802) waged with the political aim of combating the spread of republicanism from France.  Anti-Russian sentiment was fuelled most acutely by the Crimean War (1853–1856), when Britain and France backed the Ottoman Empire in defeating Russia, and was deepened during the “Great Game” conflict over control of Central Asia in the latter part of the nineteenth century.  Britain and Russia found themselves in alliance with France in the Triple Entente (1907) only due to the enormous geostrategic threat posed to British by German imperialism, leading up to the eruption of the First World War in 1914.  Polish, British and French officers inspecting a detachment of Polish troops of so-called Murmansk Battalion before their departure for the front, Archangelsk 1919. [Photo: This image was created and released by the Imperial War Museum on the IWM Non Commercial Licence]  The most significant cause of Anglo-Russian enmity in the 20th century was the October 1917 Revolution, led by Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks. The seizure of power by the Russian working class in the world’s first socialist overturn of capitalism was viewed as a mortal threat by the British and international bourgeoisie. Britain led the allied armies of counter-revolutionary intervention (March 1918-October 1919) and supplied more than half the troops involved from Britain, the US, Italy, Serbia, Canada and France. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the class struggle in Britain, above all during the 1926 General Strike, and the ever-present threat of socialist revolution fed into the ferocious anti-Russian sentiment within ruling circles.  The re-eruption of German militarism and imperial ambitions in the Second World War pushed Britain under Winston Churchill into an alliance with the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. But as soon as the war was concluded the old enmities re-emerged with force.  Churchill, who gifted the world with the term “the Iron Curtain” at a speech in Fulton, Missouri in March 1946, had urged Washington to continue the war after 1945 against the USSR. “Operation Unthinkable” centred on a proposed July 1, 1945 assault by British, American, Polish and German Nazi forces against the Red Army. It was never implemented because the US was focused on the war against Japan, while Churchill was driven from office in the July 1945 general election that swept Labour to power.  Churchill in the Roman amphitheatre of ancient Carthage to address 3,000 British and American troops, June 1943 [Photo: Unknown author - Unknown source]  While leader of the opposition, Churchill met with former-US army officer Julius Ochs Adler on April 29, 1951, at the height of the Korean War, where he proposed that an ultimatum be delivered to Stalin once he was again prime minister, threatening to “atom bomb one of 20 or 30 cities”, to be followed by “if necessary, additional ones.”  Putin’s nationalist regime emerged out of the restoration of capitalism in 1991, the culmination of the Stalinist counter-revolution against October and the perspective of world socialist revolution on which it was based. Nevertheless, despite the entirely opposed nature of Putin’s government of capitalist oligarchs to Bolshevism, it is impossible to fully appreciate the extent of the UK’s hostility to Russia outside of the historic legacy of anti-communism and bitterness towards the Russian Revolution’s inspiration of anti-colonial struggles in which the British ruling class has been steeped from birth. It is an impulse ultimately rooted in class antagonisms; a hatred of the working class and socialism, shared by the upper middle class, felt so deeply that it is driving the ruling elite to contemplate war with a nuclear power that could end human civilisation.  Labour and the Tories: A single party of war  With Britain being dragged to the precipice of war with Russia, there has been no popular discussion of the consequences thanks above all to the unanimity between the Tories and the Labour Party. Sir Keir Starmer leads one half of a single, joint party of war sitting across both sides of the House of Commons.  At its latest conference, Labour delegates passed a motion submitted by the GMB trade union calling on the party to support the provision of military, economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, for the party to back an increase in funding for UK defence manufacturing, and supporting a long-term strategy to “tackle Putin and dictators around the world” and for the party to back an increase in funding for UK defence manufacturing.  Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour Party makes his speech at the party's annual conference in Liverpool, England, September 27, 2022. [AP Photo/Jon Super]  Labour’s shadow foreign and defence secretaries David Lammy and John Healey have written in Foreign Policy magazine, “The next Labour government will ensure Britain is NATO’s leading European nation. We would apply a ‘NATO test’ to major defense projects within our first 100 days to ensure we are on track to fulfil our obligations to the alliance in full and review any capability gaps.”  These warmongers were handed leadership of the Labour Party by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to block a move by the membership to kick out the Blairites while he was in charge. The Corbynites have since either fallen silent on the war in Ukraine or, like his shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have lined up behind British imperialism and NATO.  War and the class struggle  The UK is above all driven on the path of war by acute social tensions and an eruption of class struggle at home.  Britain’s economic crisis and striving for global position dictates a brutal offensive against the working class, slashing wages, imposing speed ups and destroying social services under conditions of the worst cost-of-living crisis since the Second World War. In turn, militarism and war demands ever more draconian attacks, with the Royal United Services Institute hailing “the end of the peace dividend” such that Britain’s military spending must be prioritised over the “growing share of its national income devoted to the NHS and state pensions”.  The SEP’s 2022 Congress resolution noted:  “The catastrophic impact falls upon a society already torn by extreme levels of social inequality and widespread deprivation. Faced with a growing oppositional movement in the working class, the British ruling class is turning to war as a means of enforcing a false ‘national unity,’ with repeated calls for sacrifice from the government to justify massive hikes on the price of fuel, food and other essentials.”  The result has been a strike wave ongoing since last summer, with more than 2.8 million days lost during the winter months, the highest in three decades, and more than half a million in March alone. Sabotage and betrayals by the trade union bureaucracy of the fight by NHS, education, postal and rail workers have been vital in policing opposition, at the cost of undermining the union leaders in the eyes of millions. But the government is moving to ever more naked state repression, exemplified by the new anti-strike Minimum Services Levels Bill, set to become law on May 22.  Striking rail workers picketing during the UK wide national rail strike at the Cowlairs maintenance depot in Springburn, north Glasgow, June 25, 2022 [Photo: WSWS]  The war policy of British imperialism finds its only opposition in the working class, whose lives are being ruined and who face the prospect of death on an unimaginable scale.  But, as the SEP’s 2022 resolution warned:  “While there is enormous opposition to war among British workers, this opposition lacks a programme, perspective and leadership. The task of the Socialist Equality Party is to develop within the working class and its vanguard an understanding of the inextricable connection between war abroad and exploitation and repression at home, and in this process build a revolutionary leadership in the working class”.  Only with this perspective can workers and young people internationally fight to bring the madness of war with Russia to an end.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaWR1dS1tMTYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This flyby will mark the closest encounter with Io to date, with Juno passing at an altitude of approximately 22,060 miles (35,500 kilometres). As Juno enters the third year of its extended mission to explore Jupiter’s interior, it will also venture into the ring system where several of the gas giant’s inner moons reside.  With 50 previous flybys of Jupiter under its belt, Juno has already collected valuable data during close encounters with three of Jupiter’s four Galilean moons: Europa, Ganymede, and now fiery Io. Io is known as the most volcanic celestial body in our solar system, making it an intriguing target for scientific study. By observing Io over multiple passes, scientists hope to gain insights into the behaviour of its volcanoes, including eruption frequency, brightness, temperature, and the evolving shape of its lava flows.  - Advertisement -  Scott Bolton, the Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, emphasizes the significance of studying Io over time: “We may observe it over time on several passes to see how the volcanoes evolve, including how frequently they erupt, how bright and hot they are, whether or not they are connected to a group or erupt on their own, and whether or not the shape of the lava flow changes.”  Io, slightly larger than Earth’s moon, experiences constant gravitational pulls from both Jupiter and its neighbouring moons, Europa and Ganymede. These gravitational forces subject Io to continuous stretching and squeezing, contributing to the frequent volcanic eruptions observed on its surface.  - Advertisement -  While Juno’s primary mission focuses on studying Jupiter, its advanced sensors, including JunoCam, JIRAM (Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper), SRU (Stellar Reference Unit), and MWR (Microwave Radiometer), have provided a wealth of data on Jupiter’s moons. During this flyby, these instruments will specifically investigate Io’s volcanoes to understand how volcanic activity interacts with Jupiter’s powerful magnetosphere and auroras.  Scott Bolton further reveals Juno’s future plans for Io: “Before our twin flyby rendezvous with Io in December this year and February next year, when we fly within 1,500 km of the surface, we will be even closer thanks to our future flybys in July and October. Each of these flybys offers awe-inspiring images of this incredible moon’s volcanic activity. It should be incredible data.”  - Advertisement -  Juno has spent over 2,505 Earth days orbiting Jupiter and has travelled more than 510 million miles (820 million kilometres). Since its arrival at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, the spacecraft has continuously expanded our understanding of the gas giant. Juno’s recent flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021, reduced its orbital period to 43 days. Subsequent flybys of Europa and Io will further refine the spacecraft’s orbit, eventually settling at a fixed 32-day orbital period.  Matthew Johnson, Juno’s acting project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, highlights the mission’s broader scope: “Io is only one of the celestial bodies that Juno is continuing to study throughout this long journey. In addition to continuously altering its orbit to provide new views of Jupiter and flying close to the planet’s nightside, the spacecraft will thread a needle between some of Jupiter’s rings to gain further insight into their formation and makeup.”  NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission on behalf of the principal investigator, Scott J. Bolton, from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, overseen by the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington and managed at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The spacecraft was constructed and is operated by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver.  As Juno inches closer to Io, scientists eagerly await the treasure trove of data that will shed light on the mysteries of this volcanic moon and deepen our understanding of Jupiter’s complex system.

With the regular-season schedule revealed last week and today’s announcement, we can’t wait for the 2023 season to kick off.”  The game will be a Wild Card playoff game in prime time on Saturday, January 13, 2024. The Peacock exclusive Wild Card game will immediately follow a late afternoon NFL Wild Card playoff game on NBC and Peacock (4:30 p.m. ET on Sat. Jan. 13).  The National Football League’s move to provide more exclusive game rights to streaming services continued yesterday with the league announcing that Peacock this season will host the first-ever exclusive live streamed NFL Playoff game.  “We are excited to work with a great partner in Peacock to present the first-ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game this upcoming season,” added Hans Schroeder, NFL’s executive vice president and chief operating officer of NFL Media. “Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League, and bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  The NFL has indeed expanded the digital distribution of ‘NFL content’ over the last 18 months. Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service is now the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football games; Peacock this season will host one exclusive regular season game (December 23 between the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Chargers); and ESPN+ will have another exclusive regular season game on October 1 from London between Jacksonville and Atlanta.  Plus, the NFL last December awarded Google the exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket after being carried exclusively by DIRECTV for 28 years.  The online-only games will be available on local stations in the markets where the teams play as well as the NFL+ mobile service. But some fans on social media yesterday expressed their disappointment that they will have to subscribe to multiple services to watch all the games, particularly a playoff contest.  “Greed over access. No value to fans. This is mostly to help the mediocre Peacock streaming service,” tweeted ‘Dean Lamb.’  “If anyone puts a Ravens playoff game on Peacock I’ll lose it,” added ‘JReynolds.’  “Wait, does this mean we will have to pay for Peacock to watch this playoff game!??

Remarkably, it’s active and can still be seen oozing a flurry of mud, liquid, and gas. By studying this newly found volcano and its spewed contents, scientists believe they might be able to catch some insights into the mysteries of Earth’s interior.  Named Borealis Mud Volcano, researchers from the University of Tromsø (UiT) – The Arctic University of Norway identified the volcano earlier this month at a depth of 400 meters (1,312 feet) in the Barents Sea, located above the northern coast of Norway.  Advertisement Advertisement  In collaboration with REV Ocean, it was discovered with the help of a remote-controlled underwater vessel, named ROV Aurora, which was launched from the icebreaking polar research vessel RV Kronprins Haakon.  It’s just the second time a mud volcano has been discovered in the waters of Norway – and scientists are pretty excited.  “Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how ‘alive’ our planet is,” Professor Giuliana Panieri, expedition leader and principal researcher for the UiT project, said in a statement.  “We do not rule out the possibility of discovering other mud volcanoes in the Barents Sea. It is only thanks to good cooperation and advanced technology that we can make such discoveries,” continued Panieri.  Advertisement Advertisement  The volcano is just 7 meters (22 feet) in diameter and 2.5 meters (8 feet) in height, located within a crater that is approximately 300 meters (984 feet) wide and 25 meters (82 feet) deep. It’s thought this crater was the result of a blast of methane that erupted shortly after the last Ice Age 18,000 years ago.  It may be small, but it’s a mighty one. The volcano spews out a cocktail of water, gas, and fine sediments that likely originate several hundred meters to a few kilometers beneath the seabed. As such, the researchers say the composition of this slurry could offer a “direct window” into the depths of Earth’s interior.  The submarine volcano is home to a unique ecosystem that includes sea anemones, sponges, carnivorous sponges, starfish, corals, sea spiders, and crustaceans, not to mention a host of bacteria.  “Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane insights is like finding hidden treasures. It is full of surprises. We have found thousands of such insights. Nevertheless, every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such insight systems,” explained Professor Stefan Buenz, who worked on the project.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlmbHNjaWVuY2UuY29tL25ldy12b2xjYW5vLWhhcy1iZWVuLWZvdW5kLWZsaW5naW5nLWRlYnJpcy1mcm9tLWVhcnRocy1pbnNpZGVzLTY4OTUy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The federal agency identified the women as Patient A and Patient B and said New York City health officials were notified of the cases on February 28, 2023.  ""Patient A, a woman aged 28 years, developed a widespread pruritic eruption during summer 2021.

""Patient B, a woman aged 47 years with no major medical conditions, developed a widespread, pruritic eruption in summer 2022 while in Bangladesh,"" the agency continued. ""There, she received treatment with topical antifungal and steroid combination creams and noted that several family members were experiencing similar eruptions. After returning to the United States, she visited an emergency department three times during autumn 2022.""  Ringworm is a common and very contagious infection of the skin caused by fungi.

These geological formations are proof of how dangerous but alluring nature can be. And you don’t even have to leave the country to witness these rocky marvels! India has a total of seven volcanoes, one of which is still active. Five of these are either dormant or extinct, and one is a mud volcano. Here are seven volcanoes that you’ll find in India!  1. Barren Island, Andaman Islands  Located on the Andaman Islands, this is the only active volcano in India. The latest eruption at the volcano was on the 2nd of May, this year. During the eruption, hot ash was spewed which spread 4.6 kilometres wide.  2. Baratang Island, Andaman Islands  This is an active mud volcano. A mud volcano is a landform which is created when slurry, mud, is spewed to the surface along with gas. It doesn’t spew lava like regular volcanoes. In other parts of the world, people enjoy mud baths at some mud volcanoes.  3. Narcondam Volcano, Andaman Islands  Another volcano in the Andaman Islands, it is classified by the Geological Survey of India as a dormant volcano. Regardless, the place still witnesses a high number of footfall each year.  Also Read: This Man Becomes The First To Skydive In & Out Of An Active Volcano; Breaks Records  4. Dhosi Hill, Haryana  Dhosi Hill in Haryana is an important site from the Vedic period. It is an extinct volcano and people love visiting it every year. In case you were wondering, the difference between a dormant volcano and an extinct volcano is that it is unlikely that an extinct volcano will erupt in the future. However, dormant volcanoes are just those that haven’t erupted for a long time but may still erupt in the future.  5. Tosham Hill, Haryana  This particular volcano is one of the extinct volcanoes in the country. Given that the volcano existed a long time ago, the ring of the volcano is now buried under the soil of the later years.  6. Loktak Lake, Manipur  One of the most beautiful lakes in the country, and possibly in the world, Loktak Lake is a volcanic caldera. A caldera is a depression formed after the emptying of the magma chambers. The Loktak Lake is uniquely is formed and is a sight to behold.  7. Dhinodhar Hills, Gujarat  Another extinct volcano, this relic of a bygone era is definitely worth visiting. You can still see its volcanic plug. The plug or the neck is formed when the magma hardens in the vent of an active volcano.

Skeletons found in Pompeii ruins reveal deaths by earthquake, not just Vesuvius’ ancient eruption  MILAN (AP) — Archeologists in Pompeii have discovered two skeletons that they believe were men who died when a wall collapsed on them during the powerful earthquakes that accompanied the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Experts said Tuesday that the find underlines that many of the dead in the ancient city were due to powerful quakes that accompanied the eruption and not just victims of the volcano’s deadly ash and gas. The two skeletons were found in the House of Chaste Lovers beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The director of the Pompeii archaeological site said new techniques are allowing experts to determine the dynamics of deaths down to the final seconds.

The two men are believed to have died in an earthquake that accompanied the eruption of Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago, before the onslaught of lava and volcanic ash pouring from the volcano buried the city for good.  ""The discovery of the remains of these two Pompeians in the context of the construction site in the Insula of the Chaste Lovers shows how much there is still to discover about the terrible eruption of AD 79,"" Italian Minister of Culture Gennaro Sangiuliano said in a statement.  The two skeletons were uncovered during the excavation of a block of houses known as the Insula of the Chaste Lovers. Their bodies were found along one side of a utility room, buried beneath a collapsed wall. One of the men had raised his arm against the rubble, in an apparent vain attempt to protect himself from the falling stone.  After further examination, it became clear that the two individuals had likely died as a result of multiple traumas caused by the partial collapse of the building.  © Parco Archeologico di Pompei The two skeletons were found crushed beneath a collapse wall in the ruins of Pompeii. The two skeletons were found crushed beneath a collapse wall in the ruins of Pompeii. Parco Archeologico di Pompei  The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed Pompeii in just over 24 hours, killing an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the city's population. The area was smothered in volcanic ash, which buried the Roman city for centuries.  The ruined city lay unseen and untouched until it was rediscovered in 1748 by a surveying engineer. Together with accounts from the time by Pliny the Younger, archaeologists have been able to piece together a rough timeline of the eruption, as well as a snapshot into Roman life.

The bones, now mixed with fragments of the crumbled wall, exhibit various fractures, indicating the intensity of the collapse that claimed their lives.  Zuchtriegel emphasised that the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which occurred in 79 A.D., was a calamity that spanned a staggering 20 hours, accompanied by relentless earthquakes.  Only today we have the possibility to study the exact dynamic in which they died with micro stratigraphy.  ""The eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. lasted over 20 hours.

Kayla Nelson, 23, had only been taking Lamotrigine, a drug meant to help treat her depression and anxiety, for three weeks when she first noticed the symptoms that brought her to the emergency room on May 4.  Two weeks later, Nelson is still in the University of Utah Burn Center after being diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare, serious disorder that causes the skin to burn from the inside out and could leave her blind.  Not only is the once active woman in extreme pain that has kept her constrained to a hospital bed with a feeding tube, she has undergone surgery on her eyelids to stop the risk of losing her of vision - and is suffering from panic attacks about what happens next, her family said.  Nelson is expected to be in the burn unit for several weeks, where she is being treated for severe burn-like reactions on 30 percent of her body. She also faces weeks of physical and mental therapy before she is able to work again.

'It's a lot on a 23-year-old because she's just getting going with her life,' Ewing said. 'She has her life in front of her but now we have to deal with this, just because she wanted to get her mental health stabilized.'  Ewing said that while she is grateful for how the medication has helped some with their mental health, she still wants to warn others about the potential risks associated with this medication.  'Why have this chance of a family member or a friend or anyone go through this,' she asked. She added that her daughter's doctor did advise patients to stop taking the drug immediately if they notice a rash.  The National Library of Medicine describes the syndrome as 'a rare, acute, serious, and potentially fatal skin reaction' in which the skin detaches from the body in painful blisters and rashes on the inside and surface of the body.

The disease starts as a small rash, and develops into blisters, and the blisters begin to peel, leaving her with exposed tissue, and a high likelihood of infections, not to mention unimaginable pain.'  In the latest updates, on May 11 and may 12, the GoFundMe revealed that Nelson suffered a panic attack the night before she underwent eye surgery due to loss of skin on the inside of her eyelids.  'To stop the risk of injuring her eyes and loss of vision, they are going in and putting synthetic skin underneath her eyelids,' the GoFundMe said.  An update revealed that Nelson had 'received a graft of placental tissue in each of her eyes, due to the damage that has been caused in her eyelids, as a measure to keep her vision protected.'  'She wasn’t excited, but her Mother and Father gave her the comfort and reassurance that she needed to be strong and power through it,' her friend wrote in the GoFundMe update.  'The operation was very successful, and she was already looking around and pointing things out in her room, almost immediately after surgery!

"eruption","0079-08-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 14:08:52","Archaeologists at Pompeii said Tuesday that they had uncovered two new skeletons of male victims who likely died in an earthquake that accompanied the devastating volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which buried the Italian city in ash in AD 79.  The pair, believed to be two males aged at least 55, were found in recent excavations at Pompeii’s “Chaste Lovers” block of buildings.  They are believed to have been killed as an earthquake knocked down a wall in the room where they sought shelter. One of the skeletons had an arm raised as if in defence.  The earthquake struck as the huge blast from nearby Mount Vesuvius covered the city of Pompeii with thick volcanic ash, preserving the bodies of many of its residents.  To date, the remains of more than 1,000 people have been uncovered throughout the sprawling site, most recently in November 2020 when archaeologists unearthed two bodies, believed to be a young enslaved person and his possible owner.  The two newly discovered victims announced Tuesday “probably died due to multiple traumas caused by the collapse of part of the building”, the Pompeii archaeological park said in a statement.  They were found in what is believed to be a storeroom inside the “Chaste Lovers” block, where colourful frescoes and the skeletons of mules who worked the millstones for grain have been uncovered in the past.  The skeletons were found lying on their side with their legs curled up, and one wore a ring on his left hand.  Archaeologists estimate that 15 to 20 percent of Pompeii’s population died in the eruption, mostly from thermal shock as a giant cloud of gases and ash covered the city.  Protecting himself  Earthquakes before and during the eruption, as documented in letters by Roman author Pliny the Younger, also took their toll.  “Among the causes of death, the collapse of buildings, in some cases due to earthquakes that accompanied the eruption, proved to be a lethal threat,” the park said.  Pompeii’s director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, said modern technology was helping archaeologists “better understand the hell that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii in two days, killing many inhabitants: children, women and men”.  Traces of what is believed to be a cloth bundle were found next to one of the victims, containing necklace beads and coins.  Inside the room was an amphora and a collection of bowls and jugs, while an adjacent room contained a home shrine in the form of a fresco, and a narrow bathroom with a toilet.  In the room where the men were found, part of a wall had collapsed, hitting one of the victims “whose raised arm perhaps refers to the tragic image of a vain attempt to protect himself from falling masonry”, the park said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbWFhZW5nbGlzaC50di9uZXdzLzQwMDM1MzY0L2dsb2JhbC10d28tbmV3LXNrZWxldG9ucy1mb3VuZC1hdC1wb21wZWlpLWV4Y2F2YXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Noisy air tours would be greatly reduced over Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park under draft plans unveiled Monday. Read more  Noisy air tours would be greatly reduced over Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park under draft plans unveiled Monday.  The court-ordered plans by the National Park Service and Federal Aviation Administration use a combination of route and altitude limitations and no-fly days to reduce noise levels.  Public comment is being accepted on the draft plans now through June 16.  At Hawai‘i Volcanoes the plan would reduce air tours by an estimated 86% by authorizing up to 1,665 air tours per year using three defined routes. It would also designate Sundays as no-fly days and Wednesdays for quiet-technology flights only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In addition, the plan specifies flight times from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for non-quiet- technology flights and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for flights using quiet technology.  At Haleakala the plan estimates a 50% reduction in air tours and requires a complete transition to quiet technology by 2033.  The plan authorizes up to 2,412 air tours per year on only one defined route, with air tours allowed from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day accept Sundays and Wednesdays. Quiet-technology flights would be allowed to fly until 4 p.m. on the days when flights are allowed.  The FAA and the National Park Service aim to complete the plans by the end of the year in a schedule approved by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to comply with the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000.  Ruling in 2020, the court ordered the FAA and NPS to adopt limits on air tours over 23 national parks, including Haleakala and Hawai‘i Volcanoes national parks.  The order came in response to a lawsuit by Hawaii Island Coalition Malama Pono and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which argued that the agencies were offering little relief from the noise being generated by air tours.  In siding with the petitioners, the court noted, “For nineteen years, the agencies have failed to comply with their statutory mandate despite Congress’s command to ‘make every effort’ to do so within two years of an application.”  Calling the effort by the federal agencies “underwhelming,” the court said judicial intervention was needed and that it would ultimately have to approve the plans.  A National Park Service report published in 2019 indicated that of all the national parks, Hawai‘i Volcanoes is the one most affected by tour helicopter flights. Ten operators reported a total of 11,376 flights per year at the Hawaii island national park between 2017 and 2019.  The same report indicated that Haleakala National Park is the fourth most affected park, with 4,757 flights in the prior year.  There was a range of proposed air tour management plans for units of the National Park System released Monday, from a complete ban on overflights to a substantial number of flights permitted.  Mike Murray, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, told National Parks Traveler on Monday that he wondered why the parks in Hawaii didn’t totally ban overflights as proposed at Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota.  “We are especially glad that the NPS has identified preferred alternatives for Badlands and Mount Rushmore that would provide the ‘greatest level of protection’ for park resources and values by not allowing any commercial air tours within one-half mile of the respective park boundaries. In contrast, it is curious that NPS has identified preferred alternatives for both Hale­akala and Hawai‘i Volcanoes that would provide considerably less than ‘the greatest level of protection’ at those parks,” Murray said.  The Hawaii Helicopter Association previously said operators have invested in quiet aircraft and technologies over the past several decades and are working to ensure “responsible operations for both our residents and visitors.”  The investment, the organization said, includes a digital tracking system that addresses several areas of concern to help with regulatory compliance.  The Air Tour Management Plan, environmental assessment and related documents for each park are located online. Feedback can be submitted through the NPS Planning, Environment and Public Comment website until 8 p.m. June 16.  “An important part of the process is the inclusion of Native Hawaiian groups and individuals,” a park release said. “The agencies are consulting with Native Hawaiian organizations and other groups that have lands adjacent to Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, and with Kupuna (elders) and individuals who attach historic and cultural significance to resources within the park.”  Learn more  >> The Hawaii Volcanoes project website is available at bit.ly/3pzpauM.  >> The Haleakala project website is available at bit.ly/455rOsI.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8_cD0xMjQ5NjAw0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhcmFkdmVydGlzZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaGF3YWlpLW5ld3MvcmVkdWN0aW9uLW9mLWFpci10b3Vycy1vdmVyLWhhd2FpaS1uYXRpb25hbC1wYXJrcy1pcy1wcm9wb3NlZC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Skeletons found in Pompeii ruins reveal deaths by earthquake, not just Vesuvius’ ancient eruption  MILAN (AP) — Archeologists in Pompeii have discovered two skeletons that they believe were men who died when a wall collapsed on them during the powerful earthquakes that accompanied the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Experts said Tuesday that the find underlines that many of the dead in the ancient city were due to powerful quakes that accompanied the eruption and not just victims of the volcano’s deadly ash and gas. The two skeletons were found in the House of Chaste Lovers beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The director of the Pompeii archaeological site said new techniques are allowing experts to determine the dynamics of deaths down to the final seconds.  Germany: 5 sentenced to prison for 100-million-euro jewelry heist  BERLIN (AP) — A German court has convicted five men of breaking into a Dresden museum and stealing 21 pieces of jewelry containing more than 4,300 diamonds. The defendants received prison sentences, and the longest was six years and three months, German news agency dpa reported. The Dresden state court ruled that the five were responsible for the theft of the 18th century jewelry from the Green Vault Museum on Nov. 25, 2019. Officials said at the time that the stolen items included a large diamond brooch and a diamond epaulet. The crime was considered one of Germany’s most spectacular jewelry heists in recent history. The pieces taken had a total insured value of at least $129 million.  Salman Rushdie warns free expression under threat in rare public address after attack  LONDON (AP) — Writer Salman Rushdie has made a public speech nine months after being stabbed and seriously injured onstage. He warned that freedom of expression in the West is under its most severe threat of his lifetime. Rushdie delivered a video message to the British Book Awards, where he was awarded the Freedom to Publish award on Monday evening. He said “freedom of expression, freedom to publish has not in my lifetime been under such threat in the countries of the West.” Rushdie was blinded in one eye when he was attacked at a literary festival in New York state in August. Rushdie spent years in hiding after Iran’s leader called for his death in 1989 over the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses.”  More dogs could show up in outdoor dining spaces. Not everyone is happy about it  Just in time for the summer dining season, the U.S. government has given its blessing to restaurants that want to allow pet dogs in their outdoor spaces. It better reflects reality; nearly half of states already allow canine dining outdoors. Restaurants have been required to allow service dogs for decades. But it wasn’t until the mid-2000’s that states began allowing dogs in outdoor dining spaces. Late last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance saying restaurants can welcome dogs as long as they get permission from a local authority. The FDA suggests they also require leashes and develop plans to handle dog waste.  Ex-Audi chief pleads guilty in automaker’s diesel emissions scandal  FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The former head of Volkswagen’s luxury division Audi has pleaded guilty to charges tied to the automaker’s diesel emissions scandal. The move Tuesday makes Rupert Stadler the highest-ranking executive convicted over cars that cheated on emissions tests with the help of illegal software. The dpa news agency reported that Stadler answered “yes” to a statement read in court by his attorney that said Stadler admitted wrongdoing and regret for his failure to keep rigged cars off the market even after the scandal had become public knowledge. Stadler entered the plea under an agreement that gives probation instead of jail time and a $1.2 million fine in return for a thorough admission of guilt.

At the volcano’s summit is a lava lake that lights up the night sky like a beacon. In May 2021, an unexpected lava flow came down Nyiragongo’s flank, pouring into the outskirts of the nearby city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as residents fled in the dark.  “Volcanic eruptions cannot be prevented, so mitigation strategies are needed to reduce impact.”  Now, researchers are studying ways of educating residents about the hazards of living near one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes. The scientists presented their research at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2023.  As a child in Goma, Blaise Mafuko Nyandwi grew up with the towering Nyiragongo as a backdrop and watched the red glow of its lava every night. A volcanologist at the University of Goma, he knows from experience that people living in the city still do not know how volcanoes work and may therefore be unprepared to react during future eruptions.  “Volcanic eruptions cannot be prevented, so mitigation strategies are needed to reduce impact,” said Mafuko, lead researcher of the new study. Mitigation can mean making the nearby population aware and ready to react, he added.  Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, sits at the foot of Nyiragongo volcano. Credit: MONUSCO/Abel Kavanagh, Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0  With the ever present threat in the region, situated in the Virunga Volcanic Province of East Africa, Mafuko and his colleagues worked with 435 sixteen-year-old students from 12 high schools in Goma to test how well two extracurricular activities raised awareness of geological risk: playing the Hazagora board game and visiting the Virunga Volcano Museum.  Gaming and Exploring the Way to Awareness  On the fictional island of Hazagora, players develop a society regularly hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and landslides. Five to 10 players, representing the island’s mayor, a fisherman, a lumberjack, a farmer, and a tour guide, must figure out how to survive disasters by making trade-offs on protective measures. Players use their annual income to provide for their family’s basic needs but can also stockpile supplies and reinforce or protect infrastructure, for instance.  The Hazagora game can be used to teach people about geological hazards. Credit: Blaise Mafuko Nyandwi  The game, originally developed by researchers at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, includes information sheets on geological hazards that the moderator can use to reinforce the players’ knowledge. Through discussions about the events and possible consequences, players learn more about the natural processes at work and how to reduce risk.  “The information on volcanic risk that makes Hazagora valuable is broad,” Mafuko explained. The game could symbolize any volcanic region.  On the other hand, the Virunga Volcano Museum, which recently opened next to the Goma Volcano Observatory (GVO), features informative panels and documentaries about volcanic hazards, monitoring activities conducted at GVO, historical eruptions of Nyiragongo, and what to do during an eruption. In the center of the room is an animated 3D model of the Virunga volcanic chain.  The Virunga Volcano Museum houses displays and documentaries about nearby volcanos and how to build resilience against hazards. Credit: Caroline Michellier  “At the museum, students learned about Nyiragongo’s historic eruptions. The exhibit reinforces knowledge of volcanoes, and Virunga volcanoes specifically,” Mafuko said. “The students were introduced to volcanologists and monitoring equipment and read about volcano preparedness and mitigation measures for risks.”  Museums are useful because they help take the students out of their normal learning environment and provide good samples and tools and, often, expertise to help the students connect the dots on the topic, said Carina Fearnley, director of University College London’s Warning Research Centre, who was not involved in the study.  Through surveys and conversations, the researchers found that both the game and the museum reinforced students’ knowledge of volcanism, but the museum was a more effective tool to help students learn about how volcanoes work. The Hazagora game, on the other hand, made the students more knowledgeable about how to take protective action.  This study provided valuable insight into the success of a paired approach to learning about volcanoes, using a range of tools and types of engagement, Fearnley added.  Striking Motivation  Mafuko said he was struck by the students’ initial low level of understanding about volcanic processes and risk despite them living at the foot of the volcano. He and his colleagues did find, however, that the students were motivated to learn more and were willing to engage in disaster risk reduction activities in their school communities and with their families, Mafuko said.  “These students are the future decisionmakers and stakeholders in disaster risk reduction,” said Joseph Makundi, Goma’s civil protection coordinator. “They are powerful in influencing members of their community to adopt protective behavior.” Reaching students is therefore key to building a prepared community in Goma.  “Goma is a particularly vulnerable population for volcanic hazards, and any work that can be done to build awareness and resilience is vital.”  The work “highlights the importance of teaching hazard and risk management at schools, not just in Goma,” Fearnley said. “Goma is a particularly vulnerable population for volcanic hazards, and any work that can be done to build awareness and resilience is vital.”  Academics, risk managers, and teachers should work together to design attractive educational actions specific for their context, Mafuko suggested.  These kinds of simple educational activities may be more practical for teaching, especially in the Global South, where advanced technologies such as augmented virtual reality, which is sometimes used to raise hazard awareness, are difficult to implement. Policymakers should integrate disaster resilience into school curriculums and recommend extracurricular activities in which students can be active learners, Mafuko said.  —Munyaradzi Makoni (@MunyaWaMakoni), Science Writer  Citation: Makoni, M.

"eruption","1980-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 17:12:14","Volcanic disturbances on vegetation in relation to climatic conditions  The studied laminated sediments of Lake Van document distinct changes in the abundance of proximal herbaceous vegetation after volcanic ash deposition. Species composition does not change, but an effect of ash deposition through reduced accumulation rates is evident, especially in the first five varve-years after eruption. In general, ash fall and volatile acids in the atmosphere directly and immediately damage terrestrial biota, and their effects tend to be larger in areas near the eruption. The unique characteristics of ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean may also affect their sensitivity to volcanic hazards. One of the most important natural environmental pressures in this region is drought, and steppe species are adapted to these conditions. In plants, these adaptations include thick cuticles, small leaves, deep rooting systems, and small, protected stomata43,44. Many of these adaptations are likely to benefit species in terms of resistance to volcanic impacts1. For example, small leaves trap less tephra, thick cuticles limit the effects of acid deposition, and deep rooting systems ensure that plants are less vulnerable to tephra-soil interactions. However, if plant survival depends on growing through the ash deposit, a > 10 cm deep tephra can nearly eliminate the herb layer45. In our study, the extent of plant damage cannot be reliably determined. We assume that the first post-eruption rainfall would likely wash the ash-coating on leaves off. Grasses (Poaceae) with long slender leaves are less affected, due to their ability to shed quickly any deposited ash fall46. In addition, this family has a short life cycle and benefits very quickly from the nutrients supplied by volcanic eruptions12. This profiting is reflected by relatively stable values in pollen percentages and accumulation rates of Poaceae, especially shortly prior and after ash deposition (e.g., V-18 and V-237). Eastern Anatolian steppe species (i.e., Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) are more frequently exposed to natural disturbances (e.g., fires, droughts) and recover quickly after volcanic ash deposition or colonizing newly created open areas (e.g., V-18, V-60, V-176, and V-233a). Therefore, changes in the vegetation community and environmental conditions around Lake Van favor dispersal conditions for an increased proportion of Chenopodiaceae.  Modern environmental studies at Mount St. Helens indicate that forest vegetation appeared to be more resilient to ash cover than shrubs or grassland8. In this context, the deciduousness of trees may facilitated survival as they are adapted to leaf loss2. However, the response to natural hazards is influenced by the season during which they occur that may exert a selective force on disturbance47. We do not know at what time of year the volcanic eruptions occurred; if they occurred towards the end of the growing season when leaf-shedding would have lessened any chemical/physical damage or photosynthetic impairment, the deciduousness of trees may have contributed to them being less affected22. It should also be noted that regionally-growing deciduous oaks, predominately occurring on the southern slopes of the Bitlis Massif30,31,32,48, may have been only marginally affected by ash deposition or pyroclastic flows due to the prevailing W-E orientated wind direction26 and spatial distance to the volcanoes (more than 20 km). Regardless of morphological adaptations, it cannot be ruled out that indirect effects of volcanic eruptions such as short-term climate deterioration (e.g., reduction of solar radiation, temperature drop1,2,22) may have affected the regional vegetation at Lake Van. The minor decrease in tree cover and increase in herbaceous vegetation a few varve-years after ash deposition may also be explained by a cold shift for several years.  The deposition and incorporation of volcanic ash particles in lake sediments have effects in the proxy-dataset that are often not easily distinguished from those of natural climate changes. At Lake Van, the prevailing climatic phase (interglacial/interstadial, glacial/stadial stages) largely determines the boundary conditions for vegetation composition and also the recovery of disturbed terrestrial ecosystems following a volcanic eruption. This is impressively evident at the beginning and end of interglacial MIS 9e, where the vegetation composition following V-233a and V-237 is not comparable to its pre-volcanic composition (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 5). At the transition from cold/dry glacial to the warm/humid interglacial, the deposition of V-237 triggered pronounced changes in vegetation composition, but global climate changes during the transition attenuated the tephra-induced disturbances. It is unlikely that the fallout promoted millennial-scale climatic changes, however, it potential act as catalyst in connection with long-term post-glacial recovery dynamics. In short, the ash deposition is responsible for abrupt changes in the record, with recovery strongly controlled by prevailing climate conditions leading to a vegetation shift from steppe vegetation to an oak steppe-forest. A similar phenomenon appears at the end of the MIS 9e (V-233a), where gradually cooler/drier climatic conditions affect vegetation cover, which becomes successively more open. While evidence suggests that the volcanic event is the trigger for the documented dramatic changes in terrestrial interglacial vegetation, the open oak steppe-forest was already at its ecological limit at the transition into the cold/dry stadial period. This climatic transition affected the vegetation (both AP and NAP) and even prevented it from recovering to its previous state for decades (for the 90-varve interval studied here).  Cold/dry glacial and stadial periods at Lake Van are dominated by steppe vegetation (e.g., V-18a, V-176). Reduced vegetation cover is associated with lower pollen production and thus generally lower pollen accumulation rates, especially for trees and shrubs due to unfavorable growing conditions. Such disturbed open landscapes favor visible changes in terrestrial ecosystem (e.g., increased erosion processes; low Ca/K ratio). XRF data illustrate abrupt change or a step in all measured properties between background sedimentation and volcanic deposition. Despite the lower resolution, they provide a broader context for pollen data that not only document abrupt changes in the system but serve as independent evidence of the effects of volcanic deposition on ecosystem complexities. During the volcaniclastic ash deposition V-176 (stadial phase), PARs increased due to remobilization of allochthonous material (including high proportion of incorporated volcanic ash particles) and additional input of pollen grains (airborne components) from regionally open Chenopodiaceae-dominated steppe areas. Persistent similarity between XRF (K) and palynomorph data sets suggests a depositional process that can coexist in the same volcaniclastic deposit. By our definition, we interpret here only the depositional processes, since all volcaniclastic deposits that were finally deposited by non-volcanic processes are secondary volcanic deposits. Consequently, the increase in degraded pollen following V-176 deposition can be considered as an indicator of enhanced runoff21, acid stress, mechanical damage, changing lake sediment sources, and catchment disturbances. The increased occurrence of ruderal plants (e.g., Liguliflorae, Plantago lanceolata) between V-18b and V-18a (glacial phase) indicates habitat disturbances associated with soil degradation49. A highly stressed environment and persistent irreversible cold climatic conditions significantly impair a fast recovery to its previous state7. However, the highly affected herb and shrub communities returned to pre-eruption levels within 20 to 40 varve-years and recolonize devastated areas around the volcanoes. Any long-lasting millennial-scale effects are not apparent from palynological data. This regeneration time of only few decades is consistent with similar environmental studies at Mount St. Helen (USA)8,16,17,18, disturbances by the Laacher See tephra (Germany)11,13, and at Lago Grande di Monticchio (Italy)20. In addition, similar to the studies of the two northern German lakes after the Icelandic Saksunarvatn ash, we see a possible pre-volcanic sedimentary changes in one time interval (V-60) of about −20 varve-years before the Intralake-İncekaya-Dibekli fallout (light-yellow bar below V-60; Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 7)22.  Response of aquatic ecosystems following volcanic ash deposition  The five investigated intervals show changes in aquatic non-pollen palynomorphs (algae and non-siliceous microfossils) in all post-event phases. Aquatic organisms respond very quickly and sensitive to environmental changes and natural disturbances, such as ash deposition, caused by their shorter life cycles. At Lake Van, aquatic microfossils react with only minor (ca 1–8 varve-years) or even without any time lag to volcanic-induced environmental and ecological changes (e.g., V-176, V-223a, V-237). The clearest example we found is a 16-fold increase in annual accumulation rates of Pediastrum, dinoflagellates, and Botryoccocus immediately in the ash-affected sediments of the Nemrut deposit V-176 (from 32 to 508 cysts/coenobia cm−2 yr−1). Chemically, Nemrut volcanic deposits (trachytes and rhyolites) are dominated by silica-saturated peralkaline rocks, and therefore many Nemrut tephra deposits have moderate to high silica content (e.g., Nemrut Formation, V-18; approx. 60–70 wt.% SiO 2 )26. The sub-alkanline Süphan rhyolites are characterized by low total alkalis and high silica content, but by slightly higher SiO 2 compared to Nemrut compositions (70–77wt.% SiO 2 )26,27. The nearly aphyric basalts of the huge, predominantly hyaloclastic İncekaya system are alumina-rich, moderately alkaline, and weakly evolved basalts that are distinctly different from other basalts of the Nemrut/Süphan system26,41. The chemical composition is much lower with SiO 2 concentrations of approx. 46–48 wt%41. The measured XRF-Si counts range from high (e.g., V-18, Nemrut) to low (V-60, İncekaya). In this study, we can demonstrate that the level of Si supply has a direct and immediate effect on aquatic ecosystems, visible through increases in the NPP accumulation rates (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9).  The most significant effect related to chemical weathering of tephra is probably a massive, essentially instantaneous, input of silica from volcanic glass particles into the lake3. However, this particulate silica is often not immediately available to biota, rather it dissolves slowly (in particular for rhyolitic tephra) and is subjected to relatively slow settling of tephra through the water column. In addition, mixing processes reduce the sinking rate and could be important for the dissolution of tephra in the water column of large lakes3. Dissolution rates of silicates are pH-sensitive (indifferent up to pH 8), thereafter dissolution rate increased by 0.3 log units per pH unit50. These considerations may suggest that direct silica input does not provide the necessary sustained stimulus to explain the enhanced productivity of algae. However, volcaniclastic deposition in the watershed also leads to indirect changes in lake catchment nutrient cycles, for instance, a decrease in organic content (TOC). In addition, fresh volcanic ash is highly acidic, and therefore, when freshly-erupted ash comes into contact with the general very alkaline character of the Lake Van water (ca 153 meq l−1; pH 9.8)51, it has the potential for a short-term reduction in the pH and alkalinity. Such changes in the physical and chemical condition of the lake (e.g., increased SiO 2 input, diluting alkalinity, short-term reduced light availability (less than 1 year)3, sealing the sediment-water interfaces3,21, reduce recycling of nutrients from the lake sediments11) and the surrounding area have enormous effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In particular, the green algae Pediastrum requires a nutrient-rich environment, which is commonly enhanced by additional leaching effects from the ash deposits of the catchment. This nutrient supply has a fertilizing effect on aquatic organisms and thus stimulates increases in primary productivity of the lake. Intensified algae blooms are promoted by persistent delivery of tephra-derived nutrients (e.g., silica) due to high and sustained erosional processes from disturbed terrestrial surfaces (remobilization of volcanic ash), especially during the first five varve-years following the volcanic event (e.g., V-233a, V-237). At this point, it can be pointed out that the SiO 2 -depleted İncekaya deposition (V-60; low Si % values) did not cause any Pediastrum bloom, but on the contrary, the algal bloom was prevented (Supplementary Fig. 7).  However, once the tephra-induced nutrient input ended, the system re-established the conditions found during previous periods. Here, our observations are comparable to paleoecological studies at Lake Gölhisar21 (Turkey) and Holzmaar11,13 (Germany), where the volcanic fallout had fertilized Pediastrum and diatom communities. Finally, the Nemrut volcaniclastic ash deposits are a direct source of nutrients (Si %) with biological impact and feedback mechanism on aquatic organisms.  Relationship between vegetation changes, volcanic eruptions, climate, and fire frequency  Charcoal residues occur under natural environmental conditions either as a result of wildfire or volcanic processes that can ignite or initiate fires. High fire frequency is a major cause of vegetation damage and can be directly triggered by hot, fresh lava, fallout, or by pyroclastic flows that buried vegetation in the blast and proximal area. In the case of Mount St. Helens (USA), many trees buried by the density-flow deposit burned or smouldered for weeks after the eruption2,40,45,52.  Our study illustrates a direct correlation between changes in vegetation composition caused by volcanic deposits under each prevailing climatic condition and the effects on fire frequency. Charcoal particle peaks directly associated with ash deposition in all five pollen profiles indicate that widespread, concurrent and intense fires were associated with the eruption. However, the amplitude of fire intensity depends on the availability of biomass (e.g., lower during glacials, larger during interglacial periods), suggesting that charcoal particle peaks during colder periods may be diagnostic of tephra rather than climate-driven fires.  Fire activity at Lake Van generally follows global climate changes, with high fire intensity during warm/humid climatic conditions (e.g., interglacial/interstadial stages) when oak steppe-forest were abundant and provided fuel for fires36. In other words, high charcoal amounts correlate with high arboreal pollen values30,31,32. Depending on available biomass, warm/humid periods also promote fire events of understorey vegetation (e.g., V-237) rather than prolonged dry/cold periods in overall sparse vegetation cover (e.g., V-18). Distinct fire signals are observed at the beginning and end of interglacial MIS 9e immediately preceding and following volcaniclastic accumulations V-233a (mean 2124 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1) and V-237 (mean 1059 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1), respectively. For V-233a in particular, enhanced fires occurred during the ash accumulation in an already high charcoal level (ca 6-fold increase), but did not continue for more than one to six varve-years. Even during stadial/glacial periods, when biomass production is generally low to sustain frequent fire events (mean 279 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1), a sudden 16-fold increase in charcoal PAR (from 64 to 1052 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1) suggests that the volcanic deposition of V-176 resulted in a large-scale tephra-induced steppe fire.  The source area of fires cannot be precisely defined, but likely regional in extent. The hot lava, fallout, and/or pyroclastic flows may have caused fires in the immediate vicinity from the eruptive source. Since we identified mostly microscopic charcoal fragments ( > 20 to 125 µm) in our samples, we assume that the charcoal particles were transported into the lake over distances of a few kilometers, e.g., by erosional processes, increased precipitation events, or aeolian input. In association with hot ash deposits, explosive volcanoes at Lake Van may eject large amounts of fine ash into the atmosphere, leading to temporary and non-seasonal climate changes (e.g., reduced solar radiation12,13) and/or increases in lightning activity, and thus to wildfires. Lightning strikes are the most likely cause of long-lasting post-eruption fires. Exposed-standing trees and high abundance of fuel in the ash-damaged steppe-forests would increase the chances of ignition.  The sedimentary intervals containing five selected tephra deposits illustrate the complexity of cause-effect relationships following volcanic eruptions. The wide array of effects stretches from direct and immediate environmental changes to indirect and decades-long repercussions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQzMjQ3LTAyMy0wMDgyNy0w0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"eruption","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:40:45","There was a protest Monday that marched down Market Street to City Hall following the announcement by SF District Attorney Brooke Jenkins that no charges would filed in the Walgreens shooting of 24-year-old Banko Brown.  As KPIX reports, dozens of people rallied Monday outside Walgreens to demand justice for Brown, and then marched up Market Street toward City Hall. One of the signs being carried at the protest read, ""We saw the tape: Banko was murdered.""  The Young Women's Freedom Center, where Brown volunteered and which helped organize yesterday's protest, said in a statement:  We do not need to see the video to know that Banko Brown's killing was unjustified. Armed force is not a justified response to poverty. Young people, especially Black and trans youth who experience poverty deserve love, care, and the resources they need to survive and thrive. Banko deserved to live.  It seems likely there could be some disruption at today's Board of Supervisors' meeting just as there was last week, with friends and supporters of Brown continuing to demand justice and looking to the District Attorney to hold the shooter accountable. The DA's office has concluded there is insufficient evidence to prove that the shooter, 33-year-old Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, did not act in self-defense. He has claimed that he feared for his life.  With Monday's announcement came the release of surveillance video, a video of the interrogation of Anthony, and the DA's Office investigative report on the case. And reaction to the video has been predictably loud and swift, as it does not seem to satisfy many people on the question of whether the shooting was justified.  The video shows Anthony tussling with Brown near the door of the Walgreens at 825 Market Street, just after Anthony tried to stop Brown from exiting the store with allegedly stolen merchandise. Following some struggle, in which it's clear that Anthony can easily physically overpower the smaller Brown, Anthony lets Brown go and pushes him out of the store. Brown can be seen edging back into the store — witnesses say he intended to spit at Anthony — and after a slight lunge with his chest forward, we see Anthony raise his gun and take a shot, and Brown falls backwards outside the store.  During questioning by police, Anthony says that Brown began threatening to stab him while they were struggling on the ground. And having not frisked Brown, Anthony says he did not know what Brown might have on his person or what he might do if he was let go.  The full interview can be seen below, via the DA's office and ABC 7 — and Anthony and the police misgender Brown throughout, referring to him as female. It later became publicly known that Brown was trans and identified as male.  Anthony says he was primarily trying to subdue Brown and had him a choke-hold position at one point, saying he would release him if he calmed down.  Anthony also admits that he carries two guns on the job, and that he used to carry pepper-spray, however that was ""confiscated"" at some point, possibly by Oakland police. (Anthony just says he lives in downtown Oakland.) None of these items are provided by the security firm Anthony works for — he says that what they provide to guards is ""just a t-shirt.""  Anthony said the day that this incident occurred at the Walgreens, the firm, Kingdom Group Protective Services, had put out a notice to all employees that they should engage with shoplifters in a ""hands-on"" manner and prevent them from leaving stores with stolen goods.  As Jenkins said in a press conference Monday, per the Chronicle, the question of how guards or police should handle shoplifters remains an open one.  ""It’s a conversation that needs to be had amongst everybody involved — us as consumers, the stores, leaders … about the serious implications of both unarmed and armed security. I think it’s one that we need to have at this moment,"" Jenkins said.  Supervisor Aaron Peskin told the Chronicle that he plans to introduce legislation today calling on California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the federal Department of Justice to investigate the case.  ""This is not who we are. Stealing a bag of candy does not warrant the death penalty. I understand people are afraid of crime, a fear being stoked by too many politicians and their political allies,"" Peskin said, per the Chronicle. ""But this is not a choice between justice and safety — we can have both. And allowing what appears, at a minimum, to be an unjustified shooting does not make us safer. It does not make us better. It should make us ashamed.""

DOI: 10.1029/2022JB026114  New Zealand research could help track the path of searingly hot rock and gas flows that are the world's most deadly volcanic hazard.  Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury School of Mathematics and Statistics Lecturer Dr. Leighton Watson has for the first time shown that seismic signals—ground shaking recorded by seismometers—can be used to track pyroclastic flows, which can travel at up to 500 kmh (310 mph) during a volcanic eruption.  The catastrophic eruption at Whakaari White Island in 2019 caused a pyroclastic surge of gas and rock that killed 22 people, while an earlier eruption of Te Maari craters in 2012 on Mt. Tongariro also caused pyroclastic flows, resulting in the closure of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Around the world more than half of all volcano-related deaths are caused by pyroclastic flows.  Dr. Watson says these ""terrifying"" flows are challenging to study because they are sudden, fast-moving, and dangerous. ""It's hard to know what is going on inside a flow because the internal flow dynamics are hidden by an opaque gas cloud which is impossible to see through.""  However, he has used seismic data recorded by a permanent monitoring network at Mt. Etna, Italy, to track a pyroclastic flow that happened in February 2014. His findings have been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.  ""We've shown that as the pyroclastic flow travels down the flanks of the volcano, it pushes on to Earth's surface producing seismic waves. We can use these seismic signals to track the flow, potentially informing modeling of their flow paths in real time which could help with making hazard assessments for future eruptions.  ""By considering how seismic signals get smaller further away from the pyroclastic flow, we can locate the source of these vibrations and track their location over time.""  He says because of the extreme hazard posed by pyroclastic flows there is an urgent need to improve monitoring capabilities. The findings could be applied at volcanoes in New Zealand such as Ruapehu, Tongariro and Taranaki.  ""All of the New Zealand volcanoes are able to produce pyroclastic flows, so being able to monitor them better could help improve safety.""  Dr. Watson hopes to carry out further research in the New Zealand context using seismic signals to track lahars (mudflows composed of rock, debris, and water), as well as pyroclastic flows. A lahar from Ruapehu destroyed a bridge over the Whangaehu River causing a train derailment in the 1953 Tangiwai disaster that killed 151 people.  ""The ultimate goal is to better understand and monitor volcanic hazards and to use these findings to save lives. This is especially useful as volcanoes are often shrouded in cloud and eruptions can happen during the night when cameras are not effective.""  Dr. Watson has already shown that sound waves can be used to detect mountain avalanches along the Milford Road and is currently working on monitoring avalanche activity in Mount Cook Aoraki National Park.

This map shows the locations of two M5+ earthquakes and numerous aftershocks in and around Lake Almanor, CA, from 11-16 May 2023. The earthquakes are associated with normal Basin and Range province faulting, and there are numerous fault zones under and around the lake which could be the source of the sequence. USGS graphic by Jessica L. Ball.  The initial M5.5 earthquake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73886731/executive) was followed by a M5.2 quake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73887046/executive) as well as dozens of smaller aftershocks. Because Lake Almanor is close to Lassen, CalVO received many questions about potential connections to the volcano.  To start, the distance and character of these earthquakes tell us that they're unlikely to have anything to do with Lassen. Focal mechanisms (a way of describing the type of slip) tell us that these earthquakes occurred on a normal fault. At a volcano, we would expect seismicity to have widely varying focal mechanisms, depending on earthquake location. Volcanic earthquakes also follow a more complicated pattern than mainshock-aftershock sequences (https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/news/volcano-watch-aftershock-forecasts-let-you-know-what-expect-after-large)  Our next clue is that Lake Almanor is not in the same physiographic province (defined by tectonics, landforms, and volcanism) as Lassen. The Lassen Volcanic Center is at the southern end of the Cascades Volcanic Arc, formed by a subduction zone. But only a few miles to the east are the Modoc Plateau and Basin and Range provinces. Lake Almanor falls roughly within the Basin and Range, and its tectonic history is very different from Lassen's. The area contains several N-S and NW-SE trending fault zones, including the Lake Almanor fault, which are active and prone to earthquakes. A similar earthquake sequence happened there in May of 2013 (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc71996906/executive).  Finally, many of you asked if these earthquakes could affect Lassen. The short answer is no! While some eruptions might be triggered by large earthquakes, it only seems to happen when the volcano is already primed and ready to erupt - that is, there already needs to be gassy magma near the surface. We've seen no evidence of that at Lassen recently: no earthquake swarms, no ground swelling, and no change in the gases coming out of the volcano.  So there you have it - while these earthquakes were near Lassen, there's no danger of eruption. It's just part of living in a tectonically active state!

Volcanologist Professor Silvio De Angelis from the University of Liverpool will present the talk where he will delve into the geological and eruptive history of the Hunga volcano, the factors that drive terrestrial and submarine volcanism, and control its explosivity.  The organisers will also present some unique geophysical observations associated with this extraordinary explosion and compare it to other large historical events such as the 1883 Krakatoa eruption.  This Hunga Tonga- Hunga Haʻapai eruption was one of the largest in the past century, and caused significant damage in the archipelago and generated a tsunami. The size of the eruption was unprecedented.  The event was extensively documented by digital sensor networks on the Earth's surface, as well as from space. The eruption column reached a height of 55 km; the atmospheric pressure waves associated with the explosion circled around the Earth at least six times and were recorded by thousands of instruments across the globe.  Reserve a ticket for the public talk, which is shaping up to be a very informative event at eventbrite here.  This event is preceded by a public Volcano outreach day that DIAS will be hosting at the Foy Centre in Carlingford, running from 12:45-16:30, as part of the Improve Summer School DIAS is running in the north Louth village.

The event, which is open to all members of the public and schools from around the area to attend, is being run by 24 international PhD volcanological students that will be attending the summer school.  The organisers say there will be fun experiments like, an erupting volcano, a real seismometer with which those who take part can see earthquakes made by them when they jump, and they can listen to an underwater volcano erupting.  DIAS is an institution that attracts scholars and academics from around the world, and is the world’s second, and Ireland’s only, Institute for Advanced Studies.  It conducts and publishes advanced research across three disciplines: Celtic Studies, Theoretical Physics and Cosmic Physics.

Not technically a true geyser, this eruption of water is known as a “soda pop geyser,” because the cold-water eruptions look so similar to the popular Yellowstone phenomenon.  A geyser is created when pressure from hot steam shoots a tall column of water into the air, while soda pop geysers are created when a pocket of carbon dioxide mixes with the water until the water becomes oversaturated and then bursts the water out of the opening.  Crystal Geyser (in Grand County) is erupting!💦Our division geologist monitors this site & hasn't seen an eruption in years, but this year's wet winter might have caused the water table to rise, resulting in CO2 gas that powers the eruptions to push water through. #KnowYourH2O pic.twitter.com/hWgrORxT2w — Utah Division of Water Resources (@utahwaterres) May 15, 2023  According to the Utah Geological Survey, the Geyser was discovered in 1936 when an exploratory oil well, the Ruby No. 1 was drilled. Workers encountered carbon dioxide gas deep below the surface, approximately 360 feet, which was extremely pressurized.  The well was eventually abandoned, but in its aftermath, a geyser was created.  The November 1936 front page of Moab’s Times-Independent boasted of a new geyser that spouted an 80-foot column of water at regular intervals of about 15 minutes and a 150-foot column at intervals of about 9 hours.  Today, the geyser’s eruptions have slowed down, though it’s uncertain whether that’s a result of geological changes beneath the surface or of rocks that people used to drop down into the geyser.  Because the eruptions are sporadic, sometimes more than 24 hours apart, being able to see the geyser in action can be difficult.  Studies conducted on the geyser over the last 20 years have tracked the frequency and height of eruptions using sensors. The studies found that minor eruptions ranged in height from 2-10 feet, while major eruptions gained heights of 40 -80 feet and occurred on a schedule ranging from 17 to 27 hours apart. The duration of eruptions ranged from 3-49 minutes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzU1MDYwMy9ncmFuZC1jb3VudHktc29kYS1wb3AtZ2V5c2VyLWVydXB0cy1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUtaW4teWVhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

IN PHOTOS: Pompeii’s treasures go on display at reopened Antiquarium museum  Inside the room was an amphora and a collection of bowls and jugs, while an adjacent room contained a home shrine in the form of a fresco, and a narrow bathroom with a toilet.  The earthquake struck as the huge blast from nearby Mount Vesuvius covered the city of Pompeii with thick volcanic ash, preserving the bodies of many of its residents.  Archaeologists estimate that 15 to 20 percent of Pompeii’s population died in the eruption, which had a force equivalent to many atomic bombs, mostly from thermal shock as a giant cloud of gases and ash covered the city.

(Photo by Andreas SOLARO / AFP)  Earthquakes before and during the eruption, as documented in letters by Roman author Pliny the Younger, also took their toll.  “At least 15-20 percent of the population” was killed, according to the park.  Over the past two and a half centuries, archaeologists have recovered the remains of more than 1,300 victims, most recently in November 2020 when archaeologists unearthed two bodies, believed to be of a young slave and his master.  “Modern excavation techniques help us to better understand the inferno that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii over two days, killing many inhabitants”, archaeologist Zuchtriegel stated on Tuesday.

It is also three times brighter than the light emitted during tidal disruption events (TDEs) caused by supermassive black holes. The explosion occurred 8 billion light-years away when the universe was 6 billion years old. Initially detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility and later confirmed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the event's true scale and power were recently discovered.  AT2021lwx is believed to be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a massive cloud of gas, emitting bright electromagnetic radiation as shockwaves spread through the gas and a surrounding dust torus. While similar events have been observed before, AT2021lwx stands out due to its unprecedented scale. Although not as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, AT2021lwx has released more energy over its entire lifetime.  To determine the explosion's distance and brightness, the researchers used multiple telescopes and analyzed the emitted light's spectrum. AT2021lwx's exceptional brightness is comparable only to quasars emitted by supermassive black holes. Surprisingly, there were no previous detections of AT2021lwx, making its sudden appearance with the brightest intensity ever recorded a unique phenomenon.  While other explanations exist, the favored theory suggests a large cloud of hydrogen or dust was dislodged from its orbit and drawn into the black hole. Additional data collection and computer simulations will help confirm this hypothesis. The team plans to study the explosion in different light wavelengths, including X-rays, to understand its temperature and driving processes.  The researchers are eager to discover more events like AT2021lwx with the help of upcoming facilities such as the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Understanding these rare but highly energetic events could provide insights into the evolution of galaxy centers over time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvYmlnZ2VzdC1leHBsb3Npb24tZXZlci10aGlzLWFzdG91bmRpbmctc3BhY2UtZXJ1cHRpb24tbGFzdGVkLTMteWVhcnMtY29tcHV0ZXJzLXN0aWxsLWF0LXdvcmstNzE2ODQyNDExMzcyOTguaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC90ZWNoL2JpZ2dlc3QtZXhwbG9zaW9uLWV2ZXItdGhpcy1hc3RvdW5kaW5nLXNwYWNlLWVydXB0aW9uLWxhc3RlZC0zLXllYXJzLWNvbXB1dGVycy1zdGlsbC1hdC13b3JrLTcxNjg0MjQxMTM3Mjk4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was a scene of pure chaos and confusion for the residents of Pompeii during the infamous eruption of the volcano that showered the city with pumice, ash and hot, poisonous gasses.  Earthquakes, too, struck fear in those who were trying to escape.  4 CLASSIC TYPES OF VOLCANOES  This includes the two new victims discovered under a collapsed wall during an excavation of the Insula of the House of Chaste Lovers at the archaeological site, according to a news release.  The two victims, whom archeologists estimated to be about 55 years old, were found lying on one side of a utility room that likely wasn’t being used at the time of the eruption due to repairs or renovation work that was underway.  There they had taken refuge in an attempt to protect themselves from the eruption.

The skeletons were recovered from a building known as the “House of the Painters at Work”, and are probably of two men in their 50s who died in an earthquake that accompanied the eruption, a ministry statement said.  Pompeii Archaeological Park Director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said they were killed not by volcanic ash but by collapsing buildings, noting that wall fragments were found between their fractured bones.  “Modern excavation techniques help us to better understand the inferno that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii over two days, killing many inhabitants”, the German archaeologist said.  Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to about 13,000 people when it was buried under ash, pumice pebbles and dust as it endured the force of an eruption in the year 79 AD equivalent to many atomic bombs.  The Culture Ministry said “at least 15-20% of the population” was killed. Over the past two and a half centuries, archaeologists have recovered the remains of more than 1,300 victims.

Residents say the school, which sat vacant for 20 years, should have been torn down a long time ago.  ""They should have been doing something with that school a long time ago. And this is what we got right here today,"" said Derrick Smith of Trenton.  According to Mayor Reed Gusciora, the building was under the control of the Trenton Board Of Education and there were tentative plans for it to be turned into senior housing.  No injuries were reported.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vdHJlbnRvbi1maXJlLW5qLW5ldy1qZXJzZXktbWVyY2VyLWNvdW50eS8xMzI1MTI2MC_SAVBodHRwczovLzZhYmMuY29tL2FtcC90cmVudG9uLWZpcmUtdmFjYW50LXNjaG9vbC1vbGQtanVuaW9yLWhpZ2gtbWxrLWpyLzEzMjUxMjYwLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Five years ago, the center said the Celtics ""always kick our a**"" — and the words rang true again on Sunday.  2 Joel Embiid's past comments about the Boston Celtics' dominance over the Philadelphia 76ers resurfaced after the Celtics eliminated the Sixers from the 2023 NBA Playoffs Credit: Getty Images - Getty  2 Boston sealed an Eastern Conference Finals victory over Philly with a 24-point win in Sunday's game 7 Credit: Getty Images - Getty  Boston eliminated Philly after a dominant 112-88 win in Game 7 of the NBA's Eastern Conference Semifinals.  Jayson Tatum carried the Celtics to victory with a historic 51-point performance, scoring the most points in a Game 7 ever.  Tatum broke the record that Steph Curry set at 50 when the Golden State Warriors triumphed in a first-round series over the Sacramento Kings just two weeks ago.  And as the Sixers' postseason ended, Embiid's past comments about Boston's superiority over Philly resurfaced on social media.  ""This is not a rivalry,"" the Cameroon-born big man said after the Sixers' season-opening loss to the Celtics in October 2018.  ""I don’t know our record against them but it’s pretty bad. They always kick our a**.""  The Sixers have won just 16 of 51 games against the Celtics since Philadelphia drafted Embiid in 2014.  They've lost all three postseason series with Boston during that time, falling in 12 of the 18 playoff clashes the two teams have played.  Philly hasn't beaten the Celtics in a playoff series since 1982 when they reached the NBA Finals before losing to the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers in six games.  The Sixers started the 2023 East semifinals without Embiid, who nursed a knee injury after a first-round sweep of the Brooklyn Nets.  Still, they won Game 1 thanks to a 45-point eruption from James Harden.  With the newly-anointed NBA MVP back on the court, Philadelphia managed to push Boston to the brink of elimination with a Game 5 victory at TD Garden.  But the Celtics forced Game 7 on the road before steamrolling their opponents in the win-or-go-home clash on Sunday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0LzgxMjIzMzQvam9lbC1lbWJpaWQtY29tbWVudHMtY2VsdGljcy1zaXhlcnMtMjAyMy1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vc3BvcnQvODEyMjMzNC9qb2VsLWVtYmlpZC1jb21tZW50cy1jZWx0aWNzLXNpeGVycy0yMDIzLW5iYS1wbGF5b2Zmcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sources said trouble began some students uploaded scenes from the Hindi movie, “The Kerala Story”, on a WhatsApp “study group” late Sunday evening with comments saying it was “worth watching”. Others in the group reacted to it saying that they do not agree.  Among the injured, four students are said to be from Jammu and one from Kashmir. They were identified as Haseeb of Bhaderwah, who suffered head injuries in the clash while four others--Arunesh, Akshit, Aniket, and Omar Farooq-- received minor injuries.  The WhatsApp conversation quickly escalated into a fight between two hostel groups that included first-year through final-year batch students. However, both sides claimed responsibility for starting the altercation, which, according to the police, also included some outsiders. The students said the seniors and some outsiders later attacked Kashmiri students. “The second attack took place after some outsiders also barged into the college at 3 am,” said another Kashmiri student.  The principal of the Government Medical College has termed the incident as ""unfortunate"" and assured students that appropriate action will be taken against those responsible to maintain peace in the institute.  “The hostel warden has given two reports of the clash and the security has also been augmented. Further, eight faculty members each for the UG and PG hostels will spend the next three nights with the students. They will have dinner with them and interact with them to know their problems,” she added.  Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jammu Chandan Kohli said an investigation into the matter is underway.  ""There has been an incident of scuffle between some students and outsiders in GMC hostel Jammu. Cognizance of the matter has been taken and an investigation is going on,"" the SSP said.  This morning, a number of students even skipped class to protest the incident outside the GMC hospital. They wanted an investigation and demanded that the offenders be dealt with properly.

Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Anfield will erupt in applause on Saturday in tribute to tireless Hillsborough campaigner and former Liverpool ECHO journalist Dan Kay.  Dan passed away suddenly earlier this month at the age of 45, prompting an enormous outpouring of grief and love for a man who touched a huge number of lives with his work, his campaigning and his friendship.  Hundreds of people attended Dan's funeral on Friday at Broadgreen Jewish Cemetery before a moving service took place at the Princes Road Synagogue last night (Sunday). Dan was a leading figure in the city's Jewish community.  READ MORE: Tributes to 'extraordinary' writer and campaigner whose 'love for Liverpool was unmatched'  Dan pioneered digital journalism at the ECHO but many will remember him for his work campaigning for justice for all those affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and for the unflinching support he provided to the families of those who died on that awful day in Sheffield.  This work will be noted down permanently in the records of the House of Parliament after Wirral South MP Alison McGovern paid tribute to Dan in the House of Commons last week.  Dan's other major passion was for Liverpool Football Club. His encyclopaedic knowledge of LFC and its illustrious history has been commented on by many since his death.  With Dan's commitment to the club and the Hillsborough families, it is hugely pertinent that a minute's applause at Anfield is now being organised by some of those most affected by the disaster.  Charlotte Hennessy, who was just six when her dad died in the tragedy, has been a leading campaigner for justice for the Hillsborough families. She took to Twitter to announce the planned tribute to Dan.  She said that she and Dan's friends, with the blessing of Dan's family, would like to honour his life with an applause at Anfield during Liverpool's final home game of the season versus Aston Villa, which kicks off at 3pm.  The applause will begin as the clock strikes 7 minutes and Charlotte explained that this number was chosen for a number of reasons. She said: ""For those wondering, the number 7 was particularly special to Dan. It is one of the greatest power numbers in Judaism and it was also, of course, the number of his beloved @kennethdalglish. So it felt the most fitting to Dan.""  She added: ""Dan was a life long red who did so much for Hillsborough families/survivors.""  Speaking about the planned Anfield applause, Dan's cousin Amos Waldman told the ECHO: ""We are delighted that Dan will get the hero's goodbye he deserves so much at a place and from people who meant so much to him. He would be absolutely stoked but probably a bit embarrassed. YNWA. RIP Dan Kay.""

"eruption","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Mon 15 May 2023 00:13:23","By Jimmy Golen  BOSTON — Jayson Tatum gave Boston a long-overdue fast start and followed it up with a finish the NBA had never seen before.  After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. “It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds, and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” first-year Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting in a largely anonymous showing, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for the 76ers. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year and the fifth time in six seasons. They have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. … I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,” Brown said. “He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  BANGED-UP BROWN  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  WHAT’S UP, DOC?  Rivers is 6-10 in Game 7s. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL’s Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: “Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,” Embiid said. “We’ve got what it takes to win. … I still believe me and him have the chance to win.

The most seriously injured, a female, was rescued by Anderson Police officers from the midst of the chaos who then stopped the bleeding from her wounds to help deliver the victim to a local hospital before she was airlifted to Indianapolis for more intensive care.  The oldest victims were 21 years old, the youngest was a 14-year-old boy.  ”Gunshots like a war. Like a war,” said Bobbie Taylor, owner of Sonny Ray’s, a longtime nightclub at the corner of 16th Street and Madison Avenue. “I looked out and that’s when I saw all the police down here. And the ambulance. When I peeked out the window when I heard the gunshots, I saw people running.”  Five of the victims transported themselves to Anderson hospitals.  Investigators found witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, leaving detectives to rely on pole-mounted surveillance cameras.  “Usually we get our best evidence on Facetime live, facetime posts actually showing some of the shootings,” said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings. “That’s what usually happens.”  Cummings said the same intersection was the site of another mass shooting in the summer of 2022 that left two dead among the five wounded.  ”Its crowds and kids, it really is,” said Cummings. “And kids with guns at two or three in the morning is a formula for a serious problem.”  Taylor said the violence happens in the street involving minors too young to come into her bar.  ”This is where people come and hang out,” she said. “This has been going on for years. Everybody’s got guns out here. A lot of us are scared because you see 14 and 15-year-olds walking down the street with extended clips hanging out. And as a business owner, what are we to do?”  Taylor was joined by several supporters and other business owners, police, pastors, the Anderson chapter of the Ten Point Coalition and neighbors at a rally outside the bar Sunday night.  ”I think there should be some kind of curfew called to where after a certain time, and I feel the police should be able to stop if they see somebody walking down the street and they look like they’re 10, 13-years-old with extended clips hanging out their pockets,” she said. “I feel like they should be able to stop them, ID them or whatever. They’re not old enough. Take them home, take those guns to their parents or whatever.”  Aside from Cummings, noticeably absent from the rally the night after the shootings were the political leadership of Anderson including Mayor Thomas Broderick, Jr., who recently squeezed through his party’s primary election, and the city councilor who represents Anderson’s west side, as residents debated among themselves as to a solution to the crowds, violence and disruption that they say is common several nights a week once the weather turns warm.  ”There need to be signs out here and hire enforcement and not let those big crowds congregate out here,” said Cummings as he surveyed the private parking lot where crowds and vehicles gather. “As soon as nice weather comes out on the weekends, that’s what usually happens.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvNi13b3VuZGVkLWluLWFuZGVyc29uLW1hc3Mtc2hvb3Rpbmcv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1OS5jb20vbmV3cy82LXdvdW5kZWQtaW4tYW5kZXJzb24tbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"eruption","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Yorktown"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Sun 14 May 2023 00:11:16","YORKTOWN, Ind. — Brian Dudley said the tension was so thick, a ""haze was forming.""  Wapahani and Delta were in a classic pitcher's duel, locked at 1-1 after five innings and fighting for Saturday's Delaware County baseball championship at Yorktown High School. Raiders senior Gavin Lash and Eagles junior Kayden Thomas repeatedly exchanged blows on the mound, and neither offense could muster a breakthrough hit with runners on base.  Then, with two outs in the top of the sixth inning, Wapahani senior and former Eagle Daniel Blevins crushed one into the night sky and over the left field wall, erupting his team's dugout as the two-run homer gave the Raiders a lead they'd never relinquish.  ""I was just trying to put something in the gap,"" Blevins said. ""Saw fastball in, got around on it.""  ""I don't think I stopped screaming until the inning was over,"" Lash said. ""It was amazing. He hit the cap out of that ball.""  Senior Paul Fisher added a sac fly RBI in the top of the seventh frame to give Wapahani some extra breathing room, and Lash closed out his complete-game effort to top Delta 4-1 for the Raiders' second county title in three seasons.  It was a true team effort as the contest could've went either way on several occasions. Each team tallied six hits, played good defense and got top-notch pitching performances, yet Wapahani made the key plays when it mattered most.  That has, uncharacteristically, not been the case for the Raiders for much of this season. While the program has been a perennial powerhouse under 40-year head coach Brian Dudley, Wapahani began 2023 with a 9-8-1 record, a stark contrast to the team's 20-plus-win campaigns every year since 2018.  Graduating multiple key contributors from last season's regional-championship squad was a significant factor in the slow start, but Dudley, Lash and Blevins all alluded to a lack of chemistry as well.  It wasn't until two weeks ago that Dudley felt his boys ""got tired of losing"" and finally came together to play for one another. Their ""timely hitting"" is coming around, and they've won five straight games ever since.  ""We kind of were playing for ourselves to start,"" Blevins said. ""But now I think we're finally a team, and I love it.""  ""We lost to everyone in this county except Cowan in the regular season,"" Lash said. ""We have very good talent, more talent than a lot of teams do, and we are starting to finally play together and play for each other and play as brothers.""  More:Cowan wins first Delaware County softball championship in program history  Lash spearheaded Wapahani's opening and concluding Delaware County tournament victories. He tossed his first career no-hitter in Tuesday's 3-0 win against Daleville and rose to the occasion in the championship, pitching a complete game with seven strikeouts to just five hits allowed.  His lone walk and earned run came in the fourth inning with the bases loaded, a moment when the game could've easily swung in Delta's favor. The circumstances, which might've unraveled a less seasoned pitcher, only heightened Lash's focus as he tallied the final two outs of the frame to escape with the game tied 1-1.  ""I kept my composure really good and I felt completely in control the whole game,"" Lash said.  More:Delta track and field wins Delaware County title; 9 records broken overall by all teams  Dudley said that moment embodied the player Lash has become. Previously a significant piece on two of the program's best teams in recent history, Lash has developed into the steady senior presence the Raiders needed during their rough start.  Even if his statistics haven't been as eye-catching this season as in previous ones, his talent and experience gives his team an edge in key situations.  ""He's starting to understand that everybody will feed off him,"" Dudley said. ""He's kept his composure a lot better, especially this year.""  Lash and Blevins wouldn't have gotten the chance to shine, however, if not for Wapahani's comeback 5-3 semifinal win against Yorktown on Thursday, a game played two days earlier than originally scheduled due to weather.  In the original tournament format, Lash likely would've faced the Tigers instead. But with matchup moved up, sophomore Nate Luce got the start and did well, allowing three runs, two earned, over four innings.  Senior Daxton Dudley threw the final three innings in relief, allowing just one hit and zero runs. Down 3-1 after the fourth frame, his shutdown showing gave the Raiders' offense the necessary time to find a rhythm in the box and they exploded for four runs over the fifth and sixth innings to complete a comeback victory.  ""Those guys were awesome because that's a very good team,"" Dudley said of Luce and Daxton. ""Yorktown was the favorite coming in, and I pulled them aside after the game and said, 'You guys did one heck of a job,' because one through nine they can hit. We just kept them off base and kept fighting and scored at the end.""  Luce was a major contributor again against Delta, hitting 3-for-3 and making a key defensive play at shortstop. Wapahani played sound defense all evening, highlighted by senior Joe Foster's diving catch in centerfield in the second inning that stranded an Eagles runner on base.  Every play was significant against the ""good young group"" that is Delta, according to Dudley, especially since the Eagles (8-14) have recovered from a 1-8 start to this spring.  Dudley said defense and pitching have been the team's strengths all season, and Lash commended his teammates for their continued commitment to that facet of the game.  ""They really helped me out. For example, I wouldn't have had that no-hitter without some good plays that we made,"" Lash said. ""Everyone trusts each other and they play their hearts out for me.""  Wapahani has just five more games scheduled before the postseason begins, and the Raiders hope this tournament title springboards the group toward another postseason run.  The Radiers passed this test and will need to continue playing with chemistry and confidence to achieve their goals. In the short term, they'll celebrate adding another trophy to their illustrious program, one that Lash feels more proud of than than the county championship they won two years ago.  ""As a sophomore, we were very, very good, so we kind of just ran through teams, and this year we've got to work for a little bit more,"" Lash said. ""We've got to trust each other more. So it, honestly, felt better this time.""  Delaware County baseball tournament galleries  Gus Martin is a sports reporter at The Star Press.

It was so important for me to do something good in such complex and difficult days,"" said the 23-year-old Jewish judoka, after her dramatic victory in the 78 kg final over Frenchwoman Audrey Tschumeau.  It was the first time in her senior career that Lanir stood on the first place podium, and there is nothing sweeter than doing it in the most prestigious international competition. Although she was marked from a young age as a potential star, she was not able to make the long-awaited breakthrough since she won the European Under-23 Championship three years ago.  In the eyes of the Qatari audience, though, exactly at the moment of truth – about a year before the Paris Olympics – everything was released and Israeli judoka received a tremendous shot of encouragement.  The achievement came during a difficult year for the Jewish athlete. In the previous world championship she was eliminated in her first fight, and her participation in the Tel Aviv Grand Slam ended in tears after she lost in the battle for bronze. On Friday, the tears that flowed were of pure happiness. And how could she not be? She is the second Israeli woman in the sport to be crowned world champion, after her role model Yarden Gerbi did it 10 years before her.  A winning bet  Lanir is considered an attractive judoka, one who tends to take risks in matches. It can lead her to impressive wins like in Doha, or end up in a quick loss as has happened to her quite a few times. This time the bet had a big payoff: She was aggressive in all five of her bouts and showed particularly good offense. It was not a tactical style, and she did not try to extract penalties from her opponent.  3 View gallery Inbar Linor tests her gold medal ( Photo: Karim Jaafar / AFP )  Lanir was born in Yokne'am in northern Israel before moving with her family to Yehud, where she began her journey in judo. As a young girl, it was not clear what direction she would take. She loved ballet very much, but when she got on the judo mat for the first time it was clear that this was something to consider.  At a certain point her mother pressured her to give judo a chance in light of the positive feedback she received from the coaches. And so, Lanir would come to training in ballet clothes, throw a white uniform over them, and immediately become a tough warrior. Lanir says that ballet actually helped her in judo and improved her ability to move.  Lanir acknowledges that she was a hyperactive child, so she also experimented with sports such as floor gymnastics and aerial acrobatics, but judo attracted her more than anything - even though she was still in a dilemma. Her childhood coach, Shimi Assor, said: ""Inbar came to training in ballet clothes and told me that she was debating whether to quit because she was told that judo is a boy's sport. I told her that soon there will be the Israeli judo championships, and let's see what happens after that.""  In a post she published on Instagram, Lanir spoke openly about dealing with body image as a female judoka: ""I wasn't ready to lift a barbell that weighed more than 2 kg. and whose color wasn't pink. I was afraid to be muscular. I was afraid to look masculine. It was important to me to be beautiful; my dream was that the boys in the class would fight over who would invite me to slow dance at the bat mitzvah. I believed that if my hands were bigger than theirs, it would lessen my chances.""  3 View gallery Inbar Linor at the World Judo championships ( Photo: Karim Jafaar / AFP )  Lanir went on to describe the moment she decided to change course: ""My mother took me to see the Israel Senior Championships. I sat there mesmerized. The matches did not interest me at that moment. My eyes were locked on the sidelines where all the athletes of the national team were gathered. I studied every millimeter of their bodies, which of course were covered in judo suits, which made me continue my detective work at home. I memorized their names and looked them all up on Facebook. I went through photo after photo until I found one athlete who had a photo in a dress. And she looked just great. I was really surprised. She was very feminine and cute, and she had muscles, but she was really beautiful. A week later I went to the gym and started lifting weights. My arms grew bigger, and the terrible disaster I feared did not happen.""  Lanier adds that ""I continued to dress the way I like, and dress up and put on makeup, and feel feminine and beautiful. To this day, I stand in front of the mirror and flatter myself. Because my muscles are my most beautiful jewelry. So, I'm writing this post for the 12-year-old girl I was. For those girls who are debating whether to take the heavier weight because they are afraid of how their body will look. Being strong is so beautiful, and true beauty comes from within. And when you stand with the medal around your neck in the most important competition of your life, you will thank yourself for the decision to choose to be strong.""  Hard work to go pro  So, Lanir overcame her fears and found herself on Israel's national team at the age of 13. Of course, the commitment to becoming a professional judoka had a price: the competitions on Saturday, giving up the annual school trips and parties on the weekends. She was absent from high school quite a bit due to morning training, but in the end she finished her high school requirements on her own.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnluZXRuZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvcjFxaWhjcnZo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Wolverines had been trading goals with No. 8 Cornell all game, neither team ever able to amass a lead greater than two. Pushed into sudden death overtime, Michigan knew it was now or never as the Wolverines fought to keep their dream-like season alive — and yet they weren’t worried.  “We tend to feel comfortable being uncomfortable,” Thompson said.  Down an elite attacker and one of its best facilitators, sophomore Ryan Cohen, and with senior attacker Josh Zawada effectively neutralized by the Big Red’s All-American defenseman Gavin Adler, Michigan needed someone to step up and score. Junior attacker and All-Big Ten First Team awardee Michael Boehm seemed the logical pick, especially coming off the hat trick that solidified him as the program’s single-season goal record holder.  Luckily for Michigan, Cornell thought so too.  Just over a minute into overtime, Boehm skirted the endline, looking for an opening and taking short jabs towards the crease. Graduate attacker Bryce Clay set a screen for Boehm behind the Big Red’s goal, rolling out to the left wing as his defender attempted to double-team the star scorer. As the defenders converged on Boehm, he whipped the ball over to Clay, who rocketed it into the pocket of Thompson. On a beautiful cut in from the wing, Thompson’s momentum propelled the ball into the net, and the Wolverines erupted from the sideline.  “It’s been a plethora of guys all season,” Thompson said. “(Michigan offensive coordinator Scott) Bieda … does a great job of going with the hot hand sometimes, and … I guess that was me today.”  Thompson stepped up at multiple moments during Sunday’s NCAA Tournament matchup, beginning in the very first quarter. With just over a minute left in the first period, he took a long shot from the wing, knotting the score up at four before the quarter break.  “(Thompson)’s the Energizer Bunny,” Michigan coach Kevin Conry said. “Not only has he contributed significantly with points and playing time, but his energy on a day in and day out basis has really boosted our roster. It’s been great.”  Three quarters later, both teams seemed to be running out of gas — except for Thompson. Notching two goals, only 36 seconds apart, to lock in a hat trick and give Michigan the lead with less than five minutes to go, he provided the jolt of energy the Wolverines had been lacking. Unfortunately for Michigan, though, Cornell found its second wind as well.  Ground balls turned into football-style runs, with bodies and sticks flying. Another Boehm goal led to him getting kneed in the head in front of the crease. The first and only penalty of the game, a holding by Michigan, was called. But neither team could seal the deal. The whistle blew for overtime just as the Wolverines managed to get the ball away from the Big Red.  “They were dog tired,” Conry said.  Thompson, living up to his “Energizer Bunny” persona, shocked Michigan back into rhythm with his fourth and final goal in overtime. The Wolverines stormed the field to the sound of The Victors echoing over Schoellkopf Field — their mythical season (and chance at a national championship) still alive.  “I think the guys have so much belief this year that … the fruits of our labors are going to come to fruition,” Thompson said.  Any garden takes time to flourish, as long as one is willing to put in the work required. Last year, Michigan did a lot of the weeding. Sunday, it was Thompson’s turn to break through the ivy and bloom. And as the Wolverines use the victory to climb higher and higher up the trellis of the NCAA Tournament, facing No. 1 Duke next Sunday, they can only hope that the season they’ve been cultivating comes up roses.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2hpZ2FuZGFpbHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sYWNyb3NzZS9wZXRlci10aG9tcHNvbi1jdXRzLXRocm91Z2gtY29ybmVsbC1pbi1taWNoaWdhbnMtb3ZlcnRpbWUtdGhyaWxsZXItd2luL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
