Lyndsey McAteer had gastric sleeve surgery to shrink her stomach by 80 per cent in a bid to reach her target weight of 13 stone after a treatment plan and a pregnancy caused her to pile on the pounds.  The mum-of-two, who has endured gruelling chemotherapy and a mastectomy, is now determined to get in shape to tie the knot with her fiancé Martin O’Connor next year.  Lyndsey, from Renfrew, is also training to take part in Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life.  She said: “I still have some weight to lose, but I’m feeling great after losing eight and half stone since my surgery last September.  “I’m getting married next year so I’m determined to get in shape and I’m looking forward to doing Race for Life, I can’t wait. It’s going to be an amazing day and a great way to mark 10 years of being clear of cancer.”  It will be an emotional moment for Lyndsey when she stands on the start line at Glasgow Green ahead of the 5k on May 21. The 40-year-old, who was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at just 29, knows exactly how vital it is to raise funds for life-saving research.  She took part in her first Race for Life event in May 2013 just two days after her fourth chemotherapy treatment for the disease, and when Lyndsey returned to take part in the event the following year, she met Martin.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey after chemo  Lyndsey after chemo (Image: Supplied)  This year, her sons Harris, 12, and Ellis, seven, are joining her alongside her best friend Ruth Coulter.

Now he’s at high school and I can’t believe where that time has gone. Race for Life will always have a special place in my heart, but I know being there will bring back a lot of memories. It’s a chance to say thank you, to pause for a moment and to take in everything that’s happened in my life. Life has been a rollercoaster these past 10 years but I feel blessed to be here.”  Story continues  Lyndsey was a single mum to two-year-old Harris when she found a lump in her left breast. Just four days before Christmas in 2012, tests confirmed she had breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and marked her 30th birthday in hospital recovering from surgery.  Before beginning chemotherapy at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, doctors warned the treatment could make her infertile. She was offered the chance to have her eggs frozen but decided against it.  Lyndsey said: “I already had my son Harris.  “I decided not to freeze my eggs as I didn’t want to delay the chemotherapy starting. Doctors told me there was a high chance of the cancer coming back so I wanted to get the treatment started as soon as possible.”  After chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Lyndsey finished treatment in October 2013. And in early 2015, Lyndsey received a wonderful surprise when she fell pregnant naturally with Ellis, who was born in November. Then, to mark five years free of cancer in 2017, on the anniversary of her diagnosis on December 21, Martin proposed.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor  Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor (Image: Supplied)  Lyndsey added: “I was overjoyed.  “Some wonderful things have come from something so awful. When I had chemotherapy treatment at 29, I feared I’d never have another child. But my focus at that time had been fighting cancer. That’s why when Ellis came along he really was a little miracle and a sign that cancer didn’t win.”  Race for Life, in partnership with headline sponsor Standard Life, is an inspiring series of 3k, 5k, 10k, Pretty Muddy and Pretty Muddy Kids events which raise millions of pounds every year to help beat cancer by funding crucial research. To mark the 30th year of Race for Life and participants will receive a special medal to mark the milestone.

The West Hollywood Sheriff’s Department announced that they are currently investigating a burglary by an unknown number of suspects at a hotel in the 9000 block of Sunset Boulevard and the victim is a “well-known celebrity.” It has not been confirmed if this case is the same or related.

Naturally, air-conditioned halls and banquets are in high demand for weddings,” says Aman Chopra, a city-based wedding planner. Here’s a low-down on how city folks tend to weatherproof their wedding planning:Suparna Sarkar , associate VP of a popular wedding destination, said swimming pool venues are in high demand now. “Mehendi, haldi and bachelor parties can be set up around pools quite easily. Clients are also trying to wrap up outdoor rituals early in the morning when the heat is bearable,” she said. Many are also picking summer-friendly menus. “Clients are opting for lighter meals,” said Rongon Neogi from a city catering service. “Fish and chicken dishes are replacing mutton,” he added.""Keeping the weather in mind, we have opted for an AC banquet and tweaked the menu to keep it light. Many continental dishes have been added. I also plan to go for light makeup so that it doesn’t become messy,"" said Misty Singh , who’s getting married tomorrow.Pooja Sengupta, who married Sourabh Thakur in Kolkata last week, says they had to do all rituals indoors because of the weather. The newly-weds headed out to Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday for their reception.Manoj Kheria, another wedding planner, anticipates a crunch in AC banquet halls during the upcoming season. “Getting AC banquets for weddings has become next to impossible. Some of our clients have postponed weddings and are opting for destination weddings at hill stations due to the heat. Shorter guest lists are again in vogue like the pandemic days.” To this Aman added, “The guest list is shorter because hill stations don’t offer as many accommodation options as Kolkata or other metros.”Aman shares that outdoor rituals are being curated more cautiously. “We have to ensure that all venues are well-ventilated so that people don’t fall sick. Water sprinklers are being used for haldi rituals. For rituals happening outdoors, we are covering the area and installing temporary ACs and pedestal fans. We are arranging for daaber jol, lassi, fruit juice, ORS, nimbu paani and water along with hats and wet towels. Keeping hats with names of guests inscribed on them is the latest trend.”"

Chuppot, an organization that provides private religious services and challenges Israel's Chief Rabbinate, has officially celebrated more than 1,000 weddings conducted.  The organization reported a 30% increase in inquiries to those from last year. Chuppot organizes marriages legally outside of the official rabbinical establishment. Now, couples from across Israel can seek other ways to seek their marriage contract through official methods without jumping through additional hoops.  The reported increase in marriage requests can be attributed to several factors, but the organization believes this can best be attributed to the current state of uncertainty in Israel. As the atmosphere in Israel has recently been identified as tense, especially regarding those of political and religious significance, many Israelis have sought other opportunities to seek marriages.  Though many Israelis identify as Jewish and follow Jewish tradition, they may find it tough to differentiate between their religious identities and that of government actions. Marriage falls into this category. With the push for Israel's judicial reform, secular Israelis and non-Jewish residents and citizens of the Jewish state find themselves grappling with the laws of a ""halachic state.""  Providing suitable alternatives for the Israeli public  As a result, Chuppot has stepped in to provide a legal alternative for those wishing to be married in the holy land, while removing one official step. Since Israelis may later have to deal with the rabbinate for other reasons, Chuppot acts as a different messenger.  Rabbi Aaron Leibowitz, president and founder of Chuppot, made note of the increase. ""Every year we are aware of a consistent increase in inquiries and demands for the service we offer. This year, we've seen a drastic increase in the number of inquiries and interest in the weddings we conduct. These have come in just a few months, towards the end of the Omer and the beginning of the summer wedding season,"" he said.  ""Chuppot as an organization has set itself the goal of 'being a rabbi where there is no rabbi,' according to the religion of Moses and Israel, even if this means that he will not be registered for marriage with the chief rabbinate, Leibowitz added. ""Our activity is carried out of an absolute commitment to Halacha and the laws of Orthodox Judaism. All rabbinic activity within the project is committed to Halacha and takes place without breaking its boundaries.  ""In cases where the couples encounter a difficult and discriminatory policy, the treatment they receive in chuppahs is open and friendly - one that will allow each couple to express their wishes in the design of the canopy and the ceremony.""  Rivka Arbiv, CEO of Chuppot, elaborated on the different types of couples approaching the organization. ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah. These couples chose to make a 'turn,' to recalculate a route and find a solution that would allow them to hold a Jewish-religious ceremony, but to be freed from the shackles of dependence on the rabbinate.""  Arbiv continued, ""There are also couples who choose an alternative to the rabbis for ideological reasons - beginning with the desire to design a more egalitarian or feminist chuppah ceremony. Some are just tired of the Rabbinate.""  ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah."" Rivka Arbiv  Arbiv says that couples fearful of religious coercion have significantly contributed to the increase in these numbers."

""When I got off the phone, I said, 'I think Kensington Palace just called me?' Two days later I was sitting in front of [Harry and Meghan] talking concepts,"" the celebrated photographer exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week's issue.  Lubomirski, 47, looks back at the commission — which he initially thought was a prank — in his new book The Sittings (2003-2023), a collection of 113 of his favorite portraits. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's engagement photos are included in the spread, alongside his images of their royal wedding day in May 2018. Reflecting on how it all came together, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE that the original call came on an emotional day for his family.  L: Caption . PHOTO: Alexi Lubomirski R: Caption .

And then my poor brother and sister were looking at me on the phone because it was after 10 hours of waiting for the doctor to call. So I got on the phone and my face was like, 'I'm sorry, what?' My poor brother and sister were like, 'Oh my God, what's happened to our mum?' "" he says.  Their mother went on to a successful recovery, and Lubomirski had the honor of snapping Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, at Frogmore House for their engagement in December 2017. The British photographer tells PEOPLE he was inspired by an iconic shot of Audrey Hepburn's husband Mel Ferrer wrapping her in his coat, and he asked Harry to do the same with his then-fiancée.  ""It just popped in my head because I saw his overcoat and I said, 'Can you put that on?' And then everything just starts folding together,"" he tells PEOPLE of the creative process.  Ed Feingersh/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty  That spring, Lubomirski was called back to Windsor Castle to shoot Prince Harry and Meghan's historic royal wedding, summing it up as ""probably the most high-pressure job"" he's had to date.  ""That was a blur,"" recalls the photographer, himself the descendant of a Polish princely house. ""I got about two hours of sleep the night before, thinking to myself, 'Okay, do I have everything? How am I going to get everyone in place? How am I going to make the Queen smile?' ""  Given time constraints, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE there wasn't a second to spare — so he inventively made the most of his time with the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  ""I'd only had three minutes to get them into the garden, take pictures, and it took three minutes to get them to the garden,"" he says. ""And there was one shot of the couple sitting in the rose garden, which is an image that I got. It was that first time they were alone, as in out of the public site after being married.

But what many viewers noticed was that there were no guests - children included.  Although the couple later explained that the adult guests were, in fact, in the room, they had banned any kids from attending their wedding.  This, the love duo added, was to ensure the photos came out perfect.  As well as stunning snaps, the couple and their guests would also be able to enjoy a heart-warming and emotional ceremony without children dashing around, they noted.  ''Nothing worse than a screaming kid while the bride is walking down the aisle,'' the two went on in the caption.  The clip soon racked up more than 7million views, as social media users flocked to comments for a debate.  But despite some deeming the move ''controversial'' and some parents saying they wouldn't show up without their tots, others reckoned the couple had every right to ban children.  ''Just got home from a no kids wedding. It was awesome!'' a guest said.  Someone else agreed: ''Even if kids are allowed, I still don’t bring mine. What for?

He is now slated to become the first person to retain his membership with the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam while marrying a woman from outside the sect. The marriage of Justin with Vijimol has already garnered much attention as the occasion is expected to mark the end of endogamy practised by the community.  After much wrangling with the administrators of his parish, St. Anne’s Church in Kottody, which even witnessed police intervention, the youth is now expected to receive a ‘vivaha kuri’ or consent on Thursday morning. “This is a difficult situation as I am keen on receiving a consent from my Church,” he said.  The stand hitherto  The development assumes significance as the Church has hitherto refused to acknowledge its members’ marriage to those from other sects and made them apply for Permission to Leave Eparchy of Kottayam (PLEK). Mr. Justine, however, could secure consent for his betrothal last month in view of a recent High Court order in this regard.  The Knanaya Catholic community traces its origin back to Jewish-Christian immigrant community that migrated from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar coast of Kodungallur in AD 345 under the leadership of merchant Thomas of Cana.  On August 29, 1911, Archeparchy of Kottayam, the only archdiocese for the Knanaya members, was formed through a Papal bull for the Knanaya community to maintain their ethnic identity. They formed an endogamous community by not allowing members to marry persons from other Christian communities.  Challenged in 1989  The practice was first challenged by Biju Uthup in 1989 when the Church refused permission for his marriage sacrament citing that Uthup’s grandmother did not belong to the Knanaya Church. The fight was eventually taken up by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samithi (KCNS), a reformation group.  On the basis of a petition filed by the KCNS on April 30, 2021, the additional subcourt in Kottayam had issued a decree of permanent injunction prohibiting termination of the membership of any person of the Knanaya archeparchy of Kottayam for marrying a Catholic from any other diocese. After an appeal against this order was dismissed by the district court, the Church approached the High Court for a stay on the judgement. A single Bench of Justice M.R. Anitha on March 10, however, declined to stay the lower court order but has agreed to hear the Kottayam archbishop’s concerns."

In general, wedding season extends from late spring and continues through early fall, with weddings peaking in June and September, per Brides.com. Most couples opt for Spring and early Fall weddings because temperatures are a bit more comfortable compared to the warmer or colder seasons. When it comes to weddings, some people scope out venues that offer affordability, space for guests, or a place that practically decorates itself with a stunning backdrop. That’s why many couples prefer getting married outdoors. Whether it be a private estate, a public area like a beach, or your own backyard, some cities may be a better option for an outdoor wedding. LawnLove.com compared 200 of the biggest U.S. cities based on eight categories to compile a list of the best cities for outdoor wedding venues. They looked at the quality of outdoor wedding venues, access to wedding planners, sunshine, and other metrics. Best cities for outdoor weddings.

The best venue access for outdoor weddings includes Charleston, South Carolina at number one, followed by Savannah (number. 4), Honolulu (number 15), New Orleans (number 10), St. Louis (number 14), and Las Vegas (number 13). The study found that some smaller cities and suburbs are not so great for nature-themed nuptials, such as Miramar, Florida (number 197), Newark, New Jersey (number 198), and North Las Vegas, Nevada (number 199). They said these cities generally lack venue access, high venue quality, accommodations, and wedding-look resources.

This would take hours as they would have to scroll to find a message that specifically said how they felt.  Now, couples and wedding guests are using Chatbots - and it saves hours.  It is no secret that the age of the AI (artificial intelligence) is upon us and is quickly spreading to all industries.  When most people think about AI, they think of the manipulation of images on social media, virtual weddings, robots taking over jobs that previously belonged to humans, etc.  However, they overlook areas and industries, like the wedding industry, for example.  Couples, who claim to not have the words to write their own wedding vows, have turned to Chatbots to generate it. Although many seem reluctant about this new development in technology, it is becoming widely popular in the wedding industry.    READ MORE | 200 hours, 4 months, 50 000 crystals: Designer's wedding dress sets new world record  According to the Wall Street Journal, ChatGPT is an artificial-intelligence chatbot that is developed by an AI research company, OpenAI, which was released in November last year.  Essentially, it is a language processing tool that is driven by AI technology, which allows you to have human-like conversations and much more, using the chatbot.  The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, like writing an essay, coding or even write wedding vows.  A popular wedding-planning website and app, Joy, has incorporated this AI tool to assist couples with writer's block when it comes to writing vows, speeches, toasts, thank-you notes and also coming up with wedding hashtags.    READ MORE | Bride's brother delivers cringeworthy and sentimental speech at her wedding  What do you think of using AI to write your wedding vows? Tell us your story here.          The wedding planning app and website generates vows by asking the person using it to highlight what they love the most about their partner. Then, afterwards, they choose the style of delivery, ranging from Shakespeare, friend, therapist, TikToker, Rumi to pessimistic ex.  For wedding speeches and toasts, the same approach is taken - but, instead of highlighting what you love the most about the couple, you would give details of a memorable story about the them.  It could include how they met, or how you found out that the couple was together. Then, you choose the style of delivery.  The CEO of Joy, Vishal Josh, says he is well aware of people's disapproval of using AI for such sentimental occasions.

""Getting those emotions onto paper is so much harder than any one of us acknowledges,"" Josh told Wired.  Now, although this may seem to be a daunting experience, always remember that it is no different than going on Google and copying a speech, toast or vows - and it is certainly no different than buying a card at the grocery store, with a generated message for Valentine's Day.

Lesbian genderqueer comedian Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in 2021. They introduced Shamash and shared their union in an April 2021 posted stating, “We got married in January and we are very chuffed about it. For the record: this is me gushing. I am full of very positive feelings.”  During their performance in Something Special, Gadsby shared the story of their novelty wedding cake. They said that they and Shamash specifically wanted to trick a Christian bakery into making their cake. They knew that they couldn’t outright ask for it, so they had to be clever.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake, and it worked. I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10.’ Easy, so gullible, will believe anything, Christians,” Gadsby recounts.  Because the cake had to be a novelty cake to divert from the idea that it was a wedding cake, the design they went with what two otters swimming together with a giant shark about to eat them.  Something Special is a departure from Gadsby’s previously serious and at times cynical style. They made a point to make this special a “feel-good show” as a “reprieve” for LGBTQ+ people, who are currently under attack.  “I want people to love what I love, and that’s what this special is,” Gadsby said. “I want people to love what I love, and that’s this moment in my life, that’s [Jenney] and that’s my ability to navigate an interpersonal relationship. And it’s also my ability to experience joy, which is not something I’ve been able to do historically.” They later added, “Other people who aren’t in the community, it’s not for them — they can enjoy it, it is possible — but this is for us.”"

Well, now you can do exactly that.  ""Every year there are folks that stop by and say I've lived here my whole life and I've never been here,"" said Julia Mueller, executive director for Linden Hill Historic Estate. Her group is responsible for preserving and sharing the history of the estate in Little Falls.  On a hill overlooking the mighty Mississippi sit two mansions. A white home belonged to Drew Musser, and a green one belonged to Charles Weyerhaeuser.  In the late 1800's the two men were lumber barons and good friends. So much so that they built mansions next to each other. And that's not all they built.  MORE FINDING MINNESOTA: Iron ore and baseball celebrated at Chisholm's Minnesota Museum of Mining  ""There's a carriage house and a barn and another carriage garage,"" said Mueller.  Their families lived here happily, for decades. When the Weyerhaeusers left, they essentially gave their mansion to the Mussers. By 1989, the families were gone and both homes were vacant. But that doesn't mean they were empty.  The green mansion has been turned into a museum, and pretty much everything you see is as it was 120 years ago. In fact, 95% of the furnishings are original.  ""We actually have over 15 sets of their dishes,"" said Mueller.  Each room offers a story of its own, but the basement tends to stand-out for other reasons.  When the Mussers took over the Weyerhaeuser home, they brought over a little bit of Hollywood. The family was good friends with L. Frank Baum, who wrote ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Laura Jane Musser developed a friendship with Margaret Hamilton - the actress best known as the Wicked Witch of the West. According to Mueller, they went to Hawaii together a number of times.  A stopover next door is another step back in time. Except that the white mansion is more a hands-on experience.  ""We pretty much give you the front door keys and you have full reign of this beautiful 12,00 square foot mansion,"" said Angela Imdieke, assistant director.  Family reunions, high school reunions, and even wedding parties frequently rent out the mansion, and the music room is a popular place.  Imdieke had her wedding here. Their reception was held at the Linden Hill pavilion, which used to be the site of a heated, in-ground pool that the Weyerhaeuser's built in 1910.  There are endless books for guests to peruse. And for those that do spend the night, there's no shortage of bedrooms either - they can sleep 25 people, comfortably.  The hope is that guests develop an appreciation for the past by spending a night in the past.  ""One of our frequently-used phrases around here is 'history matters.' And we want folks to be able to enjoy and interact with history in a positive way,"" said Mueller.  The city of Little Falls owns Linden Hill and it's on the National Register of Historic Places.

'It was a very small group there with us and some friends and family watching on a live stream,' Chrishell said.  Chrishell showed off her figure in a long white silk dress while G Flip wore a black suit by Melbourne-based designer E Nolan and white sneakers.

'Love doesn't always go as planned… Sometimes it's immeasurably better,' Chrishell captioned her post, while G-Flip commented: 'My darling, I adore and love you with all my heart.'  Chrishell first confirmed her romance with G-Flip on the Selling Sunset reunion in May 2022, but the pair first met back in October 2021.  She met G Flip when she starred in one of the singer's music videos in October 2021, and they immediately hit it off.

On the Selling Sunset reunion, Chrishell said: 'It started because I was just going to be in their video. And it's about this chaotic love story. I come from soaps, I love acting.  'And with the job that we have, I don't always get to do it. At first of course I was like, ''Yes, let's do that.'''  In March 2022, Chrishell attended one of G-Flip's LA concerts, praising their performance and writing on Instagram: 'I'm sad it's over. You KILLED IT.'  That same month the pair were spotted together at an Oscars after party, with a source telling US Weekly: 'They both were by themselves at a table and didn't interact much with others.'  The pair surprised fans with the unexpected news of their nuptials in an Instagram post on Wednesday night  Chrishell then finally confirmed her romance with G-Flip during the Selling Sunset reunion episode in May last year.  'I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me,' she told her stunned co-stars.  'Their name is G Flip. They're non-binary, so they go by they/them, and they are an extremely talented musician.'  Her ex Jason Oppenheim also showed his support, adding during the show: 'They seem like a badass, for one.

But whilst nothing could be said against Prince Philip's commitment to his wife and his country, his sisters did nothing to help boost his fledging reputation when he married the late Queen in 1947.  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from attending his wedding, in large part because three of them - Cecilie, Sophie and Margarita - had married German aristocrats who became leading members of the Nazi party.  Princess Sophie was even friends with Hermann Goering - the future head of Nazi Germany's air force - and had both Goering and Adolf Hitler round for tea.  Prince Philip's sister Princess Sophie is seen sitting opposite Adolf Hitler at the wedding of Hermann Goering  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from his wedding. From left to right, Princesses Sophie, Cecilie, Theodora and Margarita  Philip's real surname, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, signified the German blood that ran through his veins.  His father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, was descended from the German ducal house of the same name.  Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenburg, also had German heritage and spent part of her childhood in the country.  The Duke of Edinburgh assumed his mother's maternal surname - Mountbatten, an Anglicised version of the German 'Battenberg' - when he married Princess Elizabeth.  After Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, a 16-year-old Philip was famously pictured at her funeral in Germany walking alongside relatives in Nazi uniforms.  She was killed along with her newborn baby in Belgium aged just 26. The aircraft's pilot had been attempting to land in thick flog.  The depiction in The Crown of the aftermath of her death was slammed by critics for wrongly suggesting that Philip was blamed by his father for her demise.  The connections between Philip's family and the Nazis - facts that in no way called the Duke's own honour into question - were explored in a Channel 4 documentary in 2014.  It revealed the contents of a memoir written by Princess Sophie in old age, in which she told of a private lunch with Hitler and how she thought he had seemed like a 'charming and seemingly modest man'.

In a sign of their devotion to Nazism, Sophie and her husband named their first son Karl Adolf, in honour of Hitler.  Sophie also wrote in her memoir of how she Goering and Hitler had both visited her home.  Goering came for tea in her flat near Frankfurt before the Nazis came to power in 1933.  She wrote: 'He talked a lot about the new political party which he had joined, the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"".  'He was very enthusiastic about it all, especially about the party leader, a man called Adolf Hitler.  'As Germany was going through hard times and there was a lot of poverty and general dissatisfaction everywhere, we were interested to hear about the great improvements his party was planning to do.'  With Goering insistent that she should meet Hitler personally, the Nazi leader then also came to her flat.  'I had been warned he was a vegetarian, and found it difficult to plan an appropriate meal,' she added.  'In those days we had a cook-housekeeper, which was just as well, as my ideas about cooking and housekeeping were fairly hazy (being only 18 at the time).  'We settled for an assortment of vegetables which turned out to be a great success.'  Sophie was careful to mention how she and her husband changed their view of Hitler 'fundamentally' later on, but said they were impressed 'by this charming and seemingly modest man, and by his plans to change and improve the situation in Germany.'

Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg  Philip as a little boy with his mother Princess Alice of Battenburg and his father Prince Andrew of Greece  Princess Theodora of Greece and Count Berthold of Baden on their wedding day in 1931  The meetings prompted her husband to join the SS, and by 1935 he had been appointed as head of the air ministry's research bureau, according to Princess Sophie.  That year, Sophie was pictured at Goering's wedding, with Hitler seen opposite.  Eight years later, Prince Christoph was killed in a plane crash in 1943, after the Allied invasion of Sicily.  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, who was 16 years older then her brother, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.  He was badly wounded while fighting for Germany on the Russian front and ended up turning against Hitler.  The prince was then among the aristocratic German officers who were implicated in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, which was led by Claus von Stauffenberg.  Cecilie had married George Donatus, the Grand Duke of Hesse in 1931 and they both later joined the Nazi party. The couple had four children.  The fourth, an unnamed son, is believed to have been born during the flight on which the 26-year-old Cecilie lost her life.  Donatus was killed alongside his wife and the plane's other passengers.  Princess Theodora, who was 15 when Philip was born in 1921, was the only one of her brother's sisters who was publicly opposed to Nazism.  Unlike her sisters, she and her husband were allowed to attend the the Queen's Coronation in 1953.  But all Philip's siblings were excluded from the royal wedding in 1947, in large part because it was so soon after the war had ended.  In an interview for 2006 book Royals and the Reich, Philip said his family had found Hitler's attempts to restore Germany's power and status 'attractive'.  'There was a great improvement in things like trains running on time and building,' he explained.  'There was a sense of hope after the depressing chaos of the Weimar Republic.  'I can understand people latching on to something or somebody who appeared to be appealing to their patriotism and trying to get things going. You can understand how attractive it was.'  But the Duke did insist that he had never been aware of 'anybody in the family actually expressing anti-Semitic views'.  Prince Philip is seen with his sister Princess Sophie (both centre) in Germany in March 1953  Prince Philip prays alongside his sister Princess Sophie and Greek Orthodox priests outside the tomb of his mother Princess Alice in 1994  The closest sibling in age to Philip was Sophie, who was born in June 1914 - seven years before her brother.  After her husband Christoph's death, she married Prince George William of Hanover, but the union was controversial.  With Prince George's house of Hanover having been the royal house of England's monarchy for more than two centuries until the death of Queen Victoria, the aristocrat sought permission from King George VI to go ahead with the engagement.  But because the UK was still at war, official permission was not given, although Sophie went on to tie the knot in 1946.  Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, wipes his eye as he sits next to his elder sister Princess Sophie in 1994 at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial  She had three further children with her second husband and passed away aged 87 in 2001, after becoming a confidante to Philip in later life.  She stayed at Birkhall with him and the Queen in the years before the Coronation and she visited Britain regularly, becoming godmother to Prince Edward.  Paying tribute to her after her death, Philip said: 'She did so much kindness in her life that she stored up many gifts in Heaven and I hope she's enjoying them now.'  Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away. She was 63 when she died in 1969."

With the pandemic forcing couples to postpone or cancel their weddings, many have turned to digital solutions to celebrate their special day. One such solution is the digital guest book provided by wed.tv. It allows guests to send messages and photos to the newly-weds through a simple and user-friendly interface.  Wed.tv has been in operation since 2016, but it was only during the pandemic that its popularity began to soar. The site allows guests to connect using a wedding code, which can be any unique identifier, such as the names of bride and groom. Guests can then send messages and photos via their browser, which are then displayed in a gallery that can be viewed online or projected onto a screen or TV like a slideshow. At the end of the wedding, a PDF featuring all the messages can be generated with just one click, providing a lasting memory of the event for all of the guests.  ""Before the pandemic, wed.tv had fewer than 20 guest books created per month"", said Michele Ampollini, founder of the Company. ""However, since the pandemic began, the number of people creating digital guest books has skyrocketed. By autumn 2021, almost 6,000 guest books had been opened, each receiving an average of more than 50 messages from guests. This trend shows no sign of slowing down, even after the pandemic has ended.""  There are many advantages to using a digital guest book like wed.tv:  It eliminates the need for paper, reducing waste and environmental impact.  Unlike a traditional guest book, there are no limits to the number of messages or photos that can be included.  Guests can include selfies and other photos to create a more visual and personalized record of the wedding.  The PDF created at the end of the event can be easily shared with all guests, making it an unforgettable memory for everyone.  Far from being just a digital version of the paper guestbook, Wed.tv can be used as a cutting-edge photo booth alternative and as an engaging animation tool. It's definitely an instrument without boundaries: guest books have been opened in more than 100 nations, the top users being the US, Singapore, the UK, India, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Guest books are free for up to 50 guests and 250 messages, which is ideal for small weddings. Users can also purchase a premium version for larger events for as little as $29. Because of wed.tv's popularity, the founders are currently developing Guestbook.tv, a general version of wed.tv designed for occasions like birthdays, graduations, celebrations, parties, and other events.  In the words of Laurent Bedubourg, Company's CTO, ""While the pandemic may have accelerated the trend of digital weddings, it is likely that this trend will continue long after the pandemic is over. The convenience and personalization offered by digital solutions are simply too good to ignore. In addition, as people become more environmentally conscious, these platforms will become even more attractive as they eliminate the need for paper and other physical materials.""  Virtual guest books such as Wed.tv exemplify the industry's innovative response to the pandemic's constraints, allowing couples to embrace digital tools and platforms to improve their special day, and showing the adaptability and resilience of the wedding industry in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Phil said: “I couldn’t believe it when I won the jackpot. I never expected to win such a huge amount of money, and I’m still in shock.

Lauryn fires at her mom in a preview clip for ""Mama June: Family Crisis.""  It's safe to say Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Efird wasn't thrilled about the festivities leading up to Mama June Shannon's (second) wedding with Justin Stroud -- or the fact that her mother had another ceremony after already getting married in a courthouse.  In a preview clip for Friday's episode of ""Mama June: Family Crisis,"" Lauryn has a heated conversation -- on her end -- with her mom about having a second wedding and a bridal shower.  ""Why the f--- are you having a wedding?"" Lauryn, 23, tells her mom over FaceTime, to which June replies, ""Because I'm only gonna get married one time.""  ""You already got married though at the courthouse without everybody!"" Lauryn snaps, and June tells her daughter, ""I want everybody there. I want a wedding.""  June and Justin tied the knot back in March 2022 after dating for six months. A year after their civil ceremony, the couple had a second wedding surrounded by friends and family in an intimate waterfront ceremony in February 2023.  During her video call with her mom, Lauryn expresses her frustration that she was told about the ceremony and a bridal shower from Justin's family rather than from her mom.  ""Why the f--- am I finding out from Justin's mother you're going to have a ceremony and f---ing bridal shower?"" she asks June, who says she ""did not know they were going to reach out to y'all on social media.""  ""That's annoying as f---,"" Lauryn fires at her mom. ""It would be nice to hear from the horse's mouth.""  A still ticked off Lauryn then asks June if her upcoming wedding is going to be ""another one of [her] f---ing money pits.'"" While June claims the wedding is going to be on a ""budget,"" the clip shows footage of her talking to Justin about how she wants ""all the bling"" as well as a ""a big cake, a dress, [and] a huge venue.""  Lauryn doesn't seem to believe her mom's words as she tells her, ""June don't never have a f---ing budget. Let's be real, except when it comes to taking care of Alana.""  She then reveals to June that she won't be going to her bridal shower.  ""I already have plans for the bridal shower. So unfortunately, I won't be able to make it, but Doe Doe says she's gonna come,"" she tells June, referencing her aunt Joanne ""Doe Doe"" Shannon, who was sitting next to Lauryn during the FaceTime with her June.  When June asks why Lauryn ""can't make it,"" Lauryn snaps in reply, ""Because I have five kids to f---ing raise, and one of them is yours!""  Lauryn shares four kids with husband Joshua Efirdd: Ella, 5, Bentley, 21 months, and twins Sylus and Stella, who were born last year. She also has temporary custody of June's daughter, Alana, 17.  June suggests that Lauryn bring the kids to her bridal shower -- and they can be ""one big happy family"" -- however, the latter isn't having it.  ""Mama always thinks that she can convince other people who aren't around her 24/7 that she's the best mom out there and that she's all about family and she's all about fixing her relationships,"" Lauryn explains in a confessional.

Howard Marshall captivated fans — and made the icon into a punchline. But 16 years later — and the subject of a new documentary, Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — perhaps Smith was the one telling the joke.  In 1992, Smith's extraordinary beauty launched her from small-town fried chicken server to worldwide fame, with five Playboy covers and as the face of Guess jeans. Smith then gained small parts in movies such as Naked Gun 33 1/3 and The Hudsucker Proxy. She smoldered from billboards, walked the red carpet at the Oscars and charmed late-night hosts like Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall.  But the whole time, she was hiding a secret: she was in a relationship.  Wearing a 22-carat diamond at age 26, Smith married an 89-year-old Houston oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall in 1994. The groom, one of the richest men in America, was wheeled up the aisle behind his bride as ""Tonight I Celebrate My Love For You"" was played. Doves were released at the end in the empty chapel.  Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty  ""She was adaptable to get what she needed,"" says Smith's friend Missy Byrum, who insists Smith was single-minded in her devotion to providing a good life for her son Daniel. ""But she could be herself with Mr. Marshall and that made her happy.""  Smith — who is now the subject of the Netflix documentary Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — met Marshall while dancing at a Houston strip club in the late 1980s and went on their first date in 1991.  Byrum tells the story of their early romance this way: ""Mr. Marshall's mistress had just died. [The dancer] went and had a cosmetic procedure done that was supposed to be a routine cosmetic procedure. But it killed her for whatever reason. Lady Walker was her name.""  Byrum continues, ""Mr. Marshall was very despondent. So his driver took him into [the strip club] Legs, which is where Nicki was working at the time and she met him. She could tell that he was despondent and everything.""  Anna Nicole Smith. DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock  Byrum adds, ""She would have lunch with him and stuff like that — Red Lobster — but she was trying to keep him a secret from the press after she got her cover. She couldn't disclose him to Guess or anybody at Playboy.""  Marshall, Byrum says, paid for some of Smith's surgeries. ""I believe she had already had her third boob job at this point. But Mr. Marshall paid for a fourth. They put two implants in each breast. That's why they were so big."" Eventually Marshall would buy Smith a car, diamonds and a house in Houston where she and Daniel could live.  Smith's uncle George Beall says of his niece (who was born Vickie Lynn Hogan): ""She really loved him! The way he took care of her and looked out for her. She cared about him a lot. She didn't want people to think that she was after his money. Aunt Kay and I both said to Vickie Lynn, 'If you love him, to heck with what people think!'""  Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  Later, while she was living in Malibu with the film producer Ashley Wells Lewis, Smith would say she was being followed regularly, by people who worked for a man with whom Smith was involved.  ""It frightened her,"" Lewis says. ""She never told me who it was. She said, 'Ashley, people, they follow me everywhere I go. Dinner, my friends, they're right with me.'""  She would get home and report to Lewis, ""I lost them. I took lots of cuts and corners.""  The men were possibly working for Marshall, Byrum says, who claims she and Smith would ""hide in hotels where Mr. Marshall couldn't find us and do our crack smoking.""  Byrum — who had her own intimate relationship and informally married the pin-up in a backyard ceremony in 1993 — says Smith truly loved Marshall, but adds, ""she needed more attention than any one person could give her.""  According to Lewis, ""Anna spent her life in pursuit of happily ever after.""  Following Marshall's death at age 90 in 1995, Smith sued in Texas for $475 million, half of the late oil tycoon's estate, but lost in a September 1997 ruling that declared Pierce the sole heir, also shutting out Marshall's oldest son, J. Howard Marshall III.  The court battle took years and included a slew of mudslinging from both sides, with Smith even accusing Pierce of wanting his father dead during one heated May 1998 testimony. That summer, Smith teamed up with Marshall's disinherited older son Howard to sue Pierce, alleging that Pierce conspired for 20 years to take all of his father's fortune for himself. Partly because of complications arising from Smith filing for bankruptcy in 1996, different judges issued contrary rulings, with Smith winning $474 million, then slashing that to $88 million. The case was appealed all the way to the federal Supreme Court, which ruled in Smith's favor.  Pierce died in June 2006 at age 67 from an infection before he could successfully prosecute the case further, but his wife, Elaine, continued on behalf of his estate, even after Smith's death from an accidental overdose in 2007. In 2010, it was finally ruled that Smith's estate was not entitled to any money from Marshall's estate."

This press release was orginally distributed by ReleaseWire  Treasure Island, FL -- (ReleaseWire) -- 05/17/2023 -- Planning a beach wedding offers the opportunity to weave ocean and beach-themed elements into the big day, from seashell-inspired bouquets to elements of decor. Suncoast Weddings, premier wedding planners based on the west coast of Florida, have a team of experts on hand to help guide and advise couples who are looking for creative ways to customize their beach wedding or beach vow renewal to make it unique and memorable. One of the easiest ways to customize the decor is to opt for aisle markers that are reminiscent of the beach. Good examples that are always firm favorites include white starfish, brown starfish, and conch shells. They can be mixed and matched along the aisle if preferred. The conch shells have a blush pink interior and so they are sometimes paired with a blush theme, with either blush chiffon accents on the arch and chairs, or blush chiffon drapes on the arch. A popular arch for smaller ceremonies is the signature Suncoast arch, which has two upright posts. For larger ceremonies with more guests in attendance, couples often opt for the four-post tropical arch. All of the arches, including the two-post bamboo, the four-post bamboo, and the two-post birchwood arch can be draped and decorated in a variety of ways. A crystal chandelier is a stylish addition to the arch, however, in sticking with the beach wedding theme, Suncoast Weddings also have a shell chandelier available for the main event. Shells are also featured commonly in the unity sand ceremony, where the couple pours sands from decorative shells into a heart-shaped keepsake bottle. The sand can be natural, or colored. Mixing natural sand and colored sand creates a pretty layering of the sands within the bottle, as they are poured at the same time. For ceremonies that include children, each child can also have their own shell and unique sand color on the unity sand table, so all of the sands mingle as they are poured. Another way to customize along the lines of a beach-inspired day is the bouquet and boutonniere. Seashells are popular, with a range of shapes, textures, and colors to choose from. In addition to seashells, pearls, starfish, and sand dollars can also be incorporated. Often a bouquet or boutonniere combines an element of the sea, like a seashell, with a more traditional floral component - such as an orchid with a starfish, or a lily with a seashell. The use of pale blue ribbons is another way to evoke the sea and Florida skies. Jewelry is a unique way to extend the theme to the wedding party, with starfish hair pins, seashell bracelets or anklets, and a traditional classic that takes on a new significance at a beach wedding, a pearl necklace. A fun-filled way to take the beach inspiration through to a beach wedding reception is to have a cake which is inspired by either a sandcastle, the ocean, or the beach. From corals, to bubbles, to pearls, seashells, and ombre shades of blue, there are many designs to choose from, with a gallery of inspiration on the social media profiles of Suncoast Weddings. Starfish cake toppers are a particular favorite that always makes family and friends smile. Many of these ideas to incorporate the beach or the ocean theme into a beach wedding can be done in a budget-friendly way. To discuss these ideas and explore more possibilities for a Florida beach wedding that is customized and tailored, contact the Suncoast Weddings team.  All ceremonies can be tailored with Suncoast Weddings, to individualize the decor and details. From small ceremonies for couples looking at eloping in Florida to lavish ceremonies with a hundred guests, ceremonies can be made to be unique.  Permits are required at most public beaches and should be submitted for approval as early as possible in the planning process to make sure that the location and date can be secured. Suncoast Weddings can help with the permit application process and will add the cost of the permit to the personalized proposal, as the cost varies from city to city.  Florida beach weddings and reception packages may start with a search for cheap beach wedding packages however there are many other outgoings that need to be tallied, like the dress, the travel budget, and certainly the reception. Affordable Florida beach wedding Packages typically take several elements of the ceremony and offer them at a reduced price when compared to building the wedding from scratch. This effectively 'bundles and saves' which offers the best value for money for the services delivered. Planning the wedding and reception together as part of a package helps to keep the costs totaled in one place and easier to track. A popular alternative to a traditional reception is a dinner cruise reception sailing the inland waterways around St Pete Beach, Madeira Beach, and Clearwater. This affords a great view of the dramatic and ever-changing scenery as the wedding party enjoys the reception fare. With a choice of paddleboats and sleek modern boats, couples can choose a package and location which suits their style and budget.  Treasure Island Weddings, St Pete Beach weddings, Siesta Key weddings, and Clearwater beach weddings boast spectacular sunset views over the Gulf of Mexico, perfect for couples who want sunset wedding day portraits. Florida beach weddings and reception packages can be purchased which include the ceremony and also the party to follow. This may include items such as a DJ, a custom-made cake, a coordinator for the wedding, and a professional beach wedding photographer.

The incident occurred on Tuesday.  The groom was declared dead at a hospital, while the bride is battling for life, the official said.  Talking to reporters, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Ramzan Khan said the groom consumed poison and informed his 20-year-old bride about it during their marriage ceremony at an Arya Samaj temple in Kanadia area because of an altercation.  ""As soon as the bride came to know that the groom had consumed poison, she also drank it. The doctors declared the man dead, while the condition of the woman, who is kept on a life support system, remains very serious,"" he said.  According to him, the groom's family members said that the woman had been pressuring him for marriage since the last several days and when he sought a two-year deadline for their marriage on the grounds of his career, the woman complained to the police against him.

SISTERS star Tammy Slaton has ditched her wedding ring since striking up a romance with her new boyfriend, Greg Morgan, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.  Tammy, 36, showed off her single status and got caught in new photos while out on a day trip earlier this month to Indiana with her brother Chris Combs, 41.  5 Tammy Slaton has been spotted out and about without her wedding ring Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  5 She did appear to wear some sort of band on her right hand, but has ditched her ring since her split from ex Caleb Willingham Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  The 1000-Lb. Sisters star took a road trip away from her Kentucky home to a Sam's Club in Indiana on May 4 to stock up on groceries and supplies.  She was caught on camera without her wedding ring on her special finger; however, she was spotted wearing some sort of a band on her right hand.  The band on her right hand was visible as Tammy nervously bit her fingernails while on a grocery cart scooter headed into the Sam's Club.  When The U.S. Sun obtained photos of Tammy out on the town back in April, she was spotted wearing her wedding ring despite rumors she had already split from her ex, Caleb Willingham, 40.  The U.S. Sun confirmed the rumors of Tammy's split earlier this month.  ALREADY OVER  An insider exclusively told The U.S. Sun Tammy and her husband Caleb are officially separated and she is in the process of filing for divorce.  ""Tammy has her legal team lined up and is ready to file for divorce,"" the source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star claimed.  ""They split up because Caleb hasn't been following his diet in rehab,"" the insider alleged, adding: ""He has gained 30 lbs and hasn't been working his program.""  ""They got into a big fight over it and he told her he wanted a divorce, but then he tried to backtrack,"" the insider claimed.  Reportedly, Caleb tried to keep their marriage together after the falling out, but it was too late.  ""Tammy's sisters Amy and Amanda were already encouraging her to just move on,"" the source elaborated.  The family insider said they believed that Tammy's decision to end it with Caleb was the right thing for her.  ""She wants someone who can be there for her and his health keeps declining. She would have to take care of him once he's out of rehab, and that is her taking on the care of a whole other person when she can barely take care of herself, so the relationship is pointless,"" the insider added.  ""They got married after just knowing each other over the course of weeks, in rehab, and he's still there,"" the source continued, claiming: ""She didn't want a long-distance relationship and certainly isn't able to care for someone else at this point in her recovery.""  The insider added that Tammy's assets are protected though, and alleged Caleb signed a prenuptial agreement.  Tammy's rep and Caleb did not respond to requests for comment.  REBOUND ROMANCE  Multiple sources claim Tammy has been secretly seeing Indiana-based TikToker Greg Morgan after meeting him on a dating app.  One source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star said: ""Tammy met Greg on one of the apps, and they immediately hit it off.""  The source added: ""They've been seeing each other for about a month now.""  ""He's come to see her a handful of times and takes a six-hour bus from Indianapolis to visit her in Kentucky,"" the insider claimed.  During one recent visit, Greg even met Tammy's family.  The source said the new couple stopped by her sister Amy's home for a visit, and Greg met her nephews Gage, 2, and Glenn, 10 months.  A second insider claimed Tammy paid for his bus rides to her town.  ""They've been talking regularly and they seem to really like each other, but they are trying to figure out when he'll visit again, because things get tough around her filming schedule,"" the second source said.  The first source added: ""Tammy is shy around him and didn't want to eat in front of him. She said she finds him very attractive.""  Greg and Tammy have also publicly communicated over TikTok, and she has commented on his page: ""Aww you love me.""  5 When Tammy was out and about last April, she was still spotted sporting her wedding band on her left hand Credit: Matt Symons for The US Sun  5 Tammy is reportedly seeking to divorce Caleb after being married for only six months Credit: Michael Moretti"

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired Wednesday, juror Saul Hernandez said he was initially unconvinced that the Idaho prosecutors had proven Vallow Daybell’s guilt.  But just a few hours into deliberations, he was swayed by gruesome evidence that made it “harder to look at” the mom.  “Growing up, you talk about good and bad, God and evil. And I think for the first time in my life, I put a face to evil,” Hernandez said.  The juror recalled how he was “disgusted” by photos of the couple happily dancing at their beach wedding in Hawaii in early November 2019, just a few weeks after Tammy Daybell mysteriously died.  Hernandez said he “didn’t want to look at” the chilling pictures.  Saul Hernandez sat down with “Good Morning America” following last week’s verdict. ABC News / GMA  The loved-up snaps show Vallow Daybell and Chad grinning and holding hands with leis around their necks.  Investigators believe that Tylee and J.J. — who were last seen in September 2019 — were also dead by this point and had been buried in shallow graves on Chad’s Salem property, where they were found several months later.  “I just couldn’t believe how someone can be that happy when your kids are in the ground. And the person that was key in all of this is sitting across from you, smiling at you and dancing with you on the beach,” Hernandez said of the callous pair.  Hernandez said he was “disgusted” by Vallow Daybell and Chad’s wedding photos. ABC News  Throughout the proceedings, the mom’s defense team attempted to portray her as a loving and devout mother who was manipulated by Chad, a noted doomsday author.  Ultimately, however, Hernandez said he bought the prosecution’s argument that Vallow Daybell was a wannabe cultist driven by “money, power, and sex” to kill her children and conspire to help Chad murder Tammy as well.  Following seven hours of deliberation, Vallow Daybell was found guilty by the jury.  “They wanted to believe something that only applied and benefited them, only applied and benefited those people they liked, their circle that they liked and they wanted to be around,” Hernandez said of the couple’s pseudo-religious fantasies.  Lori Vallow Daybell faces the possibility of life in prison without parole. via REUTERS  He noted that he thinks Vallow Daybell’s beliefs — which included predictions of Jesus Christ’s second coming in 2020 — started as “curiosity” but became more intense “once Chad came into the picture.”  “I don’t think, as a human being, you are ever really prepared to experience this,” Hernandez said of his time on the high-profile case.  Vallow Daybell faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow were last seen in September 2019.  The killer mom barely suppressed a smug grin in her new mugshot from Madison County Jail, where she was booked after the verdict.  Meanwhile, Chad Daybell is set to be tried on a similar slew of charges at a later date.  In a statement following Vallow Daybell’s conviction, the Madison and Fremont County prosecutors said they were still “committed to pursuing justice” for the three victims."

(WCSC) - A man involved in a Folly Beach crash on his wedding night that killed his bride and injured him and two others has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the accused driver and several Lowcountry restaurants and bars.  On April 28, Aric Hutchinson, his new bride, Samantha, and two others were traveling down Ashley Avenue on Folly Beach in a golf cart when they were hit by a gray Toyota Camry.  Police identified the driver of the vehicle as Jamie Komoroski. She has been charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death, according to jail records.  The newly filed lawsuit alleges Komoroski had a “booze-filled day of bar hopping” and the establishments she visited that day had an obligation to “exercise due care” in serving alcoholic beverages. In addition to Komoroski, the lawsuit names Snapper Jacks, The Drop-In Bar and Deli, The Crab Shack, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Holdings, LLC.  Court documents allege Komoroski started drinking at El Gallo Bar and Grill before going to Folly Beach and visiting several bars on Center Street.  Attorney Danny Dalton answered questions Wednesday afternoon about the newly-filed suit. He said they began an investigation into the details leading up to the crash.  The husband of the newlywed killed on their wedding night on Folly Beach in a DUI crash has filed a lawsuit.  “There’s still facts and a lot of questions that haven’t been answered, which is part of the reason we wanted to file the lawsuit, was to get into the formal discovery process where we and the families can get more definite answers to some of the questions that are still a little vague to us,” he said.  Each of the named establishments “should have known that they had the authority and obligation to train, control, and supervise their respective employees, agents, or servants, including any bartenders, servers or any other employee” to not overserve patrons alcohol and not place others at risk of incurring serious injury or death, the lawsuit states.  In naming Taco Boy, the lawsuit states Komoroski had been an employee for a short time. The lawsuit alleges the restaurant was negligent by “organizing, arranging, and supervising an employee function/meeting knowing that excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages would be purchased for, served to, and/or consumed by the employees attending the function/meeting.”  “What our investigation yielded was that she had been an employee of [Taco Boy] for a short period of time, not very long, and that there was an almost routine gathering to go out to bars or a bar after their shifts or, you know, in the middle of their shifts or at different times, and their supervisors would also attend those gatherings or those events, call them what they were, and that she had attended this and that there was significant drinking at that event,” Dalton said. “And so, there’s a responsibility, especially when you have a supervisory role, but as an employer, to act responsibly in that role as employer and supervisor, and we felt that that was not done here and that it was breached.”  insert (Folly Beach Police)  Taco Boy releases statement after being named in lawsuit  Taco Boy spokesperson Melissa Reardon released a statement Wednesday afternoon on behalf of the restaurant stating that Komoroski was not in their restaurant and was not served alcohol there on the day of the fatal crash. The statement also denies there was any “organized employee function around drinking.”  Here is their full statement.  On the day of the accident, Friday, April 28, 2023, we can confirm with absolute certainty that Jamie Komoroski did not set foot in Taco Boy, nor did anyone on our team serve her alcohol at the restaurant. We have confirmed this by watching 16 hours of video footage from multiple cameras, staff interviews with everyone working that day, and by reviewing all sales receipts.  Miss Komoroski had been recently hired at Taco Boy and had trained for only two days prior to the accident. She passed her background check and there were no red flags that would indicate ineligibility for employment. She has since been terminated.  The lawsuit alleges an officially organized employee function around drinking, which we can assure there was no such thing.  We are committed to serving alcohol responsibly and take it very seriously for the safety of our staff and guests. We require that our employees ID everyone and our staff are all ServeSafe /TIPS alcohol training certified before they are allowed to serve guests. We take great care not to overserve anyone.  Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy. Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.  Authorities release BAC of alleged drunk driver in crash that killed newlywed  The toxicology report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division states that Komoroski had a blood alcohol level of 0.261% when she was tested after the April 28 crash with a golf cart on Folly Beach. That is more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina.  Along with the toxicology report, the Folly Beach Police Department also sent an updated report of the incident.  Immediately after the crash, officers asked Komoroski what happened to which she replied, “I was driving, and then all the sudden something hit me,” the report reads.  Also, in the report, multiple witness recall seeing Komoroski “dazed and confused.” At the scene, she kept asking for her boyfriend and telling the witnesses she was on her way home, the report states.  Once she saw the victims on the ground, Komoroski started screaming and asking what happened, witnesses say.  In Komoroski’s arrest affidavit, officers claim they could smell alcohol on her breath and person. She told officers she had a beer and a drink with tequila about an hour before the crash, the affidavit states.  When asked how she felt on a scale of one to ten, with one being completely sober and ten being the most impaired, she responded that she was at an eight, the affidavit states.  Komoroski was then asked to complete a field sobriety test but she refused, the affidavit states. However, her blood was sampled for the toxicology report.  Komoroski is charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and reckless homicide. Police say she rear-ended a golf cart with her car in the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue.  At the time of the crash, Komoroski was driving 65 mph, according to police.  GoFundMe raises nearly $725,000  In a May 8 update from Hutchinson’s mother, Annette, on the GoFundMe page said he was recovering at home from multiple broken bones.  “From the accident, Aric received multiple injuries including two broken legs, one which had to be surgically repaired,” Hutchinson said on May 8. “Broken bones in his face which also had to be surgically repaired. Broken vertebrae in his back, brain bleeds, and numerous cuts with stitches. He is physically recovering at home while trying to come to terms with the loss of his beautiful wife. Now he is doing the unimaginable of planning Sam’s funeral along with her family.”  The lawsuit was also filed by the other two injured in the crash.  Copyright 2023 WCSC. All rights reserved."

But the influencer is as calm as can be ahead of the big day. In fact, Tadhg has had great fun planning his and long-time girlfriend Alannah Bradley’s nuptials.  Today's top videos  It’s helped that Alannah is just as laid back as her soon-to-be husband. Speaking to EVOKE as he does the final checks ahead of tying the knot in Kerry, Tadhg could not praise his fiancée enough.  ‘Alannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she’s very easy going and said “whatever you like, go for it” so I’ve picked the flowers and the band. She went “that’s grand” and there’s been no stress and no panic,’ he gushed.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  He continued: ‘It was gas actually, the girl who’s doing the flowers said to me “it’s normally the bride and not the groom calling in” but this has worked perfectly for us.  'There’s only a couple of weeks to go now but I’d say it’s butterflies more than nerves. It’s exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there’s no need to stress, you know who’s coming.'  Although Tadhg and Alannah have been together for over 10 years now, she’s very private and only makes rare appearances on his social media.  Tadhg jokes that Alannah is his ‘biggest critic as well as supporter’ when it comes to posting online and that they’ll be leaving the camera work to others at their wedding which has lots of nods to their personalities and shared love of animals.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  ‘The dogs are a massive part of our life - we've just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding! And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they’ll be a big part of the day,’ Tadhg said.  He added: 'The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn't be our wedding without them.'  After the church service the couple are celebrating at The Dunloe Hotel and are using lots of local suppliers and people they know for their big day. For example, Tadhg’s aunty has offered to do the canopies and coffees.  And anyone who follows Tadhg on social media knows that his dad Derry loves to get involved so it’ll come as no surprise he’s been very hands-on with the wedding planning.  Just recently a video of Derry on the kitchen floor trying to suss out the seating plan had thousands of Tadhg’s fans in stitches and anyone who’s ever tried to navigate family dynamics and feuds will relate.  Tadhg said: ‘Myself and my dad have had an input in everything. Alannah and I actually took our parents along to the food tasting with us, which was nice to have their opinions.’  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  When it comes to Derry’s role on the wedding day, he’ll be making a father-of-the-groom speech and Tadhg knows one thing for sure - there’s going to be tears!  Derry told us he’s not overthinking the speech and will instead: ‘Wing it and speak from the heart… but I’m an emotional person. It’s good to be in touch with your emotions.’  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah on a 78km Quest Run. Pic: Supplied  Quick to get a joke in, Tadhg quipped that Derry is a ‘one man band’ and family will have plenty of tissues on hand before teasing that they’ll have to play the Oscar music to get his dad off the stage.  Although they jest, we just know that Derry's speech is going to inspire a few tears from others at the celebration.  See more pictures in the gallery below:"

Since this is wedding season around the world countless ceremonies are being celebrated as couples state their vows to honor, love, and cherish their intended. It is the hope of most couples that these most important of important moments be witnessed by those who have made the biggest impression on their lives.  For those who have a parent that has passed away, the wedding day can be bittersweet. While the joy of a new union fills the air, there is a sense of melancholy that persists because of those that are missing. But, are those dearly departed truly gone?  Jen Theodore via Unsplash Jen Theodore via Unsplash loading...  A Tik Tok video posted by the husband and wife photography team at Danleigh Videography may have given us visual proof that those who love us from beyond the grave are still very much a part of our lives.  In the video shared on the Tik Tok social platform, you can see and hear the mother of the bride reflecting and lamenting the sadness that the bride's father could not walk her down the aisle. Then, ""Dad"" makes his presence known.  In Louisiana, we would call that kind of moment a frisson moment. The kind of moment that gives us chills. But not cold chills, the kind of chills that warm us up from the inside.  As the Mother of the Bride was speaking of her late husband and the bride's father you can hear the sound of a random candle breaking. Some might call that a coincidence. Others, myself included, call that unconditional love. The kind of love that a father has for his children. The kind of love that can't be contained by death.

Perhaps if you're celebrating the blessing of a marriage this spring and early summer you'll find some comfort in this amazing video captured by the Danleigh Videography team. Just grab a tissue as you watch it over and over and keep believing true love knows not of death and those who no longer share this existence with us have never truly left us."

And while selecting a ceremony gown and tuxedo is an extremely important task, for those who are currently planning multiple events, there are several other outfits you need to consider. From what you'll wear to the engagement party and the rehearsal dinner to outfits for the bachelor or bachelorette party and post-wedding brunch, your complete wedding wardrobe is an opportunity to showcase your personal style and create a cohesive look from start to finish.  With all this in mind, it's normal to feel a lot of pressure when attempting to curate the ""perfect"" capsule wardrobe. Not only will you need to coordinate with your partner, but you also have to consider your personal aesthetics, each event's theme, where they'll be held, and the level of formality, among other things. Before you get completely overwhelmed, though, we'd like to highlight that these supplementary outfits provide you with the freedom to test out new fashions and reflect your status as the bride or groom. It's also your chance to incorporate pops of color, seasonal fabrics, or trending accessories that may not be suitable for your actual nuptials. Sounds fun, right?  Ahead, we spoke with two stylists for their expert advice on planning the ultimate wedding wardrobe. Here's everything you need to know, from when to buy your outfits to styling tips to remember.  Meet the Expert Hope LaVine is a bridal stylist based in Santa Monica, California. She’s also a content creator that provides brides with wedding inspiration and advice via her TikToks, quizzes, and Pinterest boards.  Raina Silberstein is a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper based in Los Angeles, California. She helps clients define their personal style and build a wardrobe for work, special events, and more.  PHOTOS BY ADRIANA RIVERA and REBECCA YALE PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Consider When Planning Your Wedding Wardrobe  Before you start shopping for your wedding wardrobe, both Rania Silberstein, a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper, and Hope LaVine, a bridal stylist, recommend deciding on an overall creative vision. That way, you can select outfits that complement the vibe of your events while also taking the season, level of formality, and event design into consideration. For instance, if you’re planning a party on the beach, “an overall relaxed style may be best,"" Silberstein says. ""Opt for lightweight textiles like a linen suit or take cues from the coastal color palette. Planning a downtown city celebration? Neutrals and shine make a chic formula along with sleek silhouettes that mirror the architecture.”  Silberstein also advises couples to use their personal style and everyday wardrobe as inspiration. “If you often choose bold styles in your wardrobe, forgo traditional options like a white gown or black tuxedo,” she explains. “I would avoid trying something entirely new and out of your personal comfort level, whether that is a color, pattern, texture, or silhouette.” That’s not to say you can’t experiment with your ensembles, but the key to creating a fantastic look is by bringing together fashion elements you already love with a few statement details.  Lastly, you’ll want to think about wearability. “I would want to invest in high quality, gorgeous pieces that I would wear in new ways,” LaVine says. “I think your wedding wardrobe should be pretty interchangeable—a corset you wore for your bachelorette, then wear on a Friday date night with the spouse. I think if we invest in better quality pieces up front, then we will have it in our closet forever.”  PHOTO BY ADRIANA RIVERA; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  When to Buy Your Wedding Wardrobe  While it’s highly recommended that you buy a wedding dress or suit several months before the big day, the shopping timeline for your other celebrations isn't as restrictive. Specifically, Silberstein suggests that couples purchase their outfits in the same season as their events. “By sourcing your outfit closer to the event date, you discover relevant styles, colors, and textiles for the time of year,” she notes. “Resort styles may appeal for your summer tropical welcome party, while rich velvets are beautiful for a winter engagement event.”  She further notes that everyone should book their venue spaces before deciding on their outfits, as the location “will set the tone for the entire event from the design elements to the overall vibe. The wedding attire should complement the vision too.” Finally, once you’ve secured dates for your events, Silberstein and LaVine both recommend finalizing your outfit about two to three weeks beforehand to allow for any potential outfit changes, alternations, and delayed shipping.  For the bride, LaVine suggests purchasing a wedding gown first before you focus on anything else. “After that, I like to switch back to more ‘high stakes’ looks like rehearsal dinner and reception (if there is a dress change),” she says. “After securing those outfits, I tend to prioritize the bachelorette party looks last. They’re a little easier to buy for and have tons of options out there.” As for the groom, LaVine recommends that his look should not only compliment the event's aesthetic but should also pair well with the bride's attire—meaning, the groom should purchase his outfits once everything else has been locked in.  How to Make Your Wedding Wardrobes Cohesive  A bride’s look tends to take top priority for most wedding events, but it’s important to put some thought into the groom’s pieces as well. Though being matchy-matchy isn’t the right choice for every couple, planning out looks together prevents any potential clashes and ensures complementary styles—this is especially important when you consider how highly photographed all of these events will be. According to Silberstein, you should start by selecting adjectives that best describe your desired aesthetic to help guide your wardrobe choices. For example, “If the special day is supposed to be fresh, bold, and relaxed, a whimsical floral dress and vibrant suit may be favorable,” she says. “By following this unofficial dress code, the partners guarantee a cohesive, personalized, and special event wardrobe.”  LaVine also suggests couples adhere to the same level of formality, whether that’s black-tie or casual, and a similar color scheme. “When wearing white to the wedding events, you really want to match your whites down to the tone—cool white, warm white, or neutral white. And if the bride is in ivory, we definitely don’t want the groom in white or anything drastically different,” she explains. ""Pastels tend to be more casual, and jewel tones [feel] dressier. Neutrals work both ways, but it depends on the styling.” Aside from color, the experts go even further to share their top style suggestions for each event, as highlighted below.  For the Engagement Party  There’s no better way to show off your new relationship status than with an engagement party. Since this is the first of many wedding-related celebrations, LaVine suggests that brides keep their styles relaxed and playful. “I love a fun midi dress for a bride. It’s somewhere in between sophisticated and fun. Maybe the trim of the skirt has feathers, or the straps have pearls. For styling, you could also go with a fun shoe if your dress leans more simple,” she says. As for the groom, the stylist recommends going for an equally sophisticated look, like “a well-tailored black trouser, nice t-shirt or polo, and a loafer.” And to tie both looks together, the groom should consider matching his shirt with the color of the bride's dress or shoes.  For the Bridal Shower  Bridal showers are typically daytime events, which means a light color palette, textured fabrics, and romantic silhouettes are all appropriate sartorial choices. Silberstein says, “If the bride is attending a tea party event hosted by her family and friends, a white long-sleeve lace midi dress with nude ankle strap heels would be an elegant choice.” In this case, she also recommends advising guests to wear pastel hues to guarantee great photos and a cohesive theme. As for accessories, “This would be such a special day to wear family heirloom pieces or something of sentimental value. Especially with all of your family around you,” she adds.  Though a groom’s appearance may be brief at this event, he should still dress in a complementary outfit. A button-down shirt and dress pants, in a similar color scheme or texture as the bride’s ensemble, would be perfect for this occasion.  PHOTOS BY KT MERRY AND LAUREN FAIR PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  For the Bachelor and Bachelorette Parties  Whether you’re having a joint celebration or separate events, get creative with your bachelor and bachelorette party ensembles. “This is such a great time to play around with different styles and types of looks,” LaVine notes. “For my brides, I love seeing some different pieces like a blazer dress, a jumpsuit, or a two-piece set. We can get super creative here and have fun.” She also notes that brides can include at least one statement piece, like ""a fun heel wrap-up, feathers, or bows.” For the groom, LaVine recommends trying out different fabrics, opting for linen pants over jeans, or a leather jacket instead of a blazer. “Obviously, grooms don’t typically try and wear white their whole bachelor trip, but you can still stand out with something fun, like a floral or a chic neutral-on-neutral look,” she says. “Cream jeans and a cream t-shirt make for a very versatile outfit that can be worn for any bachelor trip moment.”  Planning a themed night out? Add some playful corresponding details to your look. For instance, if you’re hosting a bachelorette weekend in Nashville, Silberstein says, “The bride can wear a white denim jacket and white denim mini skirt, set along with white cowboy boots to walk down Broadway in style.""  For the Welcome Party  If you’re planning a wedding outside of your city, it’s common practice to host a welcome party for your guests. And since this is the first time you can really shine a light on your bridal and groom fashions, stick to silhouettes and color palettes that complement your venue or event theme. What's more, LaVine advises couples to embrace a casual dress code, as a welcome party is “a raw, stripped-down time to just show the couple and their love.”  She loves the idea of a bride in a maxi gown paired with a soft beauty look and the groom in a coordinating outfit, which may include a “quality khaki or cream pant and white button down, slightly unbuttoned, with a beautiful brown loafer.” Remember to be mindful of the season, though, as some colder months may call for longer hemlines and thicker fabrics.  For the Rehearsal Dinner  The rehearsal dinner is another opportunity to preview your wedding aesthetics. “This night is truly connected to the next day, so I like to incorporate small elements of the bridal look into the wedding look,” LaVine says. “For example, if your bridal gown has lace on it, it would be really interesting to have a simple gown and add a touch of lace through a glove or long sleeve.” She also suggests that brides opt for an “effortless, yet put together” outfit that perfectly blends their bridal status with their personal style. Some elegant options include a floor-length gown, an embellished midi dress, or a satin jumpsuit.  Although the bride commonly wears white on this night, there's no reason why the groom can't consider a more colorful look. Whether that’s adding a navy jacket on top of a white button-down or donning a jewel-tone suit, the bolder color scheme will make a bride’s white ensemble pop even more. As for accessories, LaVine says that the groom can keep it simple, opting for no tie, no vest, and leaving the top few buttons of his shirt open for a formal yet relaxed look.  For the Farewell Brunch  After a late night of celebrating their nuptials, many couples will prefer a slightly more casual dress code at their post-wedding brunch. While the attire for this event can vary, you’ll want to prioritize comfort and opt for a look that's functional yet stylish. “For my brides, I always recommend comfort here! Whether that’s a chic bridal short and lace top, a jumpsuit, or a silk flow slip dress,” LaVine says. For the groom, attire suggestions also fall into the relaxed category. She suggests “a linen pant and button down, or floral or lace fun shirt with a quality jean” for a simple look that still feels wedding-worthy.  Additionally, Silberstein recommends that couples “begin their marriage in a matching monochrome color palette.” White or neutrals are typically the favored option, but consider incorporating a seasonal color into both of your outfits for a statement look that's still cohesive. Jewel-tone hues, like dark purple, burgundy, or forest green, are excellent choices for a fall or winter event, while spring and summer call for pastel colors like light pink, sky blue, or yellow.

My mom has had her dress preserved in a box for over 30 years and let me take it out to try on to try and utilize for one of my wedding events. It’s so special and so detailed and took us all back in time! She looked SO beautiful on her day and it’s surreal to put the same dress on she wore when she married my dad. She gave me her blessing to repurpose it so that I can give it a second life.”  We absolutely love how the redesigned dress turned out! Check out Sydney’s full video here."

Dottie Fideli was one of those girls and has been dreaming of her ultimate wedding day her entire life.  Now at age 77 she's said 'sod it' to waiting around for a man and has married herself in the ultimate act of self-love at her Ohio retirement home.  Speaking to NBC local affiliate WLWT5, the grandmother revealed she finally had the chance to have the wedding she had always dreamed of.

Advert 10  Ms Fideli had been married once before, back in 1965.  But the ill-fated nuptials were never meant to be.  After she and her ex-husband exchanged vows at a courthouse, 'he went to work and I went home'.  ""I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,"" she revealed.  Advert 10  But she had always dreamed of having her own 'big wedding', but was dismayed at the idea it was 'too late' for her.  Her daughter, Donna Pennington, was determined to make her mother's dreams come true.  They set about decorating the community room of O’Bannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, with balloons and her daughter cooked all of the food.  Family, friends, and loved ones turned out to see Fideli in her dream white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt.  Advert 10  She also wore a white veil with an embellished headband.  Credit: Donna Pennington  Like any blushing bride, Fideli was 'nervous' leading up to the big day.  But, when the sun set on her dream wedding day, she ended up 'really happy' after marrying herself.  Advert 10  In her hand as she said her vows to herself, she held a white lily as a symbol for self-love.  ""I said, 'Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they’re happy and everything’s going to be hunky-dory, but they don’t consider the inside, the little petals inside',"" she told Today.  ""The inside is what’s important. That’s where God’s love flows. That’s where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that.""  She added: ""So that’s what I’ve done, and I’d appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.""  Good for you, Dottie."

With all of the major to-dos checked off your list, you may be wondering what's left to be done. While floral arrangements and seating charts may be top of mind, don’t forget about the reason this all began in the first place: your engagement ring! Prepping your wedding jewelry—your engagement ring and both wedding bands—is an important but often overlooked step in the getting-ready process; just as you were diligent about ensuring that your diamond or colorful gemstone looked its best in your engagement photos, you should extend that same level of care for your jewelry in the days before you say “I do.” “There are likely many wedding guests who will see your rings for the first time on your wedding day so they need to be on point,” shares Sharon Schatner, GIA Diamond Graduate at Filigree Jewelers. “And let’s not forget about your wedding pictures. Your rings will be highlighted in those forever photos so they need to look perfect.”  Meet the Expert Easter Ahn-Lee is a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and the founder of the jewelry brand Easter Ahn Design.  Sharon Schatner is a GIA diamond graduate and self-proclaimed ""rock nerd"" at Filigree Jewelers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  That's why it's so important to properly care for your special pieces ahead of the big day. To take the guesswork out of caring for your wedding jewelry—and ensuring they're in the best possible condition on the day you say ""I do""—we created a timeline that outlines exactly what you need to do and when, from the moment you get engaged to the day you tie the knot. Follow the expert advice of Schatner and Easter Ahn-Lee, a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and your rings will be ready for their wedding debut.  Photo by Valorie Darling; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  As Soon as Possible: Get Your Ring Resized  Before we dive into the specifics, if your wedding rings don't fit your finger the way you'd like, be sure to have them resized as soon as possible. “I would recommend having your ring resized right away, whether it's too big or small,” says Ahn-Lee. What's more, while weight loss shouldn't be a priority on your to-do list, Ahn-Lee further notes that “for couples who lose weight before the wedding day, I would recommend resizing the wedding bands to fit a few weeks before the wedding day so there isn't a significant change to ring size.”  One Year Out: Establish Your Budget  When establishing a comprehensive wedding budget, make sure you account for your wedding bands—while they're not as pricey of a line item as catering, for example, knowing how much you have to spend allows you to better consider your options. “Your wedding jewelry is usually part of your wedding budget, so it is also helpful to know how much you plan on spending,” explains Ahn-Lee. “You'll also need time to research and plan your [pieces] if you are doing any custom jewelry work.” Start saving photos of ring stacks and individual bands you like in order to share them with your partner and jeweler when shopping.  Planning on wearing earrings, a bracelet, or a necklace alongside your bands? Consider whether you want to purchase those items, or if you’re borrowing them from family members, and include that in your budget. And if those borrowed items need to be cleaned, bring them along on your next trip to the jeweler.  Six Months Out: Take Your Engagement Ring in for a Checkup  About six months before you say ""I do,"" visit your jeweler for a quick ring checkup. This is also a great time to ask questions about how to best care for your rock while at home. “General knowledge on how to care for and protect your jewelry will help maintain its beauty,” says Ahn-Lee. Lastly, while we highly recommend this step ahead of the wedding, you should continue to get your ring examined on a regular basis and add it to your routine for years to come. “A half-yearly to yearly checkup is also recommended to ensure the stones are secure and prongs, links, clasps, and settings are in good condition,"" Ahn-Lee adds.    Photo by Rachel Rodgers Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Three to Four Months Out: Buy Your Wedding Bands  It's generally recommended that you choose your wedding bands at least three to four months before the wedding, and Schatner adds that couples should buy their bands no later than one month before the big day. When selecting your bands, make it a day-long event with your partner and schedule time to grab breakfast or lunch, then head to the jeweler to try on those all-important pieces. As for who picks up the tab for the rings? That all depends! If you want to purchase your partner’s band and they yours, that's great, but it’s certainly not a requirement. “Since wedding bands are generally part of the wedding budget, the couple can discuss how they want to purchase them,” explains Ahn-Lee. “There is no right or wrong way on who should be buying them.”  Finally, once your rings are ready, Schatner advises couples to pick them up together so the jeweler can make sure they're a perfect fit. “If an alteration needs to be made, you can leave it with the jeweler, saving yourself time and an extra trip.”  About a Week Out: Get Your Rings Cleaned  “It’s ideal to get your rings cleaned as close to the day of the wedding as possible, so they are at their sparkling best for your special day,” says Schatner. “Your jeweler is happy to clean your rings for you, and when we clean them we also check for loose stones or lifted prongs.” If you're having them cleaned a week out, you may want to store your jewelry in a ring box rather than wear it; if going a week without your precious rock feels unimaginable, be sure to remove it whenever cooking, cleaning, working out, or applying makeup, sunscreen, or moisturizer, thus ensuring it remains clean and shiny ahead of the wedding. If you're nervous about keeping it pristine, see if your jeweler can send you home with a convenient cleaning pen for on-the-spot touchups or else try to squeeze in a cleaning appointment closer to the wedding date.

Keep a small dish near the sink so you remember to remove it when washing dishes, and designate a spot in the bathroom and bedroom so your precious jewels are in a secure place when you’re not wearing them.

(Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky/Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky)  The war in Ukraine has made its culture more precious than ever, especially traditions that might become lost after the smoke clears. One of Ukraine’s unique cultural gems involves the music and customs that accompany a traditional wedding. You can hear these evocative songs in “A Ukrainian Wedding,” which will be performed by the women of Cappella Romana with guest Ukrainian singers.  The program is curated by Nadia Tarnawsky, a professional singer and folklorist who gives workshops on Ukrainian music throughout the nation.  “I grew up speaking Ukrainian as a first language,” said Tarnawsky, “My father came to Cleveland, Ohio during World War II, and my mother was born in the U.S. Her family came here from Ukraine in the late Nineteenth Century with the first wave of immigrants.”  HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok  Tarnawsky has a bachelors in music education from Case Western Reserve University, where she has also pursued a masters in ethnomusicology. From 2017 to 2018, she spent 10 months in Ukraine on a Fulbright Scholarship to study its folk music and traditions.  During that time, Tarnawsky traveled with Inna Kovtun, artistic director of the Kyiv-based ensemble Rozhanytsia, to villages where they learned and recorded songs. Since the war started in Ukraine last year, Kovtun has moved to Portland with her daughter. Her husband remains in Ukraine.  “It is important to get these songs,” said Kovtun. “There aren’t that many people who remember all of the verses. Now there are even fewer people because of the war. Nadia and I just listened to them. These are old songs, but I can learn the melody after hearing it one time. The music speaks to my soul.”  Because most of the wedding music is sung by the women of the villages, the concert will feature the women of Cappella Romana plus Tarnawsky, Kovtun, and Hanna Tischenko, who is also a professional folk singer from Ukraine now living as a refugee in Chicago.  The Cappella Romana program draws from wedding folk songs that are not from a particular region of Ukraine, but from all around the country.  “In general, wedding music has specific songs that happen at specific times,” said Tarnawsky. “When the matchmakers come to your house, there’s a song that you sing. When you make the wedding bread called the korovai. It is a yeasty bread, and they did it on ‘The Great British Baking Show.’ You sing about what goes in the bread and how you make it. There are songs about dressing the bride and groom. There is a song about the girl on her last night as an unmarried woman. Songs about making the wreaths that go on their heads. Songs about what to expect when the bride moves into the man’s household, which meant living with the mother-in-law and father-in-law.”  “Weddings are held on Sundays,” added Tarnawsky. “On Mondays the bride’s friends would have farewell breakfast with her and sing these lamentations. There would be songs about how she is not a member of their group anymore. Sometimes she would have to leave the village, and they wouldn’t see her again.”  The second half of the program features music that is usually sung during the wedding ceremony.  “Although the church wedding music is not exactly folk in style,” explained Tarnawsky, “I opted to use compositions from composers who were inspired by folk traditions, along with widely known Kyivan chant versions, and pieces which use the liturgical tones. They will be in a more standard, Slavic style.”  Tarnawsky also mentioned that there are other songs that are sung after the wedding, but those songs won’t be part of the concert.  “Some songs have a lot of double-entendre meanings and are racy,” explained Tarnawsky, “And there are a number of songs that remind me of Appalachian murder ballads. They are kind of dark in a similar way.”  But she did talk about one folk song that is done at every wedding.  “It’s a song about two doves that love each other very much,” said Tarnawsky. “They have a nest on the side of a mountain. An eagle comes in and kills the male dove and scoops up the female. He takes the female home where he has a whole bunch of doves in cages. He gives her plenty of food and water, but she is unhappy. She just wants to weep and return to the mountain to the place where she was with the male dove. He offers her other male doves, but she rejects them, complaining that their down is not right, and they don’t have the right voice when they coo.”  “I thought that it was a depressing song,” continued Tarnawsky, “and I asked why is it sung as part of a wedding. A sweet grandmother replied ‘Look at how true her love is. She will love him forever even when he is no longer there. Why wouldn’t you sing this at a wedding.’”  That song, unfortunately, has even more meaning in light of the current situation in Ukraine.  8 p.m. Saturday, May 20, St. Mary’s Cathedral, 1739 N.W.

Now, the group is preparing for another royal wedding: Crown Prince Hussein’s nuptials to Rajwa Al-Saif, which is expected to take place on June 1, 2023. In the latest update on May 15, 2023, The Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman revealed the expected wedding dress code, and it appears to ditch one key accessory that epitomizes royalty. When a fan asked about the attire for the affair via Twitter, Salman responded, “More like black tie, long dress but no tiaras.” The royal blogger never clarified whether the “no tiara” rule applies to the bride, however.  Handout / Getty Images  The Twitter thread began with Salman confirming that Queen Azizah of Malaysia and her husband, King Abdullah, will attend the crown prince’s wedding. Many other royals around the world will also make an appearance. According to Hello!, the guest list will include Princess Hisakoa and Princess Tsuguko of Japan, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  On May 14, 2023, the Royal Hashemite Court revealed the official logo for Hussein’s big day, which is an Arabic symbol topped with a crown. “As the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for ‘we rejoice,’” the court tweeted, along with a clip of the graphic. The post even mentioned a hashtag for the special day, which is #CelebratingAlHussein.  The Royal Hashemite Court first announced the crown prince’s wedding date back in December of 2022, but the entity has kept many of the other details a secret. ""The Royal Hashemite Court is pleased to announce that the wedding of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Miss Rajwa Khalid Al Saif will take place on June 1, 2023,” the court released in a statement. “The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah on this occasion and wishes His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bun Abdullah II and Miss Raja Khalid Al Said a lifetime of happiness #Jordan.”  To share the news, the royal court shared a photo of the couple posing together, with the bride-to-be in a white dress with puff sleeves and the future groom in a dark suit. The day is a special one for the future newlyweds because Hussein’s parents, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary a little over a week later, on June 10, 2023, Tatler reports.  The couple first announced their engagement on August 18, 2022. “We pray that God grants us His blessings,” Hussein wrote on his Instagram account. “Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes.” The future king of Jordan also uploaded a snap of himself and his soon-to-be wife, and her diamond ring is on full display in the photo. According to Tatler, Hussein popped the question at Rajwa’s father’s home, and his parents were also present to witness the proposal. Queen Rania commented on the Instagram post, “I didn’t think it was possible to hold so much joy in my heart! Congratulations to my eldest Prince Hussein and his beautiful bride-to-be, Rajwa.”"

The details: “Austin and I care very deeply about the natural world, so it was incredibly important to us that our wedding paid homage to nature,” Laura says. “Before our public ceremony, we hiked the trails on our venue's property—me, barefoot, of course—just the two of us and our photographer. About a half-mile back in the woods is a gorgeous waterfall, where we had a private vow reading ceremony. It was so special and intimate and beautiful.” She describes their wedding as an earthy, wildflower party in the woods. To that end, guests took home wildflower seed packets from American Meadows as their favors.  Of note: All of the key songs of the day were by musicians that the couple had seen live. This included Billy Strings’ “Love Like Me” and Trampled By Turtles’ “Alone” (processional), “See the World” by Caamp (recessional) and “The Mountain Song” by Rayland Baxter (first dance).

Laura Palacios was shooting the couple’s big day and toward the end, the bride and groom wanted to jump into the pool. About five minutes after, Palacios noticed people searching the pool floor.  “I asked, ‘Did you lose something?’ My gut was saying it was the ring,” Palacios tells Newsweek. “The bride, Courtney, put her hand on the side of the pool for me to see. The ring was there. The diamond was gone. She was as calm and happy as she had been all day.”  Despite the bride’s calmness over the situation, wedding guests were frantically searching for the missing gem — that’s when Palacios had her brilliant idea.  “I looked back through images and realized it had gone missing at some point on the dance floor,” says the wedding shooter.  Her ingenuity meant that the group quickly ascertained they were looking in the wrong place, Palacios’s pictures confirmed that the diamond had gone missing long before the couple jumped in the pool.  “I would have jumped in the pool to help them look, but I wanted to be sure we weren’t wasting time looking in the wrong place,” adds Palacios.  The dance floor actually had wooden slats but amazingly the diamond was so big that it had become wedged in a gap.  “It was a miracle,” Palacios adds. She posted another video of the moment the precious jewel was recovered by a staff member who returned it to the grateful bride and groom.

Janet Towers, a resident of Colten Care’s Belmore Lodge in Lymington, is no longer able to travel.  Her greatest wish recently had been to see her son John get married to his partner Sarah-Jane.  The New Forest care home secretly transformed Janet’s room into a beautiful wedding chapel – enabling her to see her son exchange vows with his fiancée.  Janie Wilkins, home manager of Belmore Lodge said: “When we learned that Janet may have to miss the wedding, we knew that simply wouldn’t do.  “So, we told a little fib and asked Janet if we could dress her room for a marketing promotion, to show how we can accommodate special occasions.  “Janet agreed and this gave us the opportunity to transform her room and of course dress her accordingly as the beautiful mother of the groom.  “One significant detail was left out though, and that was that we would be re-creating John’s upcoming wedding.”  Bournemouth Echo: Janet Towers with her son John.

(Image: Deep South Media)  Her room was adorned with flowers and had a wedding arch.  “Just before the ‘photoshoot’ I told Janet we had a surprise and gave her the order of service for John’s wedding,” continued Janie.  “She said, ‘but I can’t go’, and I said, ‘no, so they are coming to you’.  “When John and Sarah-Jane came into the room, with Sarah-Jane’s two sons Joshua and Gabriel, everyone was so overwhelmed and emotional.”  The couple went on to read the same vows they would say in the ceremony and exchanged rings.  Everyone then enjoyed cake and toasted the newlyweds with pink fizz.  An emotional Janet said: “I had no idea this was going to happen, but I can’t thank everyone enough.  “I didn’t think I would be able to be part of John and Sarah-Jane’s wedding, but I was, and I loved every single moment of it. Thank you so much to everyone who made my wish possible.”  Janet’s son John added: “My wife and I are extremely grateful to Janie and all the staff at Belmore Lodge who made our special day so memorable. To have mum at our wedding was truly the icing on the cake.”"

After all, this is going to be one of the most photographed days of your entire life, so your final look will be on full display for years to come. In addition to considering which type of hairstyle will best suit your wedding style, location, and dress, you'll also need to think about how you envision yourself as bride: Do you want your hair styled into soft, romantic waves that skim across your back, or do you prefer the look of a polish, elegant updo?  As it turns out, you don't need to choose just one hairstyle for your big day. According to hairstylist Jill Buck, the creative behind Hayley Erbert's two stunning cover story hairstyles, a mid-party swap is not only entirely feasible, but it's actually easy to achieve if your pro has prepped your hair properly. Here, she shares her tips for long-lasting nuptial hairstyles and advice on how to change up your look during the wedding.  For soft waves that last all day, start with the right base.  Buck stresses the importance of ensuring that your hairdresser has enough time to prep your hair; ask how long they'd need in an ideal world and build your morning-of timeline around that. ""For brides, I like to really take time in the prep of the hair. It needs to last all day and often there isn’t time to reset any curls on such a busy day,"" she says. ""I start on wet hair with Joico’s K-Pak Luster Lock Spray (for heat protection) and then Joi Whip Design Foam (for structure and hold)."" Then, she gives the hair a ""nice, full blowout"" and curls the entire head using a 1 1/4"" curling iron (Buck likes the T3 Micro). ""Using the bigger iron helps the waves to be a little softer than a traditional Hollywood glam look,"" she explains.  Hayley's soft waves require two additional steps: For that soft, touchable look, Buck says she finishes the curls with a Mason Pierson boar bristle brush and locks the shape in place with Joico’s JoiMist hairspray.    Be sure to choose your most flattering side for a part.  If there's one piece of advice Buck wants to give all brides-to-be, it's that you should over-communicate your preferred ""side"" so that your stylist can part your hair accordingly. ""There is nothing more frustrating than setting a look only to find you have to switch the part!"" she says. Plus, you wouldn't want to end up with a hairstyle that doesn't feel like ""you,"" and parting your hair in a way you've never done before almost always ends in that result.  And don't forget to consider what best suits your wedding dress.  Another pro tip from Buck? During your hair trial, be sure to show your hairstylist a photo of your wedding dress. ""The dress neckline is always my starting point, too,"" she explains. ""You don’t want the hair and dress in competition; they should complement one another.""  If the hair was properly set, changing to an updo should be a breeze.  The beauty of Buck's method? Taking the hair from soft, flowing waves into a structured updo is an extremely straightforward process. ""After my initial set the hair is in perfect condition to put into an updo. I don’t like to use an iron after hairspray so your brush is going to be the best tool for changing the shape,"" she explains. How did she bring Hayley's look up in a flash? ""On a sleek center part I brushed her hair into two ponytails one on top of the other. This helps give me control of how sleek I can get it as well as a good anchor to set the updo and place the Bobby pins. Mini rubber bands, different Bobby pin sizes, and firm hairspray are all good tools to have.""  And if you want to go the other direction? Just be clear about your plans during your first hair trial. It's certainly not impossible to go from an updo to a long, loose hairstyle, but you'll likely need to do some touchups once pins and rubber bands come out, and your stylist may want to use a softer, more flexible hairspray on your initial updo than they otherwise would.  Decide if going from hair down to an updo—or vice versa—makes the most sense for your day.  According to Buck, brides tend to choose updos for more formal events or for the more traditional portion of the day, so most women prefer to star with their hair up and then bring it down. That being said, there's a real benefit to going in the other direction: By the time the party starts and you're ready to dance, having your hair up and out of your face might be exactly what you want. You'll have taken your beautiful portraits with long, flowing hair, and now you can stay cool and look fresh throughout the party."

Rebecca Nguyen Sanchez/Facebook  Rebecca Nguyen was wearing a beautiful classic lace gown adorned with beading and spaghetti straps when she married the love of her life in August 2017. In the years since, the dress has acted as a reminder of the magical day.  ""When I wore it, I felt like me,"" Nguyen said. ""I want to say I felt like this movie star. I felt like this princess, but that wasn't me. I felt like me.""  The memories of that dream quickly turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, when she received the shock of her life, learning that her dress was suddenly missing.  ""My wedding dress was accidentally donated by one of my family members. It was a complete accident, it was during a rush of a lot of things,"" she said while speaking with KCAL News on Wednesday. ""Mistakes happen. When I found out yesterday I was pretty heartbroken.""  Nguyen says that the dress wasn't the only wedding souvenir that got donated to a Goodwill in Brea more than two weeks ago, and she immediately submitted an accidental donation form in hopes of retrieving what she could.  She's visited Goodwill's Orange County headquarters, hoping that some of the employees could help her recover the lost items.  ""It could be sitting at the warehouse, still waiting to get sorted through,"" said Chris Sewitsky, the retail director at the location. ""It just depends where and what time of day it came in. That store is a very busy store. Some stuff does stay at that store, some stuff comes back to main distribution. So, we're hoping we can find it because it is such a unique item.""  On top of her local search, Nguyen has also posted on several local Facebook pages offering to buy back the dress if it's already been purchased.  ""If you have it, please consider selling it back to me. I will pay more than you paid for it. You can even wear it for your wedding! I don't mind sharing the joy and beauty of the dress,"" one post says.  If someone does have it, she's hopeful that they're able to get as much enjoyment out of their special day as she did.  ""Not everybody can afford to get a brand new dress and that's okay. I want someone to be able to enjoy it as well,"" Nguyen said.  Anyone with more information on the missing dress can reach out to Goodwill in Brea, which is located at 634 S. Brea Boulevard, by calling (714) 255-1099."

The best way to organize a timeless event is to host classic affair with plenty of design details that have already proven they can stand the test of time. ""Picking wedding décor and fashion can be daunting, especially if you want your wedding to feel timeless,"" shares wedding planner Dani Blasena of HauteFêtes. ""While Instagram and Pinterest are wonderful for inspiration, they often promote the same trending ideas over and over again. In contrast, a timeless wedding is one that stands the test of time and style!"" So, if you want to plan a timeless ceremony and reception, it's best to choose color palettes, fashion, and décor that will still feel relevant in 20 years.  It's important to remember that timeless weddings can take many forms, so don't shy away from the style out of fear of planning a cookie cutter celebration. You can still infuse the day with plenty of personality. ""For me, what makes a wedding timeless is not about following the most current wedding trends or guidelines but about creating a celebration that genuinely reflects a couple's unique love story and values,"" notes wedding photographer Jenny Fu. ""It's about making an impact that lasts long after the day.""  Meet the Expert Dani Blasena is the owner, creative director and lead designer of HauteFêtes.  Jenny Fu is a New York-based wedding photographer.  Jacqueline Hallgarth is the founder of wedding and event planning company Jacqueline Hallgarth Events.  If you're hoping to plan a timeless wedding that feels right for you and your spouse-to-be, we asked wedding pros to share their favorite details. Ahead, 20 ideas you can make your own.  Photo by KT Merry; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose a Classic Destination  “Venue selection is one of the most important aspects of creating a timeless wedding,” shares planner Jacqueline Hallgarth. If you know you want to tie the knot far from home, consider a locale that's steeped in history. “You and your guests will be linked forever through this selection, so choose carefully,"" she adds. ""A destination wedding, held in historic villa in Italy or chateau in France, will not only be beautiful on your wedding day, but will also create timeless memories shared by you and all your guests. Regardless of the specific venue, beautiful memories can be created anywhere with the right elements.”  Photo by Caroline Tran; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Pick an Estate-Style Venue  Modern art galleries and open warehouses are incredible blank slates, but they're not the best choices for timeless celebrations. “Choosing an estate-style venue that is classic in architecture and will create a backdrop for your big day that is as relevant in 20 years’ time as it is today,” advises Blasena. “My favorites include Rosewood Miramar Beach for a classic Hamptons style on the West Coast replete with boxwoods and white siding. Abroad, the Belmond San Michele with views for days, classic Italian-style spaces and gardens that are breathtaking. Both venues have everything you need to make your big day truly timeless from start to finish.”  Photo by Will Reid Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Black-Tie Dress Code  What your guests wear will have an impact on the overall feel of your celebration, so picking the right attire style is important. “By requesting black-tie and formal attire, you automatically create an elevated style that translates into forever cherished photographs,” shares Hallgarth. ""Floor-length gowns and black tuxedos never go out of fashion and when captured together, creates that timeless look everyone wants from their wedding.”  Photo by Volvoreta; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose Greenery and White Florals  When picking out your floral design, you can never go wrong with classic white blooms and lots of lush greenery. Blasena says, “Green and white flowers are both classic and neutral and will never overwhelm a design.”  Photo by Stephanie Sunderland; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace a Soft Color Palette  Punchy colors might be trending, but are you sure you'll love Barbie pink or neon green for years to come? If the answer isn't a resounding ""yes!"" it's likely not the best choice. “A soft color palette is always a good rule of thumb,"" notes Blasena. ""Something like a French blue or classic taupe is always sophisticated and elegant. Pick two to three soft colors that suit your style best and keep it simple.”  Photo by Ryan Ray; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire the Right Wedding Photographer  You could plan a big day that's entirely timeless, but if you hire a photographer with a trendy, of-the-moment aesthetic, your photos might not stand the test of time. ""To truly capture the timeless essence of a wedding, it's crucial to work with an experienced photographer who can document your day,” shares Fu. “The photographs they capture will be a lasting reminder of the love and joy you shared on your wedding day.” Blasena adds, “A photographer with a classic editing style, natural color tones, and graceful composition will create photographs never go out of style.”  Photo by Lev Kuperman; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  And Don't Shy Away from Candid Photos  While traditional wedding portraits are essential, some couples avoid candids out of fear of looking too modern. Whatever you do, get this idea out of your head. ""Candid wedding photographs have the power to capture the true essence and emotion of your wedding day,"" says Fu. ""Let the genuine connections and meaningful moments shine–these moments are timeless because you've lived the experience, and the candid photographs can take you back long after the day has passed.""  Photo by Henry + Mac; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Wear Classic Wedding Attire  Fashion trends come and go, even in the world of weddings. “One of the most important elements of your wedding is your dress,” says Blasena. “It’s easy to get caught up in all the amazing wedding fashion there is today with designers from all over the world. To avoid looking back in horror, think timeless and classic in the cut; a soft ivory versus a stark white; and, avoid overcomplicating the style with unnecessary embellishments such as beading, tulle, or lace. Remember, less is always more!”  Photo by Lisa Poggi; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have Musicians at Your Ceremony  Acoustic versions of your favorite romantic songs can bring an emotional elegance and set the proper tone for your wedding ceremony. Consider hiring a string trio or a classical guitarist to play as you walk down the aisle.  Photo by Benjamin Wheeler and Ben Higgins; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Close Out the Ceremony With a Flower Petal Toss  Add an extra dose of joy and ensure excellent photos of your ceremony exit by having guests toss flower petals over your heads as you recess down the aisle as newlyweds.  Photo By Twah Dougherty; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Decorate With Chinoiserie  A classic décor choice for a wedding is to bring chinoiserie ceramics into your design. Used as vessels for your florals or in your dinnerware, it adds a traditional and elegant touch to the space.  Photo by Haley Rynn Ringo; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Champagne Tower  Serving Champagne is a classic choice for a wedding. Serve your favorite bubbly in coupes, stacked in a tower, to make for an extra celebratory (and photo-worthy) moment at your reception.  Photo by AGP Collective; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Up a Checkered Dance Floor  A checkered dance floor is a classic for a reason. It sets the tone for the reception and brings a retro elegance as you get down with your new spouse and guests.  Photo by Corbin Gurkin; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace Candlelight  “Whether it’s dinner for two or a wedding for 250, candlelight creates an intimate atmosphere which can transform any space,” shares Blasena. “There’s nothing more magical than a candlelit room to create romance. Adding clusters of pillar and votive candles or simple white taper candles to your tabletop is an inexpensive touch that will also never go out of style.”  Photo by Anée Atelier; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Opt for Black-and-White Photos  Don’t forget to ask your photographer to edit some shots without color. “Black and white photography is classic, timeless, and elegant. It creates a sophisticated look that will never go out of style,” says Fu.  Photo by Jenny Fu; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Consider Seasonal Shades  “Featuring seasonal colors in the floral, stationery, tabletop and event design creates an event that resonates with guests emotions and ties your wedding to a place in time,” shares Hallgarth. ""I always encourage bright and colorful blooms for a spring wedding and autumnal florals and foliage for a fall wedding which captures not only the beauty of the moment, but forever marries the event to a specific feeling of the year.”  Photo by Brooke Miller Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Getaway Car  After you say “I do,” there’s nothing more timeless than speeding off into the sunset with your new spouse. Find a vintage car and adorn it with florals for a charming getaway for the newlyweds as they head to the reception.  Photo by Sasithon Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Make a Grand Entrance  As the wedding reception begins, have a special moment where the emcee announces the bride and groom for the first time as they rush out onto the dance floor. The entrance is a fun and celebratory moment that can easily transition to the first dance, and it's something that's been done at weddings for decades.  Photo by Allan Zepeda Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire a Live Band  While choosing a DJ or band for your wedding is a personal decision for a couple, there's no denying that live musicians can be an absolutely classic addition to your celebration. Make sure to do research to have your band fit the style and song selection you want for the evening.  Photo By Tailor James; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Leave With a Sparkler Exit  At the end of the evening (or before you head to the after party), have your guests line up for a sparkler send-off. It's a beautiful end to celebrations around those you love."

The comments were mostly positive, although some questioned whether staff were properly compensated.  In a follow-up video, Mulkey said she tipped the staff — though some users still raise doubts.

The response was generally positive, with many applauding the idea and saying they wished they had thought of it themselves.  She also received curious questions and some criticism about whether it imposed extra work on her wedding staff, which prompted her to make a follow-up video saying that she tipped all service workers involved. Despite her attempted clarification, some viewers were unconvinced and alleged that she deleted a previous comment saying she hadn't tipped them.  Still, the apparent hack has inspired others to think more creatively about wedding food — so as long as restaurant and ceremony workers are properly compensated.  Mulkey did not immediately respond to multiple requests from Insider for comment.  Madison Mulkey, a photographer with over 28,000 TikTok followers, posted a video on Sunday explaining why she chose the restaurant chain Chili's for her wedding food.  She said the main attraction was the low cost — $1,950 for 99 guests. The food included chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, and salad. According to The Knot, the average price for traditional wedding catering can cost $75 a guest, which for Mulkey, amounted to nearly $7,500 total.  She said there were some unexpected complications that arose because they didn't want to pay the delivery fee — which would have been $300, she said in a comment. They threw their wedding on St. Patrick's Day weekend, and the restaurant was packed, so they had to pick up the food early at 11 a.m. and keep it cool before the service which was at 6 p.m.  Normally, Chili's workers would deliver and set it up, Mulkey said. But since they picked the food up directly from the restaurant, her hired servers — who were mostly hired for cleaning, she said — were forced to do a lot of the food preparations. She added that her coordinator helped them.  ""Everyone made it work, thank goodness,"" Mulkey said in the clip, which has been viewed over 1.3 million times. ""Our situation was rare. I'm sure if you order from Chili's in any other regard they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free.""  The reaction was mostly positive, with people saying they would be excited to find out a wedding they attended was serving Chili's, and that society should normalize scaled-down weddings like this.  ""I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was chili's,"" a top comment with over 7,000 likes said. ""This is my dream,"" someone else wrote.  The official Chili's Grill & Bar TikTok account even left a comment calling the video ""iconic.""  However, some people worried that Mulkey's wedding staffers were forced to take on more work.  ""I'm all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,"" one top comment with over 1,600 likes said. ""You should have paid for delivery.""  A comment with over 2,200 likes said they'd give the poster an ""A for creativity"" but critiqued that the food was 7 hours old, which probably stressed the staff out.  The concerns for her staff prompted Mulkey to make a follow-up video. She assured viewers that she tipped the Chili's kitchen staff $300, and tipped the coordinator and the servers on top of their hourly payment.  ""All they did was make the food, help the buffet run efficiently, and then clean up,"" Mulkey said of the servers. ""I didn't ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means.""  Viewers, however, did not seem entirely convinced. Several comments on the follow-up video accused her of deleting a comment from her original viral video where they said she told another user she hadn't tipped anyone extra since it was included in their original payment (Insider was unable to find and verify the original comment).  Someone also claimed that Chili's managers aren't able to receive tips which prompted them to ask how she was able to tip them. (Insider could not independently verify this but has reached out to the company for comment.)  ""Maybe they didn't take it, I have no idea what they did with it,"" Mulkey wrote in response. ""We gave chilis a lump sum."""

Weddings in space are now a thing and we heard it is truly out of this world.  If the thought of nuptials on Earth sound common and boring, a space travel company wants to give you the chance to get hitched at a venue looking down on the third rock from the sun instead.  The company, called Space Perspective, is offering couples a memorable way to say “I do” — putting the bride and groom into orbit using a carbon-neutral balloon with giant windows to make the most of the ultimate view of planet Earth.  According to Jane Poynter, the co-founder of Space Perspective, the waiting list to get married amongst the stars is already light-years long.  “We’ve already had people wanting to be the first marriage in space, so we’ll see who is the first,” Poynter told The Cool Down.  “Unlike all other spacecraft whereby the crewed compartment separates from one flight system mid-flight and transfers to another flight system, Spaceship Neptune’s capsule remains secured to the SpaceBalloon the entire flight from liftoff to splashdown, creating a seamlessly safe and gentle flight,” she explained.  The website said the technology the spacecraft uses has already been “proven,” as it has been used for decades by NASA teams and other government agencies to “lift research telescopes and other heavy, sensitive instruments.”  Space Perspective was founded by two former crew members of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in Arizona, which was originally constructed to explore the potential of closed ecological systems in supporting human life during outer-space missions.  Vincent Bachet, Space Perspective lead and development engineer, added that Neptune’s windows are going to be “the biggest windows flown into space.”  Using hyper-resistant materials and a special anti-UV coating, Space Perspective co-founder and co-CEO Taber MacCallum called them “the quintessential part of the experience.”  Couples who are interesting in the unique wedding experience can join the waitlist on Space Perspective’s website for late 2024.

The twosome worked alongside each other for two weeks at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn when she was a medical school student and he was a resident. As Carolina puts it, their courtship wasn’t exactly love at first sight. “I was skeptical of his big personality and braggadocios behavior,” Carolina admits. “On our first few days working together, he told me he loved house parties, red wine, and older women. Eye roll.”  But, in a plot twist of romantic comedy proportions, Freud managed to get Carolina’s number and would text her after every shift—and even when she traveled to Florida. “On the day I was returning to New York, he knew I was anxious about flying, and sent me Angus and Julia Stone’s ‘Big Jet Plane’ single to keep me calm throughout the flight. When I landed at JFK, he surprised me and was waiting at baggage claim. Five days later, we went on our first official date. As they say, the rest is history.”  Fast-forward to June 5, 2020, when the couple was taking a socially distanced trip to the Catskills. As physicians, both Carolina and Freud were on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic and took a well-deserved vacation once restrictions began to loosen. “When we arrived, the hotel staff recommended a walk in the garden prior to dinner,” she shares. “We got ready and while walking the garden, Freud got down on one knee. I am sure he had more to say but all I remember is, ‘Will you marry me?’” The answer? A resounding yes.  When it came to planning their September 3, 2022, wedding, the couple wanted their special day to highlight the bride’s Brazilian background and the groom’s Haitian roots. They enlisted wedding planner Nathalie Cadet-James of Luxe Fete, who had the perfect spot in mind: Itapororoca Villa in Trancoso, Brazil. “There is the essence of West Africa in this rustic Brazilian beach town,” the bride explains. “With its scenic backdrops and rich culture, we knew this was the perfect place to share our love story with family and friends.”  With 80 of their closest friends and family members in attendance, their destination was a beautiful representation of Carolina and Freud in every way imaginable. “As an interracial couple, it was important for us to highlight our different backgrounds,” the bride shares. “Nathalie is Haitian-American, and she really understood who we were as individuals, but also as a couple. Her excitement to celebrate our love story was noticeable from before we even officially hired her.” Read on for an intimate look at Carolina and Freud’s wedding festivities, as photographed by Heather Waraksa.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina and Freud didn’t have to look too far for wedding inspiration. Elements of Trancoso’s seaside beauty were woven throughout the weekend. From watercolor illustrations to magenta accents that pay tribute to the local bougainvillea flowers, the invitation suite from LetterHeads Miami gave guests the perfect glimpse of what was to come.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The couple kicked off the festivities with a beach party the night before the wedding. Carolina stunned in a white dress from Farm Rio, while Freud looked effortlessly elegant in a white button-down from Peter Millar and matching shorts.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our wedding [weekend] didn’t have a traditional timeline,” the bride shares. “We had our maid of honor and best man make their speeches during the welcome party so they could enjoy themselves. We know the effort it took for our guests to celebrate with us and we wanted them to enjoy themselves to the fullest.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Come the wedding day, the bride wore a strapless gown from Valentini Spose, which beautifully fulfilled her “clean and timeless vision.” She shares, “I truly believed that this was my day and wanted to wear something that made me feel spectacular. I was also three months postpartum when I started shopping for a wedding dress, so it was important for me to feel confident in it."" Carolina adds, ""I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  When it came to accessorizing her gown, Carolina knew she wanted to support women-owned businesses. She opted for a veil by Jennifer Leigh Couture Veils, Julia Vaughn jewelry, and a special pair of shoes from Brother Vellies. “During the beginning of the pandemic, I followed [Brother Vellies founder] Aurora James on Instagram,” Carolina explains. “It had to be fate that [she] designed a bridal shoe line for HBO’s Insecure. I texted Nathalie and the team and said, ‘I know I don’t have a dress yet, but I know this is the shoe.’ So, I actually bought my bridal shoes before I had a dress!”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Meanwhile, the groom suited up in a custom navy tuxedo from Suitsupply. Rounding out the look was a tie from Tom Ford, Hermès shoes, and his everyday accessories. “Freud wore his watch and a bracelet which was engraved with his daughter’s name,” Carolina adds.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Prior to the ceremony, the couple had an “intimate and emotional” first look. “We wanted to have a moment between us before sharing ‘us’ with everyone else,” the groom explains.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Upon arrival, guests could grab some water, local juices, or a monogrammed coconut as they listened to a soothing setlist from the string quartet group Quarteto De Cordas de Trancoso.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our ceremony was on the beach underneath coconut trees with a wooden altar decorated with bougainvillea,” the bride shares. “It was very simple, but elegant at the same time.” The view of the ocean was a welcomed bonus.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina glided down the aisle to Felix Mendelssohn’s “Marcha Nupcial,” with her father and a bouquet of local flowers in tow.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Freud spent months writing his vows during his night shifts, promising to “be present, to be here next week, next month, next year, and the year after that.” Meanwhile, Carolina performed a song she often sings to their daughter at night. Her favorite lyrics: “I love you in the morning, and in the afternoon. I love you in the evening, and underneath the moon.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The newlyweds slipped on their wedding bands from Boccardo Jewelers, shared a kiss, and recessed down the aisle to Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Make time to enjoy special moments with each other. It goes by so fast!  Photo by Heather Waraksa  After the ceremony, Carolina and Freud snuck away to take some pictures with photographer Heather Waraksa. “​​Make time to enjoy special moments with each other,” the couple recommends. “It goes by so fast!”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our reception decor is what [our florist] Katia Criscuolo calls 'brasilidade sofisticada'—or 'sophisticated Brazilianness,'” Carolina shares. “She incorporated local materials and tones in the lighting, linens, and place setting. There was one long table in the reception area with no assigned seating, which was to be decorated with magenta flowers among greenery.” The bride’s favorite area was the dessert room—a bougainvillea-adorned space that displayed “hundreds of sweets” on floating trays.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  If guests were craving fresh air, they could hang out in one of the venue’s chill outdoor seating areas.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  True to their love story, Carolina and Freud shared a sweet first dance to Angus and Julia Stone’s “Big Jet Plane.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  While the newlyweds opted for a buffet style of local Bahian-inspired food—courtesy of O Cacau—they tapped Confet Doceria to whip up a four-tiered cake. “We had two different flavors. One layer was white cake with brigadeiro filling, [which is a traditional Brazilian dessert],” the bride explains. “The other layers were white cake with dulce de leche filling.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Since Carolina and Freud love music—they have a shared fondness of hip-hop—they wanted to find a DJ who understood their taste. “We worked closely with our DJ, Nath Carreiro, to play music that played significant parts in our lives both as individuals and as a couple,” the groom notes. ""We shared with her Spotify playlists for both the welcome party and the wedding. DJ Nath was a smashing success!"" In fact, the newlyweds even infiltrated the DJ booth during the evening with their daughter, Celine.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “We were on the dance floor for most of the wedding,” Freud explains. But, according to the couple, guests left the event with more than some new dance moves. “Because many of our friends had never been to Brazil before, we focused a high level of detail on the experience that our guests would have,” Carolina shares. “Freud created a WhatsApp group with all the guests as a way for everyone to connect a few weeks prior to the wedding.

Gary Moretti and Deanna Mifsud booked their dream wedding in Lippincott Manor and had reserved a block of 30 rooms for guests to stay at The Crossroads Hotel nearby in Newburgh, New York. They reportedly expected 160 guests from across the country to attend their June 24 wedding.  The couple says their plans were turned upside down when they learned their hotel block had been cancelled to make room for migrants that were being sent upstate by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The Crossroads Hotel was tapped to accept migrants who were being bused from New York City to hotels in Westchester and the Hudson Valley.  ""We woke up the other morning and got a phone call from my sister...to check out the news,"" Moretti told "" Jesse Watters Primetime "" on Tuesday. ""No phone call, no text message, no email from them about any cancellations. I call them up and ... I asked them about the migrants going in there, is it going to be safe for my guests and ourselves to be there. They said, ‘No, you have nothing to worry about’ and in my heart I'm thinking, ‘OK, cool.’ They’re like... ‘Your contract has been cancelled.'""  REDDIT USER SLAMMED FOR PLANNING TO ATTEND A TAYLOR SWIFT CONCERT INSTEAD OF HER OWN MOTHER'S WEDDING  The couple said hotel officials told them there was nothing they could do, and it was a ""complete madhouse"" in there. The soon-to-be newlyweds were instructed to contact Choice Management, which oversees the hotel. They said they played a ""back and forth game"" talking to The Crossroads Hotel and Choice, to no avail. Now they are scrambling to find accommodations for their quickly approaching wedding .

""It's also the air show weekend,"" she told ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" ""So, everything is completely sold out. The hotels that are even talking to us with possible rooms, they want to charge us anywhere from like $300 to $400 a night. Now, our transportation, everybody (is) going to be scattered. So, we have one hotel that has been doing great. We have about 15 rooms blocked with them, but...we don't have a place to go. We're looking at Airbnbs."""

""A rule that we've set is that we don't want to catch up with people on the day of the wedding,"" Erbert said. ""We're inviting people that maybe we haven't seen in a while, but every time we get together with them, it's like we pick up right where we left off, or they're people that have been consistently in our lives throughout the years.

He added, ""We want the entire day to be a blast.""  And as for that first dance, Erbert revealed that it will be a special moment, even if Hough wasn't so interested in the wedding tradition at first.

The suit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Common Pleas by Aric Hutchinson and two other people hurt in the crash, names more than a half dozen defendants including Jamie Lee Komoroski, who police arrested in connection to the April 28th death of Samantha Miller 34.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, was killed in the Folly Beach crash in Charleston County.  Three other of Miller's family members, including Hutchinson, suffered major injuries in the two-vehicle late evening crash.  The lawsuit also names five local businesses as defendants and claims Komoroski, 25, had been ""bar hopping"" the day of the wreck, which according to an arrest affidavit, involved a rented Toyota Camry slamming into the golf cart.  In addition to wrongful death, the 28-page suit also accuses the defendants of gross negligence, reckless hiring, supervision and training as well as ""negligent infliction of emotional distress.""  'Noticeably and visibly intoxicated'  A responding Folly Beach police officer, who found the victims on the ground at the scene, said the driver of the Camry smelled strongly of alcohol and admitted to drinking ""one beer and a drink with tequila about an hour ago.""  “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments,” the lawsuit reads, “Jaime Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Former Raider enters plea in DUI caseEx-Raider Henry Ruggs pleads guilty to driving drunk at 156 mph, causing fatal crash  ""This case is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly,"" the family's Charleston-based attorney Danny Dalton said.  The plaintiffs ask for a jury trial and seek punitive damages among other costs in connection to the case.  Just married  Earlier this month, Folly Beach Public Safety Department Chief Andrew Gilreath told USA TODAY Hutchinson and Miller were married just hours before the 10:15 p.m. wreck.  Police said data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car show she was driving 65 mph and briefly hit the brakes before she slammed into the golf cart.  Komoroski, who is from Charleston, refused a sobriety and a breath test, according to her arrest affidavit. She was arrested and medical personnel drew a blood sample from her.  Prince Harry in harrowing ""car chase""Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan say they were in 'near catastrophic' car chase with paparazzi  According to additional court papers, when her blood was drawn her Blood Alcohol Content was 0.261, more than three times the legal limit to drive.

Still, every challenge you face while planning your wedding is an opportunity to improve your relationship, strengthen your bond, and deepen your communication skills as a couple.  “Defining your shared values, navigating conflict, getting on the same page in terms of finances, deciding how we spend time in relationships outside of our primary relationships—any number of topics that come up during wedding planning need to get negotiated on an ongoing basis,” says Jennifer Uhrlass, licensed marriage and family therapist at Modern MFT in New York City. “It has to be an ongoing, open dialogue, which is really training for the ongoing negotiations that are going that are going to take place along the course of the relationship.”  Meet the Expert Jennifer Uhrlass is a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) at Modern MFT in New York City.  Ahead, Uhrlass speaks to us about how this crucial window of time—the engagement period—can be an opportunity for couples to strengthen their relationship and build new skills as partners.  Communicate and Compromise  Every aspect of your wedding is about the two of you as a couple, which means you’ll both need to compromise to create a day that speaks to two different personalities. Sometimes it’s easy: Maybe one partner doesn’t care about the signature cocktails or the other partner doesn’t have a preference for the reception exit. But when only one partner is set on a destination wedding, or wants a religious ceremony, or won’t trim the guest list, the middle ground can be much harder to find.  The key, says Uhrlass, is making sure you take the time to fully listen to and process your partner’s wishes—and express your own—so that you can come to an agreement you are both on board with. “Do you truly, truly hear and understand the other person’s perspective, or are you just glossing over stuff and moving forward without understanding?” she says. “There are times when you can miss each other’s message—the message sent is not always the message received. Recognize the importance of slowing down the interaction, making sure you heard and understood what your partner said, and making sure that you can come to a mutual understanding.”  Get Into an Argument—or Several  Arguments about the details of your wedding—whether it’s your partner’s desire to torpedo the guest list by adding three tables of fraternity brothers or your own insistence on a specific type of music—are precursors to future conflicts in your life together. How you approach and solve these conflicts helps you lay the foundation for healthy and productive disagreements in the future. “Learning how to navigate conflict effectively with your partner is essential,” says Uhrlass. “You have to be able to do that well with each other because the problems are going to be perpetual. There's always going to be a need to navigate and negotiate ongoing issues throughout the course of the relationship.” Today it’s the guest list and cake flavors; tomorrow it may be where to send your kids to school or how to spend your year-end bonus. “Often, partners tend to get caught up in the content of a disagreement, when it can be much more productive to focus on their process of engagement when it comes to a particular conflict,” says Uhrlass. “What’s important is to learn how to navigate that conflict effectively; not so much trying to avoid conflict altogether, but to recognize that conflict is a healthy part of a relationship.”  Photo by Getty Images; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Family Boundaries  Weddings can bring out the best in your family, but there's no denying that they can also bring out the worst. Explaining to your parents that you won’t be tying the knot at your childhood church, telling your mother-in-law her entire bridge club didn’t make the guest list, breaking the news to your siblings that their toddlers won’t be invited to the reception: These family conflicts (and many others) have the potential to put you and your partner on opposite teams. As you prepare for your wedding, it's important to remember that you’re also developing a new team of your own. “One of the natural challenges around the topic of getting married is that there’s a shift: You were part of one family unit and now you’re cultivating a new family unit in your relationship with your partner,” says Uhrlass. “Moving through this identity shift can bring up a lot of conflicts and a lot of emotion.”  Use this time to set collective boundaries as a couple, understand each other’s family history, and prioritize your partnership. “It is possible to work through this through dialogue and understanding each person’s perspective,” says Urhlass. “’Your mom wants this, however, for us, we’re also weighing this and this,’—you want to make sure that you get on the same page so you can make decisions together as a unit.”  Talk About Money  How you choose to finance your wedding is a microcosm of the larger financial decisions you’ll make in the future: How you put together a budget, and whether you’ll stick to it; whether you’re willing to take on credit card debt or loans, or accept money from either set of parents; whether your individual incomes and spending patterns are causing unseen conflict. Deciding whether you want to splurge on a band or spend less on a DJ is a precursor to future conversations about which house is in your budget, whether you’ll put a vacation on your credit card, and how often you need to upgrade your television. “Navigating issues related to finances is a common point of contention,” says Urhlass. “It could bring up difficult emotions such as fear or feelings of inadequacy. There may also be significant power differentials; in a relationship where there's a disparity in income, it can negatively impact a couple's ability to address issues in a productive way. If partners haven't reached a place where they feel comfortable, there can be a lot to unpack there. If you're just leaving it festering in the background, and you're not really addressing it, then they will tend to get worse, or stay unaddressed, which can lead to contempt later on.”  Give Each Other Space to Destress  Every major life change brings a heightened period of stress, and you and your partner will need to know how to take care of yourselves—and each other—to get through them. “Learning to take care of yourself through the very difficult wedding planning process is, I think, an essential element to navigating life effectively,” says Uhrlass. “If we're stressed to the max and we're not taking care of ourselves, we're not working out, we're not getting our proper sleep, we're not getting nutrition, or we're not spending time with friends, it’s going to have a major impact on how we approach topics and conflict and disagreements. It's really important to step back and stick to routines that are helpful to manage the stress effectively.”  This could mean planning your meal tasting around your partner’s weekly round of golf, making sure you have enough money set aside for weekend excursions (instead of putting all travel on hold until your honeymoon), or maintaining your Friday date night—no wedding talk allowed. “Set aside time to have space with each other,” says Uhrlass. “Spend time with each other nurturing your relationship, as opposed to talking about the to-do list for the wedding.  Define Your Shared Values  A shared vision for your big day can also help you define the elements that will become your family’s values moving forward: How closely will you follow religious traditions? How often will you see your parents and siblings? What constitutes a worthwhile financial investment? How do you, as a couple and as individuals, define and deepen your relationships with your friends? “Two people can have very different beliefs and philosophies about money, or [anything] across the board,” says Urhlass. “That doesn't necessarily mean that they're incompatible. It just might mean that there's more to talk about, that they understand each other and make sure that they can be on the same page in terms of their long-term goals, their values, and how they want to move forward in their lives developing a sense of identity as a couple.”"

Alongside choosing the menu, flowers and decorations and sorting the table plan, body image – how we think and feel about the way we look – can cause worries, too.  We could not identify any previous research that had formally looked at how brides in the UK felt about their body image. To address this, and fill the gap in our knowledge, our research explored how brides felt about their body image in the run-up to their wedding. We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel – from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.  You may be interested in:  Love Island ditches fast fashion: how reality celebrities influence young shoppers’ habits  How to make your clothes last longer – it’s good for your bank account and the environment too  It’s not just weddings – how celebrating small wins and unconventional milestones can bring joy  They felt that this pressure came from various sources, including family and friends. They told us that others’ perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn’t want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn’t want to feel like I’d let people down…there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‘decoration’ in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I’m really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don’t think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck – cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn’t achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding."

Parrott opened Parrott Floral Co. last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  CEDAR RAPIDS -- Cassie Parrott has expressed herself through flowers all of her adult life.  “For me, it’s the creative side, and getting to share my artistic abilities through florals,” Parrott said one recent morning. “I’m horrible at drawing or painting or anything like that, but when it comes to being creative on the flower side...”  Parrott, 32, began working for florists soon after graduating from Cedar Rapids Jefferson High School, just a few blocks from her home. She kept working while completing Kirkwood Community College’s horticulture program.  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her Parrott Floral Co. home design studio last Wednesday in southwest Cedar Rapids. She opened her business last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Advertisement  Gaining some 15 years experience, Parrott and her husband, Joey, decided last year it was time to strike out on her own.  “I had been doing it for other businesses and just decided I wanted to be doing it for myself,” she said. “I knew what it all entailed, and what I needed.”  A small toolshed in her backyard became her studio, freshened with new paint and outfitted with work tables and a florist’s refrigerator to keep blooms fresh.  “Thankfully, we had this workshop,” she said. “It was just storage. We started converting, and it went really quickly after I decided I wanted to for-sure do it.”  Wedding specialty  Parrott’s goal is to specialize on weddings, but she’s taken other business during her start-up.  “From the beginning, I knew I was going to have to do some everyday retail,” she said. “Friends and family will say, ‘Hey, can you do a birthday bouquet for me tomorrow?’ And I can make it happen.”  Business News Newsletter Signup Newsletter Signup Delivered to your inbox weekdays Email Please wait...

Without a traditional storefront, which she didn’t want to invest in, Parrott typically begins the design process in customers’ homes, where being a one-woman operation has its advantages.  “I have the capabilities and the time to actually get to know each one of my brides and give my undivided attention to them and not have to worry about other customers coming in,” she said.  Large, elaborate displays are popular for this season’s weddings, she said.  “Big, colorful arches and hanging installations,” Parrott said. “Big statement pieces are the trendy things right now.”  Most customers have at least some idea what they’re after.  “A lot of times they have somewhat of a vision,” she said. “They’ve gone to Pinterest or Google or Instagram or TikTok and found pictures they like. I guide them and make it fit within their budget and make their vision come to life for them.”  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her home floral design studio in Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Using social media  Social media also is a key marketing tool.  “When you’re starting a business, anything free is helpful,” Parrott said. “Anytime we do a wedding and they post pictures and tag us in it, that helps spread the word.  “Those relationships with other wedding vendors help. A venue, a dress shop, a tux shop, a bakery, we all get together and make a mock wedding, and it’s photographed and we post that on our socials.”  Parrott works through a wholesale florist in Illinois and directly with big flower farms in Ecuador and Chile. In-season, she also buys locally grown blooms.  Managing deliveries, she said, is vital.  “When somebody’s buying a bouquet for a birthday or anniversary, they want that to last as long as possible. I want to get that in right before the occasion and get it out to them in the form where it’s barely started blooming,” she said. “With a wedding, they’re wanting (the full bloom). Depending what kinds of blooms, I have a process where I get them to their full potential for the wedding day.”  Friends, family help  Parrott is her namesake company’s sole full-time employee, but friends and family help with deliveries and building elaborate arrangements. Peak wedding season brings some early-morning starts.  “We’re always one of the first vendors at a wedding on Saturday,” she said. “You want to be in and out, so once they start with pictures that’s all done. By about noon I have everything set up.”  Cassie Parrott dyes flowers made out of wood shavings to create at floral arrangement for a client Wednesday at her home design studio in southwest Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Despite working through the pandemic’s lingering supply-chain effects -- Parrott estimates wholesale flower costs have tripled -- she’s optimistic about her business’ first busy season.  “When I opened, my main concern was just getting clients and getting my name out there as my business and myself,” she said. “But I’ve booked 11 weddings since September. For my first eight months, that seems like a pretty good number.”"

However, there were also many B-town celebs who decided to keep their wedding an intimate affair. The trend of having a secret and hush-hush wedding also started after the Covid-19 pandemic.  But, did you know that ‘Vivaah’ actress Amrita Rao married the love of her life RJ Anmol at a temple in Pune on a budget as low as Rs 1,50,000?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMRITA RAO 🇮🇳 (@amrita_rao_insta)  Recently, the couple released a YouTube video on their official channel wherein they elaborated on the cost of their wedding, the venue, and how they were able to pull off a close-knit shaadi in that budget.  In the ‘Anniversary Special’ episode of ‘Couple Of Things’, they took us down memory lane to the place they got married nine years ago.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The handful of people who attended their wedding traveled from Mumbai to Iskcon Temple in Katraj, Pune where the couple secretly tied the knot. As for the stay and other functions like Sangeet, Mehendi, and Karaoke Night, the couple booked a hotel on the outskirts of Pune.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The couple further revealed that the outfits they wore were very traditional and cost not more than Rs 3000 each because they didn’t want to wear designer clothes. The ‘Main Hoon Na’ actor also wore all artificial jewellery on her wedding day.  “When I told Anmol that I wanted to buy jewellery, he had told me ‘Abhi q shopping karni hai, tabhi karo na shaadi k baad.’ And when the wedding happened, we were busy building our house so we had no time to shop. So, I wore artificial jewellery top to bottom. I was very angry.”  In the video, the couple then visited their wedding venue and relived those fond memories.  Amrita further revealed that she also carried her makeup kit and did her wedding makeup herself. Her family members helped her get ready for the special occasion.  They also added that one of the reasons they wanted to get married in Pune was because Amrita’s grandparents were in Pune so it was easier for them to travel to the venue. Concluding the video, Amrita shared:  “We always believed that weddings should be about love, not about showing off wealth and ostentation. We wanted our wedding to be a beautiful, intimate affair with just our immediate families & close friends, and we’re glad we were able to achieve that without spending a fortune.”  To this, RJ Anmol added, “Our wedding was a reflection of our personalities, and we wanted to keep it humble. We would be happy if this inspires people to opt for budget-friendly weddings too.”  Clearly, you don’t have to spend crores to make memories and get married to the love of your life.

Based on a book by Arpita Mukherjee and Sabrina Dhawan, the musical is conceived and directed by Nair, and “tries to capture the 2001 film’s spirit,” according to The New York Times.

As event planners string marigold flower chains and pitch a pole tent for the festivities, mania ensues. The bride-to-be, Aditi, is torn between her feelings for her ex-lover and her soon-to-be husband, the wedding planner falls in love with the family’s maid, and buried family secrets come to the surface during the days-long celebration. “Nair’s celebration rings joyful and cathartic: as a love song to her home city of Delhi and to her own Punjabi family,” says the musical’s synopsis. “At its core, it’s a story of families: how they love, rejoice, and endure together.”  calling all nyers and well wishers to immediately go see Mira Nair’s brilliant *Monsoon Wedding: The Musical* pic.twitter.com/twgjkJRP5n — Manan Ahmed (@sepoy) May 14, 2023  The production was first staged in 2017 at Berkeley Repertory Theater, where it received mixed reviews, the Bay Area Player reported at the time. Work on the adaptation began in 2006, with Nair and the film’s screenwriter, Dhawan, collaborating with composer Vishal Bhardwaj and the lyricist Susan Birkenhead. Nair told The Times that “she’d been inspired by the 2004 Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” a show built around cultural traditions adapting to survive.  The Times further notes that “like the film, the musical touches upon the fallout of India’s 1947 partition, brought to life in the characters’ religious, social and economic differences. Nair told the publication that the film is about “our families, but so deeply universal — this essential story of understanding a whole society and movement through a very personal story.”  However, the musical deviates a little from the film, in terms of messaging. For the musical, Nair had to revisit one of the film’s subplots, she told The Times, “about a relative’s grooming and sexual abuse of two younger family members.” A “concerted effort” was made to have “the women question the patriarchy and speak up,” Nair said. “Other characters who are afflicted by this don’t shove it under the rug; they make decisions in their own lives that reflect that they will not accept this behavior, which we didn’t have before.”  The change is reflective of Nair’s work which “has never shied away from examining cultural distinctions,” The Times notes. “Mississippi Masala” (1991) explored the interracial romance between a Black man and Indian American woman, “Salaam Bombay!” (1988), revolved around children living in the slums.  “Monsoon Wedding” is currently playing at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, through June 25."

WATCH: Monty Don shares personal garden transformation  Monty offset his classic white shirt and black suit with a blue tie covered with yellow flowers, while Sarah tied in with his colour scheme in a stunning pastel blue frock. It featured a high neckline, long sleeves, a ditsy floral print and navy piping which she teamed with pearl drop earrings and her blonde hair in a sleek straight bob.  The celebrity gardener captioned the candid photo, which appears to have been taken at the wedding breakfast: ""3 years ago on this day Sarah and I were celebrating our son Adam’s marriage to Emily. On the same day 37 years ago we were married too.""  © Instagram Monty and Sarah's son got married in 2017  At the time, fans rushed to comment on the couple's outfits, writing: ""Look at you all poshed up,"" and: ""I love the tie."" A third added: ""Lucky Monty, Sarah is a beauty.""  Monty and Sarah chose much more timeless outfits on their own wedding day. On their 39th anniversary in 2022, he shared one rare throwback photo, taken in 1983, which showed the newlyweds standing outside a set of wrought iron gates, with Monty's new wife rocking an unconventional blue outfit.  Sarah ditched bridal white for a dusty cornflower jacket with large buttons down the front, which she paired with a chunky necklace and matching earrings.  Meanwhile, Monty didn't appear to have aged at all – he sported the same thick curly hair and big grin and wore a cream suit and black spotty tie.  He accompanied the photo with a heartfelt message to his childhood sweetheart Sarah, whom he met at Cambridge University. ""We got married 39 years ago today - the picture is a little faded, a little wrinkly, like us but the love is as evergreen and strong now as it was all those years ago,"" Monty sweetly wrote.  Monty and Sarah share three children, Tom, Adam and Freya, and they are proud grandparents to George and Daisy Rose. However, Sarah candidly opened up about her ill health following childbirth and the impact it had on their marriage in their book, The Jewel Garden.  ""I was ill for months after our daughter was born despite having had a supposedly film-star birth at an enormously expensive private London hospital,"" Sarah wrote. ""I had a slipped disc, a result of the bodged delivery, and was so anaemic that I needed a blood transfusion.  ""My injuries were not acknowledged and as we tried to leave the hospital I had to walk down three flights of stairs because the lift had broken. I was unable to walk or stand properly for over a year,"" she shared.  Being bedridden put a strain on their relationship, with Sarah candidly writing: ""When it came down to it, Montagu was a loony and I was ill all the time.""

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable – perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star’s natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn’t too saturated. “We wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling. Kissable lips!” she explains. In the end, this was achieved with a Chanel tinted lip balm accompanied by a natural contour shade lip pencil.  Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Hydrating Beautifying Tinted Lip Balm Buildable Colour £34 at CHANEL  Part of the intrigue of Rouge Coco Baume is how it veils the lips in a practical, buildable colour. As you layer your chosen shade, the finish transforms from a sheer, barely there color to a more opaque and luminous pigment. Richie’s lip was done with shade 928 Pink Delight, one of nine shades that range from rich reds to iridescent pearls. My personal favorite? 914 Natural Charm, which enhances my pout’s natural colour.  “The Rouge Coco Baume range is hydrating and my constant go to!” Dubroff says, admitting that the formula is perfect for not only summer but in cooler temperatures when lips are more easily chapped. Why? The balm is enriched with a fruit and olive leaf-derived oil that boasts antioxidant and rejuvenation benefits – meaning lips are soft, hydrated, and smoother upon application. With its conditioning properties and sheer, never-shiny tint, it’s safe to say I’ve found my ultimate summer lip.  Below, shop the rest of Sofia Richie’s bridal beauty look."

There were whispers leading up to the day that Kate would forgo crown jewels at the request of the King because he wanted a more modest ceremony (not sure if we would call this event less opulent, but okay). And veering far from tradition, Kate chose a bespoke leafy-floral headpiece crafted from sequins, metallic beading and sparkling silver threadwork by Jess Collett X Alexander McQueen. It was a royal fashion moment for the books (as was the matching smaller version of the headpiece worn by Princess Charlotte), and one that has tipped off a trend of exquisite and elaborate bejewelled wedding headpieces as coveted accessory.  “I thought Catherine’s headpiece conveyed a youthful and whimsical vibe,” says Toronto-based accessory designer Blair Nadeau, founder and owner of Blair Nadeau Bridal Adornments, who is renowned for her exquisite jewellery, veils, hair accessories and crowns. “I literally squealed when I saw it. This accessory didn’t feel old and stuffy, it felt fresh. I loved the tiered leaf and floral motif and the doubled-banded style. The look is perfect for a wedding because it’s elegant and impactful and very modern feeling.”  Nadeau says the organic shape of Kate’s instantly iconic headpiece is what makes it easy and effortless for brides to wear. “We are still in a bit of a minimalist era but starting to see the emergence of softer silhouettes and more texture with three-dimensional details like floral embellishments and lace patterns,” she shares. “The silver tone provided an airy lightness that is very much happening now with accessories after years of bold gold designs.”  If you’re feeling the luxe headpiece vibe for your wedding day, Nadeau has a few thoughts on how to wear them. Pair a design like Kate’s with a light and airy dress with a fluid silhouette made from tulle, chiffon or lace. She also recommends keeping hair easy and not overly styled. “I actually love the juxtaposition of soft waves with a statement headpiece,” says Nadeau. “If you do wear it up, keep it soft and a little imperfect, not too sleek.”  As for adding other wedding accessories, keep it simple and classic. Kate opted for a pair of diamond and South Sea pearl drop earrings that belonged to Princess Diana, which Nadeau says worked because they complemented the motif of her headpiece. “I actually love a veil combined with a statement headpiece, but the trick is to keep it simple and minimal,” she says. “Always remember your wedding accessories are there to complement you and your dress.”  Bejewelled wedding headpieces to shop now  This bold trend is here to stay for several wedding seasons  The shape and finish of the Victoria headpiece is very much in step with the Princess of Wales’s style on Coronation day. It’s the perfect match for big, bold and volumized hair!  The Arielle headband by Jennifer Behr was first launched in 2010 and continues to be a runaway bestseller. It features hundreds of Swarovski-crystal-adorned leaves fastened to a silver ribbon-wrapped skinny headband.  The Millaray crown features a dramatic criss-cross design that creates a delicate and bold effect. Crafted from crystal beads, enamel and brass flowers, sterling-silver-plated wire and Mokuba silk ribbon, this piece is truly breathtaking.  The Cecilia headband is bedazzling hand-crafted custom piece that can take up to 16 weeks to receive from order date, so plan accordingly. This beauty is hanndmade from rhodium plating and is detailed with fresh water pearls and Swarovski crystals.  The Henri headband mixes pearls and crystals to create a maximum impact wedding accessory. This one would look amazing as a re-wear for any weddings or formal events on your upcoming calendar.  This is an amazing piece of hair jewellery that is very deco-inspired! It wraps around your head and is anchored by two dazzling leaf motifs on either side—so dramatic and so different!  We love the vintage vibe bow design of this glittering headband by designer Keren Wolf. This halo-style headpiece is easy to wear and pairs beautifully with easy, breezy wedding hair.

Don’t dredge up drunken antics. And whatever you do, don’t wing it.  But a new etiquette question has recently emerged: Can you use AI to write them?  Couples and their loved ones are putting ChatGPT to the emotional Turing test, as they seek to give vows and toasts that are personal and eloquent but don’t rely on a writerly touch. What they’re finding is that AI can’t beat a human on the feelings front—phew!—but it can perhaps help prompt memories or create structure.  Ten days before her wedding, Kelly Tenn, 35, found herself on the planning website Joy, answering prompts from its free AI speechwriting tool, which relies on OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology.  “For me, there’s obviously this big craze around AI tools over the past few months, and I was a bit skeptical to try to use a tool like this,"" said Ms. Tenn, a brand-marketing executive for a cloud-technology company in San Francisco. She doesn’t find writing hard—“I work in content,"" she said—but for vows “it takes a little bit more creativity in how you articulate something that is summarizing your relationship over many years and years to come.""  Ms. Tenn used the product to create multiple versions of AI-generated vows, including prose “spoken like a friend"" and “Shakespearean-style verbiage"" (“So often have I pondered our love and asked, wherefrom hath thy love descended so unexpectedly?""). Ultimately she scrapped the drafts, which she found basic and nondescript, but she said using the tool helped her break out of writer’s block.  The tool also eased her woes about getting up in front of a crowd on her wedding day. “Public speaking is not something I prefer to do,"" Ms. Tenn said. “This is one of many ways to help lower the barrier and alleviate nerves.""  Write Your Own Vows Using AI  Let’s write vows to an imaginary spouse. Once you answer these questions, the AI tool ChatGPT will generate vows based on your responses.  Ahead of their April wedding, Jeff and Allison Hood of Atlanta used Provenance’s toast and vow builder, which launched in early 2023. It prompts each partner to share stories, memories and promises for their future spouse. Through the service, which costs $19.99, each partner can also view the relative length and tone of their significant others’ vows without seeing the contents.  “There was really nothing that didn’t sound like my authentic voice,"" said Mr. Hood, 34, a custom clothier. Since he’s “not a novelist,"" he was grateful that the tool presented his thoughts in a way that flowed well.  Ms. Hood, 32 and head of growth for a digital-marketing agency, kept a running list in her phone of all the things she loves about her partner since they started dating four years ago. “They’re just like ‘I stubbed my toe and he brought me a Band-Aid and I felt so special,’"" she said. “It wasn’t something I could actually say on my wedding day.""  Left to her own devices, Ms. Hood said her vows would have sounded as though they had been written by a second-grader: “Will you marry me? Check ‘yes’ or ‘no.’"" Reading what Provenance came up with, she thought, “‘Wow, I would have never worded it this way and it sounds so thoughtful—and the way that I actually feel.’""  Less than two weeks before giving a rehearsal-dinner toast for a best friend’s wedding, Randi Kramer, 29, thought: How do I capture nearly a decade of friendship in just a few minutes? Another friend suggested she try ToastWiz, a paid service for crafting speeches that uses AI.  “More than anything, it was a tool that got me past writer’s block,"" said Ms. Kramer, an associate editor at a publishing house in New York City. Thanks to prompts the form gave her—such as asking for adjectives to describe the couple and a favorite anecdote about the bride—Ms. Kramer was finally able “to get the juices flowing.""  She paid $30 for three speech drafts. “I was able to Frankenstein it together,"" she said, estimating that a third of what the chatbot produced made it into her final speech.  “I definitely didn’t tell anyone,"" she said, of using the service.  Julia Rosenson, 25, a software engineer in New York City, used Joy’s service to help write her maid of honor speech for her sister’s coming September wedding. While she’s found it to be “a fun little tool"" to play with, Ms. Rosenson said it should only be used for inspiration.  “It’s pretty hit or miss—mostly miss—just because they don’t know my sister at all,"" she said, “but they put together a whole story,"" adding that it was quite funny to read. “It generates anecdotes as if I were going to tell a story about my sister and her fiancé on a camping trip they never took, or some pivotal imaginary relationship moment,"" Ms. Rosenson said.  Joy’s CEO Vishal Joshi said the tool’s invented anecdotes should be seen as placeholders for personal material. “It will make up interesting stories where it could be like, ‘OK, a story quote over here would be nice,’"" he said.  Kyle and Sarah Kuo, both 26, of Tempe, Ariz., used Provenance to prepare for their April 2023 wedding. Ms. Kuo, a registered nurse at an outpatient family practice, especially liked the fact that you could cross-check your partner’s vows to make sure you were on the same page, tone-wise.  “You don’t want to put too many jokes in there if your partner is being serious and sentimental,"" she said.  For his part, Mr. Kuo, a director of operations at a production company, was just glad to have his time back.  “I would have had to Google ‘how to write your vows’ and read through, you know, nine articles,"" he said."

Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  In the days after Russia's invasion last year, Ukrainian forces need help targeting Russian troops.  One Ukrainian artillery unit relied on help from Ukrainian civilians to guide their strikes.  Using repurposed drones, cameras and phones, and Google Maps, that unit put rounds on its targets.  Hobby drones and Google Maps were designed to enhance human life, not to end it, but when Russian tank columns seemed to be closing in on Kyiv in the days after Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, desperate Ukrainian defenders found they had two unlikely assets.  Col. Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine's 43rd Artillery Brigade, and Col. Serhiy Ogerenko, the brigade's chief of staff, told Ukrainian media that they were able to use civilian drones and Google Maps, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian civilians, to locate and target Russian forces in the early days of the war.  At the time, Ukrainian gunners faced the problem of hitting Russian vehicles — moving targets — without trained forward observers to estimate where the vehicle would be when the shell landed.  ""That's why we needed 'eyes,'"" Ogerenko said. ""We called civilians and asked, 'Do you see this section of the road? If a shell hits in a minute and a half, can you tell us at least roughly where it exploded?' Then the person would describe the place of the explosion, and we would open a Google map and see, yes, there is such a place behind the vegetable gardens.""  A woman uses her smartphone in a house damaged by shelling in southeastern Kyiv in March 2022. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images  Civilians also offered to use their hobby drones as scouts and artillery spotters. DJI Mavic quadcopters — nicknamed ""wedding drones"" because that is what they were used to record before the war — proved invaluable to the 43rd Artillery Brigade.  ""They provided the picture,"" Shevchuk said, according to a translation of the interview. ""4G, WhatsApp, a video call — the cameraman picked up, saw something, took off his phone, and said, 'look what I have.' I looked at it and said, 'hold it. We're going to shoot now.' It was convenient.""  Story continues  Drones — both military-designed and civilian models — are among the most vital assets for troops on both sides of the war. Ukrainian and Russian drones prowl the skies constantly, looking for enemy positions and movements, as well as for artillery batteries, supply depots, and command posts.  Shevchuk recounted how ""one guy from a gas station even gave us access to his camera."" Rather than explain the situation to Ukrainian gunners, the owner told them, ""'here's the password. See for yourself,'"" Shevchuk recalled. ""That's how we saw our first live target — a column of Chechens near Novyi Bykiv [37 miles from Kyiv] heading towards Kyiv. So we 'met' them three kilometers [1.9 miles] further.""  A drone operator corrects Ukrainian 82mm mortar fire toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in April. SERGEY SHESTAK/AFP via Getty Images  Sometimes Ukrainian forces would get indications that Russian troops were in a village, but not their precise location. ""We open a Google map, see a store, see its phone number, and dial it,"" said Shevchuk, who described a typical conversation:  ""Good evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any Katsaps [Ukrainian slur for Russians] in the village?"" ""Yes."" ""Where?"" ""Behind Grandma Hanna's house."" ""What house does Grandma Hanna have?"" ""Well, everyone knows her!""  ""So you talk to people a little bit and realize where everything is,"" Shevchuk added.  This isn't the only example of how Ukrainian civil society is using consumer technology to enhance Ukraine's military capabilities. To cope with waves of Russian long-range drones penetrating deep into Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian military has formed mobile air-defense teams equipped with short-range anti-aircraft weapons.  Ordinary citizens can use cellphone apps to report drone sightings to a central database, which can then alert mobile air-defense units.  Ukrainian troops fire an 2S7 Pion howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut in March. Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Ukrainians using video cameras and cellphones to call in artillery fire on Russians forces as they pass by is a bizarre, almost comical, illustration of how a modern war can play out in an urban environment. But it also shows how much danger those civilians faced from invaders intent on defeating Ukraine's military and then repressing the Ukrainian public.  Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries have been accused of numerous atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and Moscow has clamped down on Ukrainians living in areas it still controls in an effort to prevent attacks by partisans or special-operations forces. Anyone suspected of providing intelligence to Ukraine's devastatingly effective artillery could expect little mercy.  ""We lost contact with many people, and some said: 'That's it, I'm turning off my phone, deleting all my contacts. There are Russians in the next house,'"" Shevchuk said of civilians his forces were in contact with. ""Some people immediately said: 'I'm scared, don't ask me any questions.' But people called us from everywhere.""  Michael Peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in Forbes, Defense News, Foreign Policy magazine, and other publications.

I believe cash is king. (There’s no point in buying a toaster or some other kitchen implement for a couple that will most likely have been living together for years and have everything they need.)  But what is really tricky is the invitation to a destination wedding. It’s all very well if you decide to get married on a beach in Bali in flip flops and a floaty white dress. But think of the guests.  A couple may find it hard to believe, but travelling for a wedding is often seen as hassle and as expensive.  It requires taking some of your annual leave from work, which you might really resent, having hoped to save your days off to go on a decent holiday of your own choice.  You really may not want to have to rock up somewhere in Italy for a wedding event that, in the old days, used to just take place over the course of a day.  It’s downright cheeky to assume that your friends and family will welcome a wedding abroad. While close family members have no choice but to follow the couple to a hired villa in France or wherever, friends will be counting the cost.  You’re talking a few grand (at least €2,000) which is a big ask for a guest. There’s all the logistics of getting from the airport to the wedding venue which might be hours away, somewhere deep in the Italian countryside.  Scenic and romantic? Certainly, but far from practical.  Whatever happened to the Saturday wedding in a hotel serving beef or salmon? Now, folk want to emulate celebrities with their fancy notions involving hiring a wedding planner and dragging their mates abroad because ‘it’s all about the experience’.  Yes, making memories can be expensive.  But now you have the perfect excuse to decline an invitation to a wedding in some far-flung place. It’s our old enemy – the carbon footprint.  Can you really justify a flight when at least 2.4% of global emissions come from aviation?  Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.  While that may not seem like a massive contributor, only a small percentage of the world flies frequently. It’s for the relatively rich and indulgent.  Put that on your wedding invitation refusal and you should be off the hook. (On the other hand, if you have plenty of time on your hands, you could indulge in ‘slow travel’ using boats and trains and coaches to get to the celebrations). Now that could be a great and memorable trip. But time may not be on your side.  Most of us are wage slaves unable to dedicate days and days to just travelling to a destination.  According to a BBC report, a return flight from London to San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes of CO2 per person, more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year and about half of the average carbon footprint of someone living in the UK.  Even a fairly short return flight from London to Berlin emits three times the emissions saved from a year of recycling.  A study involving 29 international students asked them to rate the importance of different flights they had taken. Just 58% of the flights were rated ‘very important’ or ‘important’.  And really, how important is a flight to the Caribbean for a wedding party?  Unless you’re close family, you’d be justified in turning down the invitation – on environmental grounds.  Some people compensate for the emissions from their flights by buying a carbon offset. But this is a bit of a cod. Trees, for example, need years to grow enough to reabsorb the carbon from your flight, and there’s no guarantee they’ll be left standing long enough to counteract your flight emissions.  That kind of thing is for the wealthy who continue contributing to climate change, offsetting, but not changing their behaviour.  The solution to destination weddings? Elope. Just the two of you."

The bride recalled: ""I’ve been with Shane half my life but we were planning to get married in a few years’ time in Turkey.

He is my absolute rock.  ""And having spent so much of my life without him, I just knew I wanted my dad to be there at my wedding.”  Realising that she had so much to organise in a short time, Sophie appealed for help on community Facebook group Witney Spotted.

Multiple wedding dresses were offered in varying sizes.  Sophie said: “I can’t keep up with the offers. It's been so overwhelming.  “The hardest part was going to be finding a venue at such short notice particularly with summer coming and that was why I reached out.  ""But I was blown away by the response.  “I’ve been in touch with a couple of people who have offered wedding dresses and I have a friend who works in Blossom Bridal in Witney and I’m going to try some on to get the size and the style and then I will be looking at second hand offers and in Barnado’s.”  At the moment the likely venue is Witney’s Corn Exchange for a date around September 16.

Alyssa and Duncan were matched on the experiment together and after a series of ups and downs, Duncan eventually called it a day on their relationship.  Talking about her MAFS Australia wedding, Alyssa told Hello! Magazine she told Duncan she was a single parent and was disappointed it was never aired for viewers to see.  “I don’t know why they didn’t show it, it totally perpetuates the stigma around single parents,” she said. “It was suddenly revealed like, ‘I have a child. I have a child’.  “And then people were like, ‘When did she even tell him? When is she going to tell him?’ And I said, ‘Well guys, I was really upfront and honest, I told him straight away!’ I literally do not know why they didn’t show it,” Alyssa explained about their wedding on MAFS Australia.  Duncan has recently moved on from Alyssa and is now in a relationship with his co-star Evelyn Ellis. The happy couple announced the news in a Honesty Box session with 9Entertainment and it was incredibly wholesome.  “All of a sudden we went on a couple of nights, and some of the warm fuzzy feelings happened in my stomach and I thought, ‘What’s this? How we going here?’ Then one thing led to another,” Duncan said explaining how they started dating.

Kelly Piquet ended up attending the wedding alone, posting pictures of herself in a red, feathered dress on Instagram.  1 Piquet enjoyed the wedding despite Verstappen's absence. Credit: Kelly Piquet via Instagram  She titled the post “Lady in red” but did not explain her boyfriend’s absence from the event.  The answer can be found on Twitch where Verstappen was streaming himself racing in the virtual 24 Hours of Nurburgring.  The current world champion F1 driver was racing as part of his virtual F1 Team Redline streaming with another member Chris Lulham.  Verstappen apparently decided to join the competition at the last minute after Lulham had complained about the amount of work he had to do for his upcoming exams.  Lulham was on the call talking with Verstappen while the F1 driver took part in the race.  During the race Lulham tries to defend himself saying: “If I had raced I would have had to rock up with like five hours break.”  However, Verstappen quickly cuts him off saying: “I cancelled a wedding for it.”  Lulham suggests that Verstappen was happy to cancel his plans though saying: “Don’t tell me this isn’t what you’d rather be doing.”  To which Verstappen replies: “I love sim racing, but sometimes you have to think about the greater good.”  Verstappen has previously shown that he is almost as passionate about virtual F1 racing as he is about the real deal.  He slammed Le Mans Virtual’s organisers after issues with the servers prevented him from finishing.  Recently, he installed a full F1 simulator in his £12million private jet so that he can practise on the go.  Despite Verstappen’s absence, Piquet appears to have had a great time at the wedding, with a fan commenting on her post that Piquet even managed to catch the bouquet.

Princess Anne's daughter tied the knot with Mike Tindall on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, stepping out of the car with her father Captain Mark Phillips wearing a gown by Stewart Parvin, one of her grandmother's favourite couturiers. The long ivory silk dress featured a Duchess satin trim and a chevron pleated corseted bodice, which she teamed with a fine tulle veil secured in place with a precious Greek tiara known as Princess Andrew's Meander Tiara.  WATCH: Zara and Mike Tindall spotted for the first time following their wedding ceremony  But did you know the headpiece, estimated to be worth £280,000 ($350,000), had a special meaning?  Zack Stone from Seven Stone explained: ""It’s a particularly sentimental piece as Princess Alice gave it to Queen Elizabeth II as a wedding present in 1947, who later passed it on to Zara’s mother, Princess Anne.  © Getty Zara's Greek tiara was given to Queen Elizabeth on her wedding day  ""Made of diamonds, the tiara's Greek key design is punctuated by a central laurel wreath element and two honeysuckle elements.

Zara and Mike got married in Edinburgh in 2011  The honeysuckles on the 'something borrowed' piece from Prince Philip's mother Princess Alice of Battenberg are said to symbolise pure happiness, while the laurel wreath design was used as a Greek symbol of triumph – both fitting for Olympic equestrian Zara's big day.  For the royal wedding, mother-of-the-bride Princess Anne looked striking in a peach pleated dress, cream and pink embroidered jacket and an elaborate lace and flower detail fascinator, while the Queen also chose a pastel pink ensemble accessorised with a beautiful diamond lapel brooch.  © Getty Anne wore a pink pleated mother of the bride dress  Zara wasn't the only member of the royal family to turn to Queen Elizabeth's jewellery collection for her wedding day. Princess Anne borrowed Queen Mary's Fringe Tiara – worn by her mother in 1947 – for her nuptials in 1973, which was then loaned to Princess Beatrice for her low-key pandemic wedding with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020.  Meanwhile, Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, and the Duchess of Sussex wore Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara – a last-minute change after originally being offered the late Princess Diana's glittering headpiece.  It is not known who inherited the accessories after the Queen passed away in September 2022. It's possible they will continue to be passed down and may now belong to Princess Anne, who already loaned tiaras to her daughter Zara and former daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips.

Fortunately, the spectacular day went off without a hitch – and Laura, 32, and Joseph, 34, are now Zooming in to chat about it from Australia after sell-out gigs at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. By the time you read this, they'll have performed in Wellington. And this week, it's Auckland's turn to see their show Til Death Do Us Hearts, which they describe as ""an intimate evening of songs about love, life and maintaining a successful relationship with your co-worker"". But back to the wedding… The fun-loving couple wanted their big day to be full of excitement and surprises for everyone, so it started with a laugh-a-minute bus ride to the venue, featuring some of their favourite pop songs and hilarious mock commentary from a voiceover artist who introduces the fireworks at Disneyland. Joseph jokes he spent ""five times longer"" on this part of the wedding than he did his vows! Former Seven Sharp reporter Laura has stayed good friends with Nadia ever since the 2019 season of Dancing With The Stars and says the MasterChef judge's farm, with its stunning views out to Lake Wakatipu, made for a ""special"" venue. She adds, ""I went to Nadia's the night before and they've got a little apartment I stayed in. Nadia was heavily pregnant at the time, but she still made me dinner, which was so cute!"" Laughing, Joseph jokes, ""It was just a My Food Bag.""  The bride with pregnant pal Nadia and her husband Carlos Bagrie.  The ceremony was sweet and simple – the only real tradition they followed was Laura spending the night apart from her groom. She explains, ""We spend our lives so deeply intertwined. This was the one thing we could do to be like, 'OK, let's build this up!'"" Being reunited at the altar was a powerful moment. An uncharacteristically serious Joseph says, ""We're always going to treasure that memory."" They both get emotional recalling groomsmen Paul Williams (Taskmaster NZ) and Nic Sampson (The Brokenwood Mysteries) bursting into tears. Joseph adds, ""I really like that we made a lot of our friends cry to a Jason Derulo song!"" True to their nature, a few details were left to the last minute. Joseph says, ""I remember I emailed the suit makers, 'Hello, I'd like one wedding suit please,' and they replied, 'When's your wedding?' When I told them it was in a month, they were like, 'But we have to make it in Italy!'"" Fortunately, it arrived three days before they left for Queenstown.  The bridal party (from left): Alice Harbourne, Simone Nathan,  Steph Badham, Eli Matthewson, Brynley Stent and Zara Cormack.  Similarly, Laura says, ""We both wrote our vows the night before the wedding."" She'd sought help from newlywed comedian Chris, who told her, ""The vows will just come to you."" She says she and Joseph often have to write jokes under pressure for work, adding, ""That's when our best stuff comes out!"" The reception was under a huge tent decorated with fairy lights and flowers. There were games, speeches, drinks and  a vegetarian dinner. As for the first dance, Laura says, ""We didn't do a big, choreographed number, which a few people were expecting, but we did a cute sway side to side."" The party went on into the early hours of the morning, with dancing, singing and a saxophonist playing alongside the DJ. ""It was really going off!"" Laura exclaims delightedly. And then it was round two of partying the next day for New Year's Eve, with the newlyweds heading off on honeymoon to Hawaii. ""It rocked – I had the best time!"" declares Laura, prompting Joseph to ask, ""The honeymoon or the wedding?"" ""Both!"" Laura quickly chirps, adding that Disneyland was also on the itinerary – a visit that inspired a song in Til Death Do Us Hearts, which is part of the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.  The newlyweds honeymooned in Disneyland.  The pair first performed as a duo, but just as friends, back in 2017, with the final song in their act being about how they would never end up together. Now they're performing in Aotearoa for the first time as husband and wife, although they insist not much has changed. ""We're still renting with a flatmate and our lives are still very much the same, but it's nice to call him my husband now and to celebrate the milestones,"" says Laura. Joseph agrees, explaining that the main reason for them getting married was to create ""memories of such a special day with family and friends"". ""The lead-up to the wedding was so stressful,"" adds Laura. ""We thought, 'What are we doing?!' But then we had the wedding and were like, 'Hell, yeah, that was absolutely worth it!'"" Clearly still besotted with each other, Laura and Joseph pause when asked what's coming up for them. Laura is pensive. ""I guess we're in a phase of deciding what to do next with our lives,"" she reflects, adding that sell-out Aussie shows and one of their videos going viral in Europe have made moving overseas a temptation. International audiences are very vocal, tells Laura.  You can see their love for real in Til Death Do Us Hearts."

Of course, that required a little trickery.  Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in January 2021. In an April 2021 social media post announcing their union, the couple said they felt “chuffed about it.” (Chuffed is British slang for “very pleased.”)  “For the record: this is me gushing,” Gadsby wrote in the caption. “I am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  In their new special, which Gadsby describes as “a feel-good show,” the comedian shares more details about their wedding, including the story behind their hilariously non-traditional novelty wedding cake.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake,” Gadsby explains in Something Special, “and it worked.”  Gadsby recently shared a photo of the cake in question on their Instagram. It features a massive shark about to devour two adorable otters swimming serenely side-by-side.  “I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10,’” Gadsby recalls in their special. “Easy. So gullible. Will believe anything, Christians.”  Cakes have, of course, become one of the most unexpected battlegrounds in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. (Just imagine what Harvey Milk or veterans of the Stonewall uprising would’ve said if you told them that, in 2023, we would be suing bakers over cakes.)  In probably the most famous instance of cake discrimination, Jack Phillips, the anti-gay owner of Colorado’s Masterpiece Cakeshop, sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) in 2015 after it told him that his refusal to provide an LGBTQ+ couple’s wedding cake violated the state’s law prohibiting businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Phillips, but did not rule on the question of whether he had a First Amendment right to refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  Phillips was sued again in 2018, this time by a trans customer for whom he refused to make a cake celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary of coming out as trans. In 2021, a Denver judge ruled that Phillips illegally discriminated against Autumn Scardina when he refused to make the cake. Earlier this year, the Colorado Court of Appeals again ruled against Phillips in the case.  More recently, in Florida, a Publix grocery store refused to write “Trans People Deserve Joy” on a cake for a trans nonprofit organization. The company later apologized, claiming that employees at the Orland-area store were mistaken in believing that writing a trans-affirming message on a cake was against corporate policy."

This category includes everything from appetizers that circulate during the cocktail hour to late-night snacks — and, of course, the wedding cake.  Given the tradition of the bride and groom cutting the cake together, many couples are very particular about their wedding cake. That means they're often willing to pay a bit extra for a truly show-stopping creation. However, the most expensive slice of wedding cake ever sold probably isn't something you'd want to consider eating — given that it was over 80 years old at the time of sale.  Back in 1998, two individuals in San Francisco made Guinness World Records history. Their feat? Shelling out a staggering $29,900 U.S. dollars in order to purchase a single piece of wedding cake, packaged in a box and sold at auction. Though the crew at Sotheby's figured the sweet treat from decades past would fetch somewhere between $500 and $1,000, Benjamin and Amanda Yin were willing to pay a whole lot more for the item.  In truth, they were buying a slice of history. The piece of the cake in question was served at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937. The couple relished the romance that the purchase represented. They were willing to pay top dollar for a slice of cake that they would never even get to taste because of its connection to the historic event."

Although they’re an open-back style, the double straps offer more stability by holding the foot in place as opposed to the looser feeling that can occur with a single strap shoe.  The Basil Heeled Sandals received more than 690 five-star reviews, with many commenting on how comfy they are. Shoppers are highlighting that they’re wearable beyond just one event and are “perfect for anything casual or formal,” according to one person.“The height is perfect for capris, skirts, dresses, and jeans,” another reviewer mentioned, so you can wear them with low-lift outfits without feeling too over-the-top.  Numerous shoppers noted that they wore the heels to great lengths, leading them to purchase even more pairs.

Many brides fantasize about walking down the aisle in a gown that looks like it belongs on the set of “Bridgerton” or “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.” This fantasy can now become a reality thanks to Allure Bridals’ new line of dresses. The premier wedding designer is collaborating with Shondaland to create gowns that are fit for a Queen herself … Queen Charlotte, that is.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Inspired by the sumptuous gowns in the Bridgerverse, these gowns will be a modern and wearable take on the dresses we drool over on “Bridgerton” and “Queen Charlotte.”  The Queen Charlotte gowns from Allure Bridals will be designed by none other than Shondaland’s Lyn Paolo. Paola has worked on many Shonda Rhimes’ projects, including “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal,” and most recently served as Costume Designer for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.”  “I love the worlds that [Shonda] creates and it is an absolute delight to fill those worlds with beautiful costumes,” Lyn Paolo, Shondaland’s creative director and designer, said in a press release. “Now I am excited to help design beautiful gowns inspired by the world she has created for today’s beautiful brides.”  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Though the collaboration shared Paolo’s sketches of the gowns ahead of their release, the Allure Bridals x Shondaland wedding gowns won’t be available until December 2023. The dresses are moderately priced, starting at around $1,600. (According to The Knot, the average wedding dress was $1,900 in 2022.) There are more luxe options in the Shondaland line that can range up to $3,000, so brides can find the dress that best suits their budget.  As you can see from the sketches of the gowns, these dresses bring the drama. Forget minimalism and austere design: These wedding dresses are designed with romance and royalty in mind.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  “The intricate details, lavish fabrics, and timeless elegance of Queen Charlotte and the ton’s fashion are a perfect fit for our bridal gowns, and we can’t wait to unveil this special collection to brides around the world,” says Kelly Crum, CEO of Allure Bridals.

This could be as simple as including herbs like mint, rosemary, or lavender in a bouquet, or something more captivating like a Hellebore, anthurium, or garden roses.""  Meet the Expert Shean Matthew Strong is a wedding and event floral designer. He is the owner and founder of Shean Strong Design.  Want to learn what are the most popular florals found in the wedding bouquet? Read ahead to learn about standout blooms and filler flowers often used in this iconic arrangement.  Photo by Amy and Stuart Photography  Popular Bouquet Flowers  Larger flowers with structure and plenty of petals are often the primary florals you will find in a wedding bouquet. One of the most popular types of flowers used in all kinds of weddings arrangements are roses. Found in hues ranging from bright whites to light pinks to deep reds, a rose is a timeless wedding bloom that can help your bouquet tie into your palette. A commonly used alternative to this bloom is ranunculus. These florals can add texture and movement to a bouquet thanks to their ruffly petals.  Show-stopping peonies are just as popular as roses, thanks to their distinct colorful petals. However, this temperamental flower only really blooms from April to June, so just springtime couples can utilize them in their bouquet designs. Large dahlias are a popular alternative for couples who want this face flower from mid-summer through the fall. For a hardy bloom that can ground an arrangement, floral designers also like to turn to hydrangea.  Looking for a lighter floral with movement? ""When aiming for a bouquet with a delicate fragrance and captivating beauty, Japanese Sweet Pea is a perfect choice,"" notes Strong. ""Its gentle scent and flouncy petals form a soft and feminine shape that is both timeless and romantic."" Long-stemmed anemone are fun to incorporate for a modern bouquet, while orchids are popular if a bride wants to create a cascading bouquet.  Certain flowers are more common in bouquets of a single variety. Calla lilies are an elegant, trumpet-shaped bloom often found solo and tied with a beautiful ribbon for a bridal accessory. Lily of the valley is also popular for this style of arrangement.  Photo by Lucy Cuneo  Popular Filler Flowers  While certain blooms stand out as the face flowers of a bouquet, other florals and greenery are incorporated to add dimension to these arrangements. In fact, some of these blooms can be the star of the show. ""A flower that is often underrated but can add depth and movement to arrangements is the lisianthus,"" says Strong. ""When used skillfully, the color variations in its petals allow this once-considered 'filler flower' to take on the role of a 'dancing flower,' bringing the much desired sense of movement to bouquets.""  Another popular wedding filler flower of the moment is baby's breath. With light white blooms and plenty of volume, baby's breath is commonly used throughout wedding arrangements. While normally a filler, you can find modern brides and bridesmaids carrying bouquets of this flower on its own.  For smaller blooms, carnations are commonly used as accents to a bouquet. Since they are available year-round and are quite durable, they are a safe bet to include in your arrangement. Spray roses are also a nice addition when looking for a petite floral.  ""Don't hesitate to experiment with unique textures,"" advises Strong. ""Eucalyptus can provide interesting colors and shapes, clematis adds a touch of garden charm, dates create a cascading effect, and hyacinths offer a cluster of texture and color. Embracing a variety of flowers can elevate the overall appeal of your floral designs."""

Grande, who has a dedicated skin on Fortnite, shared the beautiful moment with fans via her Instagram story on May 15. Gomez and the beautiful Grande tied the knot in an exclusive ceremony in their Montecito home on May 15, 2021. On the wedding day, the couple stuck with a minimalist ceremony with just over ten people. Due to the private ceremony and the singer’s reticence to share personal moments, the snap is receiving a heartwarming response from fans.  Ariana Grande Celebrates 2nd Wedding Anniversary  In honor of Ariana Grande’s 2nd wedding anniversary, the Dangerous Woman singer shared a photo of herself and her husband. The adorable photo taken on their wedding day showed the lovebirds smiling as they embraced and shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Grande made a few alterations to the wedding photo. The Bang Bang singer wrote “2” on the black and white photo to signify how long they were married. In addition, she put a love symbol under the number. Grande also wrote “(3.5 together)” to signify how long she and Dalton Gomez have been together. According to Capital FM, Ariana Grande’s husband proposed to her about a year after they started dating in January 2020. The lovestruck media personality also wrote “I love him so” above the picture to celebrate her love for the realtor.  Dalton Gomez Is a Real Estate Agent  According to E! News, Dalton Gomez is a Californian native who grew up in San Bernardino. What’s more, Gomez is a real estate agent who sells houses around California. Gomez works for the Aaron Kirman Group and has sold houses for prominent figures, including actor Kunal Nayyar. Incidentally, the 7 Rings singer met her husband while house hunting. Based on insider information, the 29-year-old wanted to buy a house away from Los Angeles, and her team recruited Gomez. Grande was instantly smitten and asked for a private meeting.  The real estate agent is also musically inclined and used to dance until he moved to selling homes in California. In addition, before meeting her, Ariana Grande’s husband shared several mutual friends with her. The dog lover is friends with Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun. An insider revealed that they run in the same circle. Ariana Grande’s 2nd wedding anniversary tribute to her husband is cute and reflects what their relationship looks like.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.  “Ask Anna” is a sex column. Because of the nature of the topic, some columns contain language some readers may find graphic.  Dear Anna,  Advertisement  I’m currently planning my wedding to the wonderful man of my dreams. The process itself is less than thrilling but we’re working together as a team to tackle all the little logistical things and hurdles. A problem that I didn’t anticipate, however, is the feelings I’m having when people RSVP no — in particular, only one person from my family is coming, my sister. I love that I’ll be surrounded by friends on my big day, but I can’t help but feel hurt that my family, who I thought would show up for me, isn’t coming. I’ve certainly been invited to weddings that I wasn’t able to attend for financial or scheduling or COVID reasons, so I know it’s likely not personal, but it feels personal. How can I deal with this and focus on what truly matters — that I’m going to celebrate the love of my life? — Being Rigid In Demanding Expectations  Dear BRIDE,  Advertisement  First off, congrats on snagging the man of your dreams! It’s not everyday that you find someone worth spending your life with, so big ups to you two — I wish you every happiness.  It’s totally valid to feel hurt that people you care about can’t make it to your big day. Weddings are, in many ways, extremely loaded events and we attach way more meaning, disappointment and weight than they deserve. That’s not your fault — society tells us that this one day is THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIVES. How can we not fall short of such a ridiculous ideal? (We can’t.)  And, really, it’s just a party. A very expensive party.  Remember also that weddings are a giant, love-fueled jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes the pieces just don’t fit perfectly for everyone. (Sometimes not even for you.)  So, how do you deal with the hurt feelings without letting it hinder the love fest that awaits you and your future spouse? Here are a few tips:  Allow yourself to grieve: Let yourself feel all the things you’re feeling. Whether you’re hurt, pissed off, depressed or perhaps all of those things at once, the fastest way to deal with feelings is to simply feel them. Don’t push them away or shove them down. Open yourself to the pain, let it core and dismantle you. Then, once the storm has finished raging inside of you, dust yourself off and keep going. Feelings are always temporary. They pass. Remembering that will help you when you’re feeling the lowest lows.  Something that helped me when I was grieving the death of my father (admittedly somewhat different than your conundrum but not entirely) was to set aside five minutes a day, in the morning usually, to just think about him. Sometimes I would journal but usually I would just ugly-cry. When I allowed myself the space to feel the full weight and depth of my agony, I was surprised at how quickly the feelings moved on. Eventually, I only had to do the ritual every other day, then once a week, and now I do it only very occasionally, on his birthday and death day. You might try a similar ritual to feel the pain and disappointment you’re experiencing around your family.  Embrace the sisterly love: Then, practice a little gratitude for the family that is coming. Your sister’s got your back and will be there to celebrate with you. That’s not nothing. Plus, you two can bond even more during this special time, which will make your relationship closer.  Advertisement  Remember other ways your fam has shown up for you: When I’m feeling especially disappointed by someone who’s important to me — and literally everyone is disappointed by their families at some point! — I try to remember all the other ways they’ve shown up for me in the past, whether it was offering encouragement, sharing time or space with me, buying a book, being there for me during a hard time or even giving me cash when I desperately needed it.  People show their love in vastly different ways at vastly different times — love isn’t a one-and-done thing. It moves. So, while it stings that this particular time certain people can’t show up for you, it doesn’t mean they never have or never will again.  It’s not you, it’s them: As you said yourself, people have their reasons for not attending, and most of the time, it has nothing to do with you. Life gets in the way, and that’s OK. Just remember that their absence doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. Tell yourself a better story.  Quality over quantity: Spend a little time fixating on the amazing friends and loved ones who are coming to your wedding. They’re the ones who’ll be dancing the night away with you, toasting with you and sharing in all your wedded bliss. That’s worth celebrating.  In queer parlance, we call them chosen family — they’re our ride-or-dies, they show up for us in the middle of the night, they bring us food when we’re sick, they read and edit our sexts, they love us unequivocally when our family or society has rejected us because of who we love or who we are. It’s a bond more powerful than blood because it’s a choice. A daily, intentional f— yes! Honor those people in your life. Let them be your family.  Virtual love: If some family members can’t physically be there, you could also consider setting up a livestream or video chat to include them in the festivities. That way, they can still share in the joy of your big day.  Advertisement  Keep perspective: At the end of the day, your wedding is a celebration of the love between you and your soon-to-be spouse. As long as you two are there, that’s what truly counts. The greatest gift of all is that you’re marrying the love of your life! And nobody can take that joy from you.  Happy planning, BRIDE!

Luckily, she later reconnected with Sam Joel at a co-worker’s going away party. Or, maybe it wasn’t luck. “A psychic had predicted this meeting, in detail, to me,” Matty shares. The psychic also told her that Matty and her soulmate had been split from the same atom and met countless times before in previous lifetimes. This lifetime was to become the one they'd got married in.  Even though she certainly knew Sam was the one, Matty didn't know the proposal was coming. “Sam is a master of surprise,” she says. “We got engaged on the rooftop garden of Sam’s cherished grandmother’s Midtown apartment in October 2018. Sam’s dad, a professional photographer, was waiting in the wings to capture the moment. When we walked back into the apartment, Sam had invited an intimate circle of family and friends to surprise me.” They celebrated with a custom menu at one of Matty’s favorite restaurants.  When it came to wedding planning, they started with what they didn’t want. “In our first meeting, I told planner Allison Jackson how important it was for our guests to feel comfortable,” Matty recalls. “I wrote out a list of everything I ever hated about going to weddings, and asked her if we could eliminate or improve on as many of those things as possible. I wanted the vibe to be Friday night at your favorite bar in New Orleans—but in the mountains. I love the aesthetic of Jack Rose, a restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans, so that’s where we had our meeting.”  The venue, at least, was a no-brainer. “The Matalin-Carville family farm—built in 1753, and bought by Matty’s parents six months before Matty was born—is where Matty and her sister spent their early years,” the couple shares. “It’s where they always gathered for the most important and special events in their lives.” The bride's wedding would be no different. From there, the couple pegged vendors who matched their creativity and enthusiasm for doing something unexpected. “We wanted to think really out-of-the-box and have a lot of fun,” they say. Of course, nods to their psychic-predicted meeting and soulmate status were woven into the celebration.  Read on to see all the playfully unique details of Matty and Sam’s November 6, 2021, wedding day, planned by Allison Jackson of Pineapple Productions and photographed by Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The palette was pulled from “colors of nature, autumnal jewel tones, and a variety of textures,” Matty says. “We love bird watching together in Audubon Park in New Orleans, so we incorporated a bird motif throughout.”  While this lead to a beautiful invitation design, getting them to guests was a challenge. They changed their date due to the pandemic, then the new invites were shipped during hurricane season in Louisiana, where many of their 250 guests reside. “Our invitation send-out unfortunately coincided with Hurricane Ida, so everyone’s mail was disrupted and many were evacuated for long periods of time. Some folks’ hard copy of the invitation arrived a month after our wedding,” Matty says. “To all future brides, I would recommend the practice of perspective and laughing at the things you just can’t control.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much, and that their presence at our wedding means so much.  Photo by Kate Headley  The personalized touches was endless, and the couple took on quite a few DIYs. “The best example would be our guest goody bags,” they say. ""We had fun cups made with our name and date; gave out copies of Matty’s grandmother’s cookbook; and even had T-shirts made that said, ‘Someone in the Shenandoah Valley Loves Me.’ Was it cheesy? Sure. Did we care? Hell no! We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much. We know things have been difficult for everyone and their presence at our wedding means that much more because of it.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  For her bridal attire, Matty paired a crepe Sarah Seven gown with an overskirt by Alexandra Grecco. “I had long been a fan of Sarah Seven; all her gowns are so chic,” the bride says. ""It was the first one I tried on, and my heart knew immediately. I paired it with the overskirt at the suggestion of my sister—the most stylish person I know—and I fell in love with the combo. The other key was trying it on with the cathedral-length veil. I also wore a bow from my mother’s wedding gown, which she hand-sewed onto the back of my skirt.”  Matty's makeup look was effortlessly beautiful, with hair was inspired by her mother. “My mom wore a Vera Wang headband on her wedding day, and I wanted to mirror that with a white headband that I had [our florist] decorate with fresh flowers,” Matty says. “It felt really glam and fun, and my hair was out of my face so I could dance all night.”  Photo by Kate Headley  “The best, best accessory was the homemade flower crowns my cousin made for all the kids,” Matty shares. “Her daughter was one of our flower girls, and she was sure to model it like a pro and show the other kids how to wear it with enthusiasm. We also had cute little signs for our kiddos to wear down the aisle—things like, ‘I’m just here for the cake!’ and ‘Has anyone seen the rings?’ It added levity and humor in a serious moment.”  Photo by Kate Headley  As guests entered the ceremony space, they were greeted with warm spiked local apple cider and savory parmesan rosemary shortbread. “The focal point of our ceremony decor was the floating chuppah, which was designed by Amaryllis Floral & Event Design. The die-cut wood chuppah frame was suspended from the poles of our sailcloth tent,” Matty describes. ""The corners of the chuppah were adorned with silk ribbons. During our ceremony, special friends and family members pinned photos of lost loved ones to the ribbons.” To make the event more intimate and inclusive, they set their ceremony in the round.  Photo by Kate Headley  Matty’s dad, James Carville—a well-known political strategist, commentator, and author—walked her down the aisle to the sounds of “Stand by Me” strummed by a string quartet. Her mother, meanwhile, looked very chic in pink. “She wore a Carolina Herrera dress and accessorized it with an Oscar de la Renta boa and vintage Givenchy opera coat,” Matty says. “She also carried a small posy of roses and dahlias, accented with peacock feathers, a symbol of good luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  There was no first look, as the bride and groom wanted to see each ofter for the first time at the ends of the aisle. “It was amazing,” Matty shares. “I got the teary-eyed photo of Sam under the chuppah that I always wanted!” During the ceremony, “I loved sharing our Jewish faith traditions with Matty’s Catholic family, and I loved that they loved it,” Sam says. “I’m also so glad we wrote our own vows. We really said everything we needed to say [and] made promises we’re excited to keep. To me, that’s the best way to start life together.”  Guests tossed birdseed and confetti at the newlyweds as they retreated down the aisle. “Our recessional was a traditional hymn, but it morphed into ‘Jambalaya (On the Bayou)’ by Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles, which my dad arranged as a surprise on our wedding day,” Matty says. “Guests were dancing down the aisle as they made their way out of the tent to the cocktail hour.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  The newlyweds traversed the property to enjoy the first few moments as husband and wife, and took portraits with their photographer Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “An oversized wooden wagon held candles and soaps my mother made in the months leading up to our wedding day for each guest,” Matty says. Guests filled swag bags and snapped photos in a vintage trailer during cocktail hour, while a Cajun zydeco band created a festive atmosphere. “We had a variety of signature cocktails inspired by our family and friends,” Matty says. “We clipped fortunes to cocktails and served them with tarot card coasters as a fun nod to our psychic-predicted meeting.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We melded NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of the Shenandoah Valley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The reception tent decor was inspired by Jack Rose, the New Orleans restaurant where they’d had that first meeting with their planner. “Allison suggested we approach the design by melding NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” Matty says. “Our tent was draped in rich textured peacock-blue fabric and finished at the top with a patterned valance. Wrought-iron and gold-leaf lanterns with pillar candles, Southern smilax, and dripping jewel-toned flowers filled the ceiling of the tent for a whimsical and lush look.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “A large oval mahogany bar featured decorative panels with a bold coordinating print,” Matty continues. “The center of the bar housed a large shelving unit filled with botanicals and curiosities—even a peacock, which is a known omen foretelling success and luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  The bandstand was created from a wooden wall painted brick red and decorated with disco balls and a neon sign reading “You Belong Here.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Their semi-naked cake was adorned with sugar flowers, fresh figs, and Seckel pears—and there were more treats, as well. “Our groom’s cake was a delicious loaf of challah surrounded by honeycomb and fresh figs. Southern sweets like Mississippi mud bars and lemon squares rounded out the dessert menu.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Dinner was an homage to New Orleans. “Roasted outside our tent in an antique trailer, traditional cajun-style whole suckling pig was served at a butcher-block table with local apple chutney,” Matty says. There was also jambalaya, New Orleans roast beef debris, and blackened redfish. The couple even served a famous salad recipe pulled from the Carville family cookbook.  Photo by Kate Headley  The duo had their first dance to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” then the party got going. “Reaching out for Sam’s hand and looking over the crowd together when we were lifted up for the hora, I thanked my lucky stars for the health and presence of everyone there,” Matty shares of her most cherished moment from the day. “I tried to just melt into the blessings around me.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Fireworks erupted as a surprise grand finale to the evening, while chicken sliders and paper cones of tater tots were passed around. Looking back on the day, Matty has some advice for other to-be-weds. “Be bold, lead with kindness, politely ask for what you want, and cultivate your own style and infuse that into your wedding in a way that genuinely celebrates the love you have for your partner, your family, and your guests,” she says. “Also, trust the professionals—you’ll be blown away by their creativity.”"

The episode then flashes back to the night of Dolores Catania's Irish-themed, 1920s ""prohibition"" party, where everything came to a head.  Danielle Cabral breaks the news to Melissa that Margaret Josephs' former friend, Laura Jensen, told Jennifer Aydin and Teresa that Margaret has dirt on Melissa, claiming she was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband. It's then that Melissa stops Danielle and tells her she's already heard this story... from her own husband.  ""You wanna know how I heard it through my husband? 'Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back. Pretty f**ked up sister-in-law I have, isn't it?"" Melissa fires back.  The longtime RHONJ star proceeded to break things down in a confessional, calling the rumor ""baseless.""  ""Six months ago, Teresa called Joe over with Louie, because she heard a rumor about me, and she believes it so much, that she had to call her brother over. How dare you tell my husband that I would cheat on him?"" Melissa asks. ""You're saying this off a baseless rumor, from some woman who wants to hurt Margaret with no facts. No anything. Did she think he was just going to pack his bags and leave? Like, what the f**k are you doing?""  Fired up and frustrated at this point, Melissa tells Danielle that she should've called both Melissa and Teresa over to have this conversation. Danielle is confused by Melissa's claim that Teresa would want the cheating rumor to be true -- it becomes clear then that maybe Danielle isn't too well-versed in the years-long back-and-forth between Melissa and her sister-in-law.  ""Are you kidding me? Doll face, look at me. I have been accused of being a stripper. I have been accused of doing stuff in parking lots before,"" Melissa says. ""She's said multiple times, 'Your wife will leave you for a richer man.' She's said multiple things that we have let go in our life.""  Melissa shares that she had no intention of confronting Teresa about the meeting or the rumor because Joe himself doesn't believe it.  ""It's bulls**t and because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding,"" Melissa says in a confessional. ""And look what ends up happening: she has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone, so everyone can hear the words 'Melissa's a cheater,' and I am done.""  Demanding to know why Teresa called Joe to the house to tell him about the alleged cheating, Melissa asks her sister-in-law for an explanation.  ""First of all, it wasn't his sister. It was Louie. He was like, 'I wanna tell your brother that all this is coming from Margaret, so your brother can get in front of it,'"" Teresa claims in a confessional. ""So, he was looking out for my brother. And I never repeated it to anymore.""  At this point, the entire party is heated, with fights breaking out amongst nearly everyone on the cast. The group begins to separate into their couples as they unpack what just happened. After getting the play-by-play from Melissa, Joe sets things straight in a confessional.  ""I get a call from Louie, 'What are ya doin'? I need to see you right away. It's very important.' So, I go to her house and Louie says, 'We heard that Melissa cheated on you.' I go, 'Guys, you got the wrong girl,'"" Joe tells the cameras.  Melissa starts to believe the altercation was all a set-up and tells the cameras that she thinks Teresa knew Danielle was going to tell her at the party.  After more back-and-forth and a heated argument between Joe and Louie, the group disbands, with everyone starting to make their way home for the night.  It's now the morning after the party and Melissa calls Dolores to go over the night's events, it's then she shares that she and Joe won't be going to Teresa and Louie's wedding.  ""Dolores, how can I go and celebrate someone else's marriage when they are the people that are constantly trying to destroy mine?"" Melissa says. ""I'm not doing it.""  Dolores tells Melissa if they don't go to the wedding, then she and Joe's relationship with Teresa is ""over-over,"" to which Melissa replies, ""It's been over.""  Already on the way to Teresa's house, Dolores tells Melissa that she plans to tell Teresa about her decision to skip the wedding. And she does just that, breaking the news to the couple, who are just days away from getting married.  ""They hate us,"" Teresa says after finding out about Melissa's decision. ""Obviously, they're not happy for us... This has been going on over 10 years. I dealt with it with my ex, I'm not going to deal with it in my new chapter of my life. I'm so done.""  Later in a confessional, Teresa says that she doesn't want a family ""like that,"" if this is the way things are going to be.  ""I know she's been wanting to get my brother away from me all this time,"" Teresa says of Melissa. ""She got her wish. She got her wish.""  The season ends with Melissa and Teresa in a worse place than viewers have seen them to date, signaling that things between this family may really be ""over-over.""

That is to say: It is not the story of the real Queen Charlotte. “It is not a history lesson,” the statement continues. “It is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.” And while that is certainly the case—no one can truly know what went on in Charlotte and King George III’s relationship—some parts of the show actually are true to life. This is particularly the case when it comes to Queen Charlotte’s wedding.  Queen Charlotte shows a 17-year-old Princess Charlotte being quickly married off to a 22-year-old King George, leaving her home in Germany and getting married the same day she arrived. That all actually happened. Here are some more details about the real royal wedding as they compare to the hit Netflix show.  Charlotte’s journey to England was pretty accurately depicted.  On the show, British royal representatives arrive in Mirow, the dukedom in northern Germany where Charlotte lived as Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her brother, Adolphus, signs the contract for Charlotte to marry King George III. Adolphus then makes the journey to England with Charlotte.  This is all true to life, but some details were missing. The official British royal family website explains that the escorts who arrived in Germany to collect Charlotte were led by the Earl of Harcourt. According to the site, the group didn’t leave right away. Instead, they were three days of celebrations, and then they returned to England with Charlotte where she would begin her new life.    While Queen Charlotte shows the future queen complaining of her uncomfortable outfit and whale bone corset, the journey was actually hard for a different reason. The royal family site notes that the voyage was difficult and the group faced three storms while crossing the North Sea. It also was a very long trip: They left Germany on August 17 and didn’t get to London until September 8.  While Charlotte and Adolphus are traveling, he mentions that their parents have died. This was also true, and the death of their mother was very recent—she had died only three months earlier.  Charlotte got married the same day she arrived.  Queen Charlotte shows Charlotte and George getting married the same day that she arrives in England. And as surprising as it may seem, this is what actually happened.  “At 9:00 p.m. the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace,” the royal family site reads.  The show features a confrontation on the wedding day between Charlotte and George’s mother, Princess Augusta, in which they argue about Charlotte’s wedding dress—she wants to wear the one she had made in Paris; Augusta wants her to wear an English-style dress. According to the Washington Post, the real George had requested that gowns be made for Charlotte and be ready when she arrived.  According to Percy Fitzgerald’s book, The Good Queen Charlotte (per Town & Country), for her wedding Charlotte “wore ‘an endless mantle’ of rich violet and purple velvet, lined with ermine, over a white satin and silver dress.” In the show, she does wear a silver and white gown—just without the purple velvet addition.  As for what wasn’t based on history...  A key part of the show is the fact that Charlotte is Black and the royal court becomes integrated thanks to her becoming queen. In reality, while there has been speculation that Charlotte had African ancestry, most historians agree that this idea lacks evidence and isn’t accurate. Instead, the show takes this idea and runs with it, which makes for an interesting story, but it means that the real wedding didn’t actually feature all the non-white members of the ton being invited to the royal wedding at the last minute.  As for other exaggerated or made-up moments, those are probably pretty obvious. Did Charlotte actually try to escape her fate as the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by climbing over a fence? Probably not, but it did make for a charming royal meet-cute with Farmer George."

The 28-year-old heir to the throne is set to wed fiancée Rajwa Al-Saif on June 1, and one guest has already given a hint about the dress code. According to Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman, Queen Azizah of Malaysia confirmed that she and her husband, King Abdullah, are attending the wedding, where the attire will be ""more like black tie, long dress but no tiaras..."" Salman tweeted on Monday.  It remains to be seen if the bride will sport a tiara on her big day.  Hello! magazine reports that other royal guests in attendance will include Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, Princess Hisakoa of Japan and her daughter Princess Tsuguko and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  The excitement continues to build before the big day, and the Royal Hashemite Court even released an official logo for the next Jordanian royal wedding.  ""As the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for 'we rejoice,' "" courtiers tweeted Sunday, sharing a quick clip of the crown-topped graphic on a burgundy background. Like many modern nuptials, there's even a hashtag — #CelebratingAlHussein.  Prince Hussein and Rajwa, 29, announced their engagement in August 2022 by sharing a formal portrait on Instagram.  ""We pray that God grants us His blessings. Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes,"" Hussein wrote of the photo where he and Rajwa posed close, her diamond ring on display.

The news captioned a previously released portrait of the couple, where Rajwa channeled bridal vibes in a chic white outfit.  This year is especially celebratory for the royal family of Jordan, with not one, but two royal weddings! On March 12, Prince Hussein's younger sister Princess Iman married Jameel Alexander Thermiotis in an epic royal wedding.  Princess Iman and Crown Prince Hussein.

Doctor and TikToker Justin Tyler Fox gained over 9.1 million views, 2.3 million likes and 20,000 comments when he uploaded the wedding day confession to his account.  However, while many wedding day videos go viral for rather upsetting reasons — like the bride who served her guests $48 bottles of antibloat pills at the reception, or the groom whose “disgusting” wedding vows set off red flags all across TikTok — Justin’s wedding day footage is making a positive impact on TikTok by touching people’s hearts (and raising the bar for vows from here on out).  Fox begins his viral vows by asking his bride, Raven, “Do you remember the day I knew for a fact I was going to marry you?” He then recalls the story for all their family and friends — and now, for all the TikTok viewers at home.  According to Justin, he decided to marry Raven after a very special hiking trip — and after her fateful fall attempting to follow him across a river.  When she took the nasty fall, he knew this was someone who would follow him to any place on earth, someone who would be by his side on every adventure and challenge.  Thus, to capture this very special moment, Justin secretly took a part of that day — and a part of Raven — and had it tucked away inside her ring.  Later, after proposing to Raven and putting the ring on her finger, she asked him, “What is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?”  Justin recalled explaining to her, “I told you, ‘No, that’s the way it’s supposed to be,’ and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day. Here’s my confession. That little stone in your ring is made out of dentine and enamel. When I picked it up that day, I went straight to the jeweler and I said, ‘Can you put this in my engagement ring?’”  Justin and Raven’s wedding guests were immediately moved by the story — as were millions of TikTokers, who begged for a video of his full wedding vows (a wish Justin later granted).  Over 20,000 TikTokers were deeply moved by Justin and Raven’s story, and their love.  “If his vows ain’t like this I don’t want him 🥹🤣,” laughed @ncsquared.  “This ladies and gentleman are wedding vows! This is love, a true testament of love, faith, God and laughter.♥️i wish y’all an eternity!” commented @ingridsshenanigans.  “these are the things that should be viral. pure genuine sentimental love. this is beautiful 💕,” wrote @lissmorales__.  While not every bride might appreciate having a tooth hidden inside their engagement ring, Justin’s unique custom ring captures their special love story — and will, hopefully, inspire partners everywhere to step up their vow and proposal game!

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.  It’s wedding season, y’all. That means you’re going to have to pony up and buy that flight to that oddly remote destination your friend picked for their wedding two and a half hours from the nearest airport. Great venue choice, Bud!  For many people, wedding season can come as an embarrassing experience of wearing the same navy suit and tie you’ve had since high school graduation. Well, let me tell you, bro: It’s time to step up your game. Whether you’re going solo in hopes of meeting a bridesmaid or attending as a plus one to the event, you need to look your best. Fortunately, we’ve done the research to help you figure out what to wear as a plus-one to a wedding if you don’t want to look like every other person there.  Advice on Matching Your Date: If you’re going with a date, you should complement them, but avoid matching their look exactly—this isn’t your high school prom. If your date is wearing a certain color, choose accessories in similar or complementary shades or tones. For example, if your date is wearing a navy blue dress, opt for a different shade of blue, like sky or teal. If they are wearing pink or red, wear blue or green so that you complement each other but still look great when separated. And if they are wearing white, well then you wear whatever they told you to wear.  Try using a color wheel to match clothes and follow these few steps:  Choose one dominant color for your event outfit. Now, this could be a color that compliments your skin tone or just a color that you like to wear. Find the complementary color on a color wheel. This is the color opposite your dominant color on the wheel. Look for comparable colors on the color wheel. These could be the colors next to your dominant color or down the line in terms of shade. These analogous colors will help create a cohesive and harmonious look for your getup. Lastly, consider using neutral colors such as black, white, gray, or beige to balance out your outfit and leave room for small bits of flare.

The development speaks to an 872% increase in searches for handmade gifts on Etsy, indicative of a significant shift away from mass-produced items. The new platform, a game-changer for small businesses, is now live and accessible at Etsy.com/Registry.  What sets Etsy Registry apart is its support for independent creators and small businesses.

Alongside the launch of Etsy Registry, Etsy has also released its annual 2023 wedding trend guide. This year, couples are placing importance on fun and creativity, with unique twists on tradition taking center stage. Themes, elaborate programs, and unconventional bridal looks and rings are all part of the mix, adding to the excitement of saying “I do”.  Among the 2023 wedding trends identified by Etsy are Lovecore, Oversized florals, Western weddings, Love story gifts, and Rings with character. Lovecore sees an influx of heart patterns, roses, and red and pink hues, while Oversized florals incorporate rosettes and floral appliqués to add texture and romance. Western weddings bring a laid-back, unconventional style, and Love story gifts promote personalized mementos that celebrate each couple’s unique journey. Rings with character is a trend that showcases individuality, with handmade, unique rings gaining popularity over traditional designs.  For small businesses in the wedding industry, these trends provide a roadmap for product development and marketing. It opens avenues for those skilled in crafting handmade and personalized items, floral designs, or western-themed goods to tap into a growing market. Similarly, businesses specializing in love story gifts can hone their product range and marketing strategies based on the current trends, attracting more customers seeking unique, meaningful presents.  It’s important to note that this shift toward personalized and meaningful wedding items isn’t just a trend, but a sign of a larger movement towards conscious consumption. As consumers become more aware of their purchases’ impacts, they’re turning towards small businesses and independent creators who offer unique, handmade, and personalized items. The success of Etsy Registry could pave the way for a more diverse, personalized, and meaningful wedding gift industry, providing a significant boost to small businesses worldwide.

(Valley News Live) - Casey Ford and his fiance Allison Torkelson are set to get married in September, but never could they imagine they would be forced to find a new venue and caterer, just months before the wedding.  Ford says, last February, he and his soon-to-be wife coordinated with Bigfoot Bar and Grill, which was operated out of the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, to plan their wedding. He says they wrote out a $1,400 deposit check to Bigfoot to secure catering and the use of the Ramada Inn banquet hall.  “They cashed it two to three weeks after that. Everything was fine. The communication was fine,” said Ford.  Although, everything did not turn out fine. Ford says he learned from social media that the business had closed.  “I found out on Facebook that they are splitting ways with Ramada. There was no communication there. I emailed them again saying, I found out through Facebook that you are splitting up. What’s the deal,” he said.  Ford says he learned of the closing through a posting on a Facebook group. The posting was from another soon-to-bride, who was having the same issue. Several screenshots were attached showing the woman’s many attempts to also contact Bigfoot to determine the fate of her wedding. The post accumulated more than 60 comments from others going through the same problem or those who have had less-than-desirable interactions with the business.  He also says there have been several attempts to contact Bigfoot’s owner since learning of the closure, but there has been little to no response.  “I’ve tried calling. I’ve tried emailing. My dad has been doing things on his end in Grand Forks to try and get in contact and we’ve just heard nothing.”  Not only was the couple out $1,400, they also had to find a new venue. All he wants now is to have the money refunded.  “It doesn’t feel good. $1,400 is a lot of money. That could go towards our wedding at the new place,” Ford said. “Having to find out through a third-party source that they are splitting and we don’t have a wedding. Don’t have a location and we had to go to other venues. That 1,400 would mean a lot.”  Google listed Bigfoot as permanently closed. Also, when visiting the business website, the word “closed” is plastered across the homepage.  According to an article from the Winnipeg Free Press, Bigfoot’s owner Ty Cox was facing deportation from Canada in 2014 after he allegedly scammed a charity for kids out of $7,200. It’s unclear if he was ever actually deported.  A representative from Ramada Inn confirmed Bigfoot was no longer operating in their hotel. The representative says they were not made aware of the full list of weddings scheduled. Although, they state the hotel will honor the commitment to host some weddings in certain situations.  If there are couples who have coordinated their weddings with Bigfoot and still wish to host their event at the Ramada, you can contact Assistant Manager Tiffany at (701) 203-1714.  Our requests for comment from the owner of Bigfoot Bar and Grill have gone unanswered.  Copyright 2023 KVLY. All rights reserved."

It will be a small wedding, and we want to invite two of our mutual friends who are married to each other. We mostly knew them as a monogamous couple, but since we moved to another state, they have become part of a polycule. We love our friends, and want everyone at this intimate gathering to feel comfortable. We’ve never met the two newest people in their relationship, but they all seem to be getting more serious about each other. Should we invite just the two friends, or the whole polycule? How do we know when a +1 should actually be a +2 or +3?  A:  Hello! Fellow queer person currently planning a wedding here and experiencing intermittent guest list stress, so I am answering from that perspective! The simplified version of my answer is this: Basically, you can treat these friends the same way as you treat other friends who have maybe started new relationships where you don’t know their partners. Are you automatically inviting all of your monogamously partnered friends’ partners even if you’ve never met them before or don’t really have your own friendships with them? Then it might be the most “fair” to consider inviting these friends’ partners. If you have left off some friend’s partners who you don’t know, then it’s fine to leave these ones off, too, regardless of how serious the relationship is.  My slightly more complicated (or perhaps liberating for you — idk!) answer is that you can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. A lot of “guest list” etiquette is outdated when it comes to +1s — and I don’t mean in the sense that obviously old and heteronormative rules don’t take into account polycules or poly relationship structures but just in the sense that +1s in general don’t always need to be the default. Not everyone on the guest list for my wedding gets a +1 — even for some folks who are monogamously partnered! My fiancé and I basically went with our own personal “rules” for +1s, which weren’t codified rules at all but just rather who we thought it made the most sense to invite. We have some friends who are newer to our lives, and it just didn’t make a ton of sense for us to invite their partners who we’ve never met. We have some friends who we spend a ton of time with who never really bring their partners around, so in some of those cases, we also didn’t feel bad about not extending +1s. I have cousins in Norway who are invited who are married or otherwise in longterm partnerships whose partners are not invited, which I knew would be especially chill because Norwegians think Americans are kinda extra with all the +1 stuff at weddings.  The size of your guest list is the #1 determining factor for the cost of your wedding — full stop. I don’t think anyone understands this until they’ve planned a wedding themselves (myself included!), but the smallest adjustments to size can make a huge difference. It’s not “just a few extra people” in a lot of cases; it automatically makes the price of food, drink, programs, etc go up. And if you’re planning a small wedding, then it makes it all the more true that small fluctuations would have a big impact. The thing that really stands out to me is that you’ve never met these other people in the polycule. Except in a few very rare cases, my fiancé and I aren’t inviting anyone who hasn’t been met by at least one of us.  Every time I experienced stress while working on our guest list, I had a helpful friend who reminded me that there’s no way to make everyone happy; you should focus on making yourselves happy. No one should be invited to a wedding solely because you feel socially obligated to do so. You have to come up with whatever “rules” make the most sense for you — and they can be amorphous like ours ultimately were.  Of course, no one should feel excluded just because they choose a polyamorous approach to their relationships. Ask yourself this though: If these two people who you’re both friends with had recently broken up and were now seriously dating new people, would you invite those new partners? If any of your monogamous friends broke up and started seeing new people, would you invite those new people, too? If the answer is yes without a doubt, then sure, go ahead and invite their full polycule. If the answer is no or you’re unsure, then maybe remind yourselves that what really matters is the people you’re closest to are at your special day, and sometimes that doesn’t include everyone those people are also close to.  Also, something that’s helpful to keep in mind is that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with guest +1s being on, for lack of a better phrase, a “backup list.” If you have enough people decline when they RSVP to your wedding, then perhaps you can add in extra +1s — either for these friends or for other friends who are in new relationships or even for single friends who you think might benefit from a date. In general, my guest list has what I call a “no randos” policy, which basically means no blanket +1s for folks — except in a few individual cases where I know the person invited ONLY knows me and my fiancé and I wanted them to have a buddy. See, this is what I mean by amorphous rules! Be flexible and not overly constrained by etiquette, which can be super rigid!  I totally understand the impulse of wanting to make sure your approach to social expectations are inclusive and fair, but I also think it’s okay to play by your own rules when it comes to a wedding and go with your instincts. So long as the decision is being made from a place of what you actually want and not what you think others expect of you, I think whatever choice you make is ultimately yours and doesn’t have to be defended to anyone. The fact that you’re asking this question in the first place signals to me that you take your friends’ relationships seriously.  You can chime in with your advice in the comments and submit your own questions any time."

Olivia Wilde broke the cardinal rule of dressing for a wedding when she attended Colton Underwood and Jordan C. Brown’s nuptials over the weekend.  The “Booksmart” director, 39, wore a silky, slinky white Nili Lotan gown ($1,895) to the couple’s marriage, and boldly showed off the very bridal style on her Instagram Story — along with an explanation.  “Wore a wedding dress to a wedding so I could make a joke about it in my toast,” Wilde wrote on top of a picture of herself in the backless design.  “The grooms approved,” she added.  The unconventional style choice still caused a stir on social media, with one person tweeting, “Olivia Wilde showing up to her friend’s wedding in a white silk wedding gown is… desperate.”  Wilde shared an Instagram Story with the two grooms.

The key to finding just the right look? Skip stilettos in favor of flat sandals and go for the best beach wedding guest dresses that are wearable and refined at once.  “Look for styles that are flowy, made with lightweight fabrics like linen and viscose to help to keep you cool, and that you can dance on the beach in all night,” Suzanne Smallshaw, senior director of fashion and styling at , tells Bazaar. “If you’re looking for a more form-fitting dress, opt for one with breathable stretch, so you’re comfortable from the afternoon ceremony to sunset cocktails.”  Don’t be afraid to lean into bold, bright designs. In fact, Smallshaw suggests looking to mood-boosting spring 2023 trends for inspiration. “Opt for vibrant colors, seasonal prints, and interesting details or cutouts to show off a little skin,” she says. “Playful pleats, sunset-inspired hues, and mermaid-esque silhouettes are top themes this summer that would also play wonderfully in a beach wedding setting.”  Attending a black-tie seaside ceremony? Try a floor-length slipdress in a bright graphic print. If the invite specifies semiformal or cocktail attire, go for a dreamy puff-sleeve maxi or an ornate lace mini with a slightly relaxed fit. To enhance the vibe of your beach-chic look, Smallshaw suggests adding timeless, beachy touches like straw bags, gold jewelry, and pearls.  Whether you’re staying local or traveling to faraway shores, I did the research and tapped Smallshaw’s expertise to find the 25 best beach wedding guest dresses for every kind of seaside ceremony.

Each day this week, we’ll be asking our resident “Wediquette” expert and “Let Them Eat Cake” editor Melanie Spencer a frequently asked question or one from a reader.  Yesterday, we started the week off with a topic that can be tricky to navigate for many – money. Click here to see if there is a minimum amount to spend on a wedding present.  Today, we’re covering a big fashion pet peeve of ours surrounding wedding guests.  Question: How much is too much white in a wedding outfit? Can I wear white shoes/white purse/accessories?  Answer: It’s OK if an outfit has some white in it. What we want to avoid is attire that’s more white than any other color. So, for example, a blue dress with white flowers is fine. But it would be best to avoid a white dress with blue flowers. This guideline is mainly about steering clear of upstaging the couple getting married, since traditionally at least one person often wears a white dress, pantsuit or what have you. When it comes to accessories, I would err on the side of no white (for shoes and purse especially), because if one or more person in the betrothed couple is wearing white, they will likely also use white accessories and, again, it’s best to avoid anything that could smack of upstaging. All of this being said, if the couple instructs guests to wear white (or any specific color), definitely do as they request, because they are clearly going for a look and a vibe and you don’t want to be ‘that guy’."

Focus on what you want to use and see every day.  Much conversation surrounds the wedding itself — the prep and planning for the Big Day and the related festivities are the topics du jour as couples consider the various elements of their union. But the wedding is the start of something new, and there should be some careful consideration of your life at home — whether it’s what items to register for or how to “marry” interior design aesthetics.  Whether you move in together before or after “I do,” you’re bound to have too much of one thing, too little of another — and some items that have to go. “Taking both aesthetics and blending them together is important,” says Maureen Block, of Mason Grey Interiors in Newtown Square. “This is a new space that should reflect both personalities. Everyone should feel comfortable at home.” Here are Block’s tricks for settling in.  If you’re looking for more planning advice, check out our guides to nontraditional bouquets, stocking an N/A wedding bar, managing wedding stress, budgeting, size-inclusive wedding attire, and more.  1. Take inventory of everything. Knowing what you both have helps you see what you may need.  2. Know what the long-term shared goal for each area is. Making and agreeing on a plan to proceed room by room or space by space is key.  3. Set a budget, and don’t be afraid of using a designer. It’s an investment, but it can help save time and money in the long run. But remember, communication in any relationship is key — especially  with your designer.  4. Consider your non-negotiables. Maybe it’s an oversize recliner that one of you must have but the other hates. Rather than arguing, design around it with great pillows or art pieces to draw the eye away.  5. When it comes to your registry, only bring into your home what you really love. Focus on the pieces you want to use and see every day.  What’s the Best Registry For …  COZY-CHIC HOUSEWARES?  Head to Anthropologie in Rittenhouse. The store’s eclectic lineup of bedding and functional but fun cookware often gets overlooked for its clothing selection, but who doesn’t need a cake stand shaped like a lily pad?  CONSCIOUS ART?  Try South Kensington nonprofit InLiquid. The organization’s new registry­ lets couples curate a selection of pieces from Philly artists at a variety of price points and styles. (Email Sara Zimmerman at saraz@inliquid.org to register.)  GIFTS FROM A GROUP?  Best for a couple that already has a home full of practical items — Ilyan Jewelry in Haverford has plenty of sparkle. Perhaps your wedding party wants to go in on a chic charm to commemorate the day.  Published as “Expert Advice” in the winter/spring 2023 issue of Philadelphia Wedding."

However, one woman said she pulled off her perfect day at a great price by hiring an unlikely caterer: Chili’s.  In a viral video, user @brideisapersonality explained how having Chili’s as her caterer saved her a ton of money.  “We served Chili’s at our wedding and this is how much we spent,” the TikToker began the video.  In the background, she holds a receipt that features what the total was and everything she served to guests, including chips and salsa, salad, egg rolls, cajun chicken pasta, chicken tenders, sliders.  “Our total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests,” she said. “This also includes five specialty meals that we did for people who were gluten-free, dairy-free, and can’t eat meat, and people who needed special items like no dairy, only seafood, etc.”  While the TikToker was thoroughly impressed with the price point for all of the food, she said she did run into unexpected hurdles. “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay the delivery fees,” she continued.  The TikToker said her wedding day also fell on St. Patrick’s Day, and the restaurant prepared the food ahead of time to ensure the entire order could be fulfilled. This meant the food had to be rewarmed and set up by the bride, her family, and the servers she hired to wait on guests and help clean up.  “We had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be like cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking. My coordinator had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn’t really supposed to do,” the TikToker said. “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated.”  Nonetheless, the TikToker said she was still happy with her choice.  “The food was amazing,” she concluded. “It was the perfect meal for our wedding.”  Her video was viewed over 1.3 million times. Some viewers criticized the bride for not simply having the food delivered and expecting her servers to do additional, unexpected labor. “I’m all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” user @mars wrote. “You should have paid delivery.”  However, others applauded the bride’s decision to go with a cost-effective option that still makes guests happy.  “Normalize this,” a commenter wrote. “Weddings are so out of control! Such a great idea!”  “I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was Chili’s,” one user commented.  Chili’s also eventually chimed in with a simple comment on the bride’s video: “Iconic.”  The Daily Dot reached out to @brideisapersonality and Chili’s for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication."

Example video title will go here for this video  GLASTONBURY, Conn. — Spring is here and that means it’s officially wedding season.  The wedding industry is seeing a huge boost in business after the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked wedding plans for brides across the state.  Now venues are just catching up with their rescheduled weddings from the pandemic, and while life feels back to normal, the wedding industry has changed completely.  Before you say ""I do,"" you may find yourself as a bridesmaid instead of a bride.  ""We have more than we can handle, more than we could want, we turn people away but we give suggestions on where they can go,"" said Corrine Crocker-Luby, owner of the Tiffany Juliet House.  Finding a place to tie the knot is more stressful than ever before. Some brides are already booking into 2026.  Over at Glastonbury Hills Country Club, co-owner Frank Schroll said wedding dates are booking up years in advance.  ""We even get some brides that aren’t even engaged yet, they come out they know it's gonna happen soon and they want to do the leg work,"" said Schroll.  That leg work is harder than in years past.  All those pandemic-postponed ceremonies and receptions have backed up the bookings at venues around the country. All pieces and parts of the wedding industry are hoping brides and grooms have some flexibility.  ""We don’t want to hear brides have one date because more than likely it will already be taken,"" said Schroll.  That’s exactly what happened to Shannon Dolan.  ""I was thinking wedding planning starting about a year in advance was going to be fine but quickly we were learning some of the vendors were already booked,"" said Dolan.  Last summer, she found out “I do” is already planning to be said for every date for this October.  She decided on an unconventional approach to her big day. It's her own new booming business, the Mix and Mingle Mobile Bar. The drinks come to you, allowing brides to choose their wedding day in their favorite spot, on a budget. October it is for her big day, just with fewer guests than originally planned.  ""We’ve been to some weddings that are smaller guest counts and they’re some of the most fun weddings we’ve been to,"" said Dolan.  More weddings means post-pandemic love is in the air.  Back at the Tiffany Juliet House, owner Crocker-Luby has also been a wedding planner for more than two decades, now watching some relationships running right to the altar.  ""People are actually falling in love more after Covid and celebrating their union,"" said Crocker-Luby.  That means while it may be harder to lock down a time and place, couples are still celebrating their love, sometimes with just a big guest list cut.  ""After the pandemic people wanted to get together with their families so now we’re seeing a lot more intimate gatherings,"" said Tamie Myers, owner of Event Connoisseur Flowers and Gifts.  No matter the size, what’s a wedding with out flowers?  Myers' wedding business is, well, blooming.  ""Business is booming and people are looking to get back out there and have the interactions with their friends and family again,"" said Myers.  Brides and grooms are keeping the industry on its toes, trying to celebrate like normal is back in vogue.  ""I think we were cooped up too long for sure and it’s remembering what’s important in life and spending time with people you love,"" said Crocker-Luby.  Couples are finally surrounded again by family and friends, having their cake, and eating it too.  Lindsey Kane is a reporter at FOX61 News. She can be reached at Lkane@fox61.com.

Though wine on its own can make a great gift—especially if it means something unique to the couple—it’s nice to pair the bottle with something extra special. Fortunately, we’re here to help take some of the stress out of the gift-giving process with plenty of expert tips.  First, you’ll need to pick a great bottle of booze. “Giving a bottle from a vintage from the year the newlyweds met or got engaged is a fun idea and shows that you also pay attention to the milestones in their relationship,” says Janice Carnevale, event planner and wedding expert with Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C. “A custom case for them to open over several anniversaries would [also] be an incredibly thoughtful gift.”  Next, you’ll want to determine what else you plan to gift the guests of honor. “Most often, we see wine given as part of a wedding gift, often accompanied by a gift of cash or sometimes accompanied by wine glasses,” says Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and designer at Bella Notte in Washington, D.C.  But before you begin browsing, be sure to check the couple’s registry to see if they have listed any wine-centric items, suggests Carnevale. “They might have glassware, a [wine] opener or a chiller on their list, which would pair great with a bottle you pick for them,” she says.  Finally, as you search for the perfect wine-centric gift for the bride and groom-to-be, consider how much you want to shell out.  “Generally speaking, couples will expect gifts in various price ranges depending on their financial situation,” says Jacqueline Vizcaino founder of Tinted Events Design and Planning in Atlanta.  Cathy O’Connell, co-founder of COJ Events in La Quinta, California, recommends spending somewhere between $100 to $200 or more, but staying in the range of what you can afford. Remember, it’s the thought that counts. Also, keep in mind that this number can vary depending on how close you are to the couple.  Here, we break down some fantastic wedding gift ideas for wine lovers across an array of price points.  10 Best Wine Wedding Gifts  Personalized Vivid Decanter Any oenophile knows the importance of using a wine decanter. It is crucial when it comes to letting the vino “breathe” to enhance its aroma, flavor and texture—while also separating it from any solids or sediments. For one that combines functionality and style with a sweet, sentimental touch, consider this Vivid Decanter, which can be personalized with the couple’s initials. The decanter is hand-made in Europe and constructed with lightweight, lead-free crystal for added durability. Plus, at under $60, it won’t break the bank. $59.95 Wine Enthusiast  Personalized Reclaimed Wine Barrel Head Cork Collectors Display Wine enthusiasts can put their love of the beverage on full display with this Personalized Reclaimed Wine Barrel Head Cork Collectors Display. It can be customized to feature the couple’s last name and initials, as well as the year of the wedding. The display—which has two hooks on the back for fuss-free installation—is also equipped with a bunghole on top of the barrel, allowing couples to easily add and remove corks. Go the extra mile and gift the newly married pair a bottle of their most beloved vino so that they can instantly start their cork collection. $329.00 Wine Enthusiast  Personalized Wine Enthusiast Somm Universal Handblown Wine Glass Help your favorite wine-loving couple commemorate their milestone event with a set of personalized wine glasses etched with their last name and initials. This one-of-a-kind set features two hand-blown wine glasses with a sleek flared design and a large bowl ideal for swirling and sipping like a pro. Despite the glass’s intricate construction—a 21-step process requiring 15 glass blowers—they are dishwasher-safe, making them well-suited for everyday use. $120.00 Wine Enthusiast  Personalized Wine Gift Box and Cork Catcher Think of this personalized wine gift box and cork catcher as multiple presents in one. That’s because the wooden gift box—crafted from solid pine and complete with a walnut stain finish—doubles as a cork catcher. As a bonus, it even serves as a stylish accent piece that makes a great addition to any bar cart, dining table, shelf or counter space. Oh, and did we mention it can fit any standard-size bottle of wine or Champagne? The sliding plexiglass door, which has a hole in it, makes it easy to add and remove corks. Place a bottle of celebratory bubbly inside the gift box for an extra-special touch. $99.00 Wine Enthusiast  Marble and Solid Acacia Wood All-In-One Lazy Susan Cheese Board (14 Piece Set) Wine and cheese go together just as perfectly as your favorite soon-to-be-married couple, which is why you should consider gifting them this chic cheese board on their special day. The 14-piece set includes one Lazy Susan made with acacia wood, one removable marble insert (which can be conveniently chilled in the fridge), three cheese knives, three metal picks, three spoons and three ceramic bowls for snacks, like nuts and olives. Customize it by adding a monogram, last name and wedding year. $179.95-$199.00 Wine Enthusiast  Wine Enthusiast Somm du Vin 2-Bottle Wine Preserver and Chiller Couples don’t necessarily have to agree on everything to have a successful partnership—and that includes their wine preferences. That’s where our Somm du Vin 2-Bottle Wine Preserver and Chiller comes into the picture. Each of the two storage zones can be individually set to 46°F, 54°F or 61°F, depending on the type of wine (i.e., reds, whites, or roses). What’s more, the wine preserver and chiller simultaneously preserve, chill and vacuum seals already-open wine bottles so that they can be enjoyed for up to 10 days. And, thanks to its compact design, it can be easily stored on the couple’s kitchen counter for easy access to their favorite bottles. $399.00 Wine Enthusiast  L'Atelier du Vin Black Matte and Wood Lever Corkscrew Any drinker can benefit from having an extra corkscrew around the kitchen. This one from L’Atelier du Vin is among the fanciest corkscrews on the market—though it’s well worth the splurge. Crafted from solid walnut wood and metal and featuring a sleek matte black coating, this single-lever corkscrew is elegant and easy to use. Simply slip it onto the bottle, push down, pull up and pour. Oh, and did we mention it includes a built-in foil cutter and ergonomic handle to ensure a sturdy, yet comfortable, grip? You can even have it personalized with the couple’s wedding date, initial or last name, so as long as it’s under eight characters. $170.00-$190.00 Wine Enthusiast  Wine Enthusiast 6-Bottle Wine Cooler Bordeaux lovers will especially adore this wine cooler, which holds and protects up to six standard-size bottles of Bordeaux. (Of course, it can also be used for other bottles, albeit not six of them.) The cooler’s digital touchscreen and LED display make it easy to control the temperature with a touch of a button, while the sturdy metal racks hold the bottles in place. Finally, its compact size is suitable for small spaces, be it a kitchen counter, bar cart or somewhere else. $149.00 Wine Enthusiast"

But, when a photograph of the happy couple and the details of the marriage were published, the union of the mayor of Araucária and his fifth wife became headline news in the city in the southern state of Paraná and, in a heartbeat, all over Brazil. The wedding led to controversy as it took place four days after the bride turned 16, the minimum age in Brazil to legally marry with the permission of family or a judge, and because the groom is 65 years old. Eyebrows were also raised when it became known that the day before the ceremony the alderman had given his future mother-in-law a position in City Hall, appointing her councilor for culture. Despite the half-century age difference between the couple, it was this act of nepotism that raised the most outrage.  But despite the singular elements of this particular union, it is far from an uncommon event in Brazil. Last year, Brazilian notaries registered 12,509 marriages in which at least one of the participants was aged 16 or 17. That equates to 34 teenage spouses per day, the vast majority of whom were female.  A photograph of the beaming couple as Kauane Rode Camargo places a wedding ring on Hissam Hussein Dehaini swiftly went viral. The mayor’s political party moved quickly to disown him. And, in the face of a public backlash against the appointment of his mother-in-law, he soon dismissed her, although he initially pointed to her 26 years’ experience in public service as proof of her credentials.  Almost a month after the marriage, the newlyweds remain the most talked-about subject among Araucária’s population of around 140,000. “As anywhere, there are people who are for and against it,” says E. T., who asks to be identified by his initials in order to speak freely. “But I have noticed that, because he is an excellent administrator, his supporters choose not to look at the negative side, that it [the marriage] is legal, but immoral. Many have congratulated them, and wished them good luck.”  E. T. knows Dehaini personally, but his wife only by sight. He points out that the mayor is a successful businessman with interests in hotels, gas stations and airline charters that have created many jobs locally (although E. T. also mentions Dehaini was arrested on suspicion of links to drug trafficking two decades ago, according to the website G1, part of the Globo group). In his personal life, he has been married on four other occasions and has 16 children. His current wife was a recent finalist in the Miss Araucária Teen 2022 pageant. Although it is a conservative city, Araucária also hosts a beauty contest for young girls in the style of the movie Little Miss Sunshine.  Hissam Hussein Dehaini and his 16-year-old wife Kauane Rode Camargo. RR SS  Perhaps the age difference between Dehaini and Camargo did not come as much of a shock because Brazil is well-accustomed to marriages between older men and much younger women. The political elite serve as an example: President Lula da Silva is 21 years older than his wife, Janja and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is 27 years older than his wife Michelle. The record, though, goes to Michel Temer, president from August 2016 to December 2018, who is 43 years older than his wife, Marcela, whom he met in 2002 when he was already a veteran politician, and she was a 19-year-old newly crowned miss.  The marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, while causing controversy, has served to renew the focus on child weddings in Brazil, which remains a widespread practice. But legal marriages performed before the relevant authorities are only the tip of the iceberg, says Ana Nery Lima, a gender specialist with the NGO Plan International, who says that “informal unions in Brazil are very normalized.” The United Nations estimates that 26% of Brazilian women live with a partner before they are 18, including 6% who are not even 15. “In Brazil, when people hear the expression child marriage, they usually think of child brides of nine or 10 years old in India, but they don’t think of people they know, such as that neighbor, that aunt or their grandmother, who got married at 14,” says Lima. “In the eyes of the United Nations, child marriage is a formal or informal union in which at least one of the parties is younger than 18.” In global terms, Brazil ranks fifth in the world in terms of child marriages, with 2.2 million people falling under this category. In percentage terms, however, it is not in the top 20 worldwide, a list headed by Niger where 76% of minors cohabit with a partner before the age of 18.  In Brazil, the main reasons for this phenomenon are socioeconomic and cultural. “When two minors marry, it is usually because she is pregnant and the family wants to protect the girl’s reputation. But there are also very poor families who have many children and who think: ‘Look, at least [in another family] she will have something to eat, clothes to wear,’” says Lima. “Then there is that deep-rooted, macho culture that young women are more attractive.” The specialist notes that in weddings involving minors aged 16 and 17, the age difference between the spouses is usually around 15 years, “and this means a very large inequality of power.”  Although there were still over 12,500 legal child marriages last year in Brazil, the number of such unions has fallen by 30% since 2019 when Congress reformed the Civil Code to ban marriage before the age of 16 altogether, thus closing a loophole that ultimately allowed an adult who had raped a minor to marry her instead of going to jail, while also denying her access to abortion care, which she is entitled to by law. Any sexual relationship with someone aged under 16, consensual or not, is a crime in Brazil and no child aged under 16 can marry, regardless of whether his or her family has blessed it or not. Lima says this is a step in the right direction, but Plan International is still fighting to make marriage before the age of 18 illegal.  Following the controversy over the marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, the Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the Araucária mayor’s wedding and accusations of nepotism. However, as his wife is a minor, the details of the case cannot be made public.  Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition"

Selecting the wedding dress was a particularly fun part of the process for Kamila, who, throughout her career as a model, has worn many. “I went to Galia Lahav for the first time and picked three different dresses,” she admits. “A week later, I went back and chose a completely different one. I just fell in love with it, and they were able to make it for me in less than a month. Record time! I’m so glad it worked out because I loved the dress and felt it was perfect for my beach wedding.”  The bride kept her jewelry pieces simple and befitting of the al fresco wedding location. She wore a classic diamond necklace, bracelet, and earrings all from Material Good. As for beauty, she worked with Lauren Hen for a sun-kissed look, and also kept her hair down to ensure it felt as natural as possible. “Less is always more,” Kamila says.  The ceremony started just after 6:30 p.m., and the service took place under a jaw-droppingly beautiful chuppah consisting of garden and spray roses, hanging amaranthus, larkspur, snapdragons, frilled lisianthus, and astrantia, all by Petal Productions. First, Oren’s older brother and his 87-year-old grandmother walked down the aisle, followed by his middle brother and his fiancée. Next, his twin brother with his wife and the couple’s niece made their way down the aisle, Oren and his both parents—and lastly, the bride was escorted by her parents, who flew in from Brazil."

Aric Hutchinson and at least 100 mourners gathered on Saturday at Folly Beach — the same beach where he and Samantha Miller, 34, married just hours before the deadly crash — for a memorial in honor of his late wife, CBS affiliate WCSC of Charleston reported.  Hutchinson, who sat in a wheelchair on the shoreline at the memorial, told the local station he’s “feeling pretty good” as he recovers from his injuries. He suffered a brain injury and broken bones as a result of crash, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother to help cover the cost of medical fees and the burial for Miller.  “My body’s getting back to where I can manage, I guess,” Hutchinson told WCSC at the memorial. “It’s just as good as I can feel with the situation, but obviously, today and the outpouring of people was just amazing. I know Sam would love it.”  “I mean, she’s a beach girl, through and through,” he added. “We do walk here almost every morning, and this is her send-off for sure. She’s up there smiling for sure.”  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller. Family of Samantha Miller / AP  He and Miller had been leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart when the crash unfolded on April 28, The Associated Press reported.  A woman identified by police as Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, was accused of slamming into the back of the golf cart while allegedly driving while drunk and over twice the speed limit, according to an incident report.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm after the crash, according to online records, which show that she remains in police custody.  Two other people in the golf cart besides the groom were also injured, Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach public safety department director told the AP. He added that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Komoroski was not physically injured in the crash, according to a news release from city officials.  A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  That report also states that Komoroski told a sergeant on the scene that she had two drinks that night: a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.”  Samantha Miller's mother, Lisa Miller, told Fox News Digital that Komoroski ""chose to drink, get behind the wheel, and plow down my daughter.""  ""This is a conscious choice that a young lady made,"" Lisa Miller alleged.  Komoroski's attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in a statement released last week: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”"

Dia & Co, which offers personal styling services and plus-size apparel, now has an online landing page called the Wedding Suite. The page, which went live last week, features 38 collections curated by Dia & Co stylists. These include “bride,” “wedding guest,” “mother of the bride and groom” and “beach wedding.” In total, the Wedding Suite contains 2,200 styles from 64 brands, including Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg, Ever-Pretty and Eloquii.  In addition to the newly-curated collections, Dia & Co launched a Wedding Styling Service for brides, bridesmaids, mothers of the bride and wedding guests. The service is free, and customers can go online to receive advice and feedback about styles and sizing. While it’s still early, the reaction to the styling service has been positive, the brand says. Dia & Co sells dresses directly via its website but also recommends certain vetted salons for those who want to design their gowns in person.  In general, the apparel market still has a long ways to go in terms of inclusion. It’s not uncommon for major retailers to start offering plus sizes, only to reduce or even eliminate offerings a couple of years later, citing cost issues or problems with demand. And while it’s true that several brands do sell plus-size wedding dresses — David’s Bridal and Anthropologie, for example — many of today’s dresses do not come in a variety of styles and silhouettes, which makes the process of finding the perfect dress even harder. In addition, as The Cut writes, bridal stores want to stock as many styles as possible, so they typically carry “as few samples as possible” for people to try on.  Nadia Boujarwah, who co-founded Dia & Co in 2015, told Modern Retail she wanted to launch the Wedding Suite after getting married 10 months ago. Finding a dress was extremely complicated, she said, as many of the boutiques she visited had few options in stock. One boutique in New York City told her she could only try on four dresses, while another asked her to just hold a dress up to her body and “see” if it would fit.  “The traditional bridal salon experience can really be very painful. For the most part, these are dresses that are made to fit very, very few women,” Boujarwah explained. “It was truly unbelievable to me how challenging it was… I got through my experience with a thick skin and a lot of help, but really came away from it feeling like there’s just so much better that we could be doing here. This is one of the last frontiers of inclusive fashion.”  The U.S. bridal wear market is a major industry, estimated to be worth $27 billion. Roughly 2.6 million couples got married in 2022, more than any year since 1984, the Wedding Report found.  Before launching the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co had a “pretty extensive” offering of wedding wear, Boujarwah said. However, it did not have true bride or bridesmaid collections, and everything was self-service. With the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co wanted “to really build out that offering of the true wedding bridal wardrobe for both our brides and an inclusive bridal party,” Boujarwah said.  For instance, while Dia & Co normally offers sizes 10 to 32, the bridesmaids’ dresses now go from sizes 0 to 40. All of Dia & Co’s Wedding Suite items come in a variety of styles, as well, with silhouettes as varied as A-line, flare, midi and floor length.  That plethora of options is crucial, Shafonne Myers, editor-in-chief of the plus-size bridal magazine Pretty Pear Bride, told Modern Retail. “So often you see style guides and selections based off of straight sizes, so to see inspiration that looks like us, it’s so refreshing and inspirational,” she said.  Gabriella Santaniello, founder of A Line Partners, explained that wedding dresses are typically sized smaller than everyday clothes, so a woman who is normally a size four in a regular dress would probably be a six or an eight in a wedding dress. However, very few salons have plus-sized samples on the rack, she explained, which throws the sizing difference off even more.  “A lot of these… brands say that they’re inclusive, but when you go to try on, there’s really nothing in your size,” Santaniello said. “So you end up squeezing yourself into a dress, if you can even do it… It’s just not a fun experience.”  Santaniello said she’s sure there’s “a cost involved” to produce plus-sized samples. “But also what would be the incremental business you’d get from it?” she asked. “Probably a lot, if a woman could come in and feel that she had a reasonable idea as to what she’d look like in the dress.”  Myers, a wedding and events planner, said there are more options now for plus-size brides than when she got married 19 years ago, But, she added, “not enough brands cater to the market.”  “In my opinion, it’s because we as a plus-size audience don’t demand it enough,” she said. “…I would love to see more of the plus-size demographic speaking up about what they want. The louder we can get as a community and demographic, the more of an impact we can have.”"

Just as the early bird catches the worm, the DIY wedding couple saves more money for honeymoon piña coladas. So to help you soon-to-be-newlyweds, today we’re talking about the decoration ideas that leave you inspired to take on a project or two that could save you cash. Have you secretly dreamed of being a florist? Here’s your chance to show off your petal-arranging chops. Still have the handwriting of a fourth grader? Eh, maybe book a calligrapher. So that you know what’s even possible, we’ve rounded up 39 DIY wedding decorations ideas from industry insiders across the country.  But before we dive in, here are some general tips about decorating a wedding like a pro…  Is it cheaper to do your own wedding decor?  When it comes to wedding decor, one of the biggest expenses is flowers. If you’re able (and willing) to tackle those, savings can be substantial—potentially thousands of dollars. Joan Wyndrum O’Hear, founder and owner of Blooms By The Box in Watchung, New Jersey, suggests ordering wholesale flowers and inviting family and friends (like your wedding party) to help make bouquets and boutonnieres. “Create small affordable bouquets with big blooms such as hydrangeas, peonies, or football mums paired with lush greenery,” she says. “You’ll need fewer stems when you use bigger flowers. Also, go with leafy greenery for the boutonnieres.”  How can I decorate my wedding on my own?  Beyond a glue gun (though you’ll definitely need one of those too), high-tech DIY tools make it easier than ever to decorate your wedding. Investing in a single device, such as a cutting machine like the Silhouette Cameo, for example, can make it possible to craft a slew of different DIY projects. Custom cake toppers, T-shirts for your bridesmaids, wedding signs, and programs can all be made with the same machine.  Additionally, taking a class to learn a new DIY skill might make your wedding projects, dare we say, fun. Sign up for a flower-arranging class, a candle-making workshop, a paper crafting lesson, or a calligraphy tutorial.  How can I make a cheap wedding look expensive?  Your venue will play a major role in your wedding style. And if you choose a place with built-in decor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune to dress up a blank-slate banquet hall. Jacqueline Vizcaino, owner of Atlanta-based Tinted Events Design and Planning, recommends opting for an outdoor wedding. “Explore natural venues instead of traditional halls,” she says. “Look for places like open-air gardens or outdoor parks where you won’t have to rely on electricity as much. This will reduce your carbon footprint and create a gorgeous backdrop for all your photos.”  What are the best decorations to use for a wedding?  “It’s always great when you choose decor that can do double duty or, even better, triple duty,” says Jamie Chang, owner and destination wedding planner at Mango Muse Events in San Francisco. “For example, a small plant or bud vase can be decor, a favor, and a place card,” she says.  For more wedding decoration ideas that pull double duty and much more, read on…"

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable—perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star’s natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn’t too saturated. “We wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling.

And while just about any summer wedding date can embrace all of these advantages, there’s one day in particular that carries a bit more meaning: The summer solstice.  The summer solstice marks the first official day of summer, and it’s also the longest day of the year. “This day has carried meaning to many of my wedding clients because it signifies the start of a new season or a time for new beginnings,” says wedding planning expert Sofia Crokos.

She sipped smoothies and distributed bloat pills, as commenters suggested she was promoting unhealthy eating.  Advertisement  On Thursday, health and nutrition influencer Sam Cutler shared a ""what I ate on my wedding day"" video on TikTok, which chronicled her fastidiously healthful wedding in Boca Raton earlier this month as a gluten and dairy-free bride.  The clip, which has been viewed 4.5 million times, has sparked fierce backlash on the app, with many commenters disgracing Cutler for what they believed was promoting unhealthy eating habits.  The video begins with Cutler, who creates content under the moniker The Fit Fatale, sipping two different smoothies and being fed a grain salad by her maid of honor in the makeup chair. At the party, she notes a bottle of Arrae bloat pills have been distributed to guests, and says her chocolate wedding cake is ""gluten, dairy, and sugar-free.""  Cutler, 31, told Insider she had no idea the video would cause such a stir, given how similar it is to the rest of her content. Commenters were not only offended — some seemed angry.  ""So you forced your ED on all your guests and bridesmaids,"" a commenter wrote. She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too — stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms … Everyone should be making the choices that work for them."""

Chad Andrew “Drew” Kelly Jr. was known for his love of serving the town of Moncks Corner. But his life was cut short after he was killed in an “accident,” according to an online obituary.  Kelly died May 12, less than two months after he was married. He and his wife were “enjoying their new life together” before his death, a post on the Russell Funeral Chapel website said.  “Please keep the Kelly family and the Town of Moncks Corner Fire Department in your thoughts and prayers over the next several weeks. One cannot imagine the pain and loss both families are feeling,” the Moncks Corner Rural Fire Department wrote in a Facebook post.  Over the years, Kelly had served with that department and also worked as an engineer/EMT with the town of Mocks Corner, officials said.  “Drew’s passion in life was fighting fires and serving his community,” his obituary said. “He was 2021 Firefighter of the Year for the town of Moncks Corner.”  Kelly was also remembered for being a member of his church and for having a “beloved dog.” After Kelly’s death, several people flocked to social media to share their condolences.  “This loss is particularly painful for many,” the fire department said, noting that the news resonated across the Moncks Corner area.  Moncks Corner is in Berkeley County, roughly 30 miles northwest of Charleston.  Moncks Corner and the Rural Fire Department didn’t immediately share additional details with McClatchy News on May 15.

The Bachelor alum and Coming Out Colton star, 31, wed Jordan C. Brown, 38, in front of 200 guests in a romantic ceremony at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley on Saturday.  The three-day affair, planned by Ashley Smith Events, kicked off with a family dinner and welcome party on Friday night, before a full day of wedding festivities began Saturday morning.  ""The day of our ceremony, we have a disco-themed pool party,"" Underwood told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview ahead of the couple's big day. ""It's going to be a fun wedding,"" he adds, ""I'll say that!""  For their nuptials, the couple wore custom Tom Ford suits. Underwood went with a deep green, while his political strategist husband chose blue, both as a nod to the natural setting of their ""I do's.""  Olivia Rae James  ""We wanted trees around and sunshine,"" says Brown. ""It was really important for us to get married outside.""  As guests made their way to the ceremony where a choir and orchestra performed, they were greeted by a beautiful photo display designed by the couple.  ""One thing that's really important to both of us is that we've created this, we're calling it 'our loving walk,'"" explains Underwood, who appeared on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor before revealing in a 2021 interview on Good Morning America that he is gay.  ""It's inspired from a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called Loving and it's images of men in love throughout history. We blew them up and put them on canvases and set them around the resort,"" he says. ""Next to them will be love letters from queer people in the 18th and 19th century that were forbidden or they had to send in secret.""  Olivia Rae James  Adds Brown: ""It's really cool. It helps us to pay tribute to the people who paved the way for all same-sex couples who now can get married.""  The pair walked hand in hand down the aisle and exchanged personal vows and rings before celebrating with friends and family at the reception.  ""We wanted to break some of the traditional norms of what a ceremony and a wedding look like,"" says Underwood. ""And for the entire weekend, we recognize that a lot of people attending, both of our families and some of our friends, this will be their first queer wedding. We really want to make it special.""  Olivia Rae James  As a fun surprise, the couple arranged for Stanford University's artistic swimming team to perform in the pool as everyone exited the ceremony. 'We wanted to keep the energy going,"" says Brown. ""I like to host and bring people together. It's our wedding, but it's also a three-day party that we are throwing for our nearest and dearest.""  At the reception, guests dined family style on salads, vegetables, steak, fish and pasta. ""And lots of spicy margaritas,"" says Brown of their specialty 21 Seeds Tequila cocktails which included two cucumber and jalapeño infused drinks dedicated to the couple's dogs Scout and Zooka.  Following emotional toasts, the newlyweds (who gifted their guests Privé Revaux sunglasses) cut into mini wedding cakes while other desserts included, ""the best chocolate chip cookie you ever had,"" says Brown and mini lemon meringue pies.  The couple shared their first dance together to ""The Good Ones"" by Gabby Barrett. ""We love it,"" says Underwood. ""It's just one of those songs that both remind us of each other and special to us.""  Olivia Rae James  For Underwood, falling in love with Brown came easy. ""I've never been more sure about something. He has the biggest heart and he's such a good friend to all of the people in his life. He goes out of his way to take care of his friends and his family. That speaks volumes. It was one of the first things that I noticed about him.""  The pair first met at a party in Los Angeles in April 2021, and got engaged in Feb. 2022 in Big Sur, Calif. ""It was very natural and organic, how it progressed,"" recalls Underwood of their relationship. Adds Brown: ""We both just had a gut feeling.""  Now, as the couple celebrates the happy milestone, Underwood says he feels lucky to spend every day with his husband.  ""I love the family that we've created already,"" says Underwood. ""Having our two dogs and our home and this wedding, we've really created a life that feels so compatible and in sync."

He made fun of folks who get destination weddings only to brag in his most recent tweet. He said that many individuals today are being persuaded and getting married merely to have wedding photographs and videos to post online. Vivek described an event that occurred at a destination wedding he recently attended when the bride passed out when she found out that the wedding photographer would be late.  On Saturday, he tweeted, “People are getting married just to get wedding photos, videos and to get ‘destination wedding’ tag for show off”—a wedding planner told me. It’s true. I was in a destination wedding and someone said that the wedding photographer is going to be late and the bride fainted.” His post received mixed reactions from netizens. While some agreed with him, a few others trolled Vivek.  “People are getting married just to get wedding photos, videos and to get ‘destination wedding’ tag for show off”.  - a wedding planner told me.

Yes, people are more into ‘show off’ but saying they are getting married just to show off is laughable.” Another slammed the filmmaker saying, “Hope your friends see this tweet and realize that you are tweeting and gossiping after attending their celebratory functions.” One of the angry users said, “Shame on you for cheap thinking.”  In the meantime, Vivek Agnihotri recently made news after he sent Mamata Banerjee with a legal notice for her ""highly defamatory"" remarks against his film ""The Kashmir Files."" Additionally, he wanted an unequivocal apology from the CM and threatened to take additional legal action against her for damaging their name in public if she did not comply."
